2021-04-20 15:17,"The nomenclature is confusing an imprecise. Neurological symptoms ARE physical symptoms, though hallucinations and confusion are typically neuropsychiatric or purely psychiatric. It’s not surprising that these children needed more intensive care — their brains and nervous systems, which control everything else, were literally inflamed. Viral and post-viral (physical) neurological symptoms are much more common than our current research suggests. Accordingly, they are undertreated and ignored. I hope these children get the medical aftercare they need, as this will likely cause chronic symptoms and unexpected health effects through the lifespan."
2021-04-20 16:11,"I wonder if these children were left longer undiagnosed (since children are less likely to associate their issues with covid19 & less able to verbalize their condition)? And how are their lungs?  What share of those who developed symptoms of covid (or were found later to have gone through covid19 w/o symptoms) had harmed lungs? (I know we don't have lung scans for most people, maybe mostly those with asthma and other conditions. But it would be good to know.)"
2021-04-20 20:18,I wish they included the age spread of the children.  My kid is in prek.  It would be nice to know the level if risk.
2021-04-20 22:03,"To those adults able to get vaccinated, but who refuse:  how do you justify exposing children under 16, who are not yet able to get vaccinated, to this kind of risk?"
2021-04-20 13:24,"24 kids.  Please stop the panicky headlines. Put 24 kids in the headlines. Please. Our children need to be in school, and the NYT has not helped."
2021-04-20 22:10,"A study released yesterday by doctors at Columbia University showed that the virus itself isn't infecting the brain itself.  I wonder what is causing all the brain inflammation for these poor kids?  If not the virus, then by what mechanism?"
2021-04-20 18:37,What we don’t know is how asymptomatic infections will effect kids in the future. People are far too cavalier about kids and COVID19 just because they want them in school.
2021-04-20 18:01,"More evidence, as if we needed it, this virus must be taken very seriously. I get tired of hearing self-serving politicians and others say children are mostly immune from coronavirus. 

Covid doesn't care how old you are, whether you're male or female, what your race is, or where you come from. It's an equal opportunity destroyer."
2021-04-08 10:56,I assume Emmergent will be able to take a tax deduction for the loss of the contaminated vaccine.
2021-04-08 11:11,Something smells rotten here. Primarily understaffing is one issue which certainly must be resolved. How can employees work 70 hours a week in a factory which makes a vaccine? This isn’t a chicken factory here.
2021-04-08 11:53,"So, how effective are any vaccines coming out of Emergent plants? When there are serious problems leading to the contamination of millions of doses of vaccine it certainly leads one to suspect the quality of Emergent's work. I'd like to see an auditor's report on where government money is being spent at Emergent."
2021-04-08 11:50,Is this really surprising?  Everything in the states is nothing more than a blatant cash grab and it’s a race to the bottom.
2021-04-08 11:06,"It is crazy to me that an article on Biden’s tax plan has 427 mostly politically divided comments and this one has none.  This unfortunately is what happens when we over politicize government on both sides.  Everybody is so busy posturing, attacking and defending that no one is minding the store."
2021-04-08 11:13,"What a mess. It seems you can’t good help at the plant, but even worse, that the report fell on deaf 👂 ears in the government.  Now that the vaccines were contaminated and 15 million doses thrown out, is it any wonder that people are hesitant to get vaccinated?  Hardly.

Shame on the US.  this may be common in 3rd world countries, but again, this is the US.  The EU also seems to be tripping all over themselves, but seriously, all of a sudden, the Russians don’t look as scatterbrained as us. 

We need centralized military level control over vaccine protection.  We don’t need any more slip ups like this, or you’ll never get the unvaccinated to roll up their sleeves to do their part to stop 🛑 the spread.  🙄 SHEESH!"
2021-04-08 11:42,If the FDA budget wasn't gutted over the years...
2021-04-08 11:26,Emergent only exists because they pay a fortune in lobbying for an unnecessary anthrax vaccine and have bullied their way into primacy in this lucrative area via underhanded tactics and some would say outright lies. No surprise they can't deliver on such a huge task as this.
2021-04-08 11:36,"Is this the result of the Trump administrations philosophy that regulations are just a drag on profits? For many years the U.S. had been recognized as the best in the world in regard to quality of pharmaceuticals. Does the FDA need to be strengthened to provide protection for the quality of pharmaceuticals? Obviously Trump is ignorant of science and refuses to accept advice from scientific experts. Although there must be controls to prevent over regulation, if millions in profits and short term political gain is involved regulations may be avoided. If U.S. quality of pharmaceuticals is compromised it could be devastating."
2021-04-08 11:33,"Would I be too cynical for pointing out Emergent had spectacular 4Q and full year 2020 financial results? Couple this with failure to properly train staff and do the expensive prep work required to demonstrate ability to scale up in an emergency. What we see here is yet another downside to the US government outsourcing national defense functions, without adequate follow up. Indeed, one might ask if it is even possible for any government to adequately monitor for profit companies in these cozy situations."
2021-04-08 11:30,"This report really has thrown a monkeywrench in to the viability of the entire vaccination effort.

What else don't we know as of yet?

If warp speed equates to warped safety, no wonder the significant numbers of vaccine naysayers.

There needs be accountability for such dereliction of duty.

The trump administration recently wanted us to remember that they were responsible for vaccine development.

They did not, however, figure in to the equation distribution of such product and have not openly endorsed vaccination. 

In some cases mistrust and discouragement from the trump base have many questioning the effort.

So, one might ask, what else did they know and withhold at the expense and health of the taxpayer?"
2021-04-08 11:31,"VP bonuses are tied to COGS and so they demand unreasonable production targets for the plants under their purview.  This leads to documentation errors, rework and reprocessing, overworked employees, and failed batches.  Of course the VPs are nowhere to be found when FDA shows up for an inspection.  And I have to attend my umpteenth HR session on ""work-life balance""."
2021-04-08 12:07,"Reporters, check connections between Maryland's only GOP Congressmam Andy Harris ""M.D"", a Trump radical right extremist and Emergent. Smells big time. Emergent is a major funder of Harris. What a shocking waste of public money by the Trump HHS grifters. Keep probing."
2021-04-08 11:40,The only individual who I want to hear from about this topic is Dr. Fauci.
2021-04-08 12:04,"Emergent had a nice little ""should"" I call it a scam? going on here; locked in for ex amount of vaccines that are rarely used, the CEO giving himself a millions; now the same lobbyist / connections to trumps world gives him millions more for vital vaccines... it will be shocking they are still allowed to continue in government business's especially  after the March 6th article the times published, and now this."
2021-04-08 11:38,"Just typical, Trump makes a mess, Biden has to clean up."
2021-04-08 12:02,"Read the story that the Times published about this company on March 6.

This is the same firm that has been charging the government hundreds of millions a year for more anthrax vaccine than is needed. In 2016 the government purchased extra doses just to keep them in business. 

The spending on this company is a main  reason that the strategic stockpile was out of money for masks and PPE.

So NYT, please follow the money. Qui bono?"
2021-04-08 12:02,"The Biden-Harris team is responsible for this failure.  It happened under their watch, when they were pressing to increase the daily vaccination rate."
2021-04-08 12:03,"This was all known. If I knew it as soon as it was announced, why didn’t they? FDA inspections are grossly inadequate overseas - and in some ways domestically - even so, there are reports of findings and concerns when there are problems. I looked the company up with this was announced and found them.

The entire system of FDA inspections needs to be strengthened dramatically, staff added, and sanctions made significant and enforced. Nothing has changed since the scandals with Raxbery in India. Read Bottle of Lies by investigative journalist Katherine Eban about problems with FDA inspections of generic drug manufacturers. Read the articles Bloomberg did on problems with generics in 2019. Nothing has changed. The system hasn’t been fixed.

But they’re all shocked, just shocked, while the country moves towards the cheapest generic drugs possible, made in plants in problems at least as bad as those here - and often much worse."
2021-04-08 12:48,Emergent says its top priority continues to be strengthening of the supply chain for J & J's vaccine.  What it's TOP PRIORITY should be is to get their own act together and make sure they are a safe clean manufacturing plant with appropriate Quality Control and Policy and Procedures along with training measures in place.  Accountability.  Which is sounds like they have failed repetedly and on many occassions.  15 million tjrown out doses and possibly 62 million more doses that could be questionable.  That is 77 million doses.  Emergent needs to EAT that cost.  As a tax payer I should not have to bail those losers out.
2021-04-08 12:41,The gravy train of government contracting. The government contracting process is broken.
2021-04-08 12:25,"I received the J&J vaccine through CVS a few weeks ago.  It's my understanding that it would have been manufactured somewhere else, though.  Is that correct?  Is there any cause for concern?"
2021-04-08 12:43,"Interesting the regulatory agencies responsible for safe drugs would be in mix to prevent administration of potentially unsafe medication given the zealous drive of the former guy and his court jesters to rid the country of many regulatory agencies and functions as there is a belief those agencies stifle business.

Imagine if the former guy, a guy who had demonstrated little caring or knowledge of the functions of regulatory agencies, was still in the White House and was faced with this issue.
Would he grab the nearest black marker and issue and edict that required the administration of these potentially unsafe vaccines?

Lastly, this is the result of the government putting our eggs in one basket and becoming too cozy with potential or current contractors."
2021-04-08 13:24,"From remote observation, truly one of the more frustrating/infuriating aspects of a federal govt job seems to be the inability to correct things, get the correct experts in the correct place — where they can be effectively heard — vs everybody having to cowtow to somebody in admin (who is not competent in the field in question).

Better yet, the loudest are regarded as experts. Or the self-designated. Or the largest group. (What have you successfully delivered lately?)

Trying to do the right thing, trying to make endeavors effective seems to be a futile endeavor.

Unless you want to lose your job. Which you might anyway when the undertaking goes awry."
2021-04-08 12:50,"Emergent Biosystems is the ultimate beltway insider, with a long history of delivering substandard products to essential areas of national defense. They have been a pirate ship of federal contracting since the 9/11 bioterror era, raiding money from every emergency response authorization. The government should seize their assets, throw the management in prison, and hit the reset button on pandemic response infrastructure with companies who are not incompetent."
2021-04-08 12:27,Is there a test that vaccinated people can have to see if they have the antibodies needed to fight the virus?
2021-04-08 12:17,"“management is knowledgeable and appears self-confident.”

Large scale problems like this are inevitably the fault of management; apparently they are less knowledgeable than they need to be and over-confident would seem a better descriptor than self-confident.
Given the government's large investment in the company, perhaps it can nationalized, management fired, and replaced with competent leadership."
2021-04-08 13:40,Terrifying.  The only consolation is the criminal administration that allowed this to happen is no longer in power.
2021-04-08 13:05,I hope someone checks the quality of the anthrax vaccine we have should there ever be a bioterrorist  attack.
2021-04-08 13:07,"“I’ll be the oversight.  I’ll be the oversight.”

2021-04-08 13:48,"As a taxpayer who helped fund this fiasco, I want the money returned by Emergent BioSolutions."
2021-04-08 14:02,"Per many of the comments below, what I see is that the more we blame and point fingers, the more we politicize vaccines...the more the big picture fogs over, the more we just go along and get along, the less we ask questions, and the less we know what we know based on medical science and medical fact.

We have neither when it comes to these vacccines. Not yet. What we do have a lot of medical opinion, conjecture, etc. 

As of last Friday, Dr. Fauci cannot say whether those who are vaccinated will not spread the virus. We still know very little about asymptomatic spread.

However, in the present hyper-sensationalized environment,    if you speak up and ask questions you are either a conspiracy nut, deluded, anti-vax, or a willing killer of your fellow citizens.

I am none of the above...and I have many, many questions and concerns.  

Emergent is simply one more example of our willingness to abdicate and abandon our intelligence - our valid questions and concerns - and instead relentlessly emotionally react to the 24/7 inundation of fear into our daily lives.  

Turn off your smart phone...and tune into your intrinsic wisdom, intelligence, curiosity, and humanity."
2021-04-08 13:30,Where and how do you throw out 15 million doses? This is the question I have wanted answered since this story first broke
2021-04-08 13:46,"What would have happened if Trump was reelected?  Another part of his failure legacy.  Add the revelation of his ""donation"" scam - how can anyone support him?  Get aboard to work together and put America back on top."
2021-04-08 14:05,"President Biden and HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra have to close BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, the federal agency that repeatedly awarded Emergent no bid contracts, including for the questionable anthrax vaccine and the Covid-19 vaccines. 
The abject incompetence and corruption within BARDA are evident and have likely already caused 1000s of deaths due to delayed vaccination and prioritizing channeling funds to Emergent over building mask production capacity.

Former BARDA director Rick Bright blew the whistle, although much too late, after hundreds of millions, and potentially billions, were channeled to cronies and their lobbyist. Each and every BARDA contract needs to be investigated and administrators held liable. 

BARDA is also directing contracts for chemical disaster and weapons defence, an area where Emergent has also received massive funding over many other worthwhile proposals. BARDA has failed our nation to prepare for both chemical and biological disasters and needs to be shut down."
2021-04-08 13:31,"there need to be more consequences for a company that risks the nation's recovery from covid with this cavalier approach to manufacturing:  ""A review of months of company logs obtained by The Times showed that employees repeatedly said they deviated from manufacturing standards because of a lack of manpower and shortened production times."""
2021-04-08 13:42,"And yet, there is outrage when people have concerns about taking the vaccines? 

We wrap ourselves in blame and the politics of vaccines...rarely questioning the speed with which they were developed, the fact that they are an ""experimental"" treatment for ""emergency use,"" and Dr. Fauci has yet to confirm whether people who are vaccinated can still spread the virus.

On top of that we are freely talking about ""vaccine passports"" and multiple ""boosters"" to combat the seemingly limitless virus variants.

I for one am deeply concerned about the helter skelter handing of this and the lack of questioning. Do these companies manufacturing the vaccines have liability? Why haven't read about the short-term and long-term financial gain of these companies?

I'm a ""moderate"" if a label is required here, and a strong supporter of Biden, but that doesn't preclude me from having serious concerns and questions...

I for one see our freedoms - our bodies, our choices, our personal information, our employment, our movement around our own society - being kidnapped by Big government, Big pharm, Big money, and the new ""Big""...Big media; 24/7 fear-inducing, opinion perpetuating, drama creating, scientific fact and scientific evidence absent, information muddling...""news."" 

We're being kidnapped and held for ransom, ""Get a vaccine or else!""

We are rapidly descending down a dangerous, slippery slope we will not rise up from in our lifetimes...and possibly our grandchildren's lifetimes."
2021-04-08 14:05,A terrible loss during this pandemic where vaccines are so desperately needed to save lives.  What adds salt to the wound is knowing that Emergent will get away with this.  This country never seems to hold corporations and their CEO's accountable.
2021-04-08 14:14,Big change from making Anthrax vaccines that will never be used to producing something that will be injected into millions.
2021-04-08 14:27,"Why has this company remained operational let alone been allowed to grift billions in taxpayer dollars for years? No oversight, no regulations. It’s because if our insane political system that allows con men to become congressmen and president who are making back room deals with other con men who are lobbyists and “business” men.  

In a sane world Emergent would never have been allowed to operate. In a sane world Emergent would be immediately shut down, government funds stopped and assets seized. The CEO and other leaders would be held financially and personally accountable. 

Emergent is a great example of why lobbying needs to end, regulations need to be restored and enforced, and dirty politicians like Andy Harris (and most of the GOP) need to be prevented from holding office."
2021-04-08 14:20,"This is what happens when the only thing that counts for companies' worth is stock price and profit, and the surest way to do that is cutting workers and their pay.  The US will continue to disintegrate as long as this remains the case."
2021-04-08 14:39,"There should be an investigation into who in this company is politically connected to Trump. There is no way that they would have gotten the contract otherwise. And yet they get to keep our hundreds of millions already paid to them.

They didn’t hire enough personnel or qualified people because they wanted to maximize their profits and not focus on quality of their product."
2021-04-08 15:08,Another case of disregard  for people while padding the wallet.  Greed is still a deadly sin.
2021-04-08 15:12,"that ""self regulation"" model of big business has been broken for centuries if not millennia."
2021-04-08 14:53,"Emergent's apparent failure in fulfilling the terms of its contract with the US government appears to me to be criminal negligence.  

How many more people will die because of Emergent's failure?  They contracted with us to be prepared, to be ready and able, to produce life-saving vaccines, but took inadequate action to remedy known deficiencies."
2021-04-08 14:55,"Another fine example of Trump's dealings.  Always a ""good deal"".  Just not for the public."
2021-04-08 15:04,"As usual, follow the money. It often leads to a pocket."
2021-04-08 15:06,"As I read this article, I wondered if these were the same guys from a past Times article on the anthrax vaccine debacle.  Indeed it appears they are.  Graft and corruption may be the ticket to getting government contracts, but clearly its not a positive indicator for quality operations."
2021-04-08 15:06,"Has anyone noticed that it was the previous administration that awarded this contract to that company, or investigated related conflicts of interest? Now the current administration has to clean up the mess. Isnt this an important part of the story?"
2021-04-08 15:21,"Can the Times please find out:
What the qualifications are for all the workers who interact with the Vaccine ?
What their hourly pay is ?

The World is on Fire with this Virus
and we using Garden Hoses to put it out ?"
2021-04-08 16:00,"Given the incompetence, it is not known whether the vaccines were safe. So, what’s to be done? Answer: If a pet dog bit family members, would you keep the dog?"
2021-04-08 16:31,"This is very alarming and concerning. How can the public ever trust Johnson & Johnson or Astrazeneca knowing the lackluster quality control in manufacturing their vaccine. This is arduous to rectify. We (Americans) have become the sheep in this social lab experiment. As majority of scientist (CDC, FDA, etc) would say the benefit outweigh the risk. Smh!"
2021-04-08 16:35,"So what happened to, ""the government awarded Emergent a contract worth up to $628 million, mostly to prepare its factories to make coronavirus vaccines as part of Operation Warp Speed."""
2021-04-08 16:44,"Hopefully there will be a full scale criminal investigation of this, how this company got the contract to produce vaccines, who was involved, and follow the money trail. If Emergent gave huge donations via dark money (501c4 donations) they should be traced and see if it got to Trump.  The heads of the company should be investigated by the SEC for possible malfeasance if it is found they were publicly promising things they couldn't deliver, that is securities fraud, making false statements to pump up the stock price."
2021-04-08 17:25,I hope those millions of doses were not just flushed down the drain as that would be another disaster.
2021-04-08 17:30,"They should be fined, put out of business and forced to return federal largesse."
2021-04-08 18:07,"If I signed a contract for $628 million to produce a covid vaccine and the contractor could not deliver, I'd want my money back.  Oh, wait, it was my government that contracted with Emergent and they were using my money, so I do want my money back!"
2021-04-08 18:49,It’s sounds like the government is responsible for “manufacturing” of Covid 19. How interesting that they hired this company to mass produce vaccines “in the event” of a pandemic. This is no coincidence!
2021-04-08 18:54,"Emerging threat to vaccine distribution is vaccines that needed to be thrown out get administered into people. The vaccines have been approved for emergency use in adults. Those willing to receive the vaccine without consideration of what could happen are responsible for not doing their own due diligence when the regulatory authorities are overlooking their responsibility. 

The CEO of Emergent who started the billion dollars company in 1998 received his education from Stanford University and Yale. Too bad there is trouble in the plant due to flawed quality control concerns. At least no one died or needed hospitalization. A few years ago a compounding lab. in Framingham, MA was identified as possible source of fungal meningitis outbreak blamed for deaths. If only they had a good quality control Department there would not have been any contaminated batches of pain killing steroids not passing into the spinal fluid of patients in 23 states resulting in over 50 deaths and over 2000 hospitalizations with severe meningitis.

The lessons from these 2 cases of lack of quality control can result in halting of manufacturing. It is fairly straight forward to ensure a product leaving a company to be sterile and non toxic. If a company cannot assure quality and safety, then it should be shut down. With supply of vaccine just about exceeding the demand, such incidences will spook those who still are willing to receive the vaccine. FDA needs to carefully monitor all vaccine manufacturing."
2021-04-08 20:21,"Just like when the CDC’s first Covid test kit ended up with bits of the wrong RNA, somebody tracking it in from another part of the building. A lab coat, a hair net you forget to change, and a million units of product all get that stuff you had on you without your ever having had a clue. Should we therefore be skeptical of claimants who tell us we can’t get the virus from this box top at the grocery store or that puff of air on the bike trail?

The world of molecules and viruses is incredibly small. If you can smell the cooking, a particle with enough viruses to start an infection can drift from the chef’s nose to yours, and enough to make a small town sick can fit on the head of a pin. It’s really a tribute to our bodies’ physical defenses that most of these chance exposures don’t lead to illness even if we’re not immune."
2021-04-08 21:48,Many competent scientists at all levels stepped up to volunteer their services when the pandemic first hit and beyond. How about tapping (and paying?) some of them for creative cooperative solutions to producing or at least overseeing production of the vaccines?

2021-04-09 1:58,"NYT, please tell me again, with facts, data, reliable source quotes -- Dr. Fauci, Dr. Freiden, anyone? -- that none of this calamity of 15 million doses -- or any part of the remaining 62 million doses produced & still in existence ever left the factory, much less got into the arms of people?

From what have been reading, up into early this week, when I got the J&J vaccine (no picnic, BTW, for me, many after-effects) ... all the J&J that was in the pipeline already, or was being delivered this week and near-term beyond, was only sourced from the original manufacturing plant in the Netherlands. Which gave me some comfort. 

I'd love to see / read this confirmed yet again, given my difficult experience this week post-J&J vaxx. 

Thanks!

(And this is NOT to discourage anyone from getting it. My best friend went to the same vaxx site and also got the J&J dose, and has had the mildest of reactions. It is very individual ... )"
2021-04-06 16:35,"This discovery should offer some reservations in regards to opening up schools this fall. Trying to return to ""normal"" is not be prudent. Even though a majority of adults might be vaccinated by August 2021, that doesn't mean the virus will disappear. Instead, it may mutate into a new variant that shifts its target to those who remain unvaccinated: children."
2021-04-06 16:47,"This happened to my good friend's 16 year old son. He experienced severe chest pains at soccer practice. The boy thought he was having a heart attack. He was rushed to Children's Hospital Los Angeles. Turns out that his heart was inflamed. He had never experienced any Covid symptoms but he did test positive for antibodies. Six months later, he's still dealing with occasional chest pain and a lot of fatigue. Scary."
2021-04-06 16:49,"I'm really hoping those vaccine trials with children are coming along. As we are seeing the Covid rates spike among youth, particularly in youth sports, every age group needs access.  We cannot remain in lockdown forever and keeping the schools closed is causing tremendous harm to children and parents alike."
2021-04-06 16:55,"We thought my 13-year old was lucky that he seemed ""asymptomatic"" when he tested positive for Covid...what we didn't know was that he was going to have issues with diminished taste and smell for months afterwards (still happening 90 days post infection). There is so much they don't understand about this virus still."
2021-04-06 16:57,"Yet the narrative perpetually pushed is that we need to reopen (and not just schools); once we’ve vaccinated all adults, another shutdown would go a long way to eradicating the virus and protecting our children. But we can’t even get everyone to agree to wear masks (the bare minimum!), let alone get the vaccine. And people who have been vaccinated are now flying on airplanes to take a vacation. So, yeah, we have a long way to go still and more kids will needlessly get infected."
2021-04-06 16:57,"I believe a lot of the depression children face to justify opening schools prematurely isn’t about being at school.  It is our hostile society over the last several years.

Cases were likely in the rise before these events."
2021-04-06 17:14,"Skeptics of vaccinating children point out that covid-19 deaths among children are rare. But this is only part of the story. The severe illness and intensive care associated with some pediatric covid-19 infections could lead to significant long term problems. Thousands of American children have developed MIS-C due to covid-19. Nearly all of them survive but in some cases it can be terribly painful and have lifelong consequences, such as heart and neurological damage. It is clear that pediatric vaccinations save lives. Children should not be precluded from attending school if they haven't been vaccinated against covid-19 but the evidence is clear that vaccines that are safe for adults are almost always equally safe for children."

2021-04-06 17:49,"Per the CDC, there have been 3000 Mis-c cases and 36 deaths attributed to those cases. Out of about 75 million people in US under age 18. My heart goes out to those who have suffered or died from MIS-C (like it does for victims of other terrible and exceedingly rare tragedies), but events of this frequency should have no bearing on national public health policy. It would be unfortunate if as a result of this article, parents with healthy kids begin to worry about the sudden onset of MIS-C."
2021-04-06 17:52,"So, does the testing required for a teenager with a ‘cold’ to return to school show just current Covid infection (presumably negative if the child simply has a common cold) or would it also demonstrate exposure to a previous Covid infection?

What’s going on with testing?"
2021-04-06 18:07,"There are conflicting messages out there.  There is a rush to reopen everything and a mentality that, because there is a vaccine, we are at the end of the pandemic.  Then there is what is described in this article and the fact that the Northeast is having what might be a fourth covid surge.  There are now variants here that are deadlier and more transmissible, but yet we now are opening schools to full time in person.  There will now be four times the number of students per classroom and they will be sitting closer together, which only adds to ventilation concerns.  I don't know, but it feels like a big experiment we are undertaking with our kids."
2021-04-06 18:11,"We will be learning more about this virus in the years to come.  It is clear that parents will need to be on high alert.

That is one reason I thought it inadvisable to open schools this soon.

There is a lot we still do not know about this virus and its impact on the body. One mystery for some adults is hair loss, which they are tying to blame in fever or stress, and from personal experience, I can say it is not the ""stress type"" of hair loss. I have lost hair in the past from illness or stress and this is noting like that at all.  

In the past, by the time I noticed the shedding, I could see new hair growing in, lots of short hairs annoyingly sticking straight up though my normal length hair on the top of my head that made me look like a chia pet. I have also lost what little hair I had on my arms too.

This time, there is no sign at all of regrowth and it has been months, and I am not alone.  This is not the ""stress"" hair loss that I have experienced in the past, that is clear.

The related point I am making is that it all simply illustrates that we need to study this virus further and how it impacts our immune system, like it is doing in these kids, or our hormones, production of proteins, and the various cells in our bodies."
2021-04-06 18:14,"""The findings show that although the syndrome is rare, it can be serious.""  We don't know if the syndrome is rare.  We know that it APPEARS to be rare. 

My point isn't to be a fear monger but
1. We should continue to be careful (masks, etc)
2. We should continue and expand research (which costs money) to determine how widespread these problems actually are so that we can make informed public health decisions."
2021-04-06 18:26,"By the way—at least for K-6, schools that have upgraded their HVAC and other systems and taken the sensible precautions, and are in sensible communities, are as safe for kids as being at home. Safer, if they’re in crowded housing. 

After that it gets trickier, but decent schools are still pretty safe."
2021-04-06 17:22,"And we want to open up schools?

I don’t have school age children anymore, but if I did I’d have to think long and hard before I put my child in harms way."
2021-04-06 18:11,"Yet latest polls show that roughly half of parents don't plan to vaccinate their children against COVID. 

I suspect once full FDA Approval comes down it will have to be like mumps and other diseases...

No vaccine means your kid isn't getting inside that school. 

I don't see any other way out of this mess. Too many anti science fools running around.

Unless we make it painful by restricting access to all sorts of things for the Unvaccinated (adults and children alike) we'll never get out of this pandemic. New variants will breed and spread faster than we can develop new vaccines."
2021-04-06 18:38,"I am not a virologist but Covid-19 sounds like a disease that can cause just about every symptom, in every organ and at any stage of the disease. The sequelae may be short term, long term and from rare to very frequent.

Just how unusual is this version of cornavirus and what does it portend for future pandemics and the burden on our health care system? 

I'm not sure who I feel more sorry for, the afflicted patients or the health care providers who must care for them."
2021-04-06 18:41,"This goes to highlight the importance of vaccination in adolescents when it becomes available.  Too many people are operating under the assumption that they're bulletproof.

Not only will vaccinating children be essential to an overall recovery, but to their own protection.  Even if the risks of MIS-C and other inflammatory markers is minimal, they're still smaller than the risk of issues from vaccination (assuming they're not different from the returns seen in the 16-25 and 12-15 age groups).  

Vaccinating children keeps them safe from COVID, restricts the spread of the disease, and keeps down the development of more dangerous mutations."
2021-04-06 17:19,"Many people say that the flu is more severe and deadly than covid to children. Even the CDC website seems to suggest this:

""The risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19. However, infants and children with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for both flu and COVID-19.""

<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm</a>

However, when I read these newspaper reports on the severity of the symptoms of children who are dealing covid, I wonder if the flu is indeed riskier than the covid to children."
2021-04-06 17:40,"From reading the comments, I think the article might be getting misinterpreted quite significantly. Namely, the 75 percent figure represents the probability that an individual had an asymptomatic case conditional on developing MIS-C. But I think the figure that's more informative to public health discussions regarding the risk of MIS-C to children who had asymptomatic infections is instead the probability that an individual develops MIS-C, conditional on an asymptomatic case. 

We can pretty easily back this out using Bayes' Rule at least in rough terms: Pr(MIS-C|Asymptomatic) = Pr(Asymptomatic|MIS-C)Pr(MIS-C)/Pr(Asymptomatic). If you assume the 75% figure here is correct, that there have been 2,090 cases of MIS-C, that 50% of adolescents with Covid are asymptomatic, and that we've ascertained one third of all cases in children, then the probability an asymptomatic case in an adolescent resulted in MIS-C is about 1 in 3,000."
2021-04-06 17:46,"This article validates my disbelief last year when it was reported that children in certain age groups were not getting COVID.  That didn't make any sense to me because children are germ vectors and get sick more often than adults.  COVID-19 is a virus and that announcement was illogical.

Now according to this article it appears that most of the children being affected by this disorder either had no symptoms or very few symptoms.  Which logically to me means that children were being infected, but not tested for COVID due to being asymptomatic.  If a child isn't being tested than of course the data is going to show that their numbers are low.

I really hope the children afflicted with this syndrome gets better very soon."
2021-04-06 19:13,"I took my kid to the playground on Sunday and saw a tremendous amount of kids, and kids without masks.  My son is  only two and if he can keep his mask on the others should too."
2021-04-06 19:30,"Although it's interesting to look at ""racial"" disparities in MIS-C cases, it's probably going to be more helpful to look at geographics, diet, domicile density, and age-by-sex (as they seem to be doing already). Have any cases of MIS-C been found in rural areas? What's the population proportion there? What kind of typical American inflammatory diets have those most severely affected been on? I wish the U.S. pediatric medical establishment would start to catch up with other bodies of knowledge on the gut-brain connection."
2021-04-06 19:40,"This study has some interesting info in terms of describing what symptoms kids can get and when.

But I'm sort of shocked at the lack of analysis in this research. Nowhere in the study or the supplementary table is there any info on the ""patient characteristics"" of these kids.

This, despite the fact that the piece says ""Although most children with SARS-CoV-2 infection have mild or no symptoms, some children, particularly, PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH UNDERLYING CONDITIONS, can have severe illness.""

OK.  What are those conditions?  There's no info on BMI, nothing about other co-morbidities.  Virtually every piece piece on COVID has a list of co-morbidities with breakouts for which suffer mild, serious disease, etc.

One thing that would be interesting to know is whether any of the kids had some of the very rare, serious immune diseases that appear to make people more susceptible to severe COVID. 

It would have been useful for parents and others to see this info.  But I guess the CDC just couldn't be bothered to include it.  Strange."
2021-04-06 19:48,"Unless and until children are part of phased safety and efficacy vaccine clinical trials no assumptions can be reliably made about their susceptibility to the many infectious mysteries of COVID-19.

Testing of children is essential along with masking, social distancing, washing hands, contact tracing, solation and treatment."
2021-04-06 20:48,"My son had this, no symptoms woke up and couldn’t walk. He is better now, but terrifying and still not knowing the long term affects of what he had or what he might still have. I was an early Lyme disease child in the 80s in Connecticut. I’m 42 and will have effects they never knew would last in 1989.  So much to learn, my thoughts are with the other families. Let’s hope to get every kid vaccinated"
2021-04-06 20:50,"As soon as the vaccine clears safety hurdles for 12-16 year olds, we need to get them vaccinated asap and back to regular five days/week of school.  Statistically, that is the thing that is most damaging to kids right now - being out of school for over a year.  Yes there are anecdotal cases, some will probably come in response to this post, of kids getting very sick with covid and the inflammatory disease.  The overwhelming number of kids are suffering from being home."
2021-04-06 21:18,"I would speculate that there are at least some promising safe therapeutics in the drug development pipeline that deal with inflammation undergoing trials right now, hopefully the FDA will grant emergency usage authorization to the best of them and make them available beyond their trial locations as quick as possible."
2021-04-06 21:27,It will be interesting to find out why males are so much more likely to die from covid-19. I am sure the studies are ongoing.
2021-04-06 19:38,"Articles like this one -- which discuss a strange and unexplained variant of coronavirus -- remind me of the failure of the US scientific and medical communities to speak up about the possibility that COVID-19 is the result of ""gain of function"" research by Chinese scientists who took a bat virus from nature and enhanced its lethality and transmissibility and that somehow, their viral creation leaked from the level-4 laboratory in Wuhan.

Even the head of WHO recently criticized the Chinese government for not being forthcoming with the information at its disposal.

I hope the NYT publishes this comment.  I do not for one moment believe the virus was ""man made,"" but rather the result of experimentation that until recently was banned in the USA because of its potential dangers.

The sooner the Chinese regime tells the world precisely what happened, the sooner the West can develop full contermeasures."
2021-04-06 19:52,"If you are afraid of MIS-C you should never send your kids back to school, ever.  There are horrible diseases that occur rarely in children all the time and it is sad and disappointing, but it's also perfectly normal before Covid-19 and will be long after Covid-19 is a bad memory.

What you should really be afraid of is influenza and childhood pneumonia which kills thousands of children each year."
2021-04-06 22:28,"It was always exasperating to hear Trump's Pence-Fauci-Birx-Redfield led corona virus task force proclaim children were nearly 100% safe from the virus, because it hardly ever, ever killed them. Statistics were coming out in growing numbers about increasing cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, yet since they didn't die, that pesky side-effect was ignored.
The same disregard for statistical importance is still in effect for Long-haul covid symptoms in adults, such that if you didn't die, then you weren't important for gov't statistics.
Current vaccines do not guarantee protection against asymptomatic acquisition of this virus, which seems common to many of the children now suffering from this syndrome. 
The delayed consequences of harboring the virus in ones body, even if symptom-free, are unknown. Thus, the current pell-mell rush to reopen schools, business and society might benefit from a little more caution. People need to understand getting Covid isn't simply a live or die binary problem."
2021-04-06 22:40,"You kept hoping that all the grief of COVID would maybe skip over the children. Apparently not.

Ok, everybody — if you wouldn’t mask up, wash hands and social distance before — for heaven’s sake, do it  n o w . 

Whatever all our disagreements might otherwise be; surely we can agree here. 

We owe the children the safest environment we are capable of providing."
2021-04-06 20:08,Among the admirable jobs the New York Times is doing in its coverage of the Coronavirus Pandemic is the ability of the publication to investigate every nook and cranny of the affliction! This article is another example! Bravo! Give yourselves a pat on the back!
2021-04-06 19:51,"'It's only a thousand kids, oh well'... wouldn't that be the GOP/DeSantis response?"
2021-04-06 21:11,"Yeah, I knew there was a reason I’m not fully celebrating my second vaccine yet.  Dang it.  I have 5 grandchildren age 6 and under.  WHEN are we going to get out of the woods with this?  Coupling this article with the article about significant numbers of white evangelists planning to refuse vaccination... it... it is almost too much.  Talk about culture war. For every adult who refuses to vaccinate there are the millions of kids who will be vulnerable to the virus. What vicious selfishness and self delusion of anti-vaxxers."
2021-04-07 1:02,"Seems like a good time to remind all parents to comply with their pediatricians’ vaccine schedules for their children, including annual flu vaccines for all children starting at age 6 months.  Influenza and pneumonia cause childhood hospitalizations and deaths every year."
2021-04-07 1:22,"This is significant and may play out in the future as increased risk of developing cardiomyopathy and heart failure, which may be comparable to the ""long-haul COVID"" phenotype seen in adults.  The country (and planet) is not out of the woods yet.  Certainly should encourage all who value health and are averse to morbidity  (if not in themselves, then in others) to get vaccinated to protect their children and those around them. Hopefully vaccine will be available for pediatric use soon, but SARS-CoV2 is going to be around in various guises for quite some time.  While influenza, etc will still be around, this will be another speed bump that is of uncertain magnitude thus far."
2021-04-07 1:28,"Hi there, I hope most people will consider wearing, or double wearing, masks if and when possible, especially in public stores, buildings, transportation and in crowded areas outside even.  CDC did a study that showed most people in a sample that got covid ate in a restaurant where they didn't choose their seats.  A lot of other people went to gyms for instance.  Not sure if any studies have been done on classrooms, altho I saw the diagrams of airflow in a room with desks.  Riding a bus to school might be more dangerous than going to class?  Not sure.  Adults can be good examples for kids, and/or young adults.  Wear masks, putting a daily mask on inside the home before going out for the day.  Carry extra KN95 cellowrap masks in a brief case or bag, or backpack, as an adult, and kids will or might copy.  Kids all carry cell phones, they can learn to use a mask and even carry an extra one.  And like we should warn people young and old...to be wary of ""busy"" looking places, crowds i.e, like at Chick Filet or too many folks sitting too close at church or in the gym.  Wherever we go be alert for distancing.  If a patio restaurant is ""packed,"" ask friends if they want to get take out and ""come over"" for dinner at someone's home.  It's hard to savvy all the details of the research and medical findings, but we can all be good examples of ""how to act"" in a pandemic, covid or flu, etc.  I got my vaccination as I am more afraid of catching covid, than I am of the vaccine."
2021-04-07 4:11,"MIS-C is very similar to MCLN Syndrome in that similar organs including the heart are involved and the treatments are similar.
The pathogenesis of both is not certain but in some children an infectious agent acts as a""super antigen"" that elects a tidal wave of inflammation.
Presently, there is no test to determine what children are at risk."
2021-04-07 9:49,"To the parents who so readily subscribe to the return to the classrooms by children, read and beware! Social distancing, masks, PPE's, etc. are still a necessity for children who are as yet not vaccinated! Our schools and schoolrooms are not big enough to handle every child according to guidelines. Don't be in such a rush!"
2021-04-07 14:58,"My 33 year old son is one of the rare few who had the adult version of this, most likely as a result of having psoriatic arthritis which is, like Covid, an autoimmune disease. He had a very mild case of Covid and three weeks after recovery wound up in the hospital for 9 days with MIS-A. It took a while for doctors to start treating him properly because they couldn’t identify what he had, the condition being so rare. It was scary for him and the entire family, but that doesn’t mean everyone should be scared of having this syndrome if they get Covid: there are outliers in every disease and he just happened to be one of them. Trying to always be on alert for zebras means you’ll miss the horses going by - which are much more common"
2021-04-07 11:42,Children must be vaccinated as soon as possible to reduce this horrific inflammatory complication from COVID exposure. Hopefully this will be accomplished before the next school year in September.
2021-04-07 13:02,Just approve the vaccine for kids. The CDC and FDA have caused more damage than the virus.

2021-04-08 16:57,"Wow! This article made my day. Congratulation to Dr. Kariko!

Two items stood out: 1. She's a woman which makes her academic success more difficult within our male-focused power structures. 2. Her problem was not her scientific chops but that she lacked writing skills for her grant applications. Which leads me to my particular hobby horse: education in the humanities is as important as scientific knowledge or technological expertise. Nevertheless, she persisted."

Thank you, Dr. Kariko and thank you, Dr. Weissman!"
2021-04-08 17:04,"Excellent article about not only the dogged efforts of a committed scientist, but also the limitations of the current system of research support only via grants.  As noted here many of their grant proposals were rejected.  In competitive areas a single negative comment and score from one reviewer for almost any reason can kill a proposal. I know of many such cases where the ultimate public impact came from long efforts similar to Dr. Kariko's with minimal funding.   

Many years ago when public universities were very well funded researchers had some base funding that allowed them to pursue some cutting edge ideas that others might not understand. That is gone with tax-cutting governors and legislators. Creativity is often not understood as creativity is inherently something that no one else foresees.  It is too bad for society."
2021-04-08 17:08,Words cannot express the gratitude I feel not only for Dr. Kariko’s research but also for her passion and her determination and persistence. If only the grant makers could get some of that vision!

That every experiment, even if it fails, must be designed to tell the research something, even if it's news they don't want to hear. Also revealing how much progress depends on the interest and vision of the scientific community. Perhaps too many were short-sighted? Thank you, Dr. Kariko, for not giving up!"
2021-04-08 17:19,"A brilliant and inspiring article.  Note, though, where the intellectual capacity to build this vaccine came from: a precariously employed academic, and the work of scientists at NIH (publicly funded institution), University of Texas (public university) and University of British Columbia (public university where research would be supported by NSERC or CIHR the two publicly funded science granting councils in Canada.)  In what moral universe do these vaccines not belong to the people of the United States and Canada whose governments ought to have the power to license their production everywhere at cost so that the vaccines can be distributed to poor countries ASAP and without requiring them to pay for them?  Oh that would be the capitalist universe we live in. In ever you wanted a demonstration of the flaws in corporate IP claims you have it here."
2021-04-08 17:26,"Thank you, Dr. Kariko. Your work has touched so many lives. May the University of Pennsylvania grant you a full professorship, which is so long overdue, and may all your future pursuits in the laboratory be awarded the funding they deserve."

And as a female academic (albeit in a very different field), I am awed by Dr. Kariko's perseverance in a male-dominated field that was largely hell-bent on ignoring and discouraging her (yes, I realize, not necessarily for gendered reasons, but even so), and thankful for the male scientists who supported rather than discounted her work."

My son loves his work in an academic research lab. He's a recent grad with BS degree in Biomedical engineering. Hopefully his work and articles like this will inspire him to continue his education and get the Phd that seems necessary to career development in academic research labs.

It's a shame though that our best and brightest, including Dr. Kariko don't earn more than $60,000 per year when the companies benefitting from her research are certainly minting many new millionaires. And don't get me started on pro athlete salaries.

However, due to the fact that the NY Times is identity/social engineering, woke, obsessed dog whistling in all their stories that white men are the source of all the problems in America, I don't know whether to believe this story.

To be fair the right wing media does the same thing, ie anything Biden or the democrats do are the source of all the problems in America."
2021-04-08 17:35,Sounds like Dr. Kariko's name should go down in the history books along with Jonas Salk and Louis Pasteur.  Maybe at the top of the list?
2021-04-08 17:57,"Dr.Katalin Kariko, daughter of a butcher. But today her groundwork for the mRNA vaccines turning the tide of the pandemic and saving millions all over the world. Many salutes to her and to her colleagues who are part of the research team. God bless them all."
2021-04-08 16:50,I have chills reading this story. I’m so grateful Dr. Kariko persevered. I hope she and Dr. Weissman win a Nobel Prize. I get my second shot tomorrow.
2021-04-08 16:56,This woman is a hero. Science rocks.
2021-04-08 17:13,"Gina K, thank you for this article. Why aren't these names better known already? Sounds like they should be nominated for that next Nobel Prize in Medicine."
2021-04-08 17:20,"UPenn, award Dr. Kariko tenure and access to a grant writer and for the love of God the NIH should be fully funding her lab. Sometimes the academic world is too much like an insular country club."
2021-04-08 17:48,"I think this wonderful story shows the limits of the power of money. People like Dr. Kariko cannot be bought. She's the kind of person we need in positions of importance: in research, in management, in education, and God knows, in government. One Dr. Kariko is worth more than the entire U.S. Congress, the Administration and the Supreme Court, put together. Thank you, Kati Kariko."
2021-04-08 17:54,"Have you met any Hungarians? Stubborn, gallant, brilliant MFs. Dr. Mariko, thank you. And thank the United States for giving her a challenging, imperfect but rewarding home when Hungary would not."
2021-04-08 18:24,What a great story - thanks!  Finally I understand how the biotech companies were able to move so quickly to develop vaccines.  The groundwork had been laid for them by decades of research.
2021-04-08 18:31,What a wonderful profile and fascinating article! She is a real hero and I hope she finally gets her dues.
2021-04-08 18:42,"I’ll be getting my second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. It already means the world to me to have these vaccines available, but it’s twice as awesome knowing it was made possible by a smart, persistent, female scientist. Thank you, Dr. Kariko!"
2021-04-08 18:54,"When you read stories about the lives of Dr. Kariko, you sometimes think that there might actually be really good people in this world.  And a sense of urgency with the importance of their work.  Somebody please give her a raise."
2021-04-08 18:54,"As I received my second shot, I realized there are literally thousands, if not millions, of people I could thank if given a chance. 

The people in research like Dr. Kariko, those coordinating the logistics of the rollouts, healthcare workers, docs, other scientists, the companies making the vaccines themselves. 

It saddens me that so many that are refusing the vaccine today are themselves the beneficiaries of multiple vaccines received in childhood. 

Stories like Dr. Kariko remind me of those still hoping to find solutions that improve the lives of people they will never meet. 

Those are heroes to me."
2021-04-08 19:06,"So it's Dr. Kariko we owe thanks to!
It's a fascinating story of how basic research proceeds (or not) and the politics of who gets to work in research labs.

However, I'm also fascinated by the rock star status given to Dr. Fauci; I don't understand it. In the telling of Dr. Kariko's research, Drs. Barnathan, Langer and Weissman are all identified as key players in the research; it is their insight into the potential practical benefits in pure research on mRNA.  But why is Dr. Fauci included in this story? Why is his comment, that he knows of Dr. Kariko and his opinion is she was ""kind of obsessed"" with mRNA in a ""positive way"" or relevance and important enough to quote here?"
2021-04-08 19:41,"Heartfelt appreciation to Dr. Kariko and thank you, Gina Kolata, for the beautifully written article."
2021-04-08 18:38,Amen
2021-04-08 18:40,"I can only mega-ditto all the positive comments in this column.

But on reflection, as we perversely tally all the real and opportunity costs of the Trump administration, Dr. Kariko, her gold medal daughter, and her supportive husband exemplify the value of immigrants, underscoring the likely massive opportunity cost of Trump's stupid immigration policy."
2021-04-08 18:54,Can we transfer Rush Limbaugh’s Medal of Freedom to her.
2021-04-08 18:56,"Why isn't Dr. Kariko a MacArthur ""Genius Grant"" recipient?"
2021-04-08 19:03,Good job Katalin!
2021-04-08 19:04,I hope the Nobel Prize committee is reading this.
2021-04-08 19:05,Amazing.
2021-04-08 19:33,Go Kati!!!!
2021-04-08 18:28,"It's an absolute travesty that this is the first I have heard of this story! We are about four months into a global vaccination campaign that successfully used research that can revolutionarise medicine in areas including vaccines for diseases caused by retroviruses, such as influenza and HIV. Drs. Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman should become household names."
2021-04-08 18:31,"I am so glad to read more stories like this and fewer stories about celebrities, reality TV stars and the latest sexual harassment scandals of politicians. Amazing!"
2021-04-08 18:36,Where would we be without the melting pot of immigrants in this country? We're indebted to all selfless workers. Carry on.
2021-04-08 18:43,This is the stuff that movies are made off!
2021-04-08 18:45,Her life's work deserves a Nobel Prize in Medicine.
2021-04-08 18:46,Fascinating and inspiring story. I hope I get to meet Dr. Kariko one day. I'll bring her a box of Goobers.
2021-04-08 19:35,"This is so exciting. If possible, could someone here explain in the most very, very basic terms what is the difference between Dr. Kariko's work and Jennifer Doudna & Emmanuelle Charpentier work? Thank you."
2021-04-08 18:19,"What is so interesting to me is that this scientist who happens to be a woman, was so concerned for the people who were not right about the vaccine at the time of her greatest accomplishment.

Are women inherently more empathetic, even at this level?"
2021-04-08 18:33,"Dr. Kariko is magnificent.  An outstanding role model for women who what to go into science.  Nobel prize would be in order, don't you think?"
2021-04-08 18:48,Hero!  Tears of gratitude.
2021-04-08 19:16,"In her own way Dr Kariko was as alone and out there as Neil Armstrong. Except she built the rocket, too."
2021-04-08 19:46,"Wow - talk about persistence and drive and, of course, creativity! I wish that more people understood that these vaccines were not developed ""too quickly"" but rather that background work had been happening for a decade. What a gift to humanity these scientists are!"
2021-04-08 19:55,"A wonderfully written story for the average Joe/Joann to understand.  A lesson in dedication, faith in one's work, and perseverance.  I'm filled with excitement on future applications of mRNA."
2021-04-08 19:56,This work deserves a Nobel Prize! Fantastic story.
2021-04-08 20:05,"What a wonderful person and what good reporting!  It's so impressive to know the world has a scientist  as committed, persevering, and talented as Ms. Kariko.  Her family, Dr. Weissmann, Dr. Langer, Dr. Barnathan, Dr. Graham, and Dr. McClellan - all deserve the world's thanks, along with her.  So do the Chinese scientists who researched and shared the genetic sequence of the virus.  And, of course, the teams at BioNTech and Moderna."
2021-04-08 20:06,Thank you Dr. Kariko. Your grit and dedication are a huge inspiration for me.
2021-04-08 20:18,"While this is a success story for Dr. Kariko and her research project, it's a story of failure of science in the US.  I don't think people appreciate what the career path described here really is.  Worrying about whether you can afford trivial reagents, much less animal trials. Fretting about your own salary, which is a subsistence wage in moderately priced areas and a poverty wage in expensive university cities; worse, that salary is promised only provisionally, maybe for a few months, then a couple years, then a few weeks, then not at all.  Dr. Kariko is 66.  I wonder if her temporary positions have ever contributed to a retirement plan.

The people who can do the type of work described here are smart and dedicated.  Most can have far better lives in other careers.  They leave science because the career is too uncertain and too unrewarding."
2021-04-08 20:30,"Oh lord, we ought to be funding all these scientists with huge grants, look at the hard back breaking work they do in the lab, it's truly unbelievable how much more progress we could make if we valued scientific research more thank you Dr. Kariko and your fellow colleagues!"
2021-04-08 20:32,Thank you Dr. Kariko and family.  I am so very grateful that our world - which made your brilliant discovery much more difficult to achieve - has benefited from your gifts and talents.  I will be sharing your heroic story with my grandchildren.
2021-04-08 20:32,"we can NEVER repay the dedication of people like Dr. Kati, but a Presidential Medal of Honor from a president who understands and appreciates science would be an appropriate recognition. THANK YOU DR. KATI"
2021-04-08 20:42,I felt overwhelmed with gratitude reading this story!  Thank goodness for her perseverance.
2021-04-08 20:42,"I got my first jab of the Moderna a few days ago and as I waited for 15 minutes after, I couldn't help but have minutes to ponder and silently thank all those who put in their know-how and diligence to make it happen. But I only knew of the BioNTech couple. 

This article provided so many added insights. Thank you NYT for providing the information. 

A HUGE thanks to Dr. Kariko (a woman! an immigrant!) who gave us decades of relentless research to make a significant difference to humankind. She deserves every accolade and award out there."
2021-04-08 19:42,"Between her contributions to mRNA and her daughter's 2 gold medals, this immigrant has done more for this country than any native born could possibly imagine..."
2021-04-08 20:00,"What took you so long to write a story about this woman and her essential contribution to the welfare of humanity? 

The NYT is my main source of information. But I learned about this woman and her accomplishments months ago, by chance, looking at other online news outlets. As an NYT reader, I felt that I had been robbed of a major story. I would like the paper to explain this oversight."
2021-04-08 20:17,That’s why they award Nobel Prizes. She alone deserves one for this work.
2021-04-08 20:23,"Köszönöm a szépen￼!!!
(Thank you so very much!!!)

Without question the Nobel Prize!"
2021-04-08 19:43,"Dr Kariko’s work is emblematic of what happens in science. Underpaid, creative people struggle to do good science against all odds. The real game-changers are those, like Kariko who don’t care about the ‘accepted wisdom’ in the field.  Grants don’t come in, excellent researchers have to pick up elsewhere. Sometimes not able to pursue their own ideas. Then as they make breakthroughs, Big Pharma buys up the ideas and technologies and make billions on it. All from struggling scientists pursuing ideas and able to do their work through taxpayer dollars. The whinging from Pharma that they have to charge high prices so they can do the necessary research, doesn’t even begin to correctly describe the reality."
2021-04-08 20:05,"It may be too late for Penn to make a full professor, give tenure, and lab to work in. However they may award her a well deserved honorary doctorate."
2021-04-08 20:09,"The Covid 19 mRNA vaccine is only the first clinical application in Dr. Kariko's playbook.  More iterations will address myriads of human pathologies.  Lab coats are the new light sabers...may the force be with the research scientists

2021-04-08 20:13,She deserves a highest honor from USA
2021-04-08 19:43,We may live virus free thanks to one woman's unrelenting desire to research a problem NO ONE wanted to assist or fund. There simply is no gratitude as significant as Dr. Kariko's achievement.
2021-04-08 19:48,'Never made more than 60k a year.' The shamefully low salary for educators in the nation is a crime.
2021-04-08 20:02,"True heroes in every sense. 
Makes one realize how monetary “rewards” are so skewed in this country."
2021-04-08 19:53,"Just finished a maddening text exchange with a young woman I met through yoga and who became a friend. She was stunned to learn I’m receiving my first shot tomorrow and proceeded to rant about government agendas, Big Pharma, etc. How could I be into natural health AND vaccines? Because the science which validates much but not all of the concepts of natural health is the same science that validates the simple facts of vaccines. 

I now read this article and, because of my own medical background and science education, can easily grasp Dr. Kariko’s achievements. I then realize that my friend is also, beyond lacking any science education, just not as bright as I am. I already knew this but love her spirit, creativity, and other wonderful gifts she brings to the community. I explained the history of smallpox and the first vaccine but she not only couldn’t begin to fathom the relevance to today, she was just not interested.

Most of us reading are in a small cohort at the right end of the IQ and education scale. The vast middle is where the country is and without not only aggressive public health campaigns aimed at young people but also basic science education mandated in all schools no matter the zip code, they will kill us all. We need to stop caring about Britney Spears (still can’t believe the NYT wasted time and money on that documentary in the middle of a public health and education crisis) and think about how to educate the masses away from medieval fears and thinking, NOW."
2021-04-08 20:09,It looks like the world is deeply indebted to Dr. Kariko for all her hard work and perserverance.  Nobel Prize?
2021-04-08 20:14,"According to a recent story in the Boston Globe, Moderna produced 4 newly minted Billionaires. I hope that Dr. Kariko is also able to share in the fruits of her important groundbreaking research. She persevered in the face of adversity and non-believers. Hopefully, the Nobel Prize committee will recognize her and award her the Nobel Prize for Medicine."
2021-04-08 20:23,Dr Katalin Kariko has got to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Biology / Medicine this year. She wins hands down. Her life’s work is saving countless lives.
2021-04-08 20:14,"She is in the great humble humane empathetic dedicated tradition of yester years heroes. Like Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin.

Dr. Kariko working quietly and effectively in service to humanity by limiting our ignorance via her creative independent and original curiosity.

Along with the American and French lady scientists who received the Nobel Prize for their work with CRISPR we need all of our brain power to progress."
2021-04-08 20:52,Our grant system should ( somehow) reward long term thinking rather than incremental changes
2021-04-08 20:52,Thank goodness for the perseverance of true scientists like Dr. Kariko! This article does a great job of demonstrating why the benighted system of academic medical research so often fails to produce great science. It is almost a miracle that Dr. Kariko's work came to fruition given all that she was up against.
2021-04-08 20:58,So inspiring and it hits on two key issues for this country: immigration and women in science.  Hopefully our political class in DC sees this and asks the question of how do we align our immigration and education policies to encourage more of this.
2021-04-08 21:27,Thank you Dr. Kariko and Dr. Weissman! You are true inspirations. Also thank Gina Kolata for bringing these scientist and their hard work to our attention!
2021-04-08 21:28,"So grateful to the scientists who persevere despite obstacles of funding and lack of support. To the people who showed surprise at the $60,000 annual income, my husband left research because annual income was $45k. He might have accepted that for longer. But he spent, he felt, more time trying to get grants than doing science. It became even worse what with funding cuts under George W Bush’s administration. So he left and went into industry. I met a guy who was at Salk and did the same. Like him, my husband thought it would be nice to be able to support his family. The future of US depends on whether its scientists, thinkers, and artists are supported."
2021-04-08 21:31,"Reading this, it chills me to think of all the years when a majority of our population was effectively kept out of the sciences and academia due to race and gender. How many discoveries were lost or delayed? Thank you, doctor, for your persistence and your brilliance."
2021-04-08 21:37,This doctor and her fellow scientists saved us. I am so very grateful for their persistent search for the truth and pray there are a whole lot more in labs around the world working on more discoveries.  Thank you for telling us this important story. Blessings to Dr. Kariko and her colleagues!!
2021-04-08 21:38,"For many reasons, this is one of the most moving articles I have ever read."
2021-04-08 21:41,"Thank you Dr. Kariko and Dr. Weissman!  I get my shot next week and will know where it comes from.  What a great story.  The world saved by a person who just loves what they do and sticks to it for the love of science and making a difference.  Sure, it took a few scientists to put it all together, but you appear to have provided the key ingredient.   I bow to you in thanks!  And thanks Gina Kolata for writing this story."
2021-04-08 21:44,"What a magnificent story of human perseverance, intelligence and the scientific method.

Katalin Kariko is a hero.....or heroine, as it were.

Twelve cheers for science....and twelve more cheers for the immigrants that make America great."
2021-04-08 21:47,"A hero in every sense of the word. Worthy of many prizes, but none can compare with how Dr. Kariko and Weissman has effected all of our lives.  Great thanks...and why we need to support basic scientists to explore new ideas, make mistakes, and then great discoveries.  Thanks for this moving story.."
2021-04-08 22:01,"It could also be mentioned that her work made possible the healing of some of us with Long-Covid. I was a first wave Covid-19 patient, getting sick in March of 2020. I've been sick for over a year, and got better after receiving the vaccine! I am so thankful. Not everyone is improving of course, but some of us, with long-term symptoms are seeing improvement with the vaccines. Deep appreciation for this work and how it's helped me, personally."
2021-04-08 22:03,"This incredible woman selflessly dedicated her life and heart and soul to a cause that saved millions of lives.

....and yet some individuals find it too much to put on a mask....or to get the vaccine....so they can spread the virus and end lives.

There are not enough good words for Kati Kariko.....and not enough bad words for the others."
2021-04-08 22:04,"What a GREAT story.  

Best thing I’ve read in many years."
2021-04-08 22:28,"Heroes can be found in amazing places.

And in addition for the valid claims of needing tenure and lab funding, I hope the MacArthur Foundation considers her for a genius grant!"
2021-04-08 20:33,Katalin Kariko for Sainthood. Any objections?
2021-04-08 21:03,"What??  I thought the people behind the vaccine were led by Bill Gates and George Soros for their evil world domination scheme!

To Dr. Kariko - from the bottom of my heart, thank you."
2021-04-08 21:30,God bless Doctor Kariko.  Thank you for never giving up.

2021-04-08 22:13,"The brilliant and dedicated Kati Kariko should be a candidate for the Nobel Prize. Before the pandemic is over, her work will have saved untold millions here and around the world from serious illness, lifelong debilitation or death. 

As Deborah Birx put it, Former Guy and his associates and his Congressional dust bunnies were responsible for the last 450,000 avoidable American Covid-19 fatalities. They should be investigated, indicted and prosecuted."

2021-04-08 21:42,"Thrilled that the NYT is finally highlighting the impact of basic science on this vaccine.

But speaking as a PhD scientist (assistant professor in Immunology) there's an important lesson here than just the commentators remarking how she and Drew Weissman deserve Nobel prizes.

The deeper story is the fragile position of non-tenure track scientists. The de-emphasis of basic research being funded at the NIH in preference of flashy translational/clinical studies. Never mind that all those translational studies are built on basic science! The NIH is cannibalizing their seed. The greater story here isn't about one woman and one man. It's about thousands of scientists like them that right at this moment are toiling away in obscurity in labs. Pressure your senator, your congressman, your president, your NIH. Tell them to reinvest heavily in funding BASIC science. 

Our future decades from now depends on what's being done at this moment. Scientific 'breakthroughs' are truly built over decades."
2021-04-08 21:57,"I hope Drs. Kariko, Langer and all of their collaborators win a Nobel prize. Bravo their perseverance. A very moving article to read"
2021-04-08 21:20,"Thank you deeply Dr Kariko and Dr Weissman. I believe a Nobel Prize would be thoroughly deserved. In this age of cherry picking the science that conforms to your worldview and ridiculing the science that doesn't, I find it immensely irritating that all scientists are not respected as our guiding lights for the future but instead used by govts as a tool in their popularity contests."
2021-04-08 22:32,Thank you Dr Kariko. Amazing story of a truly persistent brilliant individual. God bless our immigrants. All of them.
2021-04-08 22:50,"Dr. Kariko’s story struck deeply home with me.  I was a young Ph.D working for a large R&D organization and recognized a huge application for an emerging analytical technique.  My organization refused to buy commercial hardware to support my idea and refused to fund efforts to build my own.  I developed a novel instrumental concept , bootlegged other projects for components, worked after hours, set things on fire in a shared lab and tried to avoid being fired.  My clandestine work produced a wildly successful solution in search of a problem which soon materialized and supported the last 20 years of my career.  Hooray for Dr. Kariko.  She deserves a Nobel more than anyone else that I can think of."
2021-04-08 22:41,"How ironic, an unheralded genius who made the vaccines happen, stuck at U of P without a tenured professorship, while our prior disgraced President bought his way into this University, which has never taken a stand against him.

Disgraceful, University of Pennsylvania. 

The whole bunch of you ought to be ashamed."
2021-04-08 22:42,"Several people pointed out that not only is this a great story about a determined scientist, but also brilliantly brought to us by Gina Kolata. Congratulations to the great scientist but also to the great science writer who researched and told her story."
2021-04-08 22:45,"Dr. Kariko and Dr. Weissman, thank you for saving the world."
2021-04-08 22:54,"I am so glad that The New York Times shines a bright light on one of the scientists whose research, compassion and commitment to an idea became the reality that is now saving lives will likely save millions more in the future. 

How many other endeavors can claim such a humanitarian victory?"

Thank you!"
2021-04-08 23:32,"Consider this woman and her dedication, framed by her humility and love of integrity in science that spanned her professional lifetime (so far). Now compare that to the Covid Dr's and the Plandemic Dr. 
There is in fact no comparison.
The credential it seems is not the defining characteristic for a powerful contributor, it is the person at the centre driven by a desire to do good for others. Dr. Kariko thank-you. Your contribution will live on I am sure in all of us who are vaccinated and i who knows how many more ways to come."
2021-04-08 23:38,"As I bow my head in thanks to Dr. Katalin Kariko and applaud her long overdue recognition, I am troubled to know many still unrecognized and undervalued scientists toil on our behalf -- until worn out. Her persistence and endurance recall those I worked with in biomedical research labs across the U.S.

Dr. Kariko's service to humanity has been transcendent, but thousands make similar sacrifices and share her struggles. A 2015 paper estimates only one tenure-track position in the US for every 6.3 PhD graduates in biomedical sciences. To continue research, the rest must seek for profit work, lower-paid temporary 'post-doc"" or adjunct positions as Dr. Kariko did.

Since Dr. Kariko moved to her job at Temple, the number of postdocs in biological and biomedical sciences more than tripled to exceed 40,000. In the 1990s, I joined fellow postdocs warning NIH that we needed livable stipends (many earned less than their age) and more funding opportunities. Stipends grew and more grantees were funded for a time, but stagnation resumed.

I left the lab to serve humanity elsewhere. Many in my cohort also left laboratory research. Our extensive training helps us succeed individually. Is that enough for people who were inspired to serve the world?

Dr. Kariko's odyssey should remind us that experts cannot fully predict who will deliver the next breakthrough. And we will not know what we lack because the next Dr. Kariko needed to pay her bills, raise her family, and was lost to science."

Kudos to the NYT's for telling this story of this remarkable woman, who like the women of Hidden Figures, and so many others, have made the world better, while men get the credit. 

Hopefully she will now be compensated appropriately for the 35 years of being under paid."

2021-04-09 0:58,The biggest takeaway from this story is that the scientific community and funding agencies need to review how to better support unorthodox ideas. I wonder what other life altering discoveries are lying dormant and wasting away due to preconceived biases.
2021-04-09 1:14,Such a good article. I particularly appreciate the author's refusal to make a simplistic valorization piece. She takes the time to cite the valuable contributions of Cullis & Graham/McClellan.
2021-04-09 1:27,I hope she gets the NOBEL prize for medicine! She truly deserves it!

My faith in humanity is always restored with these articles. Thank you Dr. Kariko et al.

2021-04-09 3:05,We need to get much better at funding scientists with unconventional ideas. Too often grants are given to the conventional idea and the truly revolutionary idea is neglected because it doesn’t fit with the conventional wisdom.

2021-04-09 3:41,AMAZING!

Immigrants are a treasure to this country.My doctors are from Peru and Nigeria respectively and boy they are excellent. Another thing of note is that academia needs to stop going after shiny and trendy objects solely and invest in obscure science as well. There is a lot we will discover. Knowledge is power! Blessings to Dr. Kariko

2021-04-09 4:11,"Thomas Kuhn would be proud of this paradigm shifter. 

Can the right committee give Dr Kariko the Nobel for medicine please? It's the least the scientific establishment can do for her. I applaud her character, she was able to withstand the fools.

The entrenched politics of science are always in the way of visionaries, read Feyerabend on this  This woman is not only a great scientist, but Dr Kariko is a courageous visionary. 

If I were a grant reviewer I would start green lighting all the weird ideas.  Maybe we can get some more fantastic breakthroughs, lord knows we need them NOW. 

Phew! ... and now Meryl Streep will play her on Netflix, right?"
2021-04-09 4:39,"I value her passion and patience. For shame that a researcher can only make so much, but reality stars can contribute chaos and mayhem into society and make much more. I’ll take what she’s offering. Knowledge is a noble pursuit."
2021-04-09 5:11,"Hard to ignore the negative light in which the leaders of the ""scientific community"" are cast in this profile. What is being done to address potential blind spots in what research conventional wisdom sees as valuable?"
2021-04-09 5:22,Thank you Ms.Kolata and NYT for this in-depth story on Dr. Kariko. Both she and Dr. Weissman ( and no doubt many other scientists working with them) have paved the way to help fight not only covid-19 but many other diseases. Their dedication to the science and humanity is something to be cherished and supported. The Nobel Prize for their work is certainly well deserved.
2021-04-09 5:24,Such an incredibly moving article.  I have chills.
2021-04-09 5:56,"Thank you, thank you thank you.
As well as possibly saving my life this is a wonderful argument for both government funding of research and immigration."
2021-04-09 5:58,"Amazing work by all the scientists but especially scientists like Dr Kariko who persisted despite cynicism, disinterest and lack of funding. I worked in the biotech sector for a few years and it was dispiriting to see fascinating research languishing due to lack of funding while superficial nonsense like social media apps got billions of dollars from VCs and huge IPOs and buy-outs. 

If there is one small upside to this pandemic,I hope it's that we wake up to the importance of science and taking risks again and start to fund scientists doing work for the good of humanity, rather than easy-exit unicorn start-ups that enrich the 0.1% without any benefit to the majority."
2021-04-09 6:25,"In addition to Dr. Kariko's remarkable story, it would be interesting to learn more about the primary and secondary education that a generation of emigre Hungarian scientists received (many emigres flourished when they came to the U.S. especially in the biopharmaceutical industry).  What role did early education play in helping to develop and cultivate this creative scientific talent?  And what methods or techniques could we apply to our own early educational system to help foster this creative talent?"
2021-04-09 6:28,This is an amazing and inspiring story.  Certainly Dr Kariko deserves a Noble prize for her work.

2021-04-09 5:14,"From the room where I have been sheltering in place for just over a year, I am raising a glass to Dr. Kariko."
2021-04-09 5:52,"Kati, getting your science and you published in the NYT is the among the 3 best things that can happen to a biomedical engineer, or any scientist for that matter. The other two includes FDA-approved full prescription information of the drug that you conceived (i.e., physicians desk reference) and the Nobel. You're closing in on the third now, I hope. Funding should not be a problem any longer, whether at BioNtech or here. Back to your original concept of producing biologic drugs in the patients will certainly become reality. Gratulalok."
2021-04-09 5:00,"I thought my respect could not be topped until I hit the middle of this article when the neurologist related how she taught him to think properly. I was trained by my advisor in the very same way. Scientific experiments are supposed to be designed to fail by default and prove wrong of one’s hypothesis. Only from the cruel Nos by the Mother Nature can we learn with 100% certainly and eventually figure out the real science behind. On the other hand, many people in research these days start from an “engineering (here as opposed to scientific)” approach by designing fluffy experiments to prove themselves right. Except, you can’t be certain that you are right, ever! The logical fallacy is, “it is possible therefore it is”. Any future one single data point that does not agree with your theory can prove you wrong. That’s how science works. 

Worse than these “pretend scientists”. there are ones who even go one step further to cherry-pick the “good data” to support their “theories”, put a fancy new name tag, get published in big journals, and get lots of grants money. They swim in the status quo, and can only be called scientific workers at best, instead of real scientists. 

I am so happy this piece is not only celebrating a true scientist, by also her rigorous, scientific way! Mad respect!"
2021-04-09 8:55,Has there ever been a more humble or more exceptional person for the world to thank and acknowledge? Let's hope that she is at least their first choice for a Nobel Prize!
2021-04-09 4:23,"Sexism stifled this scientific development. The technology could have been carefully studied and fully understood by now. I feel we were left behind because men simply wanted to keep women in ""their place""--especially in the scientific community. It is absurd it took a pandemic and deaths to take this woman's work seriously. Shame on her male colleages and on the academic institutions who failed to fund her. They owe her a public apology."
2021-04-09 10:09,"With all of the hype, there is no almost no mention of the mRNA in the clinical trials. It IS the basis for the incredible success of mRNA in the studies. The Nobel prize in chemistry or whatever, should be hers. This is the beginning of a major redirection of effort in technology."
2021-04-09 10:26,"As a computer scientist, I feel unworthy to share the title 'scientist' with this type of people. Most of modern computer science is only used to strengthen capitalism and oppressive regimes. Hats off to her and real scientists like her!"

2021-04-09 9:18,Great reporting on the world's medical science sucess for the Covid war. And to think how in recent times Donald Trump news and science are 'Fake.' Best to learn right the living journal / journey of and for loving realities to enjoy the messages well.
2021-04-09 11:39,"I read this article three times in order to really appreciate Dr. Kariko’s struggle to conquer the unknown and to overcome the scientific establishment, which failed to recognize how important her discoveries were.  She never earned more than $60,000 a year!!   The importance of immigrants to this country is once again brought to the forefront.  I keep thinking that maybe on of those little children alone at the border might be the person who grows up to conquer cancer!!!"
2021-04-09 11:59,"Wow! Her persistence is mind blowing! I went through school with her daughter, Susan, always thinking it was cool that her mom was a scientist but not really knowing all that it entailed. It’s crazy to read this article and see the time line or how she was literally changing the world while we were in elementary school!"
2021-04-09 11:55,"This sentence sums up what made her work exceptional: Kate’s genius was a willingness to accept failure and keep trying, and her ability to answer questions people were not smart enough to ask.”"
2021-04-09 11:50,"Funny how chance meetings, and dogged determination, can sometimes save the world."
2021-04-09 12:22,"This is why I discouraged my daughters from pursuing careers in biology. I'd read too much about how women, especially, are demeaned and diminished by colleagues, how innovation if stifled by other scientists--the very people who are supposed to be pushing the boundaries of knowlege--and how salaries are low and careers contingent on a grant process that can be arbitrary and capricious. It's a good think Dr. Kariko didn't care about conventional success because she loved her work so much and found it so compelling. But it's a shame that people with truly innovative ideas are often the ones who struggle most at finding and keeping support. 

I'm thankful for the colleagues who kept giving Dr. Kariko a bench, but sorry for a world where someone who builds a tech game can become a billionaire while the scientist who helps pave the way for a life-saving vaccine that rescues us in a pandemic tops out at $60K a year."
2021-04-09 12:32,"Big pharma should be taxed and research money granted by lottery. Humanity cannot wait out the amortization time of private interest. 
Now imagine that the same scientific establishment who were against Kati is criticizing all non US vaccines right now."
2021-04-09 12:56,She is an inspiration to us all. Diversity and inclusiveness benefits everyone. More girls need to be encouraged to pursue STEM careers. One of the founders of BioNTech is also a woman.
2021-04-09 13:21,"Resilience and perseverance in the face of apparent failure, tirelessly striving in her belief in mRNA and just a little mention of her work as the foundation of the vaccine. It’s unfair. She ought to be nominated and awarded for her work. An inspiring story."
2021-04-09 13:57,This article provides profound insight into how the science community addressed the coronavirus pandemic. Thank you!
2021-04-09 12:56,"Dr Kariko deserves tenure and financial security.

Many options, she can be awarded tenure at one of the several  institutes for advanced study and/or a long term consulting position at one of the pharmaceuticals that benefitted from her mRNA research.  200K/yr plus RSU's is a drop in the bucket for them. 

Is she and her colleague a candidate for a  Nobel prize?"
2021-04-09 12:58,"Thank you, Dr. Kariko, and all the others who made these vaccines possible."
2021-04-09 14:10,"Let's hear it for basic science and the thousands of dedicated professionals who toil in obscurity.  They shouldn't have to do it in penury as well.
      Did you ever get the impression that as a society, we have our priorities and our idea of celebrity upside down?"
2021-04-09 14:34,"This is an excellent profile of Dr. Kariko and is well-earned!

It's excellent that she is getting recognition for the work that she did in relative obscurity (outside of the circle of RNA scientists). I would love to see more profiles of others who contributed to this work. Katalin has gotten a lot of attention in multiple publications, but hundreds of other scientists have contributed to the research that underlies mRNA medicines. Many of those contributions could be argued to be equally or more important - standing on the shoulders of giants is a virtue, not a fault, when it comes to scientific research.

Let us continue to celebrate these amazing discoveries by continuing to recognize people that have contributed to this field that is now suddenly saving millions of lives."
2021-04-09 14:36,"An inspiring article that I will send to our daughter, a 3rd year pre-med chemistry major.  It's so important that woman are equals in this field. It's clear Dr. Kariko brought something special.  Where men seem to often bring hubris, she brought humility, patience and extreme perseverance.  Let's hope there is a Nobel Prize in her future."
2021-04-09 14:41,"The way we fund life-saving science is laughable. We need direct, sustained, public funding of labs so these scientists can continue life saving research on a stable salary."
2021-04-09 13:01,"Calling Biden Covid fighting team of experts!! This is a wake up call to them. Imagine a powerful rich country like the US, totally messed up its pandemic reaction, thanks to an incompetent Trump administration. The Biden admin inherits a totally messed up system of diagnosis tracking treatment and prevention response.

Fast forward to April 2021. International travelers who were returning home to India were required proof of negative covid test result before they could board the aircraft. The test had to be taken within 72 hours. Guess what, these travelers missed their flight because CVS pharmacy could not deliver tests results in time. So they re took the test with another community covid testing site and they too could not deliver results in time for the postponed flight. Each test cost them $150 per person. Finally at the community testing site they were told they could take a rapid Rt-PCR rest for $400 each!! That is what they ended up doing to be able to catch their flight.

Speaking to an elderly physician, she remarked how a country like India with 1.3 billion people was successful in delivering test results on time, within 24 hours. And how it was able to vaccinate its population at the closest clinic. Here, in the US we traveled 40 miles north to receive a first shot. Mine is scheduled in Boston city which is almost 30 miles from where I live, even though we have a community hospital next door and another just 14 miles away. This is how messed up our system is."
2021-04-09 15:04,"Great story about how basic science gets funded. Or not funded. It only reinforces my believe that you must be resilient in the face of overwhelming, established dogma. Few of us are so persistent in pushing against the ""settled"" science. Most drop out along the way, as it can be a very isolated life. Here's to the good doctor! Let's do better by trying to prove our own theories wrong and challenging our own rigid assumptions."
2021-04-09 13:47,"Thank you for showing us how nRNA research has been going for decades all over the world.

The conspiracy crowd will have us believe it was mysteriously conjured up out of thin air in George Soros garage."
2021-04-09 13:35,On a webinar with University of Pennsylvania leadership it was surprising that they took great pride and credit for Dr. Kariko...talk about rewriting history!

Thank you for your years of work. 

Thank you."
2021-04-09 14:43,"When I have my first meal inside a restaurant, when I get together with friends and family indoors—and especially when I go to my next indoor concert!—I will thank Dr. Kariko. 

""Oh, it works,"" she said. Bless her. 

Bless her with cash and a Nobel Prize, in fact."
2021-04-09 15:22,Thank you Dr. Kariko for persevering and never giving up. You are truly an inspiration to everyone. I hope everyone will appreciate what you have done for humankind!
2021-04-09 15:30,"I'm glad the NYT finally reported on Dr Kariko since I originally learned about her research in the foreign press in December 2020. This article leaves out the fact that she began her research on mRNA in a lab in her native country, Hungary, in 1978.

By not widely reporting the history of this research, US media has performed a disservice to the US population. The public was led to believe that the Covid mRNA vaccines were developed ""very quickly"", which led to vaccine hesitancy in some people, when it was actually decades of research that led to the creation of these vaccines."
2021-04-09 12:22,"Let’s hear it for Dr. Kariko! Let’s hear it for immigrants who come to the USA to achieve their dreams! Let’s hear it for science! Let’s hear it for dogged focus and commitment! 

Can’t wait for the book, the documentary, 
the bio pic, the opera, the Medal of Freedom and the Nobel Prize!

Let’s hear it for Dr. Kariko! Let’s hear it for heroes!"
2021-04-09 15:39,"Thank you for this article!   We often assume that science is about persistence and inquiry but even science can tend to become hidebound from time to time.   An immigrant, a woman discovered this and she persisted."
2021-04-09 14:18,"As a fellow scientist, this article warms my heart! How many scientific breakthroughs have not happened because women and ethnic-racial minority scientists can't get funded from NIH or NSF?
 
#Fund women scientists #Fund Black scientists"
2021-04-09 15:59,"Along with many others on this thread. I agree that Dr. Kariko should be nominated for the Nobel Prize in medicine.  I am guessing she would welcome the recognition, which she richly deserves.  More important than personal recognition, it would represent an affirmation that creative, ""outsider"" thinking is so often the source of valuable, transformative change."
2021-04-09 16:20,Besides selflessly saving millions of lives Dr. Kariko has given us an invaluable lesson in persistence. We cannot thank her and those colleagues who believed in her enough.
2021-04-09 16:23,"So glad to have known this story. I hope system learns from her story i.e. society / govt supports research and people who work in it.

Some of the most important developments in science have come from research done many decades ago. Societies need to be patient for 50-60 years, even then some of the work may not  find commercial applications.

We are writing our own doom by rewarding short term."
2021-04-09 16:35,"""She grew up in Hungary, daughter of a butcher.""

So sad that so many famous people seem to have grown up with only one parent. Clearly, her parents raised an amazing daughter -- it would be nice to give credit to both."

Unless I am reading this wrong, she and her unwavering passion to develop mRNA into an effective therapy is in fact what will save us from this pandemic.  This should have been a front page article.  Instead I see it's the third article under the health section at the bottom of my digital copy.  Truthfully I only stumbled upon the article cause it was a bullet point in my morning briefing; really a bullet point???  I hope someone nominates her for a Nobel prize.

Dr. Kariko is an inspiration and role model for all of us, and especially for girls and women.

Science is a tough discipline that requires patience, persistence, devotion, tenacity, and outside-of-the-box creative thinking. Many scientists and researchers spend years, decades, their whole lives, working on their research to understand something better, come up with something new, refine something, etc. and not all achieve recognition for their contributions. It's a bittersweet moment to know that her hard work has culminated into such an amazing achievement -- a novel approach to vaccine creation and its success at quelling a global pandemic -- and that she's able to witness it firsthand. It's also absolutely amazing to see the global scientific community work together so collaboratively to come up with a solution. It's a reminder that we all benefit and achieve more when we work together united for a common goal. This has restored my faith yet once again in the power of science and its positive benefits to humanity, and I hope this allows us to remember to uplift our scientific community in both public acclaim and additional funding."

2021-04-02 0:18,I’m afraid that this pandemic is far worse than we believe. When you add in deaths where Covid is listed not as the cause of death but as a contributing factor the Covid pandemic reaches frightening heights indicating how close we were to extinction but for President Biden’s monumental vaccine effort.
2021-04-02 0:41,"God bless all the nurses, the doctors, the therapists of every type, and the pastoral care personnel - each of you has done, and continues to do, an amazing job caring for these patients.

I am so very glad to know that patients like these are getting the support they need. It's clear, even from this short article, how much of a difference this makes for the patients' physical and mental health and their quality of life.

What a blessing it to have hospitals offer the help and support that's needed, and that takes into account ALLL aspects of a person's life, including post-ICU symptoms and concerns about food security and employment. THIS is caring for the WHOLE person! Once you've saved someone's life, this is medicine at its finest."

Both also suffer from emotional and mental health trauma that includes an inability to focus, confusion and distress. Their long ICU stays and ventilators amid their drug induced sedation are black holes.

Oddly enough one had underlying physical health issues and the other had none."
2021-04-15 20:14,"Thank you for getting this information out to the public. I had never considered the possibility that I would not make antibodies.  I was fortunate enough to learn that this could happen shortly before my second dose of Pfizer. I hastily enrolled in a clinical trial.  Sure enough, I had no antibodies the day before my second dose.  We will see what it looks like in two more weeks.  Most likely, many of us who take serious immunosuppressant medications, and have for many years, will need to rely on everyone else to get vaccinated. Vaccine refusal and hesitancy mean that our pandemic will go on.  Get vaccinated and wear a mask as a favor to the immune compromised people in your life.  Until infection numbers drop substantially, some of us will not be able to return to “normal life” without substantial risk."
2021-04-15 20:33,I was on chemotherapy for two years for blood cancer and then when I got an my Pfizer vaccinations back in January and February I felt like I was very lucky.  Maybe for real luck I should just go back to playing the lottery.
2021-04-15 20:35,"Thank you so very much for this story. As someone with MS who takes a B cell depleting treatment, I have to depend on people getting vaccinated. I am vaccinated but likely have little protection, and I work in a very risky environment.  We need to spread the narrative that we get vaccinated for others, too."
2021-04-15 21:05,"Many transplant and cancer centers are not telling their patients this, and subsequently, some patients are assuming they're fully protected after vaccinations - and acting accordingly. Deaths & hospitalizations would surely be prevented if these centers would notify all their patients about the situation, and vaccination centers would ask as part of an enter/exit interview."
2021-04-15 21:10,"Wishing for very reliable and easily available antibody tests. Meanwhile, even though I am fully vaccinated, I cannot risk bringing home germs (including covid) to a spouse who was still having chemo at his first covid vaccine dose and barely out of  chemo by his  second Pfizer dose. Gotta test those antibodies and continue to live restricted lives until we have some clearer answers."
2021-04-15 21:14,"""It’s unclear how many immunocompromised people don’t respond to coronavirus vaccines. But the list seems at least to include ......Remicade, a popular drug for treating inflammatory bowel disease.""

Very interesting article, especially the study they cite on IBD that compares Remicade (a systemic immuno-suppressant) with Entyvio (a GI-specific immuno-suppressant.)

Not a doctor but I'm a little skeptical about the implications for Remicade, given that they say they don't know whether the lower antibody levels for Remicade patients actually means increased risk of infection.  And also that they were not measuring T-cell responses to immunizations.

In fact, a number of articles in the IBD world have said there's no increased risk of COVID infection, or adverse outcomes, in people on Remicaid-like meds (TNF inhibitors.)  And they've even talked about using TNF inhibitors as therapeutics, since it would presumably help prevent an escalating inflammatory cascade, if that were to happen in someone with multiple co-morbidities.

I'm on Entyvio myself, and have an antibody test Friday, then start my vaccines Saturday.  So I'll be interested to see how my system performs and will be doing antibody tests in 3 and 6 months (on my own.)"
2021-04-15 21:17,"It’s very unlucky for those people who the vaccines won’t work on. It must be very disheartening for these unfortunate folks to be reading that a significant chunk of Americans refuse to get the vaccine, for unstated, unknown reasons. 

Good luck to those people who are immunocompromised. Hopefully they are able to appreciate and enjoy their lives while this pandemic rages on."
2021-04-15 21:29,"This is exactly what we have been hoping.  Our daughter has Common Variable Immune Deficiency and will not produce the needed antibodies to stay safe even if vaccinated.  Our other family members are vaccinated but we remain isolated to protect her.  She receives protection from other viruses through immunoglobulin therapy but that does not yet contain covid protection.  We are very hopeful that monoclonal antibodies will be available and helpful for her.  Also to note, those who are immune compromised should contact their doctors and hospitals now and make sure monoclonal antibodies are available to them if needed.  Make sure your doctor knows exactly how and where to get the therapy and that all paper work is in order.  Time is of the essence if you come down with covid and you need all doors cleared and open in the first few days of having the virus.  Hopefully infusions of monoclonal antibodies will be available to provide preventative protection for our daughter as well as others who are immune compromised."
2021-04-15 21:29,"I recently read somewhere that mutations develop in the systems of people with weakened immune systems, where the virus often spends more time than in a healthier immune system. I couldn't understand what that meant as I would have assumed that if the virus got into a person like that it would either kill them or make them very sick, not just circulate and mutate while they remained largely asymptomatic. So are these the kind of weakened immune systems responsible for mutations, or is it some other kind of weakened immune system?"
2021-04-15 21:31,"Johns Hopkins has done great work on this with an ongoing study of organ transplant recipients.  News after dose 1 was not good, they are now waiting on dose 2 results. 

A key issue is that testing for the antibody caused by the virus v. antibody generated by the vaccine (protein spike) are two different tests.  Weill Cornell in NY for example does the former but not the latter.  It's hard for an immune compromised person to understand the vaccine effectiveness without being able to test that.  Even CityMD which says they have the latter tests only report a binary result (yes/no) and not the level which is key."
2021-04-15 21:36,"Thank you so much for covering this.  I have a rare autoimmune condition and I entered a study to measure antibody levels at various intervals after COVID immunization.  I knew that I might not have many antibodies on board since I've been on Rituxan.  I wasn't expecting virtually no immunity, though.  That's what I found out a couple of weeks ago. 

My initial euphoria about maybe having sufficient immunity from the vaccine quickly evaporated after I got the news.  Even though I know it's not the end of the world, it does change the way I was hoping to move in the world, post-vaccine.

I'm looking forward to the day when I can walk around freely, sun in my face, without the thought of contagion clouding my joy."
2021-04-15 21:46,"Thanks for this informative  article that I plan to share with two friends who are immune system compromised, one due to transplant and the other blood cancer. I'd like to know, though, how people who have cancer histories, but are not currently in treatment, fare. Prior to cancer I never got sick (except for cancer, ironically) but five years post treatment I get sick very easily. What information has been gathered for people in my situation? I will get my second Pfizer dose on Saturday."
2021-04-15 21:47,"I am 15 years out from a renal transplant and on 2 diffferent immunosuppressants.  I made it a point to get vaccinated as soon as I could.  I was feeling very hopeful until I read about the Hopkins study on MedPage Today. I made arrangements to have an antibody test done and and it came back negative for antibodies.  The wind went right out of my sails.  I was in touch with a former HS classmate who is a pulmonologist and barely survived Covid himself.  He said I had a 50 percent chance it was a false negative. The test I had done was not the correct one and I needed the one that looked for the spike proteins.  That said, I have one scheduled in 2 weeks.  My fingers are crossed."
2021-04-15 21:51,"Why has there been no discussion about this? Public health officials and medical professionals need to start doing more to bring this important information to light and give the millions of autoimmune compromised people out there some guidance and recommendations.  The CDC still just says that ""no data are currently available on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people with autoimmune conditions.""
 As an autoimmune compromised person myself, I got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after asking my doctors advice. I was told the same thing most people have been told:  Just get whatever vaccine you are offered as soon as you can. 
If autoimmune compromised patients should be prioritized for the two shots and ""optimally timed two doses,” and then have their antibody responses measured, then doctors and public health officials ought to be aware of this and making patients aware of it."
2021-04-15 21:52,"I’m feeling so fortunate that I didn’t begin taking Ocrevus, an MS drug that’s a variant of Rituxin. I was debating it, but once the pandemic hit, I told my neurologist that there was no way I was going to start an immunosuppressant. I am worried for two friends who take Rituxin. I told them both to go get antibody tests."
2021-04-15 21:55,"I'm deliberately immunocompromised due to lupus and multiple immunosuppressant drugs. I live in Maine, and am fortunate that I'm also 61, because they decided to distribute the vaccine based on age, even though t he state website indicated kept was following the national guidelies.

I get my second shot tomorrow, so hay me. But what about those who are younger than me, who are still waiting and can't even step outside their houses because their conditions are far worse than mine. This makes me so angry."
2021-04-15 21:58,"The immunocompromised, including me, face an uphill battle until we reach herd immunity. No one chooses to have cancer or any of the many other illnesses that compromise the immune system. But the healthy anti-vaxxers do have a choice. By getting vaccinated themselves they can choose to save the lives of others, including their neighbors and family members."
2021-04-15 22:09,"Not a dr but I believe that the immune system rebounds six months after Rituxan treatment ends. I had four weekly infusions in September 2019 to treat a b lymphoma. I recently had a spike antibody test sponsored by the Leukemia Society and scored as high as they measure, greater than 250 (Anything over .80 is a positive response to the vaccine). Not bragging, just concerned that some folks will panic if they’ve been treated with Rituxan."

2021-04-15 21:23,"I appreciate the coverage of this important issue. However, I find the article confusing and hope that the author or knowledgable commenters can provide clarification.

The studies cited here and linked to (which I went off and attempted to read) seemed to be focused on single vaccine treatments or single infections of the disease. Thus, after one vaccine or covid infection, an immunologically compromised person shows almost no immunological response. However, the study of the patients on Remicade reported that ""Seroconversion rates after a single-dose of either vaccine were higher in patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine."" 

It seems to me that following the two-dose regime, yields a non-insignificant protection. I wish someone could tell me how much-- maybe it was buried in the paper. The tone of the article and its headline suggests the contrary: no protection from vaccines for the immuno-compromised.

I realize that this  still a research question, but can anyone provide greater clarity here? Thanks in advance."

A few days ago my husband and I received our second Moderna shots and we have been joyfully anticipating going back to work, seeing our friends again, having our kids participate in camps with their friends this summer... I feel like all of that has just been wiped away from us - now forever.  We did all of this to protect our husband until he could be vaccinated, thinking once he was vaccinated, an end to this nightmare would be in sight, and now vaccination isn't even enough.  It seems hopeless.  We love him and we thought we could keep him safe.  But when people respond with, ""sadly, bad things happen to good people"" - basically, ""oh well"" - it's really disheartening.  This man is the soul of our family.

So, here we have an article that tells us monoclonal antibodies are the answer, and mentions immunglobulins.  Not a word about the cost and what a person would have to do to get insurance coverage.  Why is cost so often ignored when a pharma product is discussed?"
2021-04-16 6:30,"This is distressing news, I am on a B-cell depleting biologic (Benlysta) and have been asking rheumatologists if my COVID vaccines would protect me and they have said ""no worries,"" when I knew it made more sense that I had no B-cells left to train to attack coronavirus. This story is confirmation of my concern. I will have to find a doctor who will pay attention. Even the American College of Rheumatology has not mentioned this concern to my knowledge, as I have been throwing this issue out there at them on Twitter for a few months. I will try again, and get an antibody test. Thanks for this story."
2021-04-16 7:03,"As a retired physician with indolent B cell lymphoma, now stable a year after last rituximab treatment, I was concerned enough about this possibility to get an anti-spike protein antibody test 2 months after my second Pfizer dose. No detectable antibodies. So I combed the literature and consulted experts. I could have saved time because this article reports clearly everything I found. Any confusion is because the data is partial. The good news is that the Regeneron cocktail may provide us a way to be protected. It is a bummer but not totally surprising."

Given that the Emergency Use Authorization documents say that there is no evidence that any of the vaccines prevents either infection or transmission, it would appear that they are primarily, if not exclusively, beneficial to people with compromised immune systems. Now you are telling us that they won’t work for many of them? Wow, thanks Emergency Use Authorization! Now we see why the official FDA approval process takes so much longer."

2021-04-16 12:48,"At 68, I have lived with rheumatic disease for over 50 years. At 60, my RA caused non-Hodgkin's-lymphoma (not the biologic I had been on for over 12 years). It was my misfortune to have a relapse of my arthritis with changes to my drug regimen about 6 weeks before my first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. I was on a different biologic and high doses of prednisone to get it back under control when I received the vaccine. 

This informative article is extremely helpful to me. I will follow up with a request for an anti-body test to see how effective the first shot is in producing anti-bodies and if there is a need to demand an earlier second dose. It is highly unlikely I will be able to get it within the recommended 4 weeks from the first, but I can be persistent. 

I live in Canada, where my provincial health system has delayed the second dose to 4 months to give more people a chance to receive a vaccine."

Then, I read that people with RA can also have the same issue, so I am getting one as well.  Although I am in remission and not taking any meds currently, I have  had it for over 40 years.  Still, I am grateful to have had both doses of vaccine..."

I'm in the Johns Hopkins study on the effect of the vaccine on transplant patients taking immunosuppessant drugs.  I was tested after my first shot of Pfizer for antibodies and tested negative.  I will be testing again one month after my second shot which is in a week.

I still have to live as if there was no vaccine, and I will gladly do so in order to stay safe.  When I see people who consciously make a decision not to wear a mask, or social distance, for whatever reasons, it shows selfishness.  I would never knowingly put anyone at risk for an illness that I may be carrying and why others are so selfish is beyond me.

People who are immunosuppressed are living a life where a simple cold could kill them.  Please, wear a mask, social distance because this could affect the life of one of your loved ones."

Nearly all had medical records and could have been spared if they'd had the care this knowledgeable doctor took of himself, regardless of vaccine availability for them or the general population.  One suspects uch of the tragic economic farce of recurring economic lockdowns - the insanity of doing the same repeatedly and expecting different results - might have been avoided if decent care had been taken of those it was obvious would need it."

It is worth noting that Imbruvica is being investigated as a possible covid treatment at Dana Farber, where I'm a patient, and at other hospitals as well. The fact that taking Imbruvica could be more of a benefit than a detriment in the battle against covid  should be mentioned in this article.

2021-04-16 15:48,"In France they are now giving immunocompromised people third shots to see if they get more protection.  Now that's my idea of a country being proactive in supporting people who are immunocompromised!  It is unlikely to hurt us to get third boosters, and may give many of us increased protection.  I get it that there is a limited supply of vaccines, but we all deserve a chance of being protected if possible.  
My oncologist told me I would have a weakened response to the vaccine, but he urged me to get it while I was on chemotherapy anyway, due to my high risk of complications from COVID.  I've been obsessively worrying about being only partially protected ever since.  
I'm aware there is a fair amount of scientific research going into this, but it's so frustrating to be told to continue sheltering while we wait several months or years for the research to be completed.    I don't think any current research in the US is looking at third shots in people with weakened immune systems, specifically.  I hope France is taking data."

Even with weekly infusions of immunoglobulins (the product I use is Gammunex C) I still am unusually susceptible to infections of various sorts & have a hard time getting over certain infections.  Then when I finally do get over one, it seems I just it for a different one.  

Since my diagnosis 20 years ago, I've changed my lifestyle to accommodate my special circumstances & reduce my risks. Which has meant eliminating a lot of kinds of social contact in everyday life, cutting WAY down on traveling & taking many little practical steps like no longer shaking hands or taking most public transport. But still, prior to COVID I was able to go out & be somewhat ""normal,"" albeit always with lots of wet wipes.  Since December 2019, however, I've been confined to home.

Fortunately, I have a high capacity for solitude & enjoy spending time alone. But not everyone does. 

I hope the NYT will do more reporting on people with both primary & secondary immune deficiencies. If only because more public awareness of these conditions might lead to greater social acceptance. Not everyone who appears to be a germophobe or physically standoffish is being anal & over the top. Some of us have to take what appear to be excessive  & silly precautions because our lives depend on it."
2021-04-16 17:05,"Thanks for finally reporting on this. It’s been hard to explain to friends and family that being vaccinated does not yet mean I’m protected. Some have regarded our continued precautions as unnecessary over-reactions. It’s nice to finally have the Times article getting the word out. Even more important, a lot of people who are not adequately protected by the vaccine are finally getting this information, which might save their lives. Thank you, thank you NYTimes for reporting on this. Please continue to cover what is happening in the lives of immunocompromised ppl during this pandemic."

The vaccines can not be counted on to be the only solution.  It's not even known if they prevent transmission or to what degree, how long protection lasts, etc.  But if you could just put on a mask and know the virus isn't getting through, regardless of what the people around you are doing, problem solved!"

2021-04-16 19:07,"Below in these comments, ""Cathy"" makes a useful observation: that so far, after approximately 77 million individuals have been fully vaccinated, there are only about 5,800 ""breakthrough"" infections. NBC reports ""In an emailed statement, a CDC spokesperson said the majority of people with breakthrough infections were not hospitalized, and 29 percent had asymptomatic infections."" And further: ""Seven percent of people were hospitalized, and 74 people died."" There are almost 1,300,000 people living in the U.S. with hematologic malignancies.  There are at least that many -- and likely considerably more -- with rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, lupus, and similar conditions which may confer a degree of immune suppression. As does multiple sclerosis; there are approximately 1,000,000 MS patients in the U.S. That's almost four million people -- not taking into account other pertinent categories -- who will have been high on vaccine priority lists, with millions likely among the 77 million fully vaccinated. If there was significant risk for vaccine breakthrough among these people, we should have seen a signal before now more notable than 74 deaths and a few hundred hospitalizations. Numbers may be incomplete, and I do not mean to minimize the risk of immune compromise or to suggest that we should relax good habits of social distancing, masking, etc. But in advance of more significant findings, headlines that begin ""Vaccines Won't Protect Millions..."" do none of us any favors."
2021-04-16 13:51,"Sounds like there are a lot of statistics yet to be analyzed. 
As a culture we aren't ready to talk about suicide or why people suicide. Even the so-called professionals can't handle topics like untreated pain or legitimate end-of-life issues, they're all about finding greater joy in the moment given that in the moment a person is stable.
The mental health system crashed during the pandemic. At one point there was a twenty minute hold for the crisis line (I gave up, went to bed and cried, but it would have been easy at that point to have given up permanently).
If there does turn out to be an increase in suicides among adults of color, I'd assume poverty plays a part. It's harder to access mental health care when one's poor, even if culturally one feels it's an appropriate option. Financial hardship keeps you closer to the edge where struggle seems futile. Suicide's about losing hope. For some of the folks who were already suffering, the pandemic was just that one last push..."

I let my young grandchildren see the scenes of the Capital insurrection, explaining that they're going to remember that day, but there's an unspoken understanding that I'll change the channel when I find them watching, mesmerized by the other dismal news that they're not ready to understand, but unable to ignore."
2021-04-16 14:42,"The 5 percent decrease is surprising but that people of color were more adversely affected is not. 

Lockdowns increase general psychological distress and along with social isolation, anxiety, and loneliness are perfect factors for growths in suicide rates. 

That people of color more severely feel the economic and social consequences of pandemics, inequities in health care, and inaccessibility of vaccines and treatment is alarming, not new, and should be a focal concern for local leaders and professionals.

Synthetic opioids (primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyl) appear to be the primary driver of the increases in overdose deaths, increasing 38.4 percent from the 12-month period leading up to June 2019 compared with the 12-month period leading up to May 2020."""
2021-04-16 13:06,"Are the national suicide declines age-adjusted? Older people commit suicide at much higher rates and we had a pandemic killing older people at higher rates, so could the decline be attributed to older people who would have died by suicide dying by COVID-19 instead?"

For much of last year the right wingers warned that if the states didn't open the schools, drop COVID restrictions, and get everybody back to work, the suicide rate would skyrocket. Meanwhile, there's been a tendency among some on the left to make the same kind of threats, most notably in the arguments over medical treatment for trans kids. Few of these arguments are supported by solid data.

There is one issue in the culture wars where reliable, longterm data about suicide risk exists, and that is gun control. Having a gun in the house is associated with a jump in suicide risk. Until we get reliable data about other issues, however, suicide threats should be left out of political disputes. They are basically a form of extortion."

2021-04-13 17:18,"I am glad that they paused the vaccine to investigate. If they just kept going and people found out that they just ignored it, that would cause much more harm I feel.

Although technically it is only 6 of 7 million people who got it, since it is only affecting women 18-48, that reduces the denominator. I believe that women 18-48 should be barred(or at least highly discouraged) from getting the J&J until this is resolved. We have other vaccines, no need to cause that risk."
2021-04-13 17:18,"Thank you for this information. Unfortunately the CDC left an informational vacuum in their statement, the results of which will cause this pandemic to drag on longer than necessary."
2021-04-13 17:19,"Since the US keeps to a strict adherence to the booster shot schedule, the promised 25 million m-RNA vaccinations per week only really amounts to 12.5 million first vaccinations. This means that only 50 million first vaccinations will be achieved per month with the m-RNA vaccines. Janssen was supposed to provide 100 million doses by the end of May. So this halves the potential vaccinations that might have been achieved through the end of May.

Here in Cincinnati, Xavier University is not happy. They have vaccinated 2000 of their 5000 students with the Janssen jab. Now if they switch to the m-RNA vaccines, those students will be on summer break and not present on campus for the booster shot. So even a short pause is going to cause chaos."

I'm sure the science is better now (I know there are drugs now approved for cancer patients who have this condition), but its hard to fathom how they can determine this is caused by the vaccine as opposed to other (""idiopathic"") events."

2021-04-13 17:26,Pausing the J&J vaccine because of extremely rare instances of some people developing blood clots is a classic case of the public being provided with TMI.

2021-04-13 17:29,"These deaths are very unfortunate, but we need to have some perspective.  The incidence appears to be about one in a million.  Every drug on the market has at least a small incidence of serious side effects; it's a question of risk versus benefit. 

We should be guided by the principle of an abundance of caution.  But in view of the fact that hundreds are dying each day of Covid, it's not clear if a lengthy delay is really ""an abundance of caution.""  We should look at available data, but the prudent thing to do may in fact be to accept the tiny risk and proceed with vaccination."
2021-04-13 17:30,"For those who are critical of the pause: 

Understood that the number of people who have developed blood clots post-Johnson & Johnson vaccine is minuscule, especially in light of the number of those vaccinated.  So, yes, this side effect seems rare across large populations.

But if faced with a choice of vaccine, few if any of us would now choose J&J, and rightfully so.  

In addition, the similarity to clotting and platelet problems observed with Astra Zeneca warrants observation.

I think that the pause is entirely prudent and reasonable."

2021-04-13 17:35,"On one hand, the chance of dying from clots is lower than dying from covid if you remain vaccinated. On the other hand, the US has the luxury to pause or even not use the J&J vaccine because we have ordered enough doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to cover the entire population. Unfortunately this and the bad publicity received by the other viral vector vaccine by Astra Zeneca will cause some people in lower and middle income countries to avoid these vaccines where the only alternative to not getting one of these vaccines is to not get a vaccine at all and risk getting covid instead."

Everyone should give their primary a heads up if they’ve had the J&J jab, and discuss concerns with their doctor.

Good luck all, and well done doing your part."
2021-04-13 17:43,Simple fix — give young women the vaccine from Moderna or Pfizer. People are acting as if it’s be ridiculous for young women to not want J&J after hearing this...we have alternatives that are better for this demographic so just give them the alternative.
2021-04-13 17:45,"I took the J&J shot, and actually sought it out.  I didn't have any side effects (I'm a 57-year-old woman) except a little soreness on the arm.  I'd take it again.  I think it's perfectly safe."
2021-04-13 17:39,"This unfortunately adds more complication to the J&J vaccine saga, as at the news conference today Marks indicated that virtually all the J&J vaccine is produced in the Baltimore plant now closed.

So despite all assurances to the contrary offered today, it can't be the case things are just going to roll along at the pace previously indicated, with 100 million doses now paused from both production and risk factors combined.

Fuzzy math for sure."
2021-04-13 17:50,"It is reassuring to see the correct science applied in the correct places via the correct methods.

This halt is a conscientious response to a side effect that occurred during an “emergency authorization”. May have been exceptionally rare, but there seems to have been one death. Now they go back and review the data. See if there might be other cases.

Then they decide how to proceed.

(Sigh of relief.)"
2021-04-13 17:51,"After raising such a risk, Federal health officials should also give those who have already received this vaccine some practical guidances as to how to alleviate/assess their own individual risks. 

For instance, is the risk higher for women of certain age groups and of particular genetic lineages? What symptoms should those who have had the vaccine look for? Also should those folks refrain from flying, snorkeling or diving for a period of time after the vaccination? Would normal preventive steps for deep vein thrombosis (such as taking baby aspirin, exercising regularly, and/or staying well-hydrated) also help to prevent this type of thrombosis? For our peace of mind, it would be helpful for Federal health officials to advise on such practical issues, rather than just collecting and analyzing statistical data."
2021-04-13 17:52,6.8 million doses administered?  6 cases of blood clots to date?  Still a winner!  'nuf said.
2021-04-13 17:53,"There have also been a number of cases of immuno thrombocytopenia (ITP), including the death of a 56 year old male doctor, who died of a brain hemorrhage, from the Pfizer vaccine.  

It appears the immune response from vaccination in some cases causes the body to attack its own platelets."
2021-04-13 18:01,"Ethics people debate whether it is OK to administer a drug if it does harm even to 1 in a million patients. Other ethics experts weigh risks vs benefits and if the vaccine that kills 1 in a million saves 200 in a million others, then the benefit to the 200 outweigh the risk to the one. Germany feels the former position is correct.  However, anybody that accepts the former position would never take any vaccination, and in fact, they would not take most FDA or EDA approved medications.  This blood clot hold is an amazingly severe approach to a 1 in a million problem that smells like politics and legal liability considerations are outweighing rational risk-benefit analyses."
2021-04-13 18:05,"For all those saying the chance is one in a million, those are the cases that have been documented already. I received J and J a month ago and have had 2 horrible bouts of vertigo which now I’m wondering if it’s related.  This is absolutely worth our attention. The numbers may be higher. Hold back on your judgement."
2021-04-13 18:06,"It was mistake to pause the J & J shot because the negative publicity is worse than the risk, if any, of getting the shot. If it was only going to take a few days, as reported, then why not wait for a few days for potentially no announcement at all. I would bet more that 6 people of 6.8 million have died in car crashes on the way to get vaccinated. If causality is unproven, the damage is already done to public opinion."
2021-04-13 18:06,"Interesting that women of this age range are also the demographic most likely to be on birth control pills. I wonder/hope this correlation has been researched, as they also increase risk factor for blood clots (this isn't an anti-birth control comment at all, I know it's the best option for many women and can relieve other painful health issues etc)."
2021-04-13 18:08,"The risk isn't tiny looking at the bigger picture. News like this just reinforces those who are already hesitant or skeptical about taking a covid vaccine. They don't trust Big Pharma, the vaccines are only approved for emergency use, and some are opposed to vaccination, period.

The goal is to have 70-80% of the U.S. population vaccinated to reach herd immunity, so we can get back to something resembling normal life. If we fall way short, the virus will continue to mutate and be a big problem going forward."

2021-04-13 18:00,"Does the FDA understand math???
6 potential causes out of 7 million?

2021-04-13 18:03,roughly 0.00008 percent of people taking the vaccine have had this reaction.
2021-04-13 17:51,"Yes it’s a tiny risk with the JNJ vaccine. Still, given a choice of the three vaccines, which would you choose for yourself or a family member?"
2021-04-13 18:10,"I was medically retired from the military in my late 20s due to a blood clot which lead to a major stroke 4 days after receiving the anthrax vaccination and have chronic disabilities as a result. I spent months recovering. After exhaustive testing of all other causes over a year, those involved in my care refused report the vaccine to VAERS which tracks data of vaccine adverse reactions for what I believe were political reasons. Forgive me if I don’t believe the data that is reported is accurate. I am scared to death of the COVID vaccines."
2021-04-13 18:37,I'd rather the F.D.A. just share what they know and let each of us decide for ourselves whether we want to take the vaccine. Thanks.
2021-04-13 18:40,"I am completely pro-vaccination, and in fact received my Johnson and Johnson vaccine six days ago. I am also in the criteria of people that these blood clots mainly affect: young female. From my perspective, to see people shaming other young females for no longer wanting the Johnson and Johnson vaccination is entirely inappropriate. Why should young females experience this risk and anxiety when the US has an abundance of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines? It’s not just a blood clot, it’s brain damage, paralysis, death. Does it really matter how low the risk is of developing a blood clot when it could be avoided through a different vaccine? Many of the young adults who are getting the vaccine are doing it for the public good- not necessarily because they would be affected greatly by the virus. So the last thing I should expect to see is further shaming of young women seeking out a different vaccine if the Johnson and Johnson is unpaused."

2021-04-13 18:46,"Right, but now that you've splashed this ""news"" on the front page, you've given enough fodder for anti-vaxxers and the statistically-challenged populace to set back herd immunity for who knows how long. It doesn't matter if you're 16,000 times more likely to die from NOT getting vaccinated, people will see this and say, ""nope, not getting a vaccine!"""
2021-04-13 18:39,"I too was going to comment on how the willfully ignorant will glab  onto the J&J news to justify not rolling up their sleeves. But at a certain point you have to admit that any excuse or no excuse fails to counter the bewildering lack of social responsibility for a large segment of the population. 

Fatigue forces my reluctant “let them infect each other with the virus.”

Of course, that’s how a human might think. Covid can’t think and only ‘knows’ it’s host, and the next, and the next."
2021-04-13 18:43,"My appointment for tomorrow for the J&J shot has been cancelled unilaterally. I don't fret over one in a million odds, so I would have taken the jab if I had been asked. Why not ask?"
2021-04-13 18:31,"Women routinely suffer from inadequately tested or poorly designed drugs because researchers assume our bodies are the same as the average man's. Last month alone there was a Times article on how young women experience more serious side effects from the Covid vaccines because they are given dosages that were calibrated to men and older people. I am grateful to have received the vaccine, but I was horribly sick and unable to work for a week after each dose, and I can't help but wonder if that was really necessary.

While 6 deaths out of 7 million doses may be statistically insignificant, the fact that all 6 were relatively young women should serious concerns about medical sexism in the vaccine development."
2021-04-13 18:53,"This sounds like HIT, Heparin induced thrombocytopenia, which is a reduced platelet response to Heparin therapy. It is serious and deadly and we must make sure if this is in fact what is happening to our fellow human beings. We must investigate whether the clotting factor interrupted is the same in heparin, as the J&J vaccine."
2021-04-13 18:53,"From what I can gather, it looks like the risk of blood clots is extremely small but I think as time goes on the regulators will likely determine that this very small risk probably exists for all four of the vaccines mentioned, not just the J&J and Astra. 

I still plan on getting vaccinated when I'm eligible and in fact my preference is to get the J&J vaccine because of how well it seems to do with variants compared to the others.  

That being said, I would feel more comfortable if by the time I'm able to be vaccinated, the regulators had a clear understanding of the risks for all four of these vaccines and the health care professionals were able to communicate the risks and warning signs to look for as well as an understanding of the best treatment options if needed.  

Having a clear understanding of the risks is important to me as well as a trust that I could access suitable treatment options if there was a need to do so.  I think that would go a long way towards ensuring people remain comfortable with going ahead and getting the shot.  At least for me this is important."
2021-04-13 18:54,"I appreciate that the risk is low for the genera population — but it is not low for that subset of people predisposed to the immune responses that cause clotting and low platelets/hemorrhages. I would feel more confident if doctors could identify those people, so they can be monitored & treated appropriately, if necessary. As it is now, it just feels like a dangerous crapshoot."
2021-04-13 18:56,"There are times when ""an abundance of caution"" is counterproductive, and this is surely one of them. There are so many dangers connected with this decision, not the least of which will be a reluctance to take the J&J vaccine once it's deemed safe enough. And, of course, in the meantime, there will be far more illness and death as a result of less vaccines in circulation. Most commenters on this and related articles agree it's not a prudent decision. If only the CDC and FDA would realize what a colossal mistake this halting is."
2021-04-13 19:06,"Journalism (and especially cable news) lives by making the rare feel commonplace. The CDC ""abundance of caution"" messaging will scare an already jittery cohort and will reduce vaccinations which will cause far more unnecessary deaths from covid.  Six out of 7 million is a microscopic risk, lower than the risk of getting hit by a car or being struck by lightening. One of the consequences of the non-stop focus on the virus is we have lost all sense of relative risk."
2021-04-13 19:08,"I had the J & J vaccine and experienced immediate dizziness (a common side effect). Later I began having leg pain & other signs of poor blood circulation, including headaches and light-headedness, which I attributed to existing issues which were somehow exarcebated (but did not associate with the vaccine), so I recently had an ultrasound performed on my leg blood vessels.

With this vaccine information and the ultrasound results (which confirmed a problem but whose details I don’t yet know), I will see what my vascular surgeon says ... I just hope it’s not due the vaccine - the last thing I need given that I already had blood/vascular issues."
2021-04-13 18:49,"Wow.  The headline reads like an editorial. ""J&J Vaccine and Blood Clots: A Risk, if It Exists, Is Tiny"" - Is the Times taking the word of the manufacturer here?  

In my small Italian circle, there have been two deaths after receiving the vaccine (vs. on Covid death.)  I am not anti-Vax, but if you want to continue eroding people's confidence in the vaccines, please - continue to dismiss the risks.  

The sad fact is that all our world governments have signed deals where none of the raw data is available for research purposes - so none of us, not me, not the NYT's - not even the NiH, the CDC, or the WHO have access to the data needed to do much more than accept the word of those who stand to profit from the vaccines.  

Me?  I wouldn't touch the AZ orJ&J vaccines with a 10' pole.  I'll wait my turn for Pfizer - or hopefully, the not-for-profit Cuban vaccine."
2021-04-13 18:55,"J & J & astra zenika use similar technology.  & they are the 2 vaccines that have caused blood clots.  All of the women who go blood clots after receiving the J & J vaccine were women of mentuating age.  I wonder if that's true for astra zenika too?  perhaps something in these vaccines makes them dangerous for woman of mentruating age, but they're safe for men & older people of both genders.  That should be investigated."
2021-04-13 19:06,Maybe they were not the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and were some of those that got mixed up with the Astra Zeneca vaccine when they were being produced in the same factory. Maybe they need to check out when they were sent and where they were produced.
2021-04-13 18:56,"I understand that mRNA vaccines have not had cases of this specific disorder, but the low platelet issue which is also rare, is it related? or is it a a rare side effect that can be caused by many things like SJS? 

Also many women say their periods became extremely heavy post vaccine, is this related? is it being investigated? 

Thank god my health anxiety pushed me to get the 2 shot due to efficacy rates (which I know are not comparable, HA is not logical) or I would be spiraling..."
2021-04-13 19:20,"The risk of dying from a blood clot after receiving the J&J vaccine is six in 6,800,000 (6.8M). The world population is 7,900,000,000 (7.9B). If everyone on the planet got the J&J vaccine tomorrow, and if it is the cause of the clots, then 6,971 people would die from the vaccine.

Yesterday, Covid19 killed 8,803 people (according to worldometers).

We don't want anyone to die from vaccination, and we don't fully understand what the clotting issue is, so it probably makes sense to pause using J&J as long as the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) have not been implicated (which they haven't). OTOH, if this being in the news causes fewer people to get vaccinated, pausing it may be a mistake that will cause more overall deaths.

Now, your risk of dying either from vaccination or Covid19 depends on various demographic factors not accounted for in my math above. But, nonetheless, the risk of dying from the J&J vaccine is really, really, really tiny.

Like, if I knew there was a 0.0000824% chance my car were going to explode every time I got in it and started it, I would not be at all nervous about starting my car everyday for the rest of my life. I'm way more likely, even accounting for my age demographic, to choke to death eating dinner tonight (5,051 deaths from choking in the U.S. in 2015 of which 2,848 were older than 74)."

2021-04-13 19:50,"It's fascinating how quickly our expectations can change. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use mRNA technology that has never been used in mass vaccination effort. Yet they have set such a high bar of efficacy and such a low bar of serious side effects that we cast aspersions on miraculous vaccines that ""only"" have 70 percent efficacy and cause one serious side effect for every million doses administered. In March, 2020, we would have celebrated these numbers as astounding.

But, hey, this is what human progress is all about. Keep pushing those bars higher. While we can all play armchair medical scientists, I doubt that any one of us would want to be one of those patients with a deadly blood clot. 

Having said that, given how so much of the world is lacking access to any vaccines while undergoing another wave of COVID disease and death, we should allow different countries to formulate their own risk tolerance."

I read where a big chunk of the military is refusing to be vaccinated. I'm old and I got the Pfizer vaccine. The surge of cases now is in younger folks. If the 30-40-50yr olds get sick because they refuse the vaccine, their children are going to start getting sick. Will that generation ever be able to put 2 and 2 together?"
2021-04-13 19:39,"It appears as though this was something that came up in J&J clinical trials:
statnews 4/13:
Arlett did say that, in clinical trials of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, there had been “an early sign” of an increase in venous thromboembolism. Two days later, the EMA said that it was investigating the clots. J&J said its investigations had found “no clear causal relationship” but that it is working closely with experts and regulators to assess the data. That early, but inconclusive, sign had also been noted by the Food and Drug Administration in its earlier review of the J&J vaccine as something to monitor."
2021-04-13 19:47,"Pausing a vaccine is a very serious issue given the usual behind the scenes pressure from the Corp(J&J),FDA,and the politicians/lobbyists.For each reported case there are many more yet to be reported.Astra Zeneca is also struggling with its product.Before we believe everything is safe please remember the propaganda we were fed in early 2020 saying don't worry about COVID."
2021-04-13 20:04,"There may be more people than we think. A relative of mine got blood clots two weeks after the J and J vaccination. When he raised the issue in the ER, that the vaccine might have caused it, the doctor dismissed the possibility, so no one was informed until today."
2021-04-13 20:28,"It would be helpful if we could ask smarter questions in looking at the data before we say the risks are ""very low.""

Thus far, the majority of the vaccinations in Europe (for AstraZeneca) and the US (for J&J) have been aim at the older population which is at much lower risk of clotting. Therefore, based on the older population we deduce that the risk of clotting for both vaccines are ""very low."" Fine.

But now let's expand the population to include much younger people and suddenly the risks aren't as small as before. The UK also thought that clotting risk for AstraZeneca impacted just a small number of people until health experts got around to counting properly.

If a certain drug kills 100% of a subset of people, you don't claim it's safe just because only 2% of people died at a rate of 100% while the other 98% were perfectly fine. Let's ask some serious questions, please."
2021-04-13 20:37,"So, what is the rate of blood clot formation in recipients of the pfizer or moderna vaccines?  Is this really an unexpected observation?  Or is this an example of unintended consequences?  

Maybe there is a good reason why it normally takes 5-10 years to develop and deploy a safe and effective vaccine."
2021-04-13 20:38,I got the J&J last week and am doing just fine. I was v happy to get that one in particular so I didn't have to return to the Oakland Coliseum and wait in my car for 80 minutes.
2021-04-13 20:50,"With regard to COVID-19 vaccines 'an abundance of caution' is the reason for desperate Emergency Use Authorization.

Phased clinical trials showing safety, efficacy and durability are on-going.

COVID-19 is still mostly mysterious unknown and  asymptomatic stealthy beyond the understanding of our best health. medical, science and technology professionals."
2021-04-13 20:58,"The FDA published its safety findings on the Johnson and Johnson vaccine before the final approval of the EUA was given in late February. The data was available to the public as well as the Agency's advisory council. 

It is not surprising that after vaccinating millions of Americans that the same issues have arisen as have with the AstraZeneca vaccine because both vaccines use the same platform--an attenuated adenovirus delivery system. 

To my knowledge this is the first time we have mass-inoculated humans with this type of platform. 

The mRNA platform  (the basis for Pfizer and Moderna) was used previously back in 2014 against Ebola virus and it was very successful with an excellent safety profile.

We need to look at the J and J's adverse events in the data presented to the public and see what was presented. I suspect these adverse events were present but highly infrequent. 

This all comes down to benefit-risk assessment. the J and J is a 'one and one' deal and has fairly good efficacy and may be more potent against the viral mutants. More data and more careful analysis must be done before people panic about its emergency use authorization at this juncture."
2021-04-13 20:59,"If this correlation proves out, it's unfortunate for the J&J vaccine. By itself, it's a miracle with high efficacy and probably extremely low incidence of serious side effects. Fewer than one in a million with blood clots and low platelets is still far superior to the risk of death (1-2% on average with significant age variation) and serious illness (2-10%) from the coronavirus. Seatbelts save many lives but also kill a few unfortunate people every year (and we're not banning them). 

It's also possible the risk of clots affects predominantly pre-menopausal women. That means males and women outside childbearing age might still get the vaccine without particular concerns. And even those afflicted mostly recover with prompt treatment.  

But it's harder to use a vaccine when alternatives appear to be safer. Oral poliovirus vaccine (a live attenuated virus) was withdrawn in the US in 2000 to prevent very rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio, and was done at a time when wild polio cases in the US were extremely rare. A killed virus vaccine (the Salk vaccine) has since been used in its place, while the oral vaccine is still widely used throughout the world.

We can probably do without the J&J vaccine if we have to, but it will slow our rate of immunization. It also means we'll need to use masks and social distancing for longer."
2021-04-13 21:07,"The medical/scientific community is walking a thin line on this.  To the extent it cares, a version of the Hippocratic oath says ""do no harm.""  This can be interpret to prohibit the balancing act of saying ""sure some people may die from the vaccine, but more lives will be saved by protecting people from death from COVID19.""  In addition, as some of the comments here demonstrate, the public shies away from vaccines altogether if the government allows a useful medicine with an unpredictable side effect of death to be marketed.  The United States has been more cautious than other countries, to its credit.  The decision the FDA and CDC made to suspend temporarily use of the vaccine until they understand the cause is the right one."
2021-04-13 21:09,"If one does not get the vaccine one will almost certainly get COVID sooner or later, given how contagious the new variants are and how many people will refuse the vaccine, making herd immunity difficult to achieve.

The rational person weighs the risk of the vaccine vs the disease and decides accordingly. Maybe choose one of the MRNA vaccines instead of J & J if one is a female under age 60."
2021-04-13 21:10,"The problem is not with the vaccine.  The problem is in our- humans, Americans- ability to understand and accept relative risks.   The vaccine may not be ""totally"" safe, but it is way safer than not getting vaccinated.

One person died out of 6.8 million.  How many of the 6.8 million would have died of Covid if they had not gotten the shot?  Clearly in the hundreds or thousands (I haven't done the math), given that over a half million of our 330 or so million population has died of Covid.  Which is worse: 1 or thousands?

Of course, if there were an infinite and immediate source of other vaccines, we should use them.  But there isn't.

The real reason the J&J shots are being halted is our irrationality when it comes to understanding relative risk."
2021-04-13 21:19,Charles Cooke at the National Review has a great take on the FDA's decision. '(the FDA...made a judgment about the appropriate response to those facts that should by rights be reserved to our elected officials). What do our elected politicians say about this decision?

2021-04-13 21:30,I experienced vertigo a day after receiving the J&J vaccine.  Three days later I broke out in hives and became very light headed.  The lightheadedness continued for two more days.

2021-04-13 21:34,"The sample is small as side effects are so rare but the correlation seems obvious. Young women who take the pill and/or smoke and are thus at elevated risk for blood clots to start with, should try to get the Moderna and the Pfizer, and not AZ or J&J.

One of the risks of many forms of BCP is blood clots, though usually not the type in the brain reported here.  Nonetheless, it may be that women on BCP should not take the J&J or Astrozeneca vaccine, given that alternatives are available.  It may also be that women of childbearing age in general should take a different vaccine.

Overall, though, it seems that the risks of covid are sufficiently high that withholding the J&J vaccine completely may be inappropriate, and cost many more lives than might be saved."
2021-04-13 21:41,"Further information needs to be released as to whether these women were on the pill or other hormones.  Since the pill has significant blood clot chances, vaccinating enough women on the pill would coincidentally coincide the clots from the pill with the vaccine.  It might be simple enough to tell people to take a baby aspirin for a few days after getting vaccinated.  Or at some point it may be decided that the risk is worth the benefit."
2021-04-13 21:54,"You repeatedly say six cases of blood clots instead of six REPORTED cases - and that's not counting cases REPORTED in Europe. There is no way to know the true number of cases of this or any other AE associated with vaccination, but it is clear that vaccination is not risk-free. And though it might be an ""incredibly small"" number of cases vs number of injections, the AE is NOT small to the people affected, especially those who died. Who is willing to take a non-epidemiological view and accept that people who get serious AEs and/or die are not just collateral damage?"
2021-04-13 21:56,I don’t get it.  The risk of dying from an allergic reaction to anesthesia is far greater than the incidence of these clots.  We don’t stop surgeries. No one ever expected perfection.  There are people dying every minute from opioids and we stand by and watch.
2021-04-13 21:58,"There are a few posts saying one needs to do the math.  I have just done the math (exact numbers are hard to come by), and very very roughly, the math is this.

The chance of a young woman dying of Covid-19 is around 4 in 100,000.

The chance of a vaccinated young woman getting a serious blood clot from (maybe) the AstraZeneca vaccine is around 2 in 100,000.

The chance of a vaccinated young woman dying from the blood clot is around 0.3 in 100,000.

So, the virus is riskier, but not by that much.  The risks are within about 10-fold of each other.  Given that, although both risks are small, it seems to me prudent that young people take a different vaccine.

Again, these calculations are rough, partly because the exact numbers aren't known.  I could easily be out by 5-fold."
2021-04-13 21:59,"Approx one month ago, a close friend, in Irvine, CA received the Moderna vaccine and developed puffiness at one eye.  1-2 weeks of antibiotics did not help, resulted in surgery and is now blind in one eye.  The CDC arrived at the hospital in Irvine to investigate.   Why is the public not hearing about these cases?"
2021-04-13 22:21,"There is very good evidence about the number of lives saved by vaccines, and one can predict the number of lives lost by withholding the vaccines. Causal links between blood clots, birth control, smoking, and sitting for a long time in airplanes, etc. are well documented - and appear to be orders of magnitude greater than the J&J risks, if any. Finding plausible causal links for extremely low probability medical events is next to impossible. Far greater is the risk of news-media fanning anti-vaccine sentiment that will lose lives."
2021-04-13 22:25,"Last I heard from UK, people under age 30 are being offered the Pfizer vaccine, in order to lower clot risks, while older and elderly continue using the Astra Zeneca.  UK does not have not have a large and steady supply of Pfizer yet, so they want to manage risk while also keeping the vaccination program going forward fast.  The pause for safety concerns was a big stumble and fed anti-vaccine anxiety and rumors."

It has been impossible to get medical help.  I have quarantined for last year and would like medical care."
2021-04-13 22:40,"I've read a lot of Twitter responses to the FDA/CDC tweet that downplay the risk and castigate the gov't agencies for implementing a pause.  However, I think it was the right decision 

While the risk of death by COVID may exceed the risk seen with this condition, that is a false equivalence since there are two other vaccines that can protect against COVID.  

The problem is that the hard-to-come-by numbers are a snapshot at this point in time.  What is not known is if this incidence rate of 6 per 6.8 million doses received in the US is the leading edge of more cases to come.  If vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), is anything like heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), it is not just a simple a run-of-the mill clot like a DVT and going home from the hospital with some anticoagulation.  HIT isn't a benign condition.  I don't think we want to be guessing what the final incidence may be of this condition...hence the probable reason for the pause to gauge new cases over time.  

I think this was the right course to take even though it will fuel the anti-vaxer's narrative that all the EUA vaccines are dangerous."

“Are rare blood clots associated with the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines?”

And states: 

“The F.D.A. has not found any similar cases in people who have received the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.”

But this is misleading, if not untrue. 

The medical term for blood clotting is “thrombosis” and if you search that term in the FDA’s Publicly available vaccine adverse event reporting database (aka VAERS) You will find hundreds of cases associated with the other Covid vaccines like Pfizer ‘s. 

Recently, Zhang et al. discovered that platelets expressed abundant ACE2- the receptor for the Covid spike protein. See Zhang S, Liu Y, Wang X, et al. SARS-CoV-2 binds platelet ACE2 to enhance thrombosis in COVID-19. J Hematol Oncol. 2020;13(1):120–41.

There SARS-CoV-2 was shown to directly induce platelet activation and aggregation and promote thrombosis-aka clotting. Since all the Covid vaccines induce spike protein it should really be no surprise clotting could be a serious Adverse event with vaccination. And a risk people being vaccinated be aware of."

And the risk of death from the virus is extremely low to begin with. But it is not ZERO risk; neither is walking down the street.

I understand that almost 7 million people received the JNJ shots and were okay.

I've been expecting this ever since the potential link of thromboses with AZN was announced, since J&J and AZN share the same mechanism. Have there been similar cases with other viral-vector vaccines like Sputnik or CanSino? 

A further breakdown and definition of the group most at risk would definitely help calm worries and aid better targeting vaccines."

Again, this is such a rare event and COVID-19 death is a higher likelihood that the risks outweigh the benefits. There is basically no free lunch.   Americans seem to be so okay with going out and opening up and risking getting CoV-2 (which I certainly understand) and then suddenly they're afraid of a 1/million risk? 

We've been looking into vaccine side effects. We don't like to talk about it since we're afraid it'll make us sound like anti-vaxxers and we don't have all the data, so there's no specific details here but the general view is that side effects for ALL vaccines are possible and could be dangerous both short and long term. On a molecular level, we do see potential interactions between the spike protein antigen used (in all three vaccines) and proteins in the body - will these interactions always occur? No.  But they are common to three all vaccines.

In terms of technologies, the adenovirus one has been around longer and been used in a greater # of people. There could be other exotic effects. It's always a risk v. benefit calculation."

These are reports of events that occur coincidentally with administration of a medicine, not necessarily reported by MDs, so one only has correlation, not causation.  Further, it is well known that media reporting of a particular event increases the number of that event being reported to the system, possibly overestimating risk.  Here, it is entirely possible that these events were unrelated but reported due to the publicity associated with the AZN vaccine.  Regardless, they are extremely rare events and the risk of Covid likely outweighs the theoretical risk of the vaccine.  There are experts in analyzing the AERS system - we should hear from them."
2021-04-13 23:16,"There were reports of thromboembolism events during the J&J clinical trials.  The number of these events were higher in the vaccinated group than the placebo one.  The reports did not specify what these events were.  There was one death among the vaccinated study participants who experienced a thromboembolism event.

There were also 3 deaths among the vaccinated in the Moderna clinical trials vs 4 deaths among the placebo.  There were 2 deaths in the vaccinated group vs 4 in the placebo group.  with Pfizer-BioNTech.  However the FDA briefing did no seem to indicate whether blood test or autopsies were performed  on the vaccinated who got sick and died.

The safety data for these vaccines were very slim or nonexistent during the clinical trials.  What is two months of safety data for vaccines?

It is clear from the beginning that they want the public to participate in this huge experiment. It is also clear that many are willing to use coercion in the form of vaccines passports  or job's dismissal to corral those individuals who resist or hesitate to take part."

2021-04-13 23:52,"A friend of ours passed away after getting the flu shot a few years ago.  Another friend of ours had such an adverse reaction to the flu shot, she can not longer get it because it's too risky for her overall health.

I was always afraid of the flu shot because of potential harsh and deadly side effects.  And then I got a really bad cause of the flu two years ago.  That changed my mind and made me a believer about that vaccination.

That is the same kind of mindset I've had about the COVID vaccination. I'm very concerned when I get my second jab next week because I had some moderate issues with side effects from the first jab.  But in the end, I am more fearful of getting COVID, especially at my age, than I am of any potential side effects from the vaccination.

I feel terrible for the families of the woman who died, the woman who is in critical condition and for the other four women who are suffering from blood clots from the J&J vaccination.  If it were my loved one who passed away or was suffering from this very rare form of blood clot, I don't know how ""caviler"" my attitude would be.

The older I get, the more sensitive my body becomes towards many medications.  But again, the top of my fear list is contracting COVID and my husband getting it from me.  That's why I continue to support the notion of getting vaccinated."

It's not really 6 clots out of 6 million injections, it's 6 clots out of however many of those injections went to women under the age of 48. This is likely a pool much smaller than 6 million, especially considering that many women under 50 still aren't eligible in many states. Also, there are likely additional cases that weren't reported, or connected, that will bubble up in the coming days now that this information has been made public. A pause makes sense.

2021-04-14 1:06,"1. This is probably easily handled. Find out who might be at risk, and give them a different vaccine if at all possible: it shouldn’t be terribly difficult, because it looks like almost all women under 50. 

2. All vaccines, drugs, treatments, whatever, carry risks. Generally, they’re pretty darn small. But the tiny size of the risk is exactly what makes it hard to identify until you give a vaccine to six million people or so. By the way, VAERS and V-SAFE? Tracking is exactly what they’re for.

3. Please just get vaccinated as soon as, and ignore the Junior Scientist types. Pretty much everybody I’ve seen on this thread who goes off a lot about spike proteins or whatever, or announces that they’ve averaged “death rates,” from this or that cockamamie source, or yammers about how J&J needed to this or that, is worthless. You can tell because of the tone of voice, and the constant errors, and the comoarison kf very different things. Either they’re an antivaxxer up to the same old games,mor some kind of a bot, or the kind of guy who goes off about oerpetual motion and the AESOP institute.

Odd but true: the one person I spoke to (yesterday) about the J and J vaccine she got (last Thursday) was telling me about the terrible headache she had in the days following- “stay in the dark, can’t go to work, pain like nothing ever.” Her doctor suggested Advil but she says that has never worked for her. Tylenol didn’t touch this however. After the headaches passed, both sides of her face swelled alarmingly - . She came to work, hiding swelling under a mask.

President Biden says that by July, we can have small outdoor gatherings, but in the meantime, we need to follow Covid protocols. The President also says the vaccinated can gather with other vaccinated people in small groups. Dr. Fauci tells us that the vaccinated should avoid travel and indoor restaurant dining while wearing masks in public. These are very weak incentives for people, especially younger Americans,  to get the vaccine and ignore the science behind vaccine outcomes."
2021-04-14 2:12,"The ""how common are blood clots?"" section is way misleading. 
The 300,000 to 600,000 number is the number of individuals diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in a given year (per the cdc). However, that number is entirely irrelevant because the vaccine recipients are not being diagnosed with DVT, they are being diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). 

CVST has an incidence of ~3-4 per million per year. Given the US population is ~330 million, meaning we would expect around 1155 people to be diagnosed with CVST in any given year. Based that data, about 3 cerebral blood clots occur in US population everyday. Even with several million people a day getting vaccinated, it would be really unlikely for these clots to occur in those who got the shots just by coincidence.

Also, don't forget that these individuals are not only being diagnosed with CVST, but thrombocytopenia as well. The incidence of thrombocytopenia 3.3 cases per 100,000 per year. The probability of a person presenting with both CVST and thrombocytopenia (assuming the two conditions are unrelated) is:
 3.3/100,000 * 3.5/1000000 = 11.55/100 billion ~ 1 in 10 billion per year. 

However, it is known that the CVST and thrombocytopenia are related in because they are both being caused by an immune response. And this is an entirely new condition called Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). And there is 0 incidence of anybody developing this just by coincidence, unrelated to the vaccine."
2021-04-14 2:36,"I’ll probably get castigated for saying this, but as a young woman who has already had covid and easily recovered (mild case last March, at the beginning of the pandemic), I really don’t understand why there would be a need for me to take ANY risks with these vaccines. I’ve had two antibody tests, one three months after I had the virus, and one this past February, and both indicated that I had antibodies present in my blood. I had a robust immune response from natural infection. So if I’m protected against the virus AND at extremely low risk of severe symptoms anyway, why would I get the vaccine, especially this J&J one? As far as I understand, it’s unclear whether the vaccines even adequately prevent me from spreading covid, or provide immunity to covid variants. So what is the point for someone like me? I wouldn’t even necessarily be protecting others any better than I am by wearing a mask (or perhaps less so.)

It seems to me that, in my case, the risks of vaccine AE and side-effects, however minuscule, would certainly outweigh the risks of not getting vaccinated, since not getting vaccinated carries no risks for me. The CDC says I should do so “because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19,” but they don’t even know how long or well you’re protected after vaccination, either, or if it’s any better or different than from natural infection."
2021-04-14 2:41,"As this article points out, researchers said that a similar disorder from the AstraZeneca vaccine appears to be caused by an extreme reaction from the immune system.... 
As someone with an autoimmune condition, I made the decision to get the vaccine (I got the J&J because that was what I was offered) but I did have some hesitancy and concerns, and I could understand how others in my situation would also. In terms of vaccine safety and and efficacy, there has been virtually zero discussion about people with autoimmune conditions. If anyone bothers to look at the CDC website, it says the following: People with ""weakened immune systems due to other illnesses or medication....may receive a COVID-19 vaccine. However, they should be aware of the limited safety data...Information about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people who have weakened immune systems in this group is not yet available...""
I am wondering when more data will be available for this group."
2021-04-14 4:00,"Yes, of course, anti-vaxxers will pounce.   However, isn't part of the vaccine campaign dependent on developing trust amongst the vaccine hesitant, by taking a closer look at this and any other issues that arise.  What's gained by glossing over a concern that may be statistically rare, but, personally devastating.  

Additionally, in some cases, people at big box store pharmacies have been offered the choice between Moderna, Pfizer, and J&J vaccine.  Don't they deserve the opportunity to make an informed choice? 

 Most of us have made medical decisions based on risk assessment.  We make these decisions assuming we've been given adequate information to the risk/benefit ration.  As I see it that's what's being done here."
2021-04-14 3:01,"Politically incorrect as it may be, the obvious way forward is to limit J&J vaccinations for now to the male population.   Women may not like it, but the way to look at it is that a male person who takes the J&J vaccine will be one less person competing for the mRNA vaccines.

People seem to forget that we are still in a public health crisis and must do the best we can."
2021-04-14 3:22,"I am learning that Americans, and especially the sort of educated ones, and especially the white guys, are having a very very very very hard time with the concept that they too are human, and that they too are vulnerable, and that their educarion and their privileges cannot cover them with an invisible Gardol shield against all harm.

I sympathize, kids, I am exactly the same.

And Gardol’s an oldie."
2021-04-14 3:23,"Federal health officials said the blood clots reported in the J&J vaccine are similar to blood clots detected in people who were immunized with AstraZeneca’s shot. European regulators said the clotting with the AstraZeneca is appearing at a rate of one in 100,000... and that's for everybody. The rate may be higher for certain demographic groups. 

I think everyone should vaccinated as soon as they possibly can. However, the FDA and the CDC were right to pause the vaccine here. The J&J clots are appearing up 13 days post vaccination and saying that these clots are ""one in million"" assumes that none of the 7.1 million already vaccinated will develop a clot during this week or next. We really have no idea what the incidence of this is here, but if we consider AstraZeneca's as the worst case scenario (1/100,000) then our worst case is already extremely close to risk of dying from Covid if you are 15-24 years old (1.5/100,000)... And I am sure a lot parents of 16 & 17 year olds and young adults would appreciate knowing if the likelihood of dying from Covid is almost equal to that of developing blood clots in the brain from vaccine (which may not kill you, but could leave you paralyzed or unable to speak for the rest of your life) for this group.

Again, very pro-vaccine, but also very pro humans are not lab rats (pandemic or not) and we have the right to know exactly the risks associated with something we are putting into our bodies so can make informed decisions."
2021-04-14 6:06,"As someone who got the J&J vaccine a few weeks ago, here's a question I have: At what point are the vaccine contents fully broken down and expelled from my body? In other words, at what point is there no longer a risk of new side effects developing if they haven't yet? Obviously nothing is for certain, and there is SOME long-term lingering effect of the vaccine on antibodies, as that's the whole point of getting a vaccine. But it'd be nice to know at what point I'm ""in the clear."""
2021-04-14 8:40,"I got the J&J vax Monday
They 'paused' it on Tuesday
It is somewhat aggravating to have to wait a few weeks to see whether I get done in by a clot if in fact there is any relation between the vax and the clots.  But I'm reasonably certain that I won't get done in by Covid."
2021-04-14 9:58,"I was just wondering whether there is a similar association between blood clotting and Covid19. If so, it might offer a different angle on the problem. Just spitballing, though."
2021-04-14 11:16,"How likely is it that the FDA would have arrived at the same decision had the FDA head position not been vacant? My gut tells me that we had a set of bureaucrats reassuring each other that, since Janssen was not meeting its short term production goals, it would be just fine and dandy to pause the vaccine and sully its reputation."
2021-04-14 11:23,"The limited adverse impact of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine is the same argument that doctors have used to persuade me to take bone building drugs to combat osteoporosis. Only a small number of women have developed necrosis of the jaw from these drugs, but if I were in that small 5%, or whatever the percentage is, I would not be happy. My husband recently had total knee replacement surgery. He is in the 5% for whom the surgery did not go well, and he suffered greatly for months until a specialist finally figured out the problem. I’ve seen what 5% looks like, and it isn’t pretty. I will not take those bone building drugs. If my hip breaks, that was my choice, but my jaw won’t crumble, too, at least from the drugs. The same with the Covid-19 vaccine. Perhaps this vaccine is not the best choice, but at this stage, people must know the risks they are taking. If one is in the at risk 5% who develop blood clots, wouldn’t you like to know that risk?"
2021-04-14 11:32,"How many women 18 to 48 years old have gotten the J&J vaccine? It is easy to call this a ""1 in 1 million occurrence"" when they don't provide true data.

2021-04-14 11:45,"We prefer not knowing the risks of our daily activities because we prefer to be blissfully oblivious.  The odds of injury or death from a car accident or crossing the street are vaguely on our minds but we perform a little uninformed risk benefit test in our heads and blithely go about our business.  The idea behind the J&J pause is more about the fragility of public confidence in the vaccine rollout.  Or really, anything the government says.  Both political parties are responsible for the erosion of trust in our institutions.  Navigating this landscape, the science community wants transparency, and thats what the pause is about.  Not the odds - it’s all about transparency and confidence.  Could backfire but really, they had to do it."
2021-04-14 12:13,"It's possible that at least some of these deaths may pertain to undiagnosed antiphospholipid syndrome, a rare hyper-coagulating autoimmune disorder. The aPS antibodies can remain inactive until some kind of trauma activates them. (Like a Covid vaccination?) This disorder, otherwise known as Hughes Syndrome, is found disproportionately in women, although men, like myself, have it as well. It initially presents in a variety of ways. In my case, it was swollen legs and  clot material in my finger. (There is another somewhat similar hyper-coagulating autoimmune disorder called Factor V Leiden. I have that, too.) Simple blood tests can confirm the presence of these disorders. I'm not a doctor or a researcher, but it seems to me that determining the statistical prevalence these clotting deaths ought to be done by comparing them to their subgroup and not to the general population."
2021-04-14 12:13,"Officials acting out of ""an abundance of caution"" may be causing harm here by encouraging vaccine hesitancy and by delaying the rollout unnecessarily.

They seem to be struggling with the balancing of risks and seem little better prepared than people in general who are swayed by the tone of an article or by the substitution of anecdote for evidence.

Considering the parallels with reactions to the AstraZeneca vaccine it would probably have been wise to pause the rollout just for those under fifty who are at much lower risk from covid and apparently more likely to suffer a vaccine reaction. 

Officials also seem to be struggling with a real world instance of the ""trolley problem"" much beloved of ethics lecturers. All in all I'm afraid they are display signs that they lack both hard training and the mettle required for their roles."
2021-04-14 12:17,"Not only will the risk of a blood clot be reduced to 0 by getting the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, the effectiveness against COVID-19 is also greater, so why would anyone want the (newer) J&J shot?"
2021-04-14 12:17,"If the six cases only happen in young-ish women, this seems to suggest that the vaccine is safe for men with respect to this side effect. 

If the side effect has happened to six women but no men, and women and men each got roughly the same number of shots (big ""if""), the probability that men have just been lucky so far is 1 in 64, or less than two percent. It is not obvious that this warrants slowing down vaccinations when facilities have multiple vaccines to choose from and could choose who gets which vaccine."
2021-04-14 12:33,"People keep saying 6 out of 6.8 million people who received J&J had this adverse effect. However, I would love to know the number of young women with low platelets who received this vaccine as I feel like that would give a more accurate representation of the risk, if any, to young women with thrombocytopenia. If there seems to be a connection with low blood platelets, perhaps have people with low blood platelets receive other vaccines and everyone else continue receiving J&J (of course it should still be investigated)."
2021-04-14 12:47,"Finally a moderately sober and reasonable article. The other sensationalized articles have done nothing but kill more people who are skeptical of the vaccine already (PoC, not wealthy, etc.) and cause more pain and strife over an infinitesimally small risk. The risk of blood clots is higher from covid, and the risk of new variants is higher for society as a whole. This author should be commended, their peers should be scolded."
2021-04-14 12:55,"My daughter just had this vaccine. Of course, we are all very worried. But I am also angry. This woman died a full week before my daughter had the vaccine and there was nothing in the news.

2021-04-14 13:35,"Risk management.  Benefit vs disadvantage.  6 in 7,000,000 seems a reasonable risk? Or not?  Same for driving a car, crossing the street, having a drink, eating bacon!"
2021-04-14 13:46,"Many have commented that the coverage of this issue may dissuade people from being vaccinated, which is impossible to a disagree with.  Others have pointed out that 6 out of 6 million is a minuscule (.0001) percentage.  We do need people to choose to be vaccinated.

Here’s what we’re all missing:  the “take one for the team” attitude, probably born of our own fears of the virus and dying, is disrespectful to the six.  This is a messaging problem.  Maybe if we called these six woman heroes and thanked them for taking the risk, albeit unknown, people who feared vaccines would act differently.  

When we value people equally, working together is easier.  The argument that “it’s only SIX people” devalues those lives.  It suggests, it’s Okay that “you” died so that we could live.

It’s really not okay.

And this situation is not dissimilar to different scenarios we are grappling with as a society.  Simply put, we all need to try walking in other people’s shoes."
2021-04-14 14:28,"There was a rash of articles like this about Europe's Astra Zeneca pause last month -- and now it very much appears that middle-aged women are at very small but still real risk from that vaccine. I find the American media's dismissive coverage of the JNJ pause weirdly out of context with that very recent episode. I also wonder why the regulators didn't limit the JNJ pause to women under 50 -- if the risk is real, it's many times greater than 1 in a million for people in that cohort."
2021-04-14 15:51,"Women of my generation were the first to use birth control pills in the 60's and 70's. The formulas used at that time contained much more synthetic hormone than needed to suppress ovulation. Blood clots and high blood pressure were the major dangerous side effects -- I hesitate to say ""common"" because that is subjective -- but we all knew there was a risk of serious illness or death when we took The Pill. And we did, anyway! My own doc gave me stats gathered from the British National Health system, which keeps records on all patients. The risk was real, but it was low. 
Now we have a deadly pandemic that is wreaking havoc all over the world, disrupting economies and every day life as well as killing people and leaving others with debilitating side effects for who knows how long. Let's not panic about these statistics! Let's be real -- nothing is 100% safe. Whatever can do good can also do harm. Do NOT give this vaccine to young women. Pause distribution to research this, certainly. But let's not go into a panic, or expect that there will ever be NO side effects to a vaccination strong enough to prevent disease."
2021-04-14 16:26,"Normal incidence of CVST is 2 to 5 per million. Incidence with vaccine has been 6 in approx. 7 million recipients, which is less than 1 per million. A lower incidence. This tells me the vaccine might have, if anything, a protective effect re CVST. What am I missing?"

Unless you are worried about getting hit and killed by lightening then stop worrying about J & J."
2021-04-14 5:50,There have been more fast and the furious movies than blood clots from the J&J vaccine.      Less than one in a million develop clots from this vaccine.  Thousands will probably die from Covid as a result but hey apparently deaths that way aren't nearly as bad as deaths from the vaccine where a link hasn't been proven.  Far more women develop blood clots from birth control pills.   It is a sad day when the anti-vaxxers have won the world over.
2021-04-14 11:32,"In the NYT morning summary that cited this article: ""One way to think about those numbers: While the chances of a fatal blood clot from the vaccine may be something like one in a million, roughly 125 out of every one million Americans between 18 and 48 have died of Covid since early last year.""

That should make us feel good.  However, the math may be faulty.

We also know that healthy young people are 300 times less likely to die from Covid 19 than their unhealthy peers, those with at least one comorbidity…so those numbers suggest if you are healthy you may be 3 times as likely to die from the vaccine than the virus…not all the NYT journalists understand how to read data. (Note: data on side effects of vaccines are still to early to evaluate and why they are only approved by the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization.  Long term safety testing of vaccines will be concluded in 2-3 years, so only those most vulnerable should be taking them at this time, which unfortunately is the vast majority of Americans)"

Now weigh this against the hundreds or thousands who will die by pausing this vaccine. You have had equivalent of the number of 9/11 deaths  (3,000) every day, and you are worrying about this. Even if the death is directly linked with the vaccine, it is still worth using it."

The crucial piece of missing information here what is the rate of CVST in the general population? With millions and millions of people receiving vaccinations worldwide it is likely that many people will have a coincidental “adverse event” afterward. These of course need to be tracked and investigated, but reporting of these events needs to be extremely sensitive to the dangers of scaring people away from receiving extremely safe vaccines."

2021-04-14 15:46,"It is likely that, to be abundantly cautious, women who are also using birth control pills may want to avoid Covid vaccines where there is evidence of an increased risk of blood clots. Using oral contraceptives appears to result in rare cases of blood clots in women, reportedly occurring many times higher than incidents of blood clots from Covid vaccines - although the data is incomplete. Ignorance of the ongoing risks we each face all the time and innumeracy of the chances of being at risk guarantee poor personal health choices. Conspiracy theories and rumors spread by media that makes money promoting fear and panic are worse than useless. Other risks are greater than the possibility of blood clots from a vaccine but we apparently consider injury and death from things like vehicle crashes or gun violence as routine and no big deal.

I wish I could just not get a vaccine, but I travel for work and I dont want my ability to travel ever be restricted. I have my appointment Friday for my vaccine. I really wish I could cancel it. I really dont want this vaccine. My wife is refusing to take it so Im not looking forward to her being denied services and access. Shes already told me that she can live with being denied air travel bc she believes that we shouldnt be forced to share personal medical info with everyone who wants to ask and take vaccines that are not fully FDA approved. She wont relent, so that sucks. I really do think that Covid isnt bad enough to mandate things like vaccine passports, but I see it happening already so I feel forced to get the jab. I was hoping to get the JnJ bc its based on proven vaccine development technology, but now they paused that so Im getting brand new technology, not fully tested or FDA approved, and all so I can make sure I can still work. If old people get vaccinated then they wont get Covid so I dont buy the argument that I have to get vaccinated to protect old people.

If you crossed the street 10 times a day, EVERY DAY, day after day, it would take 274 YEARS to have one million crossings.

I proffer that there would be AT LEAST two pedestrian accidents in that 274 years, making crossing the street AT LEAST twice as dangerous as the J&J vaccine.

Furthermore, that doesn't even take into consideration that the risk of blood clots from Birth Control pills and COVID itself are greater than one in a million."

I think this decision to pause J&J is likely politically driven - but for good reason.  

I think we can predict with absolute certainty that the right-wing media machine will focus on the one and ignore the millions to deliberately misinform their audience to further their political agenda.  If J&J is removed completly from the scene, then the remaining vaccines available to the public will be those that have been shown to pose absolutely zero risk - effectively removing a ludicrous right-wing talking point.  

And though this decision will slow down the vaccination pace some - and likely push out the ""herd immunity"" date predictions, in the long term it may actually result in more hesitant Americans agreeing to be vaccinated.  And that makes us all safer.  Sadly, this is where we are in post Trump America."

Indeed, it is why my wife and I, both physicians, received the mRNA vaccines, as did our families, and the mRNA vaccines are what we recommend to our patients. That doesn't make the J&J or AZ shots bad. But why get them when we have 2 alternatives that are more effective and safer?

2021-04-14 17:18,"An excellent, fact-based article with proper context.  Here's another bit of context: right now, even if this can be causally-linked to the vaccine, it's less-likely than one-in-a-million.  In 2020 in the US, 42,060 people died in auto accidents, according to the National Safety Counsel.  The US Population is 331.42 million.  So that's about 1:7900 odds of a random citizen dying in an auto accident each year.  

Given that the number of actual auto occupants is lower than the total population, the odds are actually worse than that.  

1:1,000,000 from the shot (maybe).  1:8000 from one's car rides in a year (definitely).  That's important context."

The concept of risk as applied here is completely irrelevant until a decision is reached on the cause of the blood clots. If it is found that the vaccine causes the blood clots and not other confounding factors then there is nothing to discuss and the vaccine should be pulled off the circulation. If the cause cannot be established then the proper authorities can talk about risk and let the individual decide. In the meantime no-one should be receiving this vaccine."

 The older people are the most at risk of suffering from covid, so vaccinate them, as the risk of the disease supersedes the risk of the vaccination .  

However, I am not comfortable making that argument for a young healthy lady in her twenties.  Her risk of suffering from the disease does not supersede the real risk of a clotting event.  

Mandate vaccinations  only if you are willing to pay for loss and suffering to her and her family.  Would her university turn her away if she refuses vaccination if she is afraid of a clot?  Or would they pay if she got sick or died from a vaccination induced clot?"
2021-04-14 18:28,"Having read the proposed mechanism of the thrombocytopenia and blood clots, I recognized that this is what caused my mother’s death some years ago, while undergoing an aortic valve replacement. She died in the OR, from heparin induced thrombocytopenia. This is an aberant immune response to heparin; relatively rare, it is a well recognized potential side effect of heparin and results in significant morbidity and mortality.
While there is no heparin in the AZ or J&J vaccines, there appears to be some potential for immunological cross-reactivity in certain people to the adenovirus carriers. Genetics being what they are (still a bit of a crapshoot), it seems to me that I could have an increased predisposition to this reaction that is not worth the risk.
I cancelled my appointment for the J&J vaccine, which was scheduled for yesterday, at a pharmacy 60 miles from home. I got a notice from the pharmacy this morning that they were rescheduling me (per CDC recommendation).

One only need look at Europe, where a similar pause was implemented for AstraZeneca. It's been re approved there, but the public remains skeptical and today Denmark terminated use of the vaccine. I don't believe they'll be the last country to do so.

This is a major setback in the fight against COVID."
2021-04-14 13:46,"My husband just pointed out to me that you have a 1 in 500,000 chance of getting struck by lightning where as a 1 in a million chance of developing blood clots from the vaccine. No one ever leaves the golf course or the beach until you can see the lightening flash. Some risks are worth taking."
2021-04-14 14:15,"From what is known so far, the risk of the Johnson & Johnson covid vaccine seems minuscule but the consequence for individuals and whole communities of withholding an effective vaccination is enormous. 

As the vaccine is administered, informed consent is crucial but given this caveat, the vaccine should be made available to people who are willing to take a one-in-a-million risk. The risk of a death-dealing covid infection, not to mention the danger of generating malignant virus variants at-large in the community, is far greater than than one in a million."
2021-04-14 13:46,"People have the right to decide whether they want to wait for their own peace of mind. If someone is nervous about being vaccinated then they need to go at their own pace. If they are not sick or just plain standoffish over it , then it is within their right to hold off. If someone that is vaccinated is concerned about others not taking the shot yet then where is your confidence in the vaccine working, after all if you had your shot then as vaccines are created to do they ""immunize"" you against it. Hence the word immunization !"

We could go on.   We hear about case counts more than anything, way more than anything.  From certain of the ""experts"" we never hear that dramatic decreases in deaths are good news for example we just hear cases are going up we have to keep doing this stuff with no consideration of any of the public health implications other than COVID.   I could go into the current best estimate of the IFR for COVID based on the CDCs latest data and explain why this sole focus on COVID is not just absurd it insane but I do not waste my time these days, most people still are not able, or not willing to understand this.   We should have had more open honest reporting all along but we have not had that.  Many states do not offer stratified data on death rates even, how can anyone know what their risk is if we don't give them accurate data?  This sis not the dark ages, how we have approached this is inexplicable if the goal is to inform the public accurately, this is just one example of the consequences. And I am the second commenter?  Another part of the problem, people don't want to hear this."

America has been engaged in a ""drunkard's search"" plan for addressing addiction: making painkillers more difficult to access for people who legitimately need them (and who are at low risk of becoming addicts or overdosing) because it's easy and politically expedient. Meanwhile, the real drivers of addiction and efforts toward harm reduction don't get enough funding or focus."
2021-04-14 22:45,"The measures taken in recent years to crack down on prescription opiods have perversely driven up the death rate.  People living with severe pain have been cut off by doctors terrified of being prosecuted for overprescribing. These patients have been forced to find relief in the fentanyl-poisoned products flooding the  black market. We must end the failed and racist  war on drugs. It’s time to legalize and regulate all drugs and instead of throwing people with substance use disorder in prison and stigmatizing them and ruining their job prospects for life, give them the  lifelong medical help and social support people with other medical conditions have access to. Our overriding priority must be to greatly weaken the control cartels have over our society.

Awful plagues...
Imperilling people's souls forever and ever.
So any means were justified to cure people of heracy.

Participants are given every label imaginable besides simple opioid addict.  But as always the numbers tell the truth:  more people died just from Fentanyl overdoses last year than homicides and COVID combined.  Overdose deaths are soaring because its a multi-billion dollar internationally run business.  A criminal enterprise and employer bigger than many Fortune 50 companies - combined.  It is the US retail division of the cartels in collaboration with labs in China, many of which are quietly owned by senior government and military figures.  Money flows into the pockets of police and politicians here, south of our borders, in China and globally.

Most fentanyl is manufactured in China and imported to the US directly or through Mexico. I think that’s much of why “build the wall” was popular—because of the drug crisis. Immigrants became scapegoats, accused of bringing in drugs. But to my knowledge, the supply chain of fentanyl was not addressed by our leaders, publicly or in policy, even as we were led by a man who constantly found reasons to tussle with China and Mexico. 

I think that the focus needs to be on Chinese fentanyl manufacturers and the smuggling of hard drugs. How can we work *with* China and Mexico to accomplish these goals?"

For the first month or two there was no oversight and after being off opioids for eh maybe 6 months, as soon as that vivitrol shot expired which is about a month, he went out and bought heroine and died of an overdose in late April.
He was a drug addict and had a history of bad behavior - but I mean this, he had a good heart, a brilliant smile and a larger than life personality. I know it was his choice, there isn’t anyone else to blame, it’s just sad- the whole story is just sad.

2021-04-15 13:49,"Self destruction takes many forms and is commonplace among the masochist serfs of the USA. Opioids are a minor contribution to that problem. It's just that booze, cigarettes, junk food and crashing motorized vehicles are seen as normal ways to die. We only have a negative view of opioid deaths because of the drug war and the addiction myth. 

I think that the availability of deadly opioids is only because the drug war was coming to an end. It's continued pursuit is useless and most people know it, so to make people anti drug again you just release some very deadly drugs in high amounts and everyone is back on board with the drug war. 

You'd think that seeing the corporations dump massive amounts of opioids on the country would wake people to the evils of unfettered capitalism. It hasn't and it won't. The serfs love their pain.

Individuals are responsible for their own actions. Ignorance of consequences is no excuse."

For those already saturated in the depths of alcoholic drinks, the scope for redemption is circumscribed to their will and ability to solicit their emancipation,However, there could also be new recruits to this fell trend to which they could succumb head over heels in the context of enforced solitude  which bares and betrays the darker side of existence.They resort to uninhibited binge of drinking in the faint hope that the vicious beverage would restore to them their lost equanimity .The single drought of consumption does have the hidden prowess to retain them under its serfdom perennially. Thereby hangs the tale, of total albeit  incremental ,surrender to this acquired vice with attenuated chances of recovery. The new converts, by no means, devoutly intent to be the devotees of alcoholism but  plummet into the quagmire perchance and get enmeshed in its portals. So, the most palpable villain in the spread of drugs, substances and alcohol is the enforced loneliness and confinement to space under the guise of protection from infection.This is,obviously, a passing phenomenon and is fated to show improvement with the annihilation of the vicious pandemic."

At the current rate of infections, about 10,000/day and 900 deaths/day, in the four days of the 'pause' how many infections and deaths will occur due to people not being able to get the shot.

It is not uncommon to have extended adverse reactions to the other vaccines.  There is VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Site) at the CDC. I had a severe case of CoVid last summer and an adverse reaction to my second vaccine starting that night.  I am still dizzy, lightheaded and unable to drive or exercise outside more than a week later.  My physician insisted it was still important for me to get that second vaccine.

They do have information about side effects that are not rare, but yet when we do have a reaction like this, we are on our own. In fact, they minimize the after effects.  It is important to be truthful about the vaccines even if it is negative so that people are giving informed consent, aren't caught by surprise and get the informed care we need when we do have an adverse reaction."

European nations, for example, have temporarily paused the J&J vaccine while they wait for results from America at a time when a smooth rollout is crucial for them, after having lagged behind. And as we know, convincing those people here and abroad who were hesitant about vaccines before this will be even more difficult once we’re told that the vaccine is safe after all.

None of the 3.8 million men were reported stricken in such a fashion (so far). 

One possible solution? While citing those statistics, offer men the J&J vaccine while you work out why women are affected. In the process, switch the women onto the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. 

Keep the vaccinations going. If I hadn't already been vaccinated, I would volunteer to take a J&J shot."

The idea of ""only six"" is ludicrous.  They are all women.  BIG medicine money masters, like the military, tend to think in terms of ""a few people will die for the greater good"".  Perhaps I would agree if it wasn't all profit-motivated.  

I have an auto-immune disorder of unknown origin and life-long blood clotting issues.  I will not be one of their guinea pigs.  Perhaps BIG pharma executives and their families can be test subjects?

I actually find the women who ""made it"" are sometimes the worse at being supportive.  If I hear one more person say I just need to take some me time I will scream.  It is just not feasible to work the 60+ hours per week required of pretunure scientists while having young children while dealing with all the extra service and mentoring demands academics puts only on women.  I know it is only worse for minority women.  I am trying to get more women to go into these hard sciences, but in the back of my head I am scared I am sending more women in for slaughter in the brutal system if something isn't done to reduce sexism and make the system actually work for women who dare to be mothers and scientists."
2021-04-13 16:35,"I'm a man in the hard sciences, and I did not marry and have kids because my career would not allow me to share 50 % of family responsibilities and be competitive in my field. That's because if I don't put in 100 %, someone else will. It's a choice not just for women, but for men as well."
2021-04-13 18:20,"I'm also a biostatistician. I also need blocks of time to think. I also work remote from home. Is my time constantly interrupted? Yes. Does it affect my productivity? Yes. Am I a woman? No. Have men also published fewer papers, led fewer clinical trials, and received less recognition during the pandemic? Of course. The problem of lack of time when working at home is universal -- it's not limited to women. Why try to make it sound like it is?"
2021-04-13 18:47,"But for Nobel Prize winning American and French women scientists, an overworked underpaid and underappreciated Hungarian American woman scientist and a young Black African American female scientist we would be a lot more ignorant than we currently are about COVID-19 

Misogyny and patriarchy are endemic in every human institution to the detriment of the one and only human race species that began in Africa 300,000+ years ago.

Humanity needs far more female scientists than it needs female courtesans, entertainers,heiresses and models."
2021-04-13 20:45,"It is disheartening to see this trend happening in so many fields. It's not a new one, but worsened by the pandemic. The question is, what can be done? 

Some strategies are long term and systemic.  e.g., The average age of men in many academic fields is older than for women. Older workers tend to have more resources, fewer childcare duties, and (for those who remain research active) higher productivity due to extended collaborative networks and research experience.  

If we can attract and support a diverse mix of young scientists (more like 50/50 men/women), then over time we would have more older, experienced, well resourced women who publish, co-author, are mentors, etc.  

I am not denying the 'dude wall' effect, just saying demographic changes can work over time IF institutional changes lower systematic barriers.  I've seen my own institution change, albeit slowly, with leadership and resources.  And no, not by lowering standards (our research productivity is up) or making family life impossible (men and women colleagues are having families).

What to do about this pandemic cohort?  The pandemic has affected some young male scientists with families, and passed over some female scientists without kids at home, but gender effects are disproportionate. Let's take that into account in personnel decisions.  For senior colleagues, mentor professionally as many young colleagues as possible -- without ignoring women!! -- and bring understanding into personnel evaluations."
2021-04-13 19:36,"It would be really wonderful to read a story about how men who are committed to their families have suffered during the pandemic as well. I am so, so tired of this whining by women, encouraged by reporters who think they're performing a service to  highlight women's complaints rather than their successes -- and I'm a woman! Also, the Harvard School of Public Health removed its ""dude wall"" of previous deans rather than simply adding the current dean, a Black woman. Too bad we can't acknowledge history's heroes and also note that they've been superseded by a more diverse group of heroes."

OPRAH) to mount a counter attack by funding counter institutions to the male wasp institutions.  AMA?  Research institutes?  Scientific societies?  Unions?  There has to be a way for the neglected women warriors who accomplish things against all odds for the betterment of humanity! Smart people should have children and they should be able to care for them appropriately.  Otherwise, the genetic pool just goes downhill.  MONEY is Influence.  MONEY is Power.  Where can I send my little contribution?"
2021-04-14 0:30,"so many commenters miss the point of this article.  here's the point.  in not supporting women, people of color, and all who wish to pursue careers in STEM - in failing to support them with better early education and better supportive infrastructure for the other things that benefit our culture (like child care) - how many great minds are we missing?  how many life improving things have not been invented?  it is to the benefit of all humanity to treat women humanely.  imagine that!"
2021-04-14 0:22,"Once again, the Times avoids the core issue when its writers comment on these issues - the Ivies hate awarding tenure at all.  The idea that the pandemic, discrimination, child and family care, etc. have made early academic careers in the most prestigious institutions a struggle, or unsustainable, or even unbearable, is undeniable, but that's largely because trying to get a tenured position at those places is intended to be insanely hard.  It somewhat mirrors the recent story about young analysts at Goldman-Sachs, but at least they get paid a lot.  The Times and other (elite) publications have essentially given these universities a pass on both working conditions and low salaries for almost all junior faculty for a long time.  Specific to women, it's ironic that with all the Times coverage on unions recently, the article never mentioned one mechanism untenured women should explore early on - Committee W of their campus American Association of University Professors chapter and the national AAUP.  Maybe they don't know to look for it because they never read about in articles like this one."

2021-04-14 3:25,"1. If you were a science grad student, would you choose as a mentor someone who worked “at 80 percent, as opposed to 100 percent”? 
Would you choose someone “already on the ground, already on [their] knees”?
Is it wrong to suggest that these might not be the best choices in the long-term?

2. As the parent of an (only-child) daughter, I have observed, first hand, the importance of female role models. However, in tearing down displays of histories of excellence, what, precisely, is “the tradition that should not be perpetuated”? Celebrations of histories of achievement?
If the Rockefeller display was “taken down on Nov.  11”, why has it taken over four months to replace it with a more politically-correct Pantheon?
There is nothing wrong with “cancel culture” when it is really just enforcing personal responsibility for one’s own decisions. But what, exactly, did these Nobel & Lasker prize winners do?
Please, let’s not let those on the Right be right about “cancel culture.”"

She persevered and was recognized as the best in her field.  I did make full professor by the time I was 40  so her support for me was always important.

Just because you don't get paid through an employer with a W2 form or 1099 doesn't mean you're not being compensated.

Oh, and by the way, while men earn more than women, women spend more than men. Interesting paradox that has been demonstrated by various consumer spending reports, but illustrates what is common sense. Ask any married man who does most of the purchasing."

That's more significant considering the fact that more than 72% of science grad students are from abroad and minorities while more than 84% of postdocs (the main driving force for US higher education & research industry) are foreign born and mostly racial minorities (mainly from few countries in Asia.) Black and Latino participation is pathetically low, far worse than even racial minorities from Asia.

Trying to explain this to a female boss with grown children gets me nothing but scorn.  The pandemic has been awful for so many and we are lucky to be safe and housed and well fed, but I have been working very long days, never feeling that it is enough, or that I can take a break.  Academia has not lowered its standards and cares nothing about my children’s health or success."
2021-04-15 11:32,"Interesting anecdotes but hardly anything to draw new conclusions from. I have read here previously that the pandemic has caused more men to be involved in house work.

2021-04-15 12:11,"This is not meaningful unless you also look at the pandemic's effects on male scientists. What people often assume are issues related to women are more broadly human issues.

Many years ago, Emory University surveyed untenured female faculty and found that they felt unsupported, had no mentors, and belueved they were given an unfair load of committee work while they were under tremendous pressure to publish for tenure. This was a big deal. Then domone suggested they survey intended male faculty. Turns out they had the exact same response: felt unsupported, mentorless and saddled unfairly with too much committee work. So then Emory does a big study about the glass ceiling that women experience. But it turns out there is little evidence that female faculty hit a glass ceiling. So then they did a study of why female faculty perceives that there is a glass ceiling. As Robert Frost said: It goes on."

2021-04-15 12:37,"While I do believe women have a harder time in science than men (as in other male dominated fields from finance to tech) I always find it amusing that it is assumed men are somehow well supported in these professions. Men are viciously competitive with each other and mock and tear each other down constantly, even more so when the professional cultures are more insular.  It’s not all a big bro golf game where they leave the women off the memo today (if it ever was). It helps that many men let their wives handle childcare and therefore devote themselves more fully to their professions (to the detriment of their families) but the truth is few people are well supported in science, men also burn out/get thrown out with regularity, and the issues discussed in this article are hardly limited to women."
2021-04-15 12:59,"I watched Nova's documentary last night on women scientists.  All of the claims of abuse by these women, including bullying by senior scientists, having one's creative work stolen by other scientists, and an atmosphere that is hostile to newcomers or new views were experiences that I also had during the 1990s.  That is how science works.   My biggest bully was a woman; I am a man.

 I ended up leaving academia before going through the tenure process to avoid being at the mercy of the woman bully.   I ended up in industry and have made double the salary that I ever would have made in academia with a lot less of the grief.

Woman and men in science, as in all fields, are not always nice to their more junior colleagues whom they view as potential future competitors.   That is human nature."
2021-04-15 13:07,Perhaps the need to care for children is worth the sacrifice of one's career.  The article has an unstated assumption that the pursuit of science is more important than raising one's children. It thus concludes that because the pandemic increased the burden of childcare that women were discriminated against.  Perhaps we should instead applaud those women who abandoned their career in order to properly raise their family.

For sure, male and female scientists do not deliver to the same extent if we set a common scale to determine their competencies.

I got in early, 6:30 or so, and left at 4 so that I could pick up our daughter from daycare and take her home. We went to the park or the merry-go-round at the mall or the zoo, home for me to cook dinner then a bath and bed.

2021-04-15 15:23,"The sciences and the cultures of scientific institutions have a whole range of problems that can make them terrible places to work for anybody (though it can also be very rewarding, and there are exceptions). But all it takes is to step into a scientific society's annual meeting to see that to a truly troubling, embarrassing degree, people of color are underrepresented.  I think scientists on the whole are well-meaning, idealistic people who want their fields to be diverse, but there are clearly systemic problems that we've inexcusably failed to address."
2021-04-15 12:31,"I'd prefer to read an article about how the pandemic is affecting non-one-percenter households.

2021-04-15 13:30,"Few of the brighter folk that I’ve known were suitably conscious of career dynamics.  Too bad we never get training.  Both men and women, especially those who really want to participate at the bench/lab/contact level don’t understand why they need to be proactive.  I hadn’t a clue that:
You choose your Ph.D. advisor more carefully than a spouse.
You never go with a first level boss or academic mentor who is toxic to colleagues.
You do not become identified with others who a) are leaving soon, b) are politically inept or c) are even controversial.

In my undistinguished career at several very respected institutions and companies, I simply did not pay attention, and in addition to my intellectual deficiencies, became ‘a New York Jew’, an unmarried and therefore vagrant and underserving person, suspected of acknowledging female capabilities, and several other serious crimes.  Possibly even too short to be trusted with funding presentations. 

Science, crippled as it has been lately,  competitive at every level, and short on opportunity, is a career choice that sadly has to be taken with care.  Hoping that things will change is nice, but a poor bet."

Changing the traditional “dude walls” and standing up to traditional journals for such male-centric articles in the face of poor scientific method are important ways of changing the resident scientific male-biased culture, hopefully making it unacceptable to be exclusionary to women in the near future as women continue trying to create meaningful scientific careers in a hostile environment."
2021-04-15 16:14,"The head of the lab where I was a graduate student 30-40 years ago was a man who very much favored women over men: e.g., in touting their research and providing funding when they could not secure it for themselves.

Although I agree that women scientists have a tougher time than men, the picture presented by this article is overly simplistic.
I had a tougher time from my PhD advisor than the women in my lab did."
2021-04-15 16:37,"A well meaning article that makes some important points. But, just to offer a slightly more nuanced perspective: science is a fiercely competitive enterprise. There are a lot of very talented people, of all genders and races, who wish to have an academic career and don’t succeed in distinguishing themselves enough from the rest of the crowd, and for one reason or another end up leaving academia. The proximate causes for why they didn’t make it might appear to vary a lot, and many of these people will complain that they were treated unfairly and feel aggrieved, but the ultimate cause is always the same: there just isn’t room enough for everyone.

You can say “we need more scientists of group X” as some people in the comments are saying. Yes, it’s true! We need more women, more people of color, more mothers, fathers, childless people, Blacks, Whites, Asians, you name it. It is very easy for a reporter to find anecdotes of representatives of each of these groups feeling unsupported in science and create a narrative that group X is somehow mistreated or put at an unfair disadvantage. And yet, what do such anecdotes prove ultimately? Has it occurred to the writer of this piece that science is simply hard to succeed in for EVERYONE? That the pandemic has been hard on everyone?

So sure, academia does have problems in its treatment of women, but if this article criticizes a Nature study for a flawed analysis, well, perhaps it should take a look in the mirror."
2021-04-15 16:57,"I took my PhD in 1987.  Subsequently, on several occasions I was informed that the position for which I had applied, for which I was unquestionably thoroughly qualified, was awarded to a significantly less qualified male, because ""he would get along better"" with the existing personnel.  At my first position requiring and using my PhD I was terminated as being ""unsuited to the demands"" of the work and then replaced by an underqualified male - that one took a 12 years long court battle to establish gender discrimination and be minimally compensated.  Effectively, I was driven out of my professional field and found employment in IT, where my training was entirely OJT. Twenty years later, I finally was employed in my field, at a reasonable level - and then I retired.  I can only offer my sympathies to the subjects of this article, and the testimony that the discrimination they face now is a continuum and not a novelty.  I don't know that it will ever end - I do know that the simple ambition to do the work for which one is trained, at a level commensurate with skill and ability is reasonable and not something to be denied because of gender."
2021-04-15 17:34,"There's a mistaken notion among graduate level science students that success is becoming a tenured professor. In reality just a tiny fraction can 'live the dream'.

2021-04-15 17:41,"In highly competitive workplaces (read that as political) such as academic research institutes where status is highly valued and research breakthroughs may be worth billions, some people will use any tool available to gain an advantage, be it fair or not. 

A recent example is the feud between The Broad Institute' s Eric Lander and Berkeley's Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier where the patent for CRISPR, (a gene editing tool worth billions) was at stake.

This behavior is more about human nature, competition and the clash of egos than anything else.

It is true that men set up these institutions and women face many more obstacles than men but what is missing is that the infighting in these boy's clubs is as severe as any. It is not unheard of that someone's work is sabotaged or a researcher fakes their results. Getting and receiving credit is a mad free for all.

All is fair in love and war and the climb up the ladder of success."

By then, I was done with academia.  The higher I got, the more excluded I felt. Forget about ever bringing up discussions on how to balance family and academic life.  You are expected to devote your life to the lab - anything less is seen as a weakness (not too different from the corporate world).  So I left academia and have never looked back. I took and R&D position at a start-up, and learned about the real-life world of business and the practical applications of research; of working with a team of researchers; of having a meaningful maternity leave; of having the flexibility to work from home when the kids needed me. This was all in the 1990s.  While there may be more women in STEM in academia since my time, I see that very little has changed. The pay iniquities remain. The rules still favour the ruling class (no surprise there). I still love science. And I have found a different outlet. Academia is way too stifling."

If men happen to earn more in a relationship, that shouldn't matter. Just because a man happens to have chosen a higher paying career doesn't mean the women's career is less important. If that family's expenses are such that they can't afford to lose the male income as much as the female income that family should reconsider their budgeting decisions.
On a side note, regarding the comment that some women are experiencing negative stereotypes whereby people insinuate that their success may be due to benefits or promotions bestowed upon them because they are women, not based solely on their talent, that is both unfair and completely understandable. As long as women are favored in hiring decisions people will think this. You simply can't have one without the other. In academia, I have met a number of women who do not want women to be favoured because they think it is insulting to the abilities of women. If you have less women applicants you should have less women selectees (assuming equal merit between the sexes), otherwise the standards for women are lower. The only exception I can think of that makes sense is politics, because women should have an equal role in deciding the laws that govern women, even if less women want to go into politics."

National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track
Wendy M. Williams and Stephen J. Ceci

We report five hiring experiments in which faculty evaluated hypothetical female and male applicants, using systematically varied profiles disguising identical scholarship, for assistant professorships in biology, engineering, economics, and psychology. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, men and women faculty members from all four fields preferred female applicants 2:1 over identically qualified males with matching lifestyles (single, married, divorced), with the exception of male economists, 


AAAS  Science Apr. 29, 2015

. The paper reports on a series of experiments that presented more than 800 male and female biology, engineering, psychology, and economics faculty members at 371 universities with various versions of the credentials of fictitious applicants for assistant professorships. The identical records, which indicated outstanding achievement, were sometimes attributed to a woman and sometimes to a man. In every field but economics, where the data indicated no gender preference, the respondents strongly preferred the purportedly female candidates.

Reminds me of the, ""racism isn't a problem in this country, everyone is having a hard time"" line of argument.... But yet according to the numbers, women are paid way less than men in STEM and wayyyy less women are going into STEM careers.. So why are the numbers saying this guys?

Yet, the noteworthy fact again is that I am a man who was the junior faculty person in a scientific field and the more senior faculty person doing the bullying was a woman.

Yet, I am disappointed by the comments that now follow, as they all get into the standard politically correct view that only men can do evil to women in the workplace.  

Bullying happens to most people at some point in time in the workplace in my experience, and not just in science.  This is human nature showing dominance in a way similar to how chimpanzees also show dominance toward more junior members of their tribe.  Male chimps show dominance, but also female chimps show dominance toward those that they can control.   The fact that older [white] men are more often the one's doing the bullying is an effect of the fact that they are the ones more often in power.  In my experience in observing more than a few people who have been the victims of such bullying, women and men of color are just as capable of bullying. 

The only recourse is to move to positions where you are no longer subject to the whims of the bullies.  This is true in science and in other field."

2021-04-13 10:56,"The Biden administration is right. It must continue to distribute vaccine doses based on state populations and nothing else. Mr. Leddy, Governor Whitmer's spokesperson, admitted that in addition to new variants being prevalent, that there are ""Michiganders who are not complying with the governor’s orders"". Try compliance first, then come back and ask for help. 

It's well known that shutdowns, social distancing, and masks are what are needed to bend the pandemic curve. It's not the rest of the country's fault that many Michiganders are choosing infection over responsibility. 

Perhaps Michigan can reach out to other states and ask them to send some vaccine Michigan's way, rather than asking the federal government to favor a state with a disproportionate number of irresponsible citizens over states with a more responsible citizenry."
2021-04-13 10:58,"If the problem is that Michiganders are not complying with the governor’s orders, I am not sure why they should be rewarded with more vaccines at the expense of other states.

Last Spring, Michigan went from third in the nation for COVID infections, down to seventeenth, in a matter of weeks, after her shutdown took effect. Unfortunately, Republicans were aghast at her success, and put a stop to it. Then, they stripped her powers to make sure she didn't try it again. Governor Whitmer has been an outstanding governor, in the most trying of times. My heart goes out to her!"

Even so, diverting vaccine allocated to other states would be robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Any reduction of vaccine allocated to a state could itself lead to preventable suffering and death in that state.

I expect Michigan - and any other state that experiences a surge - to redouble efforts to have people practice the non-pharmaceutical interventions (distance, face coverings, etc.) that sustained us in the days before vaccine came out in December 2020.  It the only fair way."
2021-04-13 11:31,"Dr Walensky seems to be one of a few who are prominently discussing the Michigan outbreak who seems to have a grasp of basic immunology. It takes several weeks for immunity to develop so rushing vaccine to an area will be effective in weeks, not immediately. In the interim one must use immediately effective measures  including distancing, masks, etc.

You will have to deal with a lot of sick people in the interim to achieve immunity, many of whom might not survive long enough. Use what is necessary in the time frame you have to achieve the proper result."
2021-04-13 11:41,"Sending more vaccine to Michigan will initiate similar demands from other states as the variants spread. The measured approach of the Biden Administration is the right way to go. To distribute the meds as planned is a strategy for the country. If some states find the populace to be resistant to wearing masks and engaging in mitigation, then they cannot expect the vaccination protocols to be upended. In any case, vaccination will not provide as rapid a response as masks and quarantine.  The redistribution of vaccine to Michigan is not an appropriate or useful strategy."
2021-04-13 11:43,"The article slightly mentions but does not discuss the third option here: monoclonal antibodies.

These drugs (Regeneron and Lilly) are highly effective at preventing hospitalization but they are logistically challenging. People have to start it within 10 days of infection and they have to go to infusion centers to receive treatment.

Today MI is only using about 20% of the supply they have.  

How about a Federal/State all out effort to reach high risk people who’ve tested positive and provide at no charge transportation and treatment with the MAB drugs. If you can manage hospitalizations then the high infection rate is not an issue."

You could buy alcohol but not plants for a garden?) All those rules made no sense to the general public and as such they have lost faith in her leadership and are tired of being told what to do. Had she gone about the lock down using common sense and a sense a fairness, I think Michigan would be in a different place now. People want common sense government."
2021-04-13 11:14,"I live in the Midwest and many here are too ill informed and too motivated by partisanship to adhere to another lockdown, even to save their lives. The situation is too bad in Michigan for a surge of vaccinations to fix things quickly, so in reality it is what it is.

This is another thing that can be laid at Trump's feet, encouraging people to not utilize common sense solutions like masks, which can definitely save lives."

So all of us who had weathered the big storm of the last year are simply being overwhelmed by what is basically lockdown fatigue.

I often drive by the packed parking lots of bars and restaurants out in the countryside. Everyone in the area knows these businesses are exceeding the capacity mandates, including local law enforcement, but no one takes responsibility to stop them. I see pictures in the local newspapers and on local TV of athletes, refs, and spectators at high school basketball games with no masks or with masks worn on their chins. Again, no one responsible for enforcing the rules (refs, principals, superintendents) will enforce the mandates. The bottom line is that ""strict"" safety mandates do no good when roughly half the population ignores them and actively flaunts their lack of compliance."

I do not understand why our cases are surging, and vaccines won’t help right away, but they should be available to those of us who want to be safe while surrounded by Covidiots."
2021-04-13 12:11,"I'm sorry, but it makes no sense to divert scarce vaccine to states that don't mandate basic precautions.

This would be true even if other vaccines didn't require six weeks to full immunity, meaning that vaccines are not a good method for dealing with a surge.

Send additional vaccine to Michigan.

Rationale: Southern states like Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, etal. have been lagging behind most states in vaccine shots delivered into arms. They are all at approximately 20-30 % versus 40-45 % for states like NY,NJ, NH, Me, VT, CT, RI, ND etc. More to the point they have used only 60 % or so of the vaccine doses delivered to them versus 80-90% in the states in the Northeast and the Dakotas.(All figures cited are from NY Times)

Therefore, send the doses which would have been directed to the laggard southern states to Michigan until the laggards reach 80-90%. There are  millions of doses sitting unused in these southern states which Michigan can put to good use. This will act as a spur to the southern states as well to get their acts together and protect their citizens."

As I see it, if fairness in is the goal, then people living in locations at higher risk (“hot spots”) should have some prioritization in distribution of vaccines and therapeutics.  Basically, fairness should attempt to mitigate risk fairly rather than only consider state populations.  Triaging vaccines to where it is needed most would also be most effective in containing the pandemic."
2021-04-13 11:58,"Send more vaccine immediately to Michigan.

There are many southern states like Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia etc. that are lagging behind both in shots delivered into arms and % of vaccine doses used. Some states are at 60% of shots used versus 90% for the better states like those in New England and the Dakotas. 

As a results there are millions of doses sitting on shelves unused in the laggard states while Michigan is suffering from a virus variant surge.
Send Michigan the doses that would go to the laggard states until they get their % used number up to the average of 80+%. This will encourage laggard states to get shots in arms to protect their citizens."

2021-04-13 12:13,"Why is she referred to as, ‘Ms.’ throughout the article? For crying out loud, she’s the Governor!"
2021-04-13 12:24,"Ms. Whitmer, Shut down this state.  Easy to say but the political ramifications for her are intense, not to mention the domestic terrorists' kidnapping plot against her and the armed takeover of the capitol last year.  However, depending on people to take responsibility is foolish.  Those who won't vote for her 2022 are already dug in.  However those who would consider re-electing Whitmer may be having second thoughts.    I for one wouldn't mind seeing ""that woman from Michigan"" impose tighter shut-downs."
2021-04-13 12:25,"Michigan should require a vaccine passport (or ID), so that only those who have been vaccinated can move freely.  Those who have not been vaccinated would be required to stay at home and wear masks at all times when on necessary trips to the grocery, doctor, etc.  Just as she did when Trump was president, Whitmer needs to step up again on this, for her state and the nation."
2021-04-13 12:27,The response by the CDC to the pleas for more vaccine in Michigan seems smug and callous to me. Shut down the state? They certainly know that the willingness to create civil disorder and plot violence by extreme right-wing people there makes that dangerous and costly in many ways. And then insist on it as though it’s the go-to solution? That seems overt bad faith to me. I don’t know why the governor—who has already been put in danger for her efforts—and the decent people in that state are being put further at risk by the CDC as it pretends to give viable advice that is anything but. And refuses life-saving help that is its very mission.
2021-04-13 12:26,"As my mother says, “Actions have consequences.” About half of Michiganders refuse to wear masks and follow safe practices in order to make a political statement. They also won’t get vaccinated even if more were rushed to the state. It’s their choice to get sick and possibly die. It is a profound shame that the other half are at risk, but presumably they ARE following safe practices and getting vaccinated ASAP. If Whitmer (whom I formerly admired) truly cared about her people, she’d force lockdown and take the political consequences rather than begging to take vaccines away from states (like Maine) that have been highly compliant. As my mother also says, “Don’t reward bad behavior.”"
2021-04-13 12:27,"The issue from the POV of the CDC is that it takes about 2 weeks for the vaccines to become fully effective. It seems reasonable to add in another 7 to 10 days to get a significant number of people vaccinated at best. That means 3 weeks to a month or longer before there can be much impact from vaccination. Vaccination is not a short term solution, which is what is needed in MI. 

Armed protest is a very real issue - happened once, can again, especially in the light of 1/6. The refusal of the Right to deny the reality is the real problem, not the virus."
2021-04-13 12:30,"If here in Michigan we can prove demand for extra vaccines, it does make sense to receive more. Best to nip this in the bud before we spread it throughout the country. Although I fear we already have, as it seems half of the state went to Florida or Arizona for Spring Break. Public Health taking a backseat to personal freedoms seems to be the new mantra."
2021-04-13 12:27,"There are four major factors that govern the spread of the pandemic:
* Behavior (masks, distance, etc)
* Immunity due to infection (there are likely 3 - 5 times as many infections as there are lab-proven cases)
* Immunity due to vaccination
* Increased spread due to genetic variants
The first three decrease the rate of spread, while the variants increase it.  Of these four factors, only rate of vaccination can be established with certainty.  
Lessons:  if you want the pandemic to end, get vaccinated and in the meantime, wear a mask.  
It's our choice:  prevent the spread or be prepared for additional weeks or months of preventable suffering, loss, anxiety and unwelcome intrusions on our lives. 
Everybody wants the pandemic to end.  Be part of the solution or be part of the problem."
2021-04-13 12:33,"Michigan is having a serious problem with the pandemic.

The CDC has proposed a medically sound solution that would work instantly in implemented.  This solution has undesirable economic consequences and faces strong political resistance.  However, it remains a medically sound instant solution.

Michigan has proposed reallocation vaccines allocated to other states to Michigan.  A serious problem with this proposal is that it takes several weeks to work even if the vaccines are reallocated.  Another serious problem is reallocation means taking vaccine from other people many of whom aren't sick because they've made personal sacrifices to stay healthy.

The CDC has a proposal that works, on the table.  Michigan has a proposal that won't work for several weeks or perhaps several months and is ""paid"" by responsible people who live in other states.

It is easy to criticize someone else's solution and it is hard to propose a different solution.  But that is my challenge to the people of Michigan.  The CDC proposed a solution.  Many don't like it but what I don't see from Michigan is a MEDICALLY SOUND alternate proposal.

Do you, the people of Michigan, have one?  If so, what is it and why do you think it is medically sound?"
2021-04-13 12:37,"Take a look at what's going on in Ontario, Canada (Michigan's next-door neighbour to the North). We now have a province-wide shutdown. This will be Canada's 3rd wave in battling the virus. 

This variant is extremely contagious, more dangerous, affecting younger folks and has ZERO boundaries.

ICUs in the province are at full capacity. A children's hospital in Toronto has opened its beds to adults to assist in the effort. 

What is happening in Canada can easily happen to America."
2021-04-13 12:34,"I have relatives in Michigan who do not intend to get vaccinated, even though one of their extended family was really sick with covid and is now a long hauler.  It is beyond me how anyone could go into a resturant, take off their mask and consume a meal during a pandemic.  Just because you can, doesn't mean you should!  Trouble is, what happens in Florida, Michigan and anywhere in the U.S. affects all, even as some states are more structured in their reopening efforts and are willing to take steps back as necessary.  Give Michigan some extra doses contingent upon tightening up basic social distancing measures."
2021-04-13 12:33,"The tools to control the outbreak are already in their hands ... masks, distancing, etc... If citizens of Michigan demonstrate their ‘personal responsibility’,  they could control the outbreak.  Rushing to vaccinate by re-allocating from other recipients isn’t equitable."
2021-04-13 12:33,"While I understand why Michigan and other hot spots want the extra vaccine Team Biden is doing the right thing by sticking to an equitable distribution.

The political fallout if Michigan and others get priority and the shortage elsewhere causes a huge spike would be horrendous and you can absolutely bet it would be some Red State that had the problem if Team Biden caved and gave Michigan and the others an extra share at the expense of other States. 

With all our other problems we can ill afford to have Biden's Administration playing favorites with Blue States when it comes to vaccine distribution.

This has to remain based on population until supply is no longer a problem."
2021-04-13 12:37,"When US is done vaccinating within its borders and starts helping to vaccinate the other countries, will it be spreading the available vaccine evenly based on population, or concentrate on hot zones? It is obvious to me to give as much vaccines as possible to the countries with rising infection to prevent the worse outcome.

And we need to do the same here - Texas can wait, give more to Michigan and others where cases are rising."
2021-04-13 12:36,If the governor is not going to take control of her state then it is a waste of vaccine to just give her more and have infection rates continue climbing because she has not or will not lock down the offenders
2021-04-13 12:38,"Like most states, Michigan has a rural/urban political divide. 

The virus hot spots are in rural counties that voted overwhelmingly for Trump. The vast majority in these counties have no use for Democrats, particularly governor Whitmer and will not follow her directives.

As the article notes, our gerrymandered legislature is controlled by Republicans. 

This court makeup changed after the 2020 election, but the then Republican majority Michigan Supreme Court ruled that Whitmer's legislated authority to make pandemic decisions is unconstitutional.

The right wing dominance of politics in Michigan is lessening. Statewide elections are won by Democrats. The Michigan Supreme Court again has a Democratic majority. Our huge gerrymandering problem looks like it will be fixed in time for 2022 elections.

Whitmer can't convince Trumpers to do what they don't want to do, but the end result of this resulting tragedy may be a complete political reversal in Michigan, with all three branches of government controlled by Democrats after the 2022 election."
2021-04-13 12:51,"I really feel for the Governor. She knows what should be done, but, politically is in state that for reasons I do not understand has lost its collective mind. Actually, I did go to college in Michigan, and I do get the urban/rural divide, and even had some experiences with, Besty DeVoss types, but, still found it to be a sensible state. I must have missed something along the way."
2021-04-13 12:50,"Here in Alabama, we were on the nation’s worst list for months. We had a mask mandate and kept things open, schools/businesses/youth sports. Anti-maskers were resistant at first (there wasn’t much enforcing people to wear masks) but when anti-masker’s friends and relatives started getting really sick and or dying plus realized hospitals were maxed out, they stepped in line and put on their mask. It sounds like Michigan’s citizens are going to have to learn like us, the hard way. Let them resist self-protective masks & distancing and see how it works out. I suspect Alabama rates are lower— not because of lack of testing — because we’re experiencing herd immunity-ish status with our mix of vaccinated people, masked-up folks, and people who already had Covid. 

Lockdowns are not the solution (it only delays the inevitable)...Weirdly, keeping things open IS the answer."
2021-04-13 12:55,"We missed an opportunity to get single vaccine doses in twice as many people, as the UK did. Michigan is only an example of this error in the US, partially brought on by scientific dogma. Two shots, 3 or 4 weeks apart, for the mRNA vaccines is only a guess. It was structured that way in clinical trials because it was expedient. The UK took a calculated risk, and they are now in a much better position. Just because we make like our science guys/girls, and view them as good, decent people, doesn't mean they are making sound decisions."
2021-04-13 12:57,"The premise of this piece is simply incorrect.
It's not either vaccinations or lockdown.

It could and should be both.

The Governor is correct to ask for more vaccine supply and the Federal government is wrong to stick to their population-based formula without consideration of severity of a local outbreak.

However the CDC is correct in calling for a resumption of lockdown orders in Michigan. Things really are that bad there.

Unfortunately the non-compliant - with masking, with stay-at home orders, and with vaccines, are a huge obstacle to the public health. 

Still don't have the faintest clue how the Republican Party became so anti-science and frankly dangerous."
2021-04-13 12:46,"Whitmer is wrong.  I do not think she can demand vaccine to take the heat off her failure to do the right thing.  Both are necessary, but she tries to sooth the right-wing in her state by not doing her duty on this.  I am not for giving them more vaccine than they would be entitled to.  Vaccine is only part of the cure.  Sorry Governor, I supported you before, but not on your failed protection of even the unwilling in your State."
2021-04-13 12:52,"Equity? Are you kidding? Federal distribution may have been based on population, but equity went down the drain when states took over from there. We oldsters waited while some states opened up to younger people. We waited while teachers, school staff got priority. Prisoners, with no voice, waited and died while Florida handed out doses to select ....neighborhoods. Grocery workers, with high risk, may still be waiting. 

So I have to go with Dr. Topol- send the extra vaccines other states aren’t using...transport what you can and at least try. It’s the variants- which were evidently not in the initial distribution decisions. 

Michigan may have been lax is masking, distancing, but so weren’t many parts of nearly every state. We are one. One nation. All the tools, masks, distance, vaccinators, help in distributing what you have....yes. But send the extra vaccines. Who knows, maybe my state, yours, will be the next hot spot. It is, as the doctor says, flexibility. One of our greatest assets."
2021-04-13 12:44,"Objections to ""shut-downs"" are economic.  How about temporarily closing businesses where close contact increases risk for contagion, such as  bars, nail salons, indoor dining in restaurants, gyms, and paying those workers and owners to stay home for 2 weeks through the paycheck protection plan.  Isn't that what this plan is all about?  
And, of course, accelerate vaccination for everyone."
2021-04-13 12:02,I wish we could deny health care to deniers.
2021-04-13 12:45,"This development is a bad looks for the Biden administration.  The constant emphasis on equity, bordering on obsession, will be their undoing."
2021-04-13 12:51,"I blame Governor Whitmer’s problems directly on the Republican Legislature. They are the ones playing Russian Roulette with citizens lives. They egged on those groups that threatened Whitmer’s life because she ordered the much needed lock down and this increase in virus infections lays squarely on their shoulders. Then they take away most of her authority. What kind of humans are these Republicans.

If States like Mississippi have excess vaccines because their citizens believe all of the false information they are given, then they should have to send their vaccines back to the Feds to be distributed where they are most needed. 

Shame on the Michigan and every other State where the Legislature is interfering with the rights  of citizens whose very lives are being threatened because of people like the Republicans in power think it is ok not to wear masks and Social distance. Simple things to prevent the spread of the  deadly Covid-19 virus."
2021-04-13 12:55,All I here from Dems is politics is a zero sum game. Republicans know how to play that game well also. The next election is around the corner if you don’t like what happening in these states win.
2021-04-13 13:04,"When will people realize its not the cases, its the hospitalizations and deaths that are important.  Without cases people don't build immunity.  Its either that or a vaccine.  All this article says is hospitalizations have ""doubled"" in recent weeks and gives no specific data. Nothing on number of deaths. Cases are up primarily with younger people not at risk.   The bottom line is we're past the point of lockdowns.  Anyone seriously at risk knows what to do right now and if they choose not to do it, that's their choice.  We can't cripple the economy and millions of people's lives anymore to save a few."
2021-04-13 13:04,"Grew up in Michigan; went to college there and moved to Virginia as an adult.

Folks in the South are always surprised when I tell them about the white supremacy/libertarian/militia strain that runs deep in the state.

Based on the worst locations, it looks like those, Trump supporters and skeptical African Americans are driving up cases."
2021-04-13 11:53,"I’m sorry Michigan finds itself in this predicament. But, it’s not up to the Biden Administration to “surge” vaccine to “hotspots”. Full vaccination and immunity — with J&J now reportedly paused — will take what? 8 weeks? I see that case counts are up, but I don’t see hospital numbers in any of these stories. If it’s just that the positive tests are up, that’s less worrisome than hospital census out of control. Remember, the goal used to be “flatten the curve” of hospital admissions, not kill the virus. I don’t support lockdowns in any state now. “Covid fatigue” means no one will pay attention.

When I look at the states that are now “up” I’d like to match how many of those residents might have been on the beaches of Florida during Spring Break."
2021-04-13 11:32,"In case you wondered if the virus has been politicized in Michigan, now you have proof.  A year ago there was still a president that needed to be defeated by any means so Whitmer destroyed the economy.  Now, with the worst covid numbers in the country, she is keeping things open because she now has her own election to worry about."
2021-04-13 12:46,"I live in the state of Michigan. The area that I live in is heavily Republican. I previously lived in the New York metropolitan area for thirty years. I am a Warren democrat. I think that Governor Whitmer is doing a terrific job. I voted for her and I will vote for her again. My thought is if your house is on fire in the back bedroom and the fire truck shows up, do you send it out to the cow barn? No, you go to where the fire is.  I am a senior citizen. I have been in self imposed lockdown for over a year now. I finally got my first jab and will get the second one on Friday. I tried several times to get an appointment for the vaccine. The only places available required transportation. I couldn’t get the vaccine because there was no transportation available. Then, out of nowhere, I got an invite from Michigan Medicine at a clinic close by for the vaccine. I jumped on it immediately. The yahoos that showed up in protest at the state Capitol shouldn’t affect my ability to get the vaccine. Some guy standing there with an assault rifle on the front steps of the Capitol crying because he needs a haircut. He doesn’t want to wear a mask or make a sacrifice for the greater whole. This person should not affect my ability to get the jab. President Biden has done an outstanding job thus far. Please President Biden, send the fire truck to Michigan. Governor Whitmer needs your support."
2021-04-13 12:40,Of course she doesn’t want to shut down the state. The last time she did they tried to kidnap her!
2021-04-13 12:58,There are thousands of doses in Alabama and Mississippi that are on ice because the residents don’t want them. Pack em up and  send them to Michigan.
2021-04-13 12:52,"Many counties here have 70% refusal to vaccinate.  There will be a continued outbreak here, and eventually everywhere else, as the varients become more and more contagious.

The problem is the people who have voluntarily joined this death cult.  Like all cults, it is hard to free them.  Especially as the right-wing media ecosystem continues to lie and embrace Trumpism.

We are in for a long endemic.

Next up, Republicans will campaign that Biden did not convince rural Trumpists to vaccinate.  And they will blame him."
2021-04-13 13:02,"What happened to following the science, Madam Governor?
Or is it just political science that you follow?"
2021-04-13 13:02,No amount of COVID 19 vaccine will protect people that willingly ingest the poison of disinformation.
2021-04-13 13:04,"Governor Whitmer must do her job and shut down her state.

Haven’t we yet learned that the virus doesn’t care about politics?"
2021-04-13 13:21,"More vaccine may not help mitigate the spread in rural/ conservative parts of the state.  In Ohio, Gov. DeWine is touring rural regions to encourage folks to get the shots.  It is well known that if you are having a hard time getting an appointment in Columbus all you need to do is drive 20 to 30 miles and appointments are easy to find!   Gov. Witmer is in a tough spot regarding the re-implementation of any lifted lockdown measures.  I imagine the Republicans in the Michigan State House are pursuing measures similar to what they did in Ohio. Ohio's legislature passed and overrode DeWine's veto of a bill that severely limits the Governor's ability to impose health orders."
2021-04-13 12:01,"Gov. Whitmer’s mounting crisis seems to lie as much with her undisciplined, regressive population as with variants. Those of us in the West and South can’t  get smug. According to epidemiologists, there’s a cycle to this thing - remember?  We’re next, especially taking into consideration warmer weather and loosening restrictions. I live in a little town that is solid Republican. People love their “freedoms” but don’t respect mine. Thankfully, I get my second shot Friday."
2021-04-13 13:18,"“Which is why it’s important for us to ramp up vaccinations as quickly as possible,” he said.

A vaccine won't help people who already are suffering from the virus.  I think the reason why the governor of Michigan doesn't want to lock down the state is to avoid a backlash like last year.   And that is too bad, because ultimately Gov. Whitmer got high marks for her resistance to open Michigan up.  Now is the time to do it if there ever was one, but this time she's resisting the experts."
2021-04-13 13:17,The governor should get her people in line. In other states we follow the measures. Why should they be rewarded for breaking them?
2021-04-13 13:22,"I doubt Whitmer and Biden will suffer any long term consequences from this episode . She asked for a surge of vaccines,  he said no, with perfectly good reasons. Now she has to suggest to the reckless and carefree residents of her state that they be more vigilant. Masks, distancing, limiting public gatherings. Same old remedy. Biden is projecting leadership with a plan. Whitmer will now, as she has in the past do the same thing. Vaccines won't work to interrupt the current surge. Behavioral changes will."
2021-04-13 13:35,"Arguing for a vaccine surge, Michigan Lt. Gov Gilchrist pointed out that equity is about shifting focus to areas where there is the most need, which is clearly Michigan right now. I don't understand why the Biden admin is putting pressure on the state to lockdown. Governor Whitmer doesn't have the same powers she had a year ago, and people do not have the same willingness to follow those orders. 

Bottom line is this is not just a Michigan problem. These variants will continue to spread to other states, many of which are more open, have dropped their mask mandates, and are behind in vaccinations. A hot spot strategy feels like the right approach, but instead I fear we're going to continue stretching this crisis out even longer."
2021-04-13 13:23,"Please, no quarreling as we see currently in display in Germany.  The only winner will be the Covid-family, spreading with abandon and having a grand time.

Both have to be done in order to make life miserable for the virus and its relatives: vaccination and shutdown."
2021-04-13 13:33,"My daughter lives in Michigan in one of the hotspots. She has relatives who work in health care who are refusing to get vaccinated. And then, one of them put out a message decrying the fact that, when the pandemic first started, the public was completely behind hospital personnel, but now, even though the hospitals are chock full of COVID19 patients, people aren't saying thank you to nurses and doctors, not sending them food, etc. ""A little thank you goes a long way when these patients are dying right in front of them."" Yet this nurse herself won't get vaccinated, because ""no one's going to TELL ME what to do."" It's Trump country, and when my daughter tells people that Trump and Melania were both vaccinated, they say ""fake news."" My husband and I haven't seen our grandchildren since December 2019. We are supposed to go there at the end of May. We are fully vaccinated but are not sure we want to travel if Michigan, especially in Port Huron, which has been cited in the NYT, can't get its act together. Yes, medical personnel should still be getting our gratitude. Yes, we're all still weary of this. But to me, that means we should all be doing EVERYTHING possible to minimize the spread of this virus. Michigan Republicans don't seem to care and/or have a path for their followers except to spew ""fake news"" themselves."
2021-04-13 13:08,I live in deep blue Detroit.  Plenty of masks below noses and chin strapped.  Also an abundance of vaccines with large well run vaccine centers that have extra doses available to anyone at the end of each day.
2021-04-13 13:39,"Perhaps the thought of being kidnapped and killed, has the governor afraid to lock the state down."
2021-04-13 12:50,"This article doesn't acknowledge that since last spring Governor Whitmer's powers to shut down the state have been thwarted by the GOP-led state legislature.

Tell Ron Weiser and his cronies to stop dragging down the state."
2021-04-13 11:25,"Gov. Whitmer is stuck between a rock and a hard place. She knows that the people of the state are sick and tired of the lock down and she knows that a lock down again is the right thing to do, to save lives.
This country needs to admit that they don't have the virus under control and do the adult thing, lock it back down."
2021-04-13 11:51,"The CDC Director - & The NY Times - seem unaware that the Michigan’s legislature stripped Whitmer of her emergency powers.  

& if The NY Times did some research, they would find that other Republican legislatures have stripped Democratic governors of similar powers.  See Wisconsin for one."
2021-04-13 13:32,"So the Governor has bowed to the people who wanted to 
kidnap her.She has showed that she can be pushed around
by bullies.She is in a place where what she is doing is not satisfying either group.I feel sorry for the people of Michigan."
2021-04-13 11:38,"She wants to keep her job and advance politically in Michigan. 
 And not be kidnapped or assassinated by some group of under informed over armed people. 
  Many who occupy seats in the republican dominated gerrymandered anti science state legislature. 
  Who removed much of her power to shut down the state.
  She is stuck with the unenviable task of herding cats with fleas. And the fleas carry the plague."
2021-04-13 13:41,"I am with Gov. Whitmer on this one. Biden's administration shall do what the governor is seeking because she knows her state's pulse, not the WH. 
Let us hope Biden listens to Governor for once."
2021-04-13 13:25,"What happened to the CDC telling us that we have a lot (80%) of protection from the virus two weeks after the first shot?  Now, they are saying six weeks before we are protected.  Why not at least try to get more first doses and unused vaccinations from states such as Mississippi and Alabama to states where it could save lives?  Government bureaucracy at its worst!"
2021-04-13 13:20,"Why can’t they just give her more vaccine. I hate what is happening and it happens all the time, someone makes a decision and because they made the decision they will not change their mind. Just give Michigan more vaccine and see if it helps stem the tide, this is how you learn, this is how you experiment. You on,y learn through bold initiative,

This is such a male way of thinking, letting ego get in the way."
2021-04-13 13:22,"The last time Gov. Whitmer tried to do the right thing and shut down the state, her life was threatened and the statehouse was occupied by radical right wing nuts. Sadly, it still is, sort of, by a Republican legislature who would rather hogtie her than allow her to do the right thing.

And yet, as bad as that is, that’s not the real immediate problem. Much as I love and respect President Biden, I disagree with how his administration is handling this. Triage is necessary. Vaccines need to go where they are needed most. I understand that the vaccination rollout has been rough and even; the scorched-earth nation that The Former Guy left Biden with hasn’t made it easy. Still, intense and increasing clusters of the virus should be getting the most urgent attention, especially with issues in the supply chain. When you have a wildfire, you first extinguish its source, not its fringe embers. It is time to control this invisible monster which is killing our country, its citizens and its spirit to the greatest extent possible."
2021-04-13 13:34,"If a Governor of a Red State can lift the mask mandate and open up the State despite pleas from the local health community, Mayors and City Judges, why can the MI Governor ask for a mask mandate, limit crowd in public places and have the schools do remote learning and employees WFH till she can get the vaccines and start vaccinating people in large numbers. You cannot control the spread  by vaccinating people  while opening up the State when the virus is surging at this level."
2021-04-13 13:09,"Given what happened in Michigan if I were Governor Whitmer I wouldn't do anything either.  She tried to do what was advised and what was her reward:  almost being kidnapped.  If this were the Black Plague most of the people who are refusing to take precautions would be dead now.  It's not and we've been lucky but if the responses we've seen from Americans are anything to go by, a great many care very little for anyone but themselves."
2021-04-13 13:32,"My wife and I volunteer on weekends at Autzen Stadium  to fill out vaccine cards and check legibility and signatures. Last weekend we did 2800 people each day, nearly 15,000 county-wide. We rank right next to Michigan in vaccination, around 30th in the country.  We and Michigan have used 80% of our allotment.

This weekend, we will be vaccinating at least 5000 fewer people, not opening one facility.  J and J has been paused.  Our cases have increased here, too, just not as bad.  At least so far.  

There are six states in the Deep South with far lower percentages of vaccinations used, 4 with only  64% used. This disparity means millions of vaccines are unused there which immediately need to be shipped elsewhere. Michigan can use them, so can we, and I know other states can as well.

Equity and diversity are all well and good, but I have no patience with stupidity and denial of facts being part of diversity that we must treat equitably."
2021-04-13 13:34,"Mandate the lock down NOW!  This should be non-negotiable to any areas of the country where there is a surge.  And for the residents that refuse to be inoculated they need to adhere or be placed on house arrest until they get vaccinated.  If we have to bring in the National Guard so be it.
We cannot leave sensitive political careers or the average Joe to navigate what they perceive to be the right path to controlling the transmission.
No more foolish games.  It's time for the heavy hand to show it's cards."
2021-04-13 13:44,I live in Michigan. Visiting Republican areas of the state means you will see no face masks or no social distancing. This problem is a political issue. These folks will sacrifice themselves and there neighbors to make a political statement.
2021-04-13 13:33,Why would they not do both— lockdown AND accelerate vaccinations? Only one answer I can think of: Michigan has a lot of people who don’t want to be vaccinated and some portion of their current vaccine allocation is being thrown away? This is why the Feds don’t want to give them more?
2021-04-13 13:29,She has few options. Gov. Whitmer was actually stripped of her emergency management powers last year by the legislature.  Anything she tries to do has to be with their consent. Guess what won't happen?
2021-04-13 13:36,"The advice given to Governor Whitmer is the best way to proceed . Any vaccine given now will take about one month to have any effect whereas universal mask use and keeping your distance works faster and with  no sore shoulder. 
     Both methods have advantages but masks and social distancing have a more immediate effect. Sometimes a silver bullet places second to a piece of cotton"
2021-04-13 13:33,"There are many lessons:
A virus has no brain and belongs to no political party.  It reproduces within your cells imperfectly, with errors in copying leading to new strains.  Some are more infectious.  So far we don't have strains that are not covered by the vaccine, but given enough time, we may.  Then we will have to start all over.

It takes between 5-7 weeks to develop full immunity with the vaccine, but only 3-5 days to become sick once exposed to the virus if the victim is not vaccinated previously.

Ignorance and political bias are very difficult things to counter and can cause people to adopt foolish and dangerous behavior.

Once adopted, these behaviors may be harmful to others, but ignorance and bias result in a lack of concern for the well being of others, especially if they don't share political  beliefs.

If persistent, you can intimidate even intelligent and well meaning people into not doing what they know is best.  This is a fact of life that will be with us for the long foreseeable future.

Or as Walt Kelley said in Pogo: ""We have met the enemy and he is us""

Sorry Governor Whitmer, you are going to have to watch the death of many constituents and the overload of your healthcare system. But at least my child will get to play sports and I will be able to shop and dine out."
2021-04-13 13:27,"Our fundamental liberty is life, without which nothing matters.  Here in Michigan it is the Republican controlled legislature, more radical than in some other states, that shares a major part of the blame.  

Yes, the variants play a big factor, but anyone who lives here, if honest with themselves, knows how much pushback there has been against reasonable restrictions.  The GOP here, aided and abetted by Trump and radical groups, has denied science in some cases while shouting that precious liberties are being infringed upon in most cases of restrictions. 

There are many red areas of this state where you can drive in small cities and towns and see large numbers of people unmasked or bunched close together in restaurants.  These people, with their science-denying and sometimes radical ideology, are responsible for an untenable health situation and a political environment that borders on libertarian anarchism.

No matter that courts historically have backed government's right to impose severe measures in epidemics.  These folks don't only deny science, they ignore history as well.  God help us if folks like prevail in the coming years.  Viruses have destroyed empires.  We should all be concerned."
2021-04-13 13:36,"Motivated by my own position that it is easy to criticize and hard to propose solutions, I've done some criticizing and I feel like I should propose a solution.

Several have said that Gov. Whitmer should simply shut down her state.  My objection is that, while she could issue an order, I don't think there would be sufficient compliance.  It isn't feasible to arrest a million people.

I don't see good options but that isn't an excuse. 

I think the Governor should invite opposition leaders to a PUBLIC discussion with the goal of finding a solution.  NOT a debate but a problem solving discussion.

I suggest opening with the CDC suggested shutdown, how it is medically sound but also has negative economic impact and faces strong political opposition.  

Follow up with the ""we want more vaccines"" proposal and state the problems with that.  (1) the federal government isn't willing to take vaccines from other states and (2) if the vaccines were available it will take several weeks to have a positive effect.

Then open the floor to invite anyone to make proposals that can be implemented and also solve the problem.

While I doubt there are other solutions, there might be.  Why not at least try?

And if there aren't, then I'd like the opposition people to explain themselves.  (One advantage of doing this on live TV)"
2021-04-13 13:40,"This latest surge may have to do with people letting their guard down but the solution is exactly what the CDC said yesterday. The closures from last November are clearly needed here. 
Why can't the Governor just follow the CDC here? She has the same power as last November. 
It's a sad argument that vaccines will fix this latest surge. I'm tired of hearing how ""personal responsibility"" will lower infections now. We have heard the same talking points from other governors the last few months. If people haven't been responsible the last year then they won't now. 
If she want's lower infection rates ASAP then she could do it. She is dancing around the solution here which she doesn't want to mention but the CDC did. 
I have lost a lot of respect for the governor the last few weeks by her stalling of needed measures to protect the public!  
You can't go wrong following public health guidelines. The Canadians across the river seem to be doing it."
2021-04-13 14:21,It seems an open question as to how much benefit additional vaccine dosages may have in Michigan. High rates of refusal/noncompliance w simple masking/behavioral precautions likely correlate w high rates of vaccine refusal. Creating large unvaccinated pockets seems likely to blunt the efficacy of the vaccine.
2021-04-13 14:25,"I suspect Ms Whitmer is now afraid of having to impose restrictions (something she was able to do earlier in the pandemic) which is sadly understandable because of the personal threats to her life.

If Michigan were the only state and there was plenty of vaccine it’d be ok, but I have to agree with the CDC - we can’t be held ‘hostage’ by people who decide to flout common sense and place themselves and others at risk. I also wonder how many of her ‘liberty-loving’ constituents would even accept to receive the vaccine"
2021-04-13 13:55,"It looks like Michigan is in a state of flux- the article didn't say how fully opened the state is but with the unwillingness of the electorate to go along with a new lockdown- they have what they have- a real mess. 
I don't blame the Governor for not locking down and instead pleading for more vaccine- she has a bunch of right wing terrorists who have tried to kidnap and kill her to deal with.
And the Biden administration who seems to be pretty efficient in getting the vaccine to states can't reverse course and start playing whack-a-mole with distribution- that wouldn't be fair to the states who are following lockdown mandates.
Unfortunately, Michigan is in a tough place- between the new variants and citizens who refuse to follow guidelines.
New Mexico seems to be doing a good job- why not look there for replication?"
2021-04-13 13:57,Our son is a front line health care worker at a major Detroit hospital. He is in despair. He tells us of co workers refusing to vaccinate and of their mocking those that have been. This plague is far from finished. There is no light in this tunnel only more darkness.
2021-04-13 14:19,Relief in six weeks or relief tomorrow? I know what I'd choose.
2021-04-13 14:38,What state does the Governor think should get fewer shots so she can have more.
2021-04-13 14:22,"Even today, every governor could save some lives by locking down their state - but none want to incur that political and real $ cost. Republicans AND democrats included."
2021-04-13 13:59,I hope President Biden will remind Dr. Walensky that Governor Whitmer is also a Democrat.  They are on the same team.  Before going on TV and criticizing a teammate you should try to  work out a solution behind the scenes.

People aka African primate apes are acting according to their DNA evolutionary fit nature as well."
2021-04-13 14:10,"Why does it have to be the federal government who steps in to give more vaccines? If states think they have an “excess” of vaccines, let them share with Michigan—just like the States shared PPE and ventilators."
2021-04-13 14:15,"This article  is woefully uninformed. Governor Whitmer was doing a great job of keeping Michiganders safe last year through her emergency orders. However, the Republican legislature forced the issue and via the state Supreme Court, took Whitmer's emergency powers away. 

Whitmer's hands are tied. She was stripped of her authority to act so she cannot do anything now. It is up to the Republican Legislature to take action, but they're just sitting on their hands. Our Health department has been issuing warnings, but without the power of law, no one's listening. 

I would ask that the authors of this article include this information in the article because as it stands, people here are blaming Governor Whitmer for not taking action."
2021-04-13 14:21,"Shut down is a viable option, but even if ordered, it will not be followed. The pollution of trump here is so complete that discovery of PFAS is hailed as a sign of an improving environment."
2021-04-13 14:05,"The administration and CDC are correct.  Even if everyone in MI who wanted to were to be vaccinated today, it wouldn't begin to take effect for a while, with the disease meanwhile spiking exponentially.  It's ironic that this administration's quarrel with Whittmer--""lock down""--is the opposite of the previous one's--""liberate""."
2021-04-13 14:21,"Governor Whitmer finds herself in a state with an ungovernable population. She has already faced a violent showdown and threats directed against her personally after she enforced a lockdown. Dr. Walensky's advice is tone-deaf--a nonstarter-- given the don't tread on me mentality of the electorate in that state. Governor Whitmer understands the facts on the ground better than the administration in Washington, D.C. President Biden should listen and give the governor the help requested in additional doses of vaccine, since states such as Mississippi are not even using their quota and the deadly variant is on the rise in her particular state. A slavish devotion to the numbers game creates inequity because of the differences among the states in compliance and in prevalence of the variant. Slavitt's idea of figuring out more efficient administration of the doses is also a good idea. Gov. Whitmer is a smart, competent woman, aware of what her state needs and how to handle it. Armchair generals should defer to her.  Give her what she needs to win the Covid war in Michigan."
2021-04-13 14:26,"Nobody seems to be pointing out that Michigan is essentially just catching up with the rest of the country. Our total Covid numbers have been relatively low compared to many other states, probably in part because we’ve been so aggressively locked down for so long. Nor does this article point out that a large majority of our current caseload is made up of young people. As a result, our daily death rate is low. 

We are still at reduced capacity for many things. I live in the largest county in the state, and masks are everywhere. I reject the assertion that Michiganders are just a bunch of yahoos who need to be reigned in by government — and I’m surprised and pleased that our governor is taking the stance that she has."
2021-04-13 14:00,American people want their leaders to be non-partisan and fair. President Biden is doing the right thing by not favoring Michigan over other States in the supply of coronavirus vaccine.
2021-04-13 14:33,"We used to live in Monroe, one of the towns on the NYT high infection rate list. The demographics of all these towns are entirely different - from Monroe and Adrian at one end to Detroit and Flint at the other. Racial, housing and income disparities do not seem to be the issue. My sense is that close working conditions in the myriad automobile plants in and around all these towns (plus the state penitentiary in Jackson) are probably the drivers of the infection. This is like here in North Carolina and out in the Midwest in the early days when meat processing plants and prisons were the epicenters in otherwise rural areas. Has either the state or federal government done the basic epidemiology research? Shutting down hair salons and restaurants like Biden and company suggest is not the answer if the factories, which would stay open as “essential” businesses, are the vector. Targeted MANDATORY vaccines for specific worker groups and their families would make more sense. But with no real research, at least none published, how is one supposed to make rational decisions?"
2021-04-13 14:38,I’m not sure taxpayer funded antibody treatments should be sent to people who refused to comply with wearing masks.  Why should the medical community be exposed to a potentially fatal illness for people who don’t believe in science except when they need lifesaving measures requiring science.  Cherry picking scientific facts and treatments as needed is so tiresome and selfish at this point.  Sounds horrible but I feel horribly resentful towards those who continue  to fuel Covid by their selfish acts.
2021-04-13 14:14,"The last time Gov. Whitmer ordered masking, distancing, and the closure of crowded venues, people stormed the capitol with the stated intention of finding and executing her! I think she knows the CDC is right, but she is not just trying to protect her political career: she is trying to protect her life! And- she knows a lockdown order will never get through the Republican legislature in Michigan Some of these rightwing Michiganders are crazy. She's in an utterly impossible position.
Trump's politicization of science has done more harm, and continues to do more damage, than any one person in the history of this country."
2021-04-13 13:57,"Politicians running for office employ powerful, convincing, slickly-produced media campaigns to get their messages out, which have been seen to be very effective. Wouldn't it be equally effective if state Governors initiated mass public education messages targeted the hold-outs in their states on the importance of vaccination and following covid prevention guidelines? Could they re-program the brainwashed, or enough of them to turn the tide?"
2021-04-13 14:02,"The debate on what to do about hotspots during the vaccine rollout, and the effectiveness of imposing or reimposing restrictions is full of ethical gray areas. 

But I am very disheartened by the general consensus that people “deserve” a dangerous disease. This is not just affecting those who refuse to follow recommendations. If COVID were able to be contained to those out and about who refuse to wear masks, lockdowns wouldn’t have ever been necessary. There are many people who have taken precautions who have gotten and continue to get sick. 

Please don’t let frustration with the pandemic blunt your compassion."
2021-04-13 14:37,"Just to be clear, Michigan is not ""at loggerheads"" with President Biden, they're at loggerheads with public health experts.  Vaccination doesn't prevent transmission RIGHT NOW, it prevents cases 6-8 weeks later.  Preventing transmission right now is done by social distancing and wearing masks."
2021-04-13 14:30,"With a limited supply of vaccine, any additional vaccine sent to MI means less vaccine elsewhere. In addition, vaccine is not a treatment but is a preventive measure. Surging vaccine may make theoretical sense insofar as responding to increased transmissability of variants. Far better and far easier steps include masking, hand-washing and social distancing. This is a tempest born in part from ignorance."
2021-04-13 14:27,"Biden and Whitmer aren't at odds with each other as much as they are at odds will Republican idiots who equate ""freedom"" with ""freedom from responsibility"". People who have decided to live their lives at odds with science, logic, reason, and basic common sense in accordance with Republican Orthodoxy."
2021-04-13 14:46,"I like the suggestion by ""Hugh"" below.  Invite the leaders of the opposition (those same leaders who are anti-science and have hamstrung her at every turn) to a televised session, where they will be asked to come up with solutions to this problem. If they refuse to be televised, that will already tell you something.  Either way, the meeting should be recorded and the public informed of the results.  If the Republican opposition refuses to accept the idea of any restrictions, then they can bear responsibility for more deaths and cases.  If they (by some miracle) decide that a shutdown is warranted, then perhaps some of those well-armed ""freedom fighters"" will land at their offices for a change. It may give them a taste of what Gov. Whitmer has had to deal with."
2021-04-13 14:52,"I am well and truly puzzled that the pushback against this misguided idea of a vaccine surge hasn't been led with the fact that it won't work.  Even if all the vaccine doses in the world were shipped to Michigan, the time it would take to vaccinate everyone who wants it (many weeks) plus the time lag for it to become effective (more weeks) plus the likelihood that you can't reach herd immunity anyway because of kids and vaccine hesitancy... it could be the end of summer (or beyond) before the vaccination rates became high enough to stop the surge without other measures.  By then, all of Michigan will have COVID at the current rate of exponential growth."
2021-04-13 15:00,"I live in Michigan and got the first dose of my vaccine almost 3 weeks ago, but I had to drive to Ohio to do it as they had opened up eligibility to 16+ earlier than Michigan did. I'm in my 40's and have asthma, so when the numbers started climbing again, I wanted to get in as quickly as possible. It was so frustrating to see the very slow vaccine rollout going on in our state.I do NOT want Whitmer to shut the state down though. I've been supportive of her overall, but there would be way too much pushback at this point from all sides, and our kids need to be in school."
2021-04-13 15:08,"I’m from Alabama, where every afternoon, sites are urging people to come in and get unused shots. I know other states have the same issue. I don’t think it would hurt to redirect a small percentage from states such as mine to states with surges. A wholesale reallocation would like lead to pushback and wouldn’t be effective in any event because of lack of vaccinators and other logistics. With that said, the governor needs to lead and reimpose restrictions."
2021-04-13 15:22,"Some states have an excess of vaccines. What’s wrong with donating those to hotspots, in return for getting doses back once the crisis is over?
The National Guards could have these transported almost overnight.

We’re all in this together."
2021-04-13 14:52,The governor is calling for personal responsibility and lots of Michiganders are showing they only care about themselves. Well you will reap what you sew. For the record I am fully vaccinated.
2021-04-13 15:08,"Michigan is full of people like the so-called conservatives here who resist any and all measures to prevent the disease (except keeping out non-European travelers and immigrants) and who will, guaranteed, claim that failure to contain the disease is somehow the fault of Liberals, Mexicans, Antifa, Fauci, and, of course, the dread SOROS."

2021-04-13 14:02,"Michigan's Republicans are reaping what they have so enthusiastically sowed: refusal to follow reasonable guidelines, abandoning common sense, and thinking of state officials who try to contain the virus spread as “witches” (so said Michigan Republican chair, multi-millionaire, and University Regent Ron Weiser). Their selfish and short-sighted responses recall the repeated stupid mismanagement of Michigan's auto companies in the face of foreign competition from the 1950s down to the present. And so there may be many fewer Michigan Republicans alive to vote in 2022 and 2024...."
2021-04-13 14:35,"I particularly appreciate the style and substance of the Republican protesters featured in the in-line photo. Apparently they've given up the fur and horns look and retained the near-100% channeling-the-military garb. Oh, what a corps of fit Marine Corps types they aren't! Fat, out-of-shape, beer addled cosplay people mostly, with the unfortunate feature of real guns to go along with with the fake man look.

And now, one can see the strategic value in the governor's position. CDC has advocated rapid vaccination in response to variant outbreaks. Why not take some of the refused-by-white-Republican-men vaccine doses from Arizona and try sending them to Detroit? Both Biden and Whitmer have a point in the argument, as far as I'm concerned."
2021-04-13 14:00,"The last time gov. Whitmer displayed outstanding leadership and courage, and shut her state down, she was physically threatened with kidnapping and death. White right wingnuts armed with AK-47s stormed into the Capitol in Lansing, and still hold sway over republican control of that state.

There is a troika of heroes in Michigan, the secy. of state, the AG, and the gov., all democratic women, all courageous role models for the rest of the country. However, one can completely understand Whitmer’s reticence to invite another cycle of violence by armed white racists willing to cleave her state apart by “liberating” Michigan.

She deserves moral support from federal leaders. Biden, Harris and/or Garland need to speak up in support of Whitmer."
2021-04-13 14:34,"Yes, shut the state down.  That has worked well so far (sarcasm).  This has devolved into nothing but political posturing.  Whitmer knows that if she shuts it back down her political career is toast."
2021-04-13 15:22,"It would seem that the Governor, after having had her capitol stormed by heavily armed militia members and her life threatened by a gang of murderous kidnappers, has now decided that trying to protect that portion (ungovernable and ungrateful) isn't worth the trouble.    But getting more vaccines into the state which IS a hotspot to help out the others (the un-crazies) seems a reasonable ask."

She was Swift in quarantine the state at the outset of the pandemic. It was brave of her to do so given the ridiculous amount of opposition she faced.

They are pausing because of 6 cases of blood clots among 6.5 million J+J vaccinated people? There are probably many HUNDREDS of lives saved among those 6 million, plus lessening the massive danger of a virus antigen RBD-altered variant that is like playing Russian roulette.   All for a 1 in a million chance at a blood clot? Trading hundreds of lives saved against 6 hurt by blood clots? How about NOT halting vaccination while you figure out the data. Please see the forest instead of the trees."
2021-04-13 15:11,"President Biden is not ""at loggerheads"" with Governor Whitmer.  He is just not going to reward bad behavior by the republicans who refused to shut down the state and tried to kidnap the governor.

It would be a slap in the face for OUR President and health officials to take vaccine from those of us who have kept safe since the start of this pandemic to ""save"" democracy-destroying, mask-defying people in Michigan, Texas, Florida, Mississippi and other states whose leaders are defying science..

The answer is for the Good People of Michigan who do not agree with the destructive actions of republicans to hit the streets and DEMAND a lockdown and masks.

Their lives are at stake.  OUR lives should not be.  Do NOT reward bad behavior."
2021-04-13 15:14,"Another reason that could be triggering the surge in cases in Michigan, snowbirds returning home.  Arizona was willing to give seasonal visitors the vaccine but in Florida you had to prove residency.  
Also, not sure how the Governor went from ally to “poor relations” status so quickly.  Someone in the Biden administration needs to hop on the phone and get this straightened out, lives at are stake."
2021-04-13 14:50,"I mean, come on. The Republicans in Michigan are pressuring Whitmer into making the wrong decision to keep everything open instead of being sensible, and the state is supposed to get rewarded with additional doses of the vaccine so they can all continue their bad behavior while people in other places which are doing the right thing get their shots pushed further back? I mean, come on!"

We certainly should not reward their behavior with more vaccine. Half of Republican men don’t believe in taking it anyway."
2021-04-13 15:03,"Governor Whitmer's request, whether right or whether practical is secondary. The Biden administration quick refusal is simply bad optics. Why can't they say they would consider it, or at least move some excess vaccines from other states to help the governor out.

That is why the CDC director’s response, that additional doses would make no difference, was so cynical. It should not go unchallenged."
2021-04-13 14:52,I have to side with the CDC on this one-- shutting down now saves jobs later. the federal gov't should give financial aid to the shut down businesses in Michigan for the period of the shutdown so more don't go out of business. And all of us should stop traveling for spring break and wait until summer which is a scant 2 months away. C'mon people show a little discipline and wisdom....
2021-04-13 14:56,They government is wrong not to send additional vaccine doses to Michigan. This problem should be addressed using all means available including shutting down high risk areas in Michigan but also full court press on vaccinations. If Mississippians don't want the vaccine send it to Michigan.
2021-04-13 15:22,I can't help but wonder if the surge in Michigan above and beyond other states is due to the large amount of Trump supporters who refuse to follow mask-wearing and social distancing guidelines.

We've not seen a rate of infection as significant as it is currently since the start of the pandemic. The majority of new infections are caused by variants of concern (VACs) which are spreading at a dangerous rate and are impacting healthy young individuals.  

Gov. Whitmer made many good decisions since the start of this pandemic.  Unfortunately, one cannot leave it to the people to be responsible. Some will be but many won't. If you want to see anything like a ""normal"" summer, she needs a multiple pronged approach which includes declaring a lockdown to get the situation under control."
2021-04-13 15:09,"We can surmise that a mix of denial and defiance is what motivates the uproar over restrictions, but it is the denial and defiance of petulant children, not mature adults.

Within the state, surely some vaccines can be moved from rural areas where they are being shunned, to urban areas where they will be eagerly received."
2021-04-13 14:52,"As I’ve seen mentioned elsewhere, bring the decision makers/controllers to the public fore and explain themselves.  Explain in detail and very publicly why they refuse to allow Governor Whitmer to do what’s necessary for public health.  The Legislature’s intransigence is costing many people their lives (and along with their freedom). 

The media need to be tough (and fair) in interviewing Michigan lawmakers.  Call out a lie for what it is."
2021-04-13 14:54,"I don't understand why they don't do both. Michigan can help protect themselves and the rest of the country by shutting down, if only for a couple weeks, to try to flatten the rise out and prevent it from spreading. The country can help Michigan by flooding them with more vaccines to try to control the spread within their state. Yes, it will require some other states that are better off to temporarily sacrifice, but are we a country or not?"
2021-04-13 15:28,"If some states have more than they are using, by all means redirect some from those to states experiencing outbreaks.

Given the time it takes for the vaccines to be effective though it would make the most sense to send them to states just starting to experience surges rather than those in the middle of a surge.

Obviously the fastest as well as easiest approach involves a few simple steps such as using masks and not eating indoors. If people can't follow those simple guidelines they shouldn't expect the government to bail them out should they?"
2021-04-13 16:01,"Note, in passing, the asymmetry. States, especially red states, are ignoring the CDC guidance that they should return to following the CDC guidelines including mask and physical distancing mandates. On the other hand, for a rare blood clotting condition, which has occurred at a rate of roughly one case for every six million Johnson and Johnson vaccinations, they are pausing that vaccine's use.

The Michigan numbers have improved for older people but have gone downhill for everybody else including even younger people. Recall for a moment what we now know, namely, that 30% of people who have had the virus, for all ages, whether or not they experienced any of the symptoms, will suffer from at least one or two of the serious symptoms associated with long Covid. 

As somebody who has not been vaccinated yet--I believe the CDC should make an effort to get Whitmer more vaccines, and Whitmer should put in place the required mandates. The Michigan spike is much worse in the rural areas, and almost certainly it is a consequence of pro-Trump people, mainly men, of all ages, refusing to be vaccinated. How many of those people are likely to become Whitmer supporters, if she does not put in place the mandates?"
2021-04-13 15:35,"'“The answer is not necessarily to give vaccine,” said the director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky. “The answer to that is to really close things down, to go back to our basics, to go back to where we were last spring, last summer, and to shut things down.”'

I fully support all efforts to defeat this virus, including wearing masks, avoiding indoor gatherings, maintaining social distancing, and getting vaccinated. 

Clearly ""shutting things down"" never happened, and won't happen now.

Send vaccines to locations that need them and will use them."
2021-04-13 15:38,"I feel for the governor of Michigan. She must know that lock down is the thing to do, but must deal with the Republicans. They are the problem—as always, lately..."
2021-04-13 16:06,"While I certainly sympathize with what is happening in Michigan, here in NY, we have been walking around with masks  and keeping our distance for the past year. In contrast, your residents have been complaining for 6 months about having Covid fatigue. I certainly would not agree with taking vaccines away from our residents and send them over to your State. It's time the residents from Michigan to step up and stay home. Maybe you could stay away from storming your Statehouse and  trying to kill your Governor. While you were ignoring all CDC guidelines, you are to blame for the Variants spreading our way. Sorry to sound callous, but we tried to do our part."
2021-04-13 15:50,How would more vaccine help?  The freedom-loving covid-deniers are getting sick because they don't believe in masks or distancing. What makes anyone think they'll agree to be vaccinated?
2021-04-13 15:44,"This is one of those instances where political considerations are prominent. Every officeholder in the state must plead for more vaccines or their political future is nil. I have noted, however, that many medical experts, including Dr. Scott Gottlieb and Dr. Hja from Brown University have agreed with Dr. Whitmer. Dr. Walensky and President Biden have to consider the entire United States and anticipate that other states may make similar requests and things could get difficult from a medical and political standpoint. Suppose there is a surge of infections in Georgia next? Finally other experts agree with Dr. Walensky that closing down (mitigation) is the proper response for Michigan. Some problems don't have simple answers."
2021-04-13 16:02,"The media loves to overplay a situation to promote drama. Gretchen is doing what she needs to do and the feds are doing what they need to do. The media acts as if there is some major rift. If michiganites chose to behave in a manner that puts them at greater risk, then that is not reason to deny those who are behaving access to the vaccine. Rewarding a poor CHOICE is not in the best interest of the country or its people."
2021-04-13 15:50,Why should the citizens of states that behaved responsibly give up their vaccines for a state that hasn't behaved responsibly?
2021-04-13 15:46,"Feds to MI:  Drop Dead

The CDC continues to confuse.  One Day it is ""impending doom"" but no actions taken.  Followed by guidelines for get togethers.  Then refusing to even entertain discussions with the cruise ship industry regarding guidance on how to re-open.  Earlier conflicting messaging on ""re-opening"" schools.  This points to a cultural and leadership issue at the CDC the pre-dates Biden."
2021-04-13 16:04,"Governor Whitmer is dealing with the problem at ground-zero.  This is no time for arm-chair experts to give her lectures instead of vaccine.  She can’t do anything with the lectures.

President Biden, if you have the vaccine, have it driven to 
Michigan right this second.   Vaccine + lectures are way better than lectures alone!  Why does this even have to be pointed out—this is a no-brainer."
2021-04-13 15:44,Vaccine distribution should based on public health data. Politics shouldn't be a factor.
2021-04-13 15:58,"I agree with the Biden Administration on this:  the vaccines are not (and should not be) distributed by who are our friends and through a political prism.  I've flown and been through airports in the U.S. for 3 round trips in the last one year: The mask has been a very reliable defense for me; of course, washing my hands with soap, added to it.
Why can't the MI state try this with a lockdown? If everyone is confined in a lockdown, wear a mask and wash their hands with soap every time after they return from outside, the reported cases are bound to go down.
Vaccination is NOT a silver bullet; no one should try to a get a fast solution and be adamant to get back to the prior normal life quickly!  I'll be wearin my mask in public places, even though I'm fully vaccinated now."
2021-04-13 16:04,"Two things: 

Michigan is using 80% of the doses delivered, New Hampshire on the other hand is on the top in this measure using 98% of delivered doses and now also has the highest % of its population dosed with one shot, over 50%. 

Make no doubt about it, the vaccination-resistant, mask-less Michigan Republicans are spreading this disease to their friends, neighbors and families... and to unfortunate fellow citizens of all political stripes that they come in contact with. 

Good luck Governor. You can only do something about the vaccination utilization. The rest is not on you..."
2021-04-13 16:06,"In Canada, they are sending more vaccine to ""hot spots"". Right now, if you're in Whistler, B.C., where the Brazil variant is spreading, any age can get the jab. In Toronto, where the UK variant is spreading fast, same thing. Other provinces/cities have been slowed down."
2021-04-13 15:39,"Michigan would be better served by buying up the entire available supply of N95 and KN95 masks and imposing a mask mandate. Universal mask use would have an immediate impact on the spread of COVID, the data are clear. Vaccines won't help at this point, since there is a long gap between the shot and immunity (up to 4 weeks for J & J, which is suspended anyway, 5 weeks for Pfizer, 6 for Moderna). Further, I JUST clicked off a live WaPo interview with two doctors who were members of Pres. Biden's COVID task force who noted that Michigan has areas of the state where vaccine appointments are going unfilled; those could be reallocated to areas where demand exceeds supply. So the issue isn't really vaccines. Basically, Michigan is asking other states to give up vaccine because the people there are unwilling on political grounds to do what could greatly reduce transmission immediately. You make your bed . . ."
2021-04-13 16:00,"More misinformation from the CDC- stating that the vaccine isn't effective until 6 weeks (ie. 2 weeks after the 2nd dose).  It clearly is effective after the first dose, though perhaps not as perfectly.  

They need to stop beclowning themselves telling people things that simply aren't true in a vain attempt to engineer behavior."
2021-04-13 15:59,"I like Gov Whitmer and agree with most of her decisions; however, the decision to reopen more restaurants and shopping a few months ago wasn't one of them. Cases were already back on the rise and it made no sense to so so other than appeasing the right-wingers who think their ""freedoms"" come first. 

How is more vaccine going to help in a state where at least 40% won't take it or when it takes 6-8 weeks to become fully vaccinated? Shut it all down."
2021-04-13 16:10,"The vaccines should start providing protection around 1 week, no more than 2 weeks, after the first shot is administered.  Flooding a state with a covid surge with vaccines would, in fact, help.

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines showed around 80% efficacy in preventing Covid cases starting 14 days after the first dose (if you look at the Pfizer efficacy chart it actually appears to be day 12 where it kicks in).  Note that does NOT account for the 4-5 day incubation period.  Accounting for the incubation period, it implies the vaccine starts preventing transmission around 9-10 days, and possibly as short as 7 days, after receiving the first dose.

The narrative that the mRNA vaccines aren't helping until 2 weeks after the 2nd dose is administered is preposterous and extremely frustrating to hear.  Just a poor excuse that's not well thought out to explain bad policy decisions."
2021-04-13 15:57,"Just give the first shot to everyone, Governor Whitmer. You can delay the second shot. That will protect more people."
2021-04-13 16:14,The Republicans don't care if there's a surge that inevitably leads to more deaths. It's far easier to reduce those voter rolls through Covid attrition than passing even more unconstitutional voter suppression laws.
2021-04-13 16:14,I’ve got to say I don’t blame her for treading lightly with residents of her state. She doesn’t want to be kidnapped and executed. I’m sure she’ll remember that thwarted plan for the rest of her tenure as governor.
2021-04-13 16:15,"The Republicans of Michigan have proved yet again that, as they like to say, ""Freedom isn't Free,"" and it is a heavy cost to bear for the rest of the citizenry."
2021-04-13 16:19,"Another point if I may. If the Michigan outbreaks were about “Republicans refusing to wear masks” and the other political shaming, the outbreaks would be in Grand Rapids, Holland, and other outstate and western Michigan areas. That is demonstrably not the case based on the NYT list of communities. I had previously commented that these are automotive factory towns. They also likely have another commonality - diabetes due to ethnic, cultural and dietary issues. Monroe of which I am personally familiar from my time there in the ‘80’s, had a history as being a diabetes hot spot with a 95% White population. Flint and Detroit have the problem of Black diabetics. Adrian, Monroe, Lansing nearer to the Ohio and Indiana border with their large Hispanic populations. These are all people prone to diabetes and therefore Covid. But as the weather warms up, they will not be willing to sit at home again. Whitmer, not worth much in my opinion, at least knows that. Problem now is the terrible messaging by public health authorities. Compare the pathetic ads by the CDC to the much better messaging by Walgreens, Walmart, CVS. But those drug stores don’t have much of the vaccines. No wonder there are outbreaks."
2021-04-13 16:18,"I can understand the CDCs position. Should Michigan be given more vaccines than other states just because the majority population there has determined it does not want to comply with the less-pleasant recommendations that save lives, such as mask-wearing, staying out of closed, packed bars and restaurants, business shut-downs, avoiding large gatherings, etc.? And now that the J&J vaccine is on hold, there will be shortages and rationing.

I don't know. Having spent over a year basically living as a shut-in, my tolerance for irresponsible behavior is limited. If everyone would just work together and follow the CDC guidelines, we'd collectively benefit, and get out of this mess sooner rather than later. 

Unfortunately, communal well-being  never has been a priority in a nation of ""I gotta get mines"" and ""me firsts."""
2021-04-13 16:21,"I agree with Whitmer.  At this point, make the case for citizens to voluntarily follow protocols while speeding up vaccinations.

Lockdown will only enrage people and harden the resolve to ignore protocols."
2021-04-13 15:47,"Michigan flouted the rules, didn't wear masks , gathered in large groups and basically did everything to invite this public health disaster. Now they expect more vaccines. The sheer gall and stupidity is mind boggling.
Now we hear that California and  many other states are opening up...big mistake. Astra , nobody will take it, J&J ceased production, that leaves Moderna and Phizer, not enough production capacity for the whole country. Factor in the variants and you have the makings of wave after wave of transmissions.
The US truly is a backwards nation performing a herd culling on ourselves."
2021-04-13 16:47,"On the one hand, it's hard to blame Gov Whitmer. When she did enact emergency orders to lockdown, she was the target of a foiled kidnapping plot by armed felons. Also in the wake of that episode, the MI Supreme Ct severely restricted her emergency authorization powers. So she is left to do what the GOP (that controls the MI legislature) does -- preach about personal responsibility out of one side of their mouth and demand gov't rescue out the other.  

It'd be good to know though how many would actually get the vaccine if it was more readily available. It's not an acute solution anyway."
2021-04-13 16:48,"Whitmer needs to get reelected in a hostile, roiled state. The state that came closest to having a right-wing coup. When extremists rise, people in the center try to calm things. Sometimes it works, sometimes backfires.

She knows she won't get vaccines. It's a triangulation tactic. Position contra Biden to get Republicans to wear masks.

Masks reduce transmission by 70% to 90%, the same percent as vaccine's decrease. Not rocket science. The US, especially Michigan, is sickened by ignorance. Republicans increasingly identify as manly men and womanly women. Men think masks emasculate.

Isn't refusing to follow orders, refusing to believe, refusing to take personal responsibility, the things conservatives accuse liberals of? Maybe Michigan's right-wingers are really liberals wearing Republican clothes."
2021-04-13 16:56,"i live in Michigan.  I do not think it is people flouting mask mandates and hanging out in bars and breathing on each other, as much as you all might like to think so (it can't happen to you, right?)  There was a big push to open up schools and school sports just as the B117 variant was getting established.  School sports played a big part in spreading it.  And the  variant spreads like hot grease.  Weather plays a part: we are surging at the same time we did last year.  But I am sure it is something unique to Michigan and could never  happen on either coast.  I am fairly sure that if and when it does happen to you on either coast, California or New York, that the feds will release additional vaccine for you."
2021-04-13 17:29,"What an awful situation. I feel for Whitmer and the people of Michigan. I’m sure she feels powerless given the pushback from legislature, but I do think a lockdown would certainly help contain the spread. It’s true: it would take six weeks for vaccines to take effect, unfortunately. They need help now. 

The situation highlights many issues. Vaccine hesitancy in rural states, the inability to move vaccines not being used, and the politicization of the pandemic. 

The combination of these elements must be so stressful for Michiganders and Gov. Whitmer. My heart goes out to everyone."
2021-04-13 15:55,I can't imagine Congress stripping away the President's power of anything.  Why is this happening in MI?  Why is this being allowed to happen?
2021-04-13 17:09,"Thanks for all the smug armchair criticism, fellow Americans. I knew there was a reason I avoided reading the Comments section in this fair newspaper. Let them eat cake indeed.

We’ve worn the masks. We’ve shut down our schools. We’ve closed our restaurants. We’ve canceled our parties, shuttered our churches, postponed our weddings, tanked our economy, and missed the final moments with hospitalized family members.  The states below us — Ohio, Indiana — have never shut down for as hard or as long as Michigan has. And today, if anything, they continue to be even more open than we are.  Can any of you experts tell us why they’re not suffering as we are right now? I’m sure you’d love to share your great wisdom with us. You sure aren’t interested in sharing much else."
2021-04-13 17:41,"Governor Whitmer is acting purely out of self-interest. She is willing to sacrifice countless   lives in the hopes that doing so will result in her own re-election.

Given that Governor Whitmer does not care about the deaths that she is causing, and will cause, she  might want to consider how choosing oneself and one's political self  interest above acting to stop the spread of a deadly virus, and above the health and lives of Americans worked as a political strategy for Donald Trump."
2021-04-13 17:42,"What an awful situation for Gov. Whitmer. She has been threatened with kidnapping and possibly death for shutting down the state once before. How can the Biden administration even suggest shutting down again? I am of the mind that if the people who threatened her should not get the vaccine, but just take their chances at getting the Covid-19. They are so sure their rights were violated and would feel they were being controlled by the State. They brought this on themselves. They could be identified from videos of them barging into the Capitol. Some were even in Washington D.C. on Jan. 6th."
2021-04-13 17:24,Why should my state be given fewer doses of the vaccine because Michigan is populated by an overabundance of  people  who will not follow CDC guidelines? The need to reap what they sow.
2021-04-13 17:41,"Dear Readers,
Has anyone noticed that between the Post and the Times, additional information that might help ordinary people be more informed about the rising COVID Cases is not stated ...info is too random. 

Is there any data about age groups that might be contributing to spreading COVID in Michigan? Example - senior centers, students in school, indoor dining, etc... 


Are those vaccinated not infected with this new strain rise in Covid ? ( if this is true then for Pete’s sake that should be a frontline point !) it would counter vaccine naysayers..

Could the vaccinated be spreading Covid among family members not vaccinated.. ?

These are just examples of info that would be much more helpful....rather then blaming political beliefs..."
2021-04-13 12:37,"The NYT keeps neglecting to mention that the Michigan GOP has revoked Gov. Whitmer's emergency powers to enact restrictions.  All she can do is ask for a pause and the large majority of Michiganders are not listening or scared to act.   The state athletic association came out and said it would not shut down.  My county health department has now decided to leave the decision to local schools.  Local school boards are dealing with outraged parents on both sides of the issue.  The governor, athletic association, school boards and health departments have all been subject to lawsuits and/or credible threats and harassment.  The majority of local health departments in the state are over seen by GOP majority controlled county commissions, many of whom have passed resolutions supporting reopening the state.   I don't blame them for their inaction.  I just find it sad that many of my fellow Michiganders have made the pandemic into a partisan issue not backed by scientific fact and have shed their masks, if they ever wore them at all, and are acting like its 2019."

2021-04-13 19:20,"All I know is the CDC finally has the spine to tell Michigan what is needed to correct the problem and our Governor is doing the exact opposite. Most of the states did the same thing. It's not an accident the US is the world leader in infections and deaths. 
Nothing is stopping her from closing down high infection public places. Threats or complaining about the GOP doesn't empty out the ICDU's. She is choosing not too. Talk is cheap! Vaccines won't fix this latest surge."
2021-04-13 20:33,"So long as you are allowing indoor dining you will have a surge.  Shutting down is a no-brainer but the GOP who will not allow Witmer to order a shut down have demonstrated they are brainless when it comes to dealing with this pandemic. In Michigan where Trump Republicans are still in charge, the disease is soaring. The CDC is right in demanding the State take action. Can you imagine the anger of people living in a State that is taking preventive action when you tell them that they will have less vaccines  because they have been so responsible? It would be punishing people for doing the right thing. Their point about the length of time it would take to help reduce the surge with vaccines compared to the shorter-term success with a lockdown is also valid. In that godly country Witmer and the GOP should remember that God helps those who help themselves."
2021-04-13 20:22,"Michigan resident here.

My wife and I returned from Florida last June, and Southeastern Michigan (Wayne, Oakland, Macomb counties) have been masking religiously since then.  Yet, we have some of the highest rates in the country.  We have a ""100 year flood"" of a particularly virulent virus.

The response?

""Leaving it to the states"" didn't work last year, and it will not work this year either.  Governor Whitmer bravely fought the virus and the Republicans and was nearly kidnapped and killed for her efforts.  The vitriol that the three female leaders of the state have endured is appalling, scary, and patently misogynist, and it comes from political foes and a politicized press.

Michigan must reduce high-contact activities.  The Feds must provide additional vaccines if possible.  

To those who are hectoring us, I ask what you will do when the virus comes to your area?"
2021-04-13 20:57,"A large percentage of Michigan's citizens protested masks, protested social distancing, protested a shut down, all proven measures to stem the spread even storming their state capital. Now, they want a ""surge"" in vaccines, which means unless there are extra unused doses sitting around, someone somewhere else going to have to go without to save Michaganers who 'fiddled while the state burned'. 

Choices have consequences, Michigan, take responsibility. My sympathies to those state residents who did all the right things and lives are now in jeopardy due to the selfish actions of others."
2021-04-13 21:47,If I were Gov. Whitmer I would call Gov. DeSantis and ask him what she should do.
2021-04-13 22:34,"I understand both sides of this debate from a scientific point of view. But whether the governor should shut down or not, the Biden administration is playing the game of diversion. The state needs more vaccine, or the the problem will never go away. Sheesh, it's not either/or."
2021-04-13 21:56,"I can understand Governor Whitmer's reluctance to issue mandates, especially she seems to have lost the authority to do so.  Given the earlier reaction to her mandates, shutdown, etc., she might be worried about getting kidnapped and/or shot -- in her place, I would be."
2021-04-13 23:48,"I, too, am a Michigan resident. 

Governor Whitmer unilaterally forced Michigan to lock down  resulting in job loss, excess deaths, and economic losses that will be felt for years. We now know that lockdowns do little to control the virus and locked down or not, we’d probably be in the same spot we’re are at now. This is a virus. It will have its own way.  

Interesting that as re-election looms for her in 2022, she suddenly sees “personal responsibility” as the way to control this surge. Never mind that she shut the state down for case numbers much less than this. Her actions show that she was more interested in keeping the economy stagnant during the last administration and is more worried about being re-elected than about being consistent in her approach."
2021-04-13 23:45,"The demand from the heads of states for more vaccines to the president or prime minister of their respective nation is indeed a healthy sign to accelerate the vaccination drive but leading to the state of loggerheads won't lead a nation anywhere.
My request to the heads of the states all over the world is to pay a strict vigil and measures to prevent the wastage of  any WHO approved vaccine in use at present.
Every vaccine, whether it is adeno virus based or m-RNA based, they are on the process of fine tweaking everyday to the newly arising  variants in different continents.
Exhibiting undue pressure on the supply chain of the vaccine shouldn't  result in a vaccines mix-up or quality compromise in the  output.                                                                          Mix-up of the vaccines at Baltimore process units, absence of the registered personnel not reporting to the vaccination center and vacillating with a wavering mind of 'vaccinate or not to vaccinate"" are some of the few known factors that led to the wastage of vaccines."
2021-04-13 22:03,"She needs to shut things down and stop asking her citizens to behave themselves which they clearly are not doing. Dumping more vaccine there won't fix this, but not having people out infecting each other in bars, restaurants, gyms and any other place where people can congregate will. That whole state should be quarantined for the virus pit that it is."

Whitmer (the women from Michigan, as Trump called her) literally risk her life by being a good soldier and following CDC guidance in terms of preventative measure like closures  and mask mandates.  Now the Biden's CDC is denying the governor the one thing that would save lives that wouldn't be political suicide for her.  Taking vaccines from states which have almost zero community spread  and states  where vaccines are sitting in cold storage because of vaccine hesitancy, is the obvious choice.  The best time to have done this was a month ago.  The second best time  is now.   What director Walensky COULD do, with  the stroke of a pen, is change the official CDC guidance telling the public not to wear N95 masks --- even though hundreds of millions of unused N95s sit in warehouses and epidemiologist have been pleading for the public to wear high filtration mask since last March."

Can FDA pause it for women only so men can continue to get vaccinated? Can doctors and patients be warned to look for the symptoms two weeks out? Do we know if these women had pre-existing conditions that would mean some people shouldn't get J&J, but everyone else can? I worry that with such a desperate need to vaccinate people, maybe pausing is too dramatic of an action."
2021-04-13 12:03,"""Nevertheless, the regulators argued, the benefit of the vaccine — keeping people from being infected with the coronavirus or keeping those few who get Covid-19 out of the hospital — vastly outweighed that small risk.""

Perhaps as a generalization, looking at the population as a whole, but it definitely doesn't outweigh the risk to a person who experiences this outcome. This relegates that person's experience, and life, as being of no value. Is there some way to acknowledge that person and still decide it is valuable to continue? I'd like to think so but I am not seeing it here."
2021-04-13 12:07,"Is any information available about the symptoms that have allowed diagnosis of a clotting issue? News has not defined this for Astra Seneca or Johnson and Johnson. Our Metro area is currently going through supplies of the J&J vaccine at mass vaccination sites. Stories like this are useful, to a point; even if there is no consistent set of symptoms is there any guidance for what women in the suceptible age group should be aware of, or what personal medical histories appear most vulnerable to this low-likelihood of adverse reaction?"
2021-04-13 12:07,"Six clotting incidents out of seven million shots? That's less than half the risk of being struck by lightning!

If we had sufficient supplies of other vaccines, this pause would make sense, but supply is limited. What's more, the Johnson and Johnson vaccine can be used in circumstances that preclude the use of the Pfizer and Moderna. The chance of getting Covid is much higher than the chance of developing blood clots."
2021-04-13 12:06,"Sounds like the feds don’t know how to do a cost-benefit analysis, including the vaccine hesitancy this action will cause that will lead to countless deaths."
2021-04-13 12:06,What are the symptoms? I received this vaccine and fall in the age category affected and would like to know what to look for.
2021-04-13 12:09,"Women are by far having more side effects than men to these covid vaccines. As a minor case, I was one of the Moderna recipients who got a mysterious oval-shaped, itchy rash covering my entire forearm that appeared exactly a week following vaccination. I read that women are far more likely to have this reaction than men. Clearly, gender differences in vaccine reactions need more careful study."
2021-04-13 12:10,"Understanding potential risks and conditions that lead to those risks is critical.  Typically these risks would be vetted through clinical trials that can last years.  Given the rapid onset of the virus with its personal and corporate impacts, there is really no choice but to accelerate the use of the vaccines.  I'm surprised the FDA would stop the deployment of the J&J vaccine with the virus variant on the rampage.  Though a cold utilitarian assessment, using the J&J vaccine will likely save more lives than it costs."
2021-04-13 12:06,I received my first shot of Moderna vaccine last month and will go back for the second shot later this month. I am beyond grateful for the vaccine. I hope the J&J news won't deter people. I have a lot of anti-vaccine people in my extended family who blame covid on 5G and who-knows-what nonsense. They refused to be vaccinated or wear masks before this news. I fear for them.
2021-04-13 12:01,Are there any indicators to look for to determine if a person is at risk for developing blood clots from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine?
2021-04-13 12:14,"Is this rare outcome of serious injury or death similar to any other established vaccines or even medications? Seems that the outcome of stopping will be far more detrimental, leading to more 
hospitalizations and deaths from Covid. Perhaps instead we stop this vaccine in women only who have a certain pre-existing condition. We need that information here as well."
2021-04-13 12:15,"Any loss of life is not to be taken lightly and I can appreciate the FDA taking concern, however they knew the risks of passing and approving these vaccines. They allowed for companies to cut the average 10 or so years of trials to a much reduced amount due to the extremity of Covid-19. For them to be concerned and halt completely for 6-7 Cases out of 7 million distributed seems not only like a massive oversight on the damage they will cause by establishing distrust in what is a safe vaccine and to cause fear in every woman who has received said vaccine."
2021-04-13 12:12,"Can't we just screen for people who can't take blood thinners (and send them to a Pfizer or Moderna site), then prescribe a course of blood thinners for a month beginning on the day the vaccine is administered?"
2021-04-13 12:12,What can we tell young women who have gotten this vaccination last week what they can do now to prevent complications.  I happen to know a few women in their 20s and 30s that were so excited to finally get the vaccine and now they are frightened.
2021-04-13 12:14,What are the signs and symptoms one needs to pay attention to?
2021-04-13 12:18,"They are probably pausing not just becuase of the blood clots, but also the reports of adverse reactions in various states. I got the J & J vaccine and had an awful reaction that evening (rapid onslaught flu). And yes, I would still get the vaccine, although I wish I was offered one of the other two, and do feel like I got the inferior vaccine. Maybe the government has more information about the J&J vaccine that we are not privy too."
2021-04-13 12:18,"This pandemic has shown that the medical community generally and the CDC specifically need much better PR people. Inconsistent messaging from the start has been incredibly harmful.

Now we are faced with a scenario where six people out of seven million have developed blood clotting and we are going to run front page stories about the potential dangers of these shots. It is going to severely depress vaccine adoptions which will ultimately cause more harm than these trivial amount of cases.

Driving to your local vaccine distribution center is vastly more dangerous than getting a vaccine. Why have we not learned from the AstraZenica debacle in Europe? We should pause before sounding the alarm bell and keep the big picture in mind."
2021-04-13 12:09,I have seen 2 patients at my 150 bed hospital with clots after moderna vaccine. There is politics to reporting and actions regarding vaccine complications
2021-04-13 12:21,"For adults, the benefit of the vaccine heavily outweighs the the risk of short-term side effects.

For children--who are at vanishingly small risk of severe Covid--the benefit of the vaccine is insufficient to outweigh the risk of long-term side effects."
2021-04-13 12:21,"I’m still waiting for my first dose of any vaccine. As a healthy male without preexisting medical conditions, I would take the J&J version this minute if it was offered."
2021-04-13 12:19,"The FDA and CDC have really been a net negative throughout this whole pandemic. It is unbelievable that we would pause an urgently needed vaccine program, and undermine confidence in our vaccines, over a side effect that occurs in less than once in a million. People need to get fired over this."
2021-04-13 12:19,The incidence of illness and death related to the J&J vaccine is infinitesimal and if the same metrics were applied to almost everything we experience in life then we'd never get out of bed each day.
2021-04-13 12:22,"This article underscores the reason that no person should take an unapproved, untested, & hurriedly rushed to market. This is most certainly the reason that so many people are vaccine hesitant!"
2021-04-13 12:23,"As an infectious disease specialist, I have been anxious about this for weeks as I've read about the cases of what appears to be a variant of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a devastating hematologic disorder, appear in the population vaccinated with the Astra Zeneca vaccine. The Astra Zeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are made with the same adenovirus platform and therefore it stands to reason that a similar phenomenon might play out; that it is occuring in both vaccines strengthens the case that it is a true association.  There have been sporadic cases of TTP associated both with illness and with other vaccines but a consistent pattern appears to be emerging which is devastating, given the ease of vaccination and storage with these vaccines."
2021-04-13 12:12,"""Why didn't Trump exercise the option to buy 300 million more Pfizer vaccines?""  This is why.  We didn't know at the time which horse would win the race, which had flaws, which would fizzle out.  Imagine if he bought 500 million AstraZeneca vaccines?  
I'm not a Trump fan but he did a good job throwing boat loads of money at ""Operation Warp Speed.""  Now, the US and Israel lead the world in vaccinations."
2021-04-13 12:24,"My husband and I had the J&J vaccine and I got a 103-degree fever the night after. My teeth were chattering and body hurt everywhere. My husband, on the other hand, was fine. That was less than two weeks ago. What are the symptoms of the blood clots?"
2021-04-13 12:25,"The authors comment that ""there have been no significant health effects"" from the Moderna and Pfizer mrna vaccines is simply untrue. They are both linked to allergic reaction and anaphylaxis which is why there is a 15 minute monitoring period after administration.  Anaphylaxis can similarly be life threatening but is also rare. No vaccine is perfect, but it is appropriate to employ a cautious review to determine causality and incidence before redeploying the JNJ."
2021-04-13 12:25,"While I am sympathetic to the idea that the risks of COVID outweigh the risks of blood clots, I could not in good conscience say I would take this vaccine or recommend it to any of my friends or family, especially women, until the connection has been more thoroughly  vetted. In a nation where vaccine hesitancy runs rampant, the last message we should send is that there are no potential side effects and that every vaccine is the same in terms of safety profile—that would be a straight-up lie and would further diminish trust."
2021-04-13 12:27,"When did the symptoms begin for this 6-7 cases of blood clotting? I.e. after they received the shot, how long after did the symptoms begin?"
2021-04-13 12:24,"No easy answer for this one. First, one must look at the odds of this happening versus the odds of contacting Covid 19.
Here is my read on this one!
Johnson & Johnson will do everything within their power to come up with an answer to this one. We’re talking about MONEY! Something like this could bring the giant down, and I suspect they will do everything within their power to correct it.
We’ve had 2 shots of Pfizer. If we could only take Johnson and Johnson, I would do it, even with this “rare” consequence of blood clotting."
2021-04-13 12:24,I am in my sixth week of an itchy rash all over my torso arms and armpits which developed 5 days after the first Moderna shot. Two allergists have told me under no circumstances should I get the second shot. The dermatologist is performing a biopsy today to gather more information on what may have triggered a persistent pityriasis rosea type rash. We are in the middle of several mega vaccine trials with unapproved drugs.
2021-04-13 12:25,"Sometimes Governments  reacts to things too dramatically. The vaccine is beneficial in saving lives. As one commenter said, how about at least offering JJ vaccine to men only?

Sometimes the government doesn’t react to things when they should. Like after children were murdered at various schools by people carrying assault weapons, they should have banned those unnecessary people killing weapons entirely. 

Vaccines are needed for the good of all, the government paused them in an expansive way.

Assault weapons are not needed and in fact the only thing they do is make it possible to murder large numbers of people, the government takes no action or minimal action.

What a country!!!"
2021-04-13 12:23,"This doesn't make much sense.  Basically, a 1-in-1,000,000 chance of getting blood clots and a 1-in-5,000,000 chance of dying, when the typical probability in the US (admittedly not the healthiest country out there) is at least 1-in-1,000.  And if you contract covid, you've actually got a pretty decent chance of getting blood clots."
2021-04-13 12:29,"I am a 62 y o woman and I had the J & J vaccine March 8. I had no side effects from my vaccination (that I am aware of).  I have a couple of questions re the blood clot concern. Are there any signs that I would want to be aware of?  Also, it seems to be common procedure when undergoing surgery to receive heparin as a precaution. Should I have concerns for possible future surgery?"
2021-04-13 12:30,"I have had the AZ vaccine and would have it again. The chances of a 30-39 year old having a severe reaction to the vaccine is 1 in 125,000. The chances of dying in a car accident in the U.K. in any one year is 1 in 20,000. The chances of drowning in the bath or dying from falling down the stairs or choking on your breakfast is far higher. It’s right to pause while it is investigated but some perspective is needed."
2021-04-13 12:30,"This is where federalism is a benefit. This is only a recommendation to the states, and the states should ignore it. The harm from stopping the vaccinations is far greater than from the vaccines."
2021-04-13 12:30,"I am positive that Birth Control have worse side effects and I ended up in the ER after the Moderna vaccine with PB/Heart issues among others due to over active immune response. I still got my second vaccine because for me benefits outweigh the risk. NONE of my doctors wanted to believe that anything that was going on with my had to do with the vaccine, which is  incredibly irresponsible so I am positive that reactions are under reported. 

People have different hormones and DNA, meaning medications, medication reactions and different rates of specific diseases occur according to those differences. I am not sure why any of this information is shocking. 

They didn’t seem to care when they launched IUDs and major issues started to occur..."
2021-04-13 12:32,"Everyone in my family randomly received moderna or Pfizer EXCEPT the one person who most needed the best protection. That’s my 30 year old daughter who has lupus and who spent nearly a decade recovering from the aftermath of a problem that began with a common cold. She got J&J. There was no information that the center she selected was giving it till she got there and it was too scary to turn down a scarce vaccine. But the news on this vaccine goes from bad to worse. There seems to be no evidence that it’s nearly as protective as the others. Further, people with autoimmune diseases like lupus are more vulnerable to vascular problems and may be more at risk from this shot for that reason. And in general from the lower protection it gives. People aren’t machines. There should always have been an opportunity to make an educated choice on which vaccine to receive. I’m very concerned for her and others who’ve received this shot. It wasn’t withdrawn for inferior protection as I thought it should be but I’m glad it’s gone. I hope the people who had problems are recovering."
2021-04-13 12:35,At this point most people who want a vaccine are able to get one.     It is best to be cautious.  There are other options.
2021-04-13 12:36,"This is a setback in several ways, but most significantly, it will serve to reinforce the doubts and misconceptions a significant number of people have about the vaccines. They will ignore the fact that, thus far, thrombosis is a one-in-a-million complication of adenovirus vector vaccines. Our path to herd immunity and a return to normalcy will be delayed months by this news, even if the pause is lifted tomorrow."
2021-04-13 12:30,The 7 million people who received J&J certainly received a lesser vaccine.  In my household we decided we would only accept Pfizer or Moderna.  Easy pass on the others.   I think it's important the U.S. is pausing to examine the blood clot risk with J&J.   This company doesn't have a great record - 15 million doses from their Baltimore facility had to be discarded because of contamination or not being mixed correctly.  Their stock deserves to tank and people should pay attention to these warning signs.
2021-04-13 12:31,"How many people will die of COVID complications from the pause of this vaccine? Is this really worth the risk when you have less than 1 in 1,000,000 chance of developing blood clots? There is a higher chance of developing blood clots from flying on an airplane..."
2021-04-13 12:30,"A medical doctor friend who has worried out loud that the warp speed development of vaccines on so many platforms carries unusual risk because longer term effects cannot be known for a long while. He is not going to get vaccinated for a year or so. He's over 65 but believes monoclonal antibody treatment with steroids applied early if he gets the disease will increase his chances of avoiding hospitalization and worse. Every time a bad outcome is published regarding any vaccine, he pings me with this caution. Only time will tell. As others have commented, if you are one of these folks who's experienced this severe reaction to the J&J vaccine, you are probably wishing you had been more cautious. And, if you have lost a loved one to covid, you probably wish your lost family member had been vaccinated. In either case, there is risk. I do wish that we continue to focus upon therapeutics for covid and related conditions including unknown side effects from novel vaccines since there will always be a plurality of choice and lifestyle across the world."
2021-04-13 12:29,"What are the symptoms of a blood clot??  I wish this article would tell us that.

I am 49 and had the J&J shot last week. I was in bed for 2 days with horrible side effects.  (Meanwhile my parents who both got their shots with me had no side effects at all, not even sore arm.)

Do people who have stronger reactions to the vaccine tend to be more likely to develop a clot?  

I wish we knew more; this is highly upsetting."
2021-04-13 12:30,"The French gov. decided last week already to give the J&J only to those over 55, anticipating that the same problem as with the Oxford/AZ vaccine would arise (now confirmed). 

The article says that the US has imported a big part (or all?) of its J&J doses from Europe. The US still has the Trump export ban in place and has exported exactly 0 doses of any vaccine (it has loaned a few of its stock pile of Oxford/AZ to Canada and Mexico that it will never use). That's not a good way to treat your allies or to make friends. The US will have reached vaccine saturation in a few weeks (supply outstripping demand), ahead of almost any other country bar Israel. Europe will need at least 3 more months, and Latin America much longer. It is high time to lift the Trump-era export ban."
2021-04-13 12:33,"You know, in any population of 7 million some people are bound to suffer medical irregularities, vaccination or not. Is it the shot? We'll see."
2021-04-13 12:30,Six people out of 7 million suffered blood clots after receiving some J&J vaccine? One died? I'd take my chances.
2021-04-13 12:40,"I was on day two of my period when I got my second Pfizer shot, and within minutes it became extremely heavy - heavier than it was previously. It slowed down after a couple days, luckily, but it was pretty concerning. Many women are reporting issues with their periods after the covid vaccines. Given covid’s affects on the blood, I guess this isn’t surprising. It really gives me pause when considering whether to eventually vaccinate my toddler when the vaccines are approved for young children."
2021-04-13 12:40,"Everything has side effects, including vaccines. Whether or not we give a therapy involves a risk benefit analysis. Part of the problem is that Dr. Fauci and other medical experts presented all vaccines as essential equal. Those of us in the medical field knew from the get-go that that was untrue. Indeed, it is why my wife and I, both physicians, received the mRNA vaccines, as did our families, and the mRNA vaccines are what we recommend to our patients. That doesn't make the J&J shot bad. But honesty is better than irrational exuberance."
2021-04-13 12:42,"In this thread, there has been much unwarranted criticism of the decision to pause the distribution of the vaccine. I believe people are looking at the wrong metric and underestimating risk to a specific population segment. It appears that all cases were in middle aged and young women. The vaccine has been mostly distributed to those above the ages cited, and half of those, in turn, were men. So this is not a one in one million risk as assumed, if you are a young woman. It is far greater, and not negligible. The health athaurities may decide to restrict its use based on age and gender,  especially as alternatives are available for this segment. A similar decision was taken in certain foreign countries regarding the Astra Zeneca product that uses the same platform."
2021-04-13 12:43,"If you take the time to read the cautionary notes on any medication, both over the counter and prescription, and react to them like the reaction the J and J vaccine is getting no one would take a medication.  There are cautionary notes on liquor and  cigarettes that are far worse in the long term than the infinitely small risk to the J and J vaccine but the use of those items haven’t been suspended.  It would seem that the ability for logical reasoning has abandoned many of us."
2021-04-13 12:44,"This incidence rate is quite a bit lower than normal occurrence of clots in the US population (about which the general population does not seem to be particularly upset). The opportunity cost of the pause cannot truly be measured, but I wonder how much avoidable morbidity and mortality will occur during it."
2021-04-13 12:46,"It’s a pause for now. 
It needs to be studied on how to treat it, 
Training and literature need to include blood clots as a risk factor.
Doctors and patients who give and receive it have to be aware of the risk and consent to it.

It’s the same procedure that brings us that list of side effects on drug commercials.  
Hoping within a week it’s back in cycle."
2021-04-13 12:48,"According to this article, the chances of developing a blood clot is literally less than one in a million. What is the rate at which this condition develops otherwise? In Europe the AstraZeneca vaccine was cleared for use after they determined that the rate of blood clot development was lower than would form naturally.

I've already received a dose of Pfizer and will get my next in a couple weeks. If I were unvaccinated and offered the J&J instead, I'd happily roll those dice. One death out of 7 million is magnitudinally safer than COVID, which kills about 1 in 50, and much safer than even driving."
2021-04-13 12:51,I have T1 diabetes and received the Pfizer shot.  6 days later I had a retinal bleed that has obscured my vision in one eye since. I’ve been to the retina specialist every week and have to wait out to see if I will need surgery or if eye injections will clear the bleed.  The doctor says the shot had nothing to do with the bleed.  But all these years and no bleeds and then one the same week as the shot.  I don’t know.   I got the second dose this weekend    Because I haven’t left my house in a year and have to be protected. But I was petrified.
2021-04-13 12:52,"What are the symptoms we should be on the lookout for if we've already had the johnson and johnson vaccine? If this kind of blood clot is different from other blood clots, then what are the signs of it and what is the treatment?"
2021-04-13 12:55,Moderna has reactivated my Lyme disease (I had blood work done) causing heavy-duty tinnitus and hearing loss (still worsening after 2 weeks -- I had 2 hearing tests 2 weeks apart so far). Could be temporary comparable to the earlier covid symptoms of taste and smell loss. But there is no knowing. I am on meds for Lyme. There are no meds for tinnitus and hearing loss. I'd love to see some follow-up in the press about these vaccine side effects.
2021-04-13 12:55,"Those of us who remember the smallpox vaccine (which we no longer need because...it worked!) will remember that it caused skin scarring. The scar was the sign that the vaccine worked!  It was a badge of honor.  Today, if we had a vaccine that caused a scar it would not be approved. 

There is a small but nonzero chance of getting sick from many vaccines, like the MMR...nevertheless, vaccines save far more lives than they damage or end.  

I have had my two Moderna vaccines (which I needed for work, as I am a front-line doctor who makes house calls), fortunately had no unpredicted side effects and have been immune for over two months.  I and other vaccinated people expect not to have to worry about COVID, and worse, long COVID.  I did not feel that getting vaccinated was a gamble, but if it was, it's been worth it.  I had a (vaccinated) friend over for dinner last night and am having (vaccinated) friends over tonight as well.

I was lucky.  Most people who get vaccinated will be lucky too.  In fact, ALMOST ALL people who get vaccinated will be fine and then immune.  Get vaccinated!"
2021-04-13 12:56,"Instead of pausing, perhaps we could just allow the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for males and for people over age 60 (categories that do not appear to be at risk for the clotting disorder). Inevitably setbacks (even tragic setbacks) will occur during vaccine rollouts. Meantime people are dying of Covid. A more nimble response by the CDC to these setbacks may enable the saving of lives by a significant margin."
2021-04-13 12:58,Isn’t 1 in a million on par with the risk of being struck by lightning? It’s in the realm of events that nobody worries or even thinks about.  The risk of clots is 1000x higher (1 in 1000) for birth control pills. I wonder how many more people will die of COVID in our futile quest to reduce all risk to zero without thinking of trade offs or even the common sense of comparing to other medications.
2021-04-13 12:47,What about the pediatrician who died due to an acute clotting disorder shortly after receiving the Pfizer vaccine ? Seems like all the vaccines have this very rare side effect but nobody seems to discuss Pfizer. Fear of law suits ?
2021-04-13 12:41,"All the reported clots pretty much bracket the age range for using the pill which causes 1 in 1000 women per year to have a blood clot. Which translates to approximately 19 per week out of a million women. Assuming only half the women are on the pill, you get around 10 per week out of a million women. They are seeing 1 in a million showing blood clots with the vaccine. We have been vaccinating in descending age bands except for health care and preexisting conditions. The J&J vaccine was introduced just as the vaccinations were opened up to all adults. It also is targeted at the college age population at universities. So it really is the first vaccine to run straight into the population who are on the pill."
2021-04-13 12:45,"Over the past few weeks, AP stories have reported the blood clots is - at least in some countries - were all women between 25 - 60.
I wondered, since it's been documented almost since they came on the market, if oral contraceptives or estrogen hormones were being used by these women at the time they had the vax?
Or, since they are now finding immune response issues with *these* blood clot patients, if immune issues could have caused the initial blood clots/strokes that occurred when the birth control pill was first marketed?

To me, someone old enough to remember when young women started having blood clots & strokes in the early oral contraceptive years before the estrogen level was decreased, I don't understand why estrogen hormones weren't the first thing that came to mind when these blood clots primarily/exclusively in women started happening.

No rushed study is needed immediately before changes can be made.  I don't understand why we all aren't being  asked if we are taking any kind of hormone in the vax pre-vax screening questionnaire - I wasn't it mine & I've has both Pfizers. Pre-screen & publicize & have women between 25 - 60 - on hormones, particularly - take the Pfizer or Moderna vax while the Astra-Zeneca is being studied going forward - because, more than likely,  we will be taking covid booster shots for years."
2021-04-13 12:43,"I am 5 weeks out from my Johnson vaccine, but reading this was like a punch in the stomach.  It gives me a little more sympathy for people who are hesitant because of the lack of data (but not for those who think it's a mechanism for secretly microchipping me).

I had no unusual symptoms following the vaccine, so I hope that I am in the clear."
2021-04-13 12:41,"I'm a woman in this age group, and I also happen to have an inherited clotting disorder that (thankfully) has not yet resulted in a clot.  The pandemic presents a terrible catch-22 for people like me.  Covid could reasonably cause me to have a life-changing clot.  The vaccine carries much less risk for me than covid, but if it could also potentially kill me, I think it merits an investigation and I am glad that the FDA and the CDC are addressing it.  There is a difference between hesitancy over conspiracy theories and hesitancy over a legitimate health concern."
2021-04-13 12:49,"A rare cerebral venous thrombosis occurred in my daughter's brain when she was 26.  It was a terrifying two years of warfarin and bi-weekly blood tests before it dissolved and why I adamant oppose her receiving the Astra-Zeneca and, now, it appears, the Johnson vaccine. 

But I just hope the Moderna/Pfizer 'new technology' alternative doesn't evolve into an even worse long-term thalidomide-esque debacle.  Only time will tell."
2021-04-13 12:48,Perhaps you could share with us those symptoms leading to hospitalization - something to be aware of? Those of us who have loved who have received the J&J vaccine might be curious to know that.
2021-04-13 12:42,"Pfizer and Moderna both had longer and much larger trials than J&J or for that matter Astra Zenica.

In our rush (both here and in Europe) to provide cheaper / easier alternatives to the vaccines that underwent the most rigorous testing we have now created a situation where people are dying and worse given the vaccine reluctant and flat out anti vaxers reason to continue to refuse vaccine.

We should have stuck with the stuff we KNEW was safe and had longer and larger trials for the others that came later.

Now we have a real problem because you cannot unring that bell.

In an attempt to save lives we have moved too fast and now many people will die who did not have to because we have shaken faith in vaccines badly."
2021-04-13 12:43,In my country 1 in 7 people have tested positive for covid. I'm immune suppressed due to liver transplant. I was very proactive for a vaccine appointment and received my first in end of February. got my second shot 3 weeks later. Mine was Pfizer with zero adverse reaction. looking forward to a golf trip in Florida in May.
2021-04-13 12:24,"The majority of Americans will not be impacted by this setback as Pfizer and Moderna are supplying more than enough currently, and we’re within a few weeks of softening demand.

For the poorer countries of the world, this is a major blow. 1 billion doses are scheduled from J&J in 2021. It’s a cheap, easier to store, one shot vaccine. 

Hope they can get to the bottom of it quickly and find easy solutions to what appears to be a minuscule risk."
2021-04-13 13:01,"My question is are there other adenovirus-based vaccines used on a commercial basis today? Any concerns there? Hopefully the public won't buy off on the AZ and JJ statement that the blood clotting is so rare that it off sets the positive use of the drug. Right, tell me that make me feel ok when my 18 year old child dies from a blood clot in their brain. Pitiful. I say to the world: boycott AZ an JJ vaccines until they get their act together. And the CDC and other country medical authorities should immediately suspend the use of these drugs. That will make sure they will quickly correct the problem. A concern for their credibility and their concern for loses will insure they get their act together immediately."
2021-04-13 12:20,Novavax can't be approved soon enough.
2021-04-13 12:21,It's idiotic to pause with this small incidence. How many of these women were on the pill?
2021-04-13 12:55,What a mess
2021-04-13 12:23,"This is another NYTimes story with more detail about the low platelet reaction - <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/health/immune-thrombocytopenia-covid-vaccine-blood.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/health/immune-thrombocytopenia-covid-vaccine-blood.html</a>"

2021-04-13 12:17,"So much for ""vaccine hesitancy"" being some sort of mental disorder to be overcome and censored."
2021-04-13 12:12,"""An abundance of caution"" = Knee jerk overreaction."
2021-04-13 12:41,"After being on an extremely long vaccine waiting list, I finally got the J&J shot this past weekend. So, now I need to fear getting a deadly blood blot. Good grief!"
2021-04-13 13:05,"Unfortunately, antivaxxers will use this news and the issues with AZ to scare the public from getting any of the vaccines."
2021-04-13 12:53,"So about 1 in 1.5 million? Odds of getting struck by lightning are 1 in 500,000 in any given year. Pausing the rollout was stupid. We just lost everyone who was on the fence about getting a vaccine and will not reach herd immunity via vaccine in the US."
2021-04-13 13:03,Good thing those 15 J&J million doses were messed up and not released.
2021-04-13 12:30,"Covid itself causes blood clots that kill through stroke or cardiac arrest. Given the incident stats for the vaccine compared to other known and approved drugs, like birth control and HRT, this seems like an extreme measure, and a truly irresponsible headline that will slow vaccinations at a time when we need to speed them up."
2021-04-13 12:56,"If you compare the incidence of blood clots post-J&J-vaccination with the incidence in the population over all, you might discover that this vaccine prevents blood clots. Google “post hoc ergo propter hoc”."
2021-04-13 12:37,"Why don’t these articles at least include the names of the sort of blood clot one might expect to see.? If we know the name we might be able to steer our doctors unfamiliar with the issue toward doing no harm. Heparin is not the drug of choice with these types of clots.

2021-04-13 12:45,A lot of people who think they are smarter than the physicians held out for the European built J&J vaccine. Not smart. The best vaccine is the first one you can get in your own arm.
2021-04-13 13:03,"Having COVID-19 makes you much more hypercoagulable than a vaccine, dear readers.  

Patient who received the J&j vaccine—> 1:1000000 chance of thrombosis

Patient in ICU with COVID-19—>1:10 or 20 chance of deep venous thrombosis, plus other assorted fun experiences like being proned on mechanical ventilation while you die with strangers and your family says good-bye to you on an iPad.

Wish the Times could demonstrate more responsible reporting, and also ensure the reader understands the known hypercoagulability that is associated with having severe COVID-19.  Which is much more Iikely to happen.  Without being vaccinated.  

The “anti-vaxxers” can “do their research” and Google that one."
2021-04-13 12:38,"A one in a million chance? I'm willing to take those odds to be vaccinated against the far more dangerous Covid, no problem!"
2021-04-13 12:46,In the US you’re twelve times more likely to die from COVID than a traffic fatality.
2021-04-13 13:04,"For those looking for the signs and symptoms of this rare clotting problem, “vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia”, they are listed in a link that is in the NYT article, “ AstraZeneca Vaccine and Blood Clots”.....

Patients should seek medical assistance immediately if they have the following symptoms

shortness of breath
chest pain
swelling in your leg
persistent abdominal (belly) pain
neurological symptoms, including severe and persistent headaches or blurred vision
tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the site of injection"
2021-04-13 12:57,"The risk of blood clots with this vaccine are significantly less than the risk both for oral contraceptives and also much less than the risks of thromboembolism after a normal pregnancy. 
Per American Society of Reproductive Medicine:

The incidence of VTE is 5–20/ 10,000 woman-years in pregnancy and 40–65/10,000 woman-years post- partum, compared with 1–5/10,000 woman-years outside of pregnancy.

2021-04-13 13:09,"I keep wondering if researchers are looking at a relationship between use of birth control pills and these events, since they seem to have occurred almost exclusively in women of child-bearing age. We know that birth control pills can raise one’s blot clot risk. I know that’s not the usual scientific process, but if we could determine that such a relationship exists, it might be possible to resume administration of the adenovirus vaccines with the warning that people using birth control pills should receive the mRNA vaccines instead."
2021-04-13 13:09,"So far, all of the vaccine recipients who developed clots were women of relatively young age. It would be important to know if they were also receiving oral contraceptives or other hormonal therapies which could have been another factor increasing clotting risk when taken together with the vaccine.

In the meantime, it makes little sense for the FDA to approve the Astra Zeneca vaccine for emergency use (if they do apply for it), until this all gets sorted out, as it appears the U.S. will still have an adequate supply of vaccines to meet its goal. Approving a vaccine that is under suspicion of causing serious side effects (even if the ""cost benefit is acceptable"") will shake confidence in the other vaccines especially among those who are already hesitant to receive it."
2021-04-13 13:10,"I’m a woman in this age group and after weeks of going on line multiple times a day trying to find an appointment here in the SF Bay Area I finally booked one yesterday. It was for the J and J. Percentage wise I realize the risk may be low, but I’m not going to take the chance. I’ll start over and will hopefully be able to find another one soon."
2021-04-13 13:13,"Are they pausing due to liability at this point? If they update the release you sign before you take the vaccine to include ""infinitesimal risk of blood clotting"" will vaccination be able to resume?

My wife and I got J&J, and we'd get it again even knowing this risk. Every day we delay vaccination gives the virus another day to mutate."
2021-04-13 12:43,"It will go like this: until the USA has vaccinated its people, they will be 'selfish' and others show off distributing mediocre vaccines. Comes July, USA will have its people safe AND will save  the world.  We are waiting."
2021-04-13 12:40,So maybe for women under 50- go with Pfizer.
2021-04-13 12:09,"It appears that - as of the numbers in this article - the percentage is 0.00065 of people with reported blood clots out of the 34M who've received the shot. Of course this is a worrying problem, and I respect the decision to pause for further study, but for anyone else out there who, like me, has a loved one who took the J&J and panicked at this headline, I hope that percentage gives you some hope. It does appear to be very, very rare indeed."
2021-04-13 12:22,"Loss of life is always devastating - I am truly sorry for those who have lost someone due to these complications.

I do also believe the benefits of using this vaccine still outweigh the dangers - 6 in 7,000,000? The damage pausing J & J will cause is far greater - between the loss of actual shots in arms, this will only embolden and expand the reach of under-informed anti-vaxxers who are already complicating our national vaccine roll out"
2021-04-13 12:54,"Has nobody noticed that Covid kills at a very high rate, and that includes the poverty and isolation it causes?  Stopping this vaccine, even for a week, will create so much doubt that many more people will die of covid. Unnecessarily. Foolishness all around."
2021-04-13 13:11,This will provide more fodder for the anti-vax activists and increase vaccine hesitancy among many. Hoping scientists can get to the bottom of this soon.
2021-04-13 13:14,"This timing is very unfortunate. My wheelchair-bound mother who requires a medical van to get to doctor's appointments was scheduled to get the J&J vaccine tomorrow. It's not impossible for her to get another vaccine (she made a Pfizer appointment for this Friday), but now it's another inconvenience and risk of exposure with the driver to get her second dose. The J&J one-shot approach very much changes the game for people with limited mobility or transportation options."
2021-04-13 13:09,Exactely like AZ here in Europe. Same rare but serious blood clots specially on women under 60.
2021-04-13 13:18,"I got the J&J vaccine on Friday, because it is impossible to get an appointment in my county from any of the pharmacy chains or hospitals. When an appointment was offered at our County's new ""mass vaccination"" site, shortly before it would be open to everyone in the STATE over age 16, I signed up. And I got the vaccine they offered.

I was hoping to get the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, because of their apparently higher efficacy. And, everyone I know has gotten one of those two. 

I've since reassured myself that the J&J vaccine was still worth getting. And, the J&J trials enrolled a much higher percentage of people with higher risk of Covid infections: members of minority groups, people over 60, and people with co-morbidities. [Of course, that might not make a difference to the efficacy rate, since they are comparing people with similar demographics who either got the J&J vaccine or didn't get it.]

I'll try to remember that the vaccine will, in theory, protect me from a severe case of Covid. Hopefully."
2021-04-13 13:10,"My friend’s entire family, both immediate and extended, didn’t ‘believe in’ covid, and all became infected. Her father and mother, who were older but active - gardening, walking, driving, shopping, enjoying life - died within three days of each other. She said goodbye to each of them on FaceTime. 

Every one of those non-believers wish they had worn a mask, and all are trying to get vaccinated. 

mRNA vaccines have in fact been studied for years. And the risks associated with being vaccinated are far lower than those with getting covid."
2021-04-13 13:09,My sister received this vaccine a few days ago. I wish I knew a way to prevent this side effect. Aspirin?
2021-04-13 13:06,"Is there anything you can do if you already got the vaccine? Will drinking more liquid, walking more, eating certain foods, etc help to reduce the chances of blood clots?"
2021-04-13 13:16,"I am not a medical expert but I along with my three coworkers took the JJ vaccine and did just fine. The odds of getting blood cloth with any vaccine or medication should have been taken into consideration before pausing it. If the strategy of the FDA is to get people to go and get any of other two vaccines that are readily available unlike JJ which is in shortage due to that fiasco, then it should be honest with the public.  News like this will further put fear in people who are already on the fence."
2021-04-13 13:12,"Assuming the story is correct, it's extraordinary that the vaccine would be paused with one person in a million + having developed a severe reaction.  Meanwhile, as the statistics suggest, thousands are dying every week because they have not been vaccinated. Whatever happened to the public good!"
2021-04-13 13:21,This pause will lead to more loss of life as the increased risk of COVID due to delayed vaccination and amplification of vaccine hesitancy will far outweigh the reaction risks of J&J's vaccine.  This pause action was a huge mistake.
2021-04-13 13:10,My guess is the vaccine was pulled for issues far more serious than a few individuals developing blood clots.  Something doesn’t add up.
2021-04-13 13:09,"If the blood clots are so far only developing with people under a certain age (so fat 18-48),  then perhaps there is some kind of direct connection between any medications these younger women may be taking.I told my wife perhaps it's birth control pills, and then even Sanjay Gupta from CNN, said the same thing. Fortunately (so far and cross my fingers), I received the  Pfizer vaccine a few weeks ago, and I'm hoping that there are no contraindications!"
2021-04-13 13:07,"We’re the 6 cases women under age 48, as I read. And if so we’re they on birth control pills which in itself can lead to blood clotting?"
2021-04-13 13:24,"I admire my aunt and uncle more than just about anyone on this planet. They have both been hesitant to receive the mRNA vaccines and were more receptive to the JnJ vaccine, due to it being a more ""traditional"" vaccine. 

With this news, they will almost certainly hold off from innoculation. While this is an anecdotal reference, there are undoubtedly many others in this same boat. 

Make no mistake about it, this decision will have real consequences with people who could have otherwise been vaccinated."
2021-04-13 13:27,"It's interesting that the FDA has completely stopped the use of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine because of the rare blood clotting events, while the UK and European regulatory agencies are continuing to use (although with limitations) the Astra Zeneca vaccine that produces the same type of blood clotting. 

It's also interesting that Australia says it won't purchase Johnson and Johnsons' adenovirus vaccine but it is still using AstraZeneca's adenovirus vaccine that is producing the same adverse effect.

For once, I have to say that the US is for once being more responsible than other countries. 

But I do have to say that a lot of decisions made by people and governments about these vaccines appear to be so nationalistic. Countries in the British commonwealth seem to overlook the problems with the AstraZeneca clinical trials and brush off the vaccine's adverse effects. But they appear more unforgiving and critical of other country's vaccines."
2021-04-13 13:28,"It would be helpful to get more advice on what people who received this vaccine should do to rule out issues. If recipients had persistent headaches or other symptoms, do they need to seek treatment? And how is this particular clot treated? The article states that while heparin is the usual course of treatment for a clot, heparin is dangerous for anyone suffering from this particular type of clot. What happens instead?"
2021-04-13 13:28,"The article would have benefitted from some additional analysis. Six people out of seven million developed blood clots and one died. The smallpox vaccine had 1000 out of one million develop serious side affects with two people per million dying from the vaccine. Nobody suggested stop vaccinating for smallpox. All vaccines carry small risks, but the benefits greatly outweigh those risks."
2021-04-13 13:30,"Sadly, this will convince the fence sitters and naysayers that they were right in being suspicious of vaccines.  But the fact of the matter remains that all medical treatments have risks, even flu shots.   And 6 people out of 7,000,000 represents .000086% of those who have received the vaccine, a much better risk than  say being one of the 2% of people who die after contracting Covid-19.  So, I'll gladly take my chances with the vaccines.  The odds are infinitely more in our favor."
2021-04-13 13:31,"It would be extremely productive for the benefit of all if the industry or the media provided a visual primer to explain these scientifically complex issues to the public. 

For example, a flow chart of the manufacturing process with all of its bills of material requirements, pre-dispensing testing, in process testing, retained samples, etc..  A layered illustration of the encapsulated, sterile, air lock controlled manufacturing train. It is a highly, highly controlled environment with protocols that under proper management is a daily discipline for each employee during the entire time of their shift. Onsite and third party testing labs regularly test each other to validate their processes and investigative capabilities to source root cause analyses of any out of spec results. The entire operation if correctly accomplished becomes a set of redundant actions/tests done in isolation of each other to ensure their results are equal. It is not the same as manufacturing cookies or candy or any other product that is intended for human use, ingestion, or consumption. There are excellent to awful facilities out there but, for the most part, the FDA does a good job inspecting domestic manufacturers.

It is sad to learn of the clotting issue in the Jansen vaccine. The numbers are very small but that does nothing to buffer the grief of those with serious adverse reactions with resulting hospitalizations and injury or death."
2021-04-13 13:37,"Both the J & J and AstraZeneca vaccines use an AAV (Adenovirus associated Virus) delivery system. There is some data that the AZ vaccine induced platelet-activating antibodies, suggesting that either the vaccine is infecting megakaryocytes ( precursor to platelets) to produce a rare autoimmune response or it is in some other way (cross-reactivity?) inducing antibodies against a platelet antigen (thrombin receptor?) although other mechanisms may be possible. One also wonders whether surface expression of the Coronavirus spike protein is leading to cell fusion and that this contributes to the pathology. Unfortunately, I think the mechanism needs to be determined and addressed before the J&J vaccine goes back into use. And, also unfortunately, that is unlikely to happen."
2021-04-13 13:51,"I’m a 25-year-old male who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine two weeks ago.

While my initial side effects were fairly common (fatigue, muscle soreness, fever) and subsided within 24 hours, I was shocked to discover 6 to 8 small bruises on my left calf develop a week after vaccination. After visiting an urgent care facility, I was encouraged to go to the ER for bloodwork to be performed quickly to confirm that I was not suffering from immune thrombocytopenia, a rare blood disorder first reported by the NYT in early February amongst recipients of both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines which causes platelet count to effectively drop to zero. Fortunately, my bloodwork came back fine, I was discharged from the ER, and the bruising disappeared after a few days. Having received the vaccine in my left arm and with no other probable cause for bruising to occur in such a localized area repeatedly, I am convinced there is some correlation, I’m just hoping it was mild and that I have recovered.

All told, I remain incredibly happy to have been vaccinated, but I share the very real concerns of many, especially as it relates to the limited data we have on the long term effects post-vaccination and the way it can affect different subsets of our population."
2021-04-13 14:08,"The public needs to know what the symptoms of their blood clotting disorder are, what they should look for, what kind of medical attention they should seek and what the treatments are.  The article lists what the treatments are not - heparin.  That’s helpful to some extent.  Without this missing, basic information we are just left with fear."
2021-04-13 14:09,Did anyone check to see if those six women between the ages of 18 and 48 were on birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy? Clots have been an issue since the pill was first introduced. One could conjecture that the introduction of the vaccine could send a few women into the danger zone.
2021-04-13 14:11,"My glass-half-full take on this situation is that we now have proof that health officials are vigilantly monitoring the roll out process and have the power to pump the brakes even when it's not politically inconvenient to do so. If this is standard operating procedure for treatments that have received emergency authorization, I am reassured that no steps are being skipped due to expediency.

That said, I think health officials could have done a much better job priming the public for this scenario.  They have been pushing this idea that these vaccines are perfectly safe when all they just needed to say was that their benefits far outweigh their risks. The inability of our health officials to be consistent in their messaging has been a recurring problem through out this pandemic."
2021-04-13 12:39,"Well, looks like they need to use ""warp speed"" to have an immediate protocol for blood clotting cases with the vaccine."
2021-04-13 13:09,John Hopkins says about 5 in 1 million people get this every year. So 6 in 7 million is about 1/6 normal expected rates. Maybe we should be looking at the J and J vaccine as a cure?
2021-04-13 13:24,"Unfortunately, this will fuel the anti-vax debate which is steeped in misinformation and conspiracy.  We're mired in an era of too much topical information and not enough intelligent discourse.

One doesn't have to stretch the messaging too far to feed into the frenzy that people should resist vaccination at all expense for fear of minute odds that your molecular diversity could have an adverse reaction.  The age old equivalent of a lightning strike shouldn't prevent one form ever going outdoors to enjoy fresh air, but in an era of flat-earthers and election-fixers a shred of information that can be distorted is quickly weaponized.

Sit back and observe.  The conspiracy crowd is ramping up."
2021-04-13 13:54,"This is unfortunate , however  the speed with which the virus hit us , resulting  in none of the vaccines going  through a traditional 3 or 4 year trial to establish long term effects, means we may find  some surprising side effects .  If we  had waited   the 3/4 years  worldwide hundreds of millions would have died.
We just need to regroup, move forward with what we have to work with and continue to push for all Americans to be vaccinated. 
This will have no impact on those intent on not getting vaccinated , since  largely their decision making is based on politics not science
 Now would also  be a good time  for the  Federal Government  to look into the  implementation  of a Vaccine Passport .
 To allow the Government and Private business to restrict the movement and  ability of those who 'refuse' to get vaccinated to live like their is no virus 
.  If we want to get back to life as it it was in 2019 , or something that resembles that we can only do so knowing that the person standing beside you on the subway has Corona Virus immunity. The way to be certain of that is a white piece of paper stating that your identity has been verified and that you have been vaccinated."
2021-04-13 13:09,Why aren't we told about the general health of the blood clot cases? Do they have any comorbidities?
2021-04-13 13:26,"""Abundance of caution,"" and ""listen to the scientists"" were great slogans that won Biden the presidency against Trump who was seen as rash and a non-believer. 

With the presidency now in the bag, being over-cautious is not the solution. Vaccines for such a pandemic take 5 years to develop and it is amazing that vaccines began to roll out last year, in just 9 months. We all knew the risks of such rapid development, but the risks of pausing now are a lot more."
2021-04-13 13:16,"I keep reading that the benefits of the vaccines ""outweigh the risks,"" which focuses on the macro, population-level analysis. As someone who wants the vaccine, I'm less interested in that rosy public policy calculation than I am in this one:

If you are one of the admittedly few unfortunates, what are the odds of surviving blood clots in the brain, as opposed to surviving a case of Covid?"
2021-04-13 13:26,Here’s an idea - which many European countries have researched and are following. Administer J&J to men- who don’t seem to be having these blood clot issues. Why stop a vaccine rollout entirely? 6 cases in 7 million are very very low odds.
2021-04-13 13:40,Is the risk higher for women of certain age groups and of particular genetics backgrounds? What symptoms should those who have had the vaccine look for? Also should those folks refrain from flying or diving for a period of time after the vaccination? Would taking baby aspirin help to prevent it? It would be great if Federal health officials also attempt to address these associated issues.
2021-04-13 13:41,"Not sure we're getting the whole story.  Regardless, I would never get a vaccine from that company due to it's history of cover ups where they had hidden toxic ingredients.   I just can't support them morally and will certainly not inject one of their vaccines ever.  All vaccines carry some risk and all you have to do is google each of their ingredients to see that.  It's time to start creating organic vaccines, yet there appears to be no effort to do so."
2021-04-13 13:46,"Sounds to me as though the vaccine is not nearly as likely to produce fatal blood clots as the Pill, while Covid-19 is far more common and far more dangerous than pregnancy."
2021-04-13 14:06,"We need an abundance of courage, not an abundance of of caution right now.  This decision (even if the pause only lasts a few days) will undermine confidence in the vaccine that is supposed to be best suited to reach marginalized communities.  These communities already have high rates of vaccine skepticism.  Unfortunately there is not putting the genie back in the bottle.  The damage has been done."
2021-04-13 13:32,"How many people have died in auto accidents on the way to/from getting the vaccine?  Or on the way to the corner grocery, or out to dinner?

Cars are far more dangerous - let's ban them and until then, use them rarely and carefully.  They are lethal, and not just to the user."
2021-04-13 13:18,"This is what I find admirable about America and more particularly about the Biden administration.
They discovered some problems with the Astra- Zeneca vaccine and they halted its use. They have now paused the Johnson and Johnson vaccine due to similar concerns
 I am a British Indian living in India due the force of circumstances following a divorce.
The Indian Government until yesterday, had only given permission for two vaccines, one based on the Oxford- AstraZeneca research and another local product. There is no protection for people like me who feel uncomfortable with 
both and people like Rahul Gandhi who say that other vaccines like Moderna and Pfizer should be allowed in are being criticised by Ministers as someone acting for the pharmaceutical industry.
This is unacceptable arrogance and dishonest bullying by the Indian Government.
I am 83 and as a British citizen want to decide what goes in my body. The Indian Government have no right to push me towards their vaccines about which serious doubts have been expressed. 
Boris Johnson and Joe Biden please help a stranded but determined old man.

P.S. As if stupidity was not enough, they have yesterday approved the Sputnik ( Russian) vaccine for “emergency use”
I want Pfizer or Moderna in my body urgently."
2021-04-13 13:04,"Literally one in a million. I can understand investigating this, but shutting down? No."
2021-04-13 13:28,"The crucial question here is the mechanism by which the autoantibody forms.  The adenovirus is a vector that delivers the viral spike protein DNA into host cells.  The DNA is integrated into the nucleus and the cell produces the spike protein and displays it on its surface.  This induces the immune system to produce antibodies.  However, the spike protein could also interact with other cell surface components, potentially leading to antibodies formed against these self proteins.  Whether this occurs or not depends on the individual's immunogenetics, because the antigens are presented to the immune cells in association with what are called MHC antigens (in humans called HLA), which are unique in each person.  This is the basis for many drug allergies as well.  We might only be seeing the effects of antibodies that lead to devastating conditions now.  Some autoimmune responses take time to develop into illnesses.  Without searching for these autoantibodies, we will only know when we see an unusual rise in the incidence of certain diseases.  The best example is encephalitis lethargica associated with the Spanish flu epidemic, which only became apparent years later.  These DNA and mRNA vaccines, being such strong immunogens, risk provoking such problems.  As we Chinese say, needles are never sharp at both ends.  We might celebrate the superior efficacy of these new technologies now, but we still don't know what the ultimate cost will be."
2021-04-13 12:44,"""Federal officials expect that state health officials will take that as a strong signal to do the same.""

I'm waiting for Gov. Ron DeSantis to proclaim that J&J vaccines continue to be administered in Florida. It would follow his pattern of ignoring science, overruling the CDC and blazing his own trail."
2021-04-13 13:11,"Oh great, my 21 year old daughter is supposed to get her J&J vaccine tomorrow. Waiting for the text or email from Cook County, IL, Health Dept telling her that her appointment is being cancelled. So frustrating."
2021-04-13 13:31,"So, the ratio of clotting is approx. 1 in 1-million, which initiates a FULL pause on vaccination!! This is just not good!"
2021-04-13 13:21,"Every year there are 100,000 death due to blood clot.  7 million people were given J&J vaccine, and 6 of them developed blood blood.  Statistically speaking, the causation between J&J vaccine and Blood clot death is very weak.  The government overreacts."
2021-04-13 13:30,"The death rate from cerebrovascular events in the US is traditionally about 165,000 cases per year.  That works out to a prevalence of about 50/100,000.  The rate of cerebrovascular events with Janssen's vaccine is 0.1/100,000.  Meanwhile, the death rate from COVID over the last year in the US has been 170/100,000.   So we're going to stop protecting people from a disease that is 1,700 times more fatal than the cure.  I fail to see any science or even rational thought in that scenario."

And if the Times published the odds of being in a car accident in a two-week period, how many drivers would stay home?

How many women in the US get blood clots in a given two-week period?

The sky is not falling, at least not from the vaccine. But the sky will continue to rain down on us from COVID if we don't get everyone vaccinated, and fast. 

In the meantime, couldn't this article, and a thousand others, remind readers that proper mask-wearing and staying home are as effective at containing the pandemic as is the vaccine? We need to maintain containment protocols until everyone is vaccinated and the all-clear siren is souned.

There isn't even a proven causal link"
2021-04-13 13:17,"Another reactionary stumble taken by an agency run by Peter Principle bureaucrats. Science will out and prove almost all of these so called side effects are coincidental. Statistically ITP is seen in 5/1,000,000 per year. The question is where are the other 30 cases expected? Slowing a program by moving the finish line is lunacy."
2021-04-13 13:44,"It’s kinda important the government can convince us these new vaccines won’t end up like Rick Potion #9. This doesn’t help.

2021-04-13 12:39,I'm in my '80s and received the J&J covid vaccination on March 29th. I had Total Knee Replacement last March and ended up with a blood clot in the calf of that leg.     At this point I'm just paying attention to the news reports. If I have any questions I'll contact my family doctor.
2021-04-13 13:14,"I did some quick, very back-of-the-envelope calculations. About 1.24 million U.S. women aged 18 to 45 have received the J&J vaccine. On average, we would expect that during this time period about four of these women would experience the CVST clot that is of concern to the CDC, unfortunately. Again these are very crude estimates. But four is not that far from six. 

We could also have expected that about eight of these women would have died from covid, as compared to one so far from CVST. During this period, we could also expect that about 250-1,000 would have tested covid positive (with long term effects unknown) and about 50 to 100 of them would have been hospitalized due to covid.

Again these are crude estimates. Please feel free to correct me if any of my numbers are wrong.  But it is important to put risks in their appropriate context."
2021-04-13 13:22,I wonder if there is any way to tell how common this really is. Do people get 'near-miss' clotting events that resolve on their own and go unnoticed?
2021-04-13 13:28,"It's quite frankly bizarre that they pause deployment. Look at how many are killed by covid and how many have rare blood clots. 
It's something like 6m get the vaccine, 6 suffer blood clots, and  the number prevented from getting covid and potentially dying in comparison is huge."
2021-04-13 12:42,"If you're ready to rage, I suggest you read Invisible Women Data Bias in a World Designed for Men by Caroline Criado Perez. Maybe it's a coincidence that blood clot patients of AZ an J&J vaccines are women, maybe it's not. This isn't about sexism - the world is full of great men, but it's also objective reality that the world was built by and for men. Medicine was built on our understanding of the male body. Human bodies are similar in many ways, but they're also critically different, and female bodies are harmed by this bias. 

It wasn't until 1993 that it was written into law that women and minorities be included in clinical research. 

A Google search will also show you plenty of statistics on women's experience with medicine - notably that their pain is underestimated and often written off, and they aren't believed when telling drs about their own experiences in their own body. 

Food for thought."
2021-04-13 12:51,"One of the most important things to remember about building codes, scuba diving tables, CFR on Food and Drugs, etc. is that this collective caution has been paid for by loss of property, injury, and loss of life. For those questioning the pause for this particular vaccine, understand that the FDA took a risk based on the need to get shots into arms but continued to monitor the situation to make sure that it made the right choice in approval. This was the best approach, given the circumstances. The pause is 100% the right thing to do."
2021-04-13 13:02,"I’m 63 and the main reason I went with J&J was that the times had published a article back in February, reporting on a rare blood disorder ITP, immune thrombocytopenia, that was occurring in people who had had either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. At the time 36 cases had been reported with one possible death related to it. I had ITP many years ago after contracting a virus and luckily survived after having been given high doses of prednisone and ultimately a splenectomy. My fear of having this recur was why I went with J&J. I’m not sure if they are all interrelated,but,my question is why hasn’t the FDA and CDC put a halt on or looked into this on Moderna and Pfizer ? It’s been two weeks since I had the shot and so far so good, fingers crossed !"
2021-04-13 13:29,"I'm a careful guy myself, so I'm okay with ""an abundance of caution."" But in a country where, and in a time when so many people are putting themselves and others at risk because we can't wrap our heads around ""the numbers"" regarding Covid, I think the NYT ought to be providing some ""context"" on this story.

It seems that people who get the J&J vaccine have about a 1 in a million chance of developing blood clots.  The National Weather Service says that's just a little higher than my chance of being struck by lightning this year.

Certainly, this deserves some additional study - and it would be great to get a better understanding of which vaccine works better/worse for different segments of the population.  But I'm afraid that stories like this, without some ""nuance"" just provide some people with another ill-founded reason not to get vaccinated."
2021-04-13 13:34,"It appears that the incidence of a rare bly restricting its use to blood clot disorder are far lower for the J7J vaccine than for Astra-Zeneca's.  Given the dire need for vaccines worldwide, hopefully the review can result in restricting its use to certain people by age/gender/health condition, as opposed to taking it off the market altogether.   The J&J vaccine is already protecting 7 million Americans, it has already saved at least hundreds of lives as a result."

2021-04-13 12:41,"Multiple relatives through in-laws have a gene called Factor V Leiden, which is not as uncommon as once would have thought. It causes the blood to clot more easily, so these relatives have had to take precautions when trying to get pregnant, have to take blood thinners as they get older, and have to be careful to not sit too long. They are all concerned about the vaccine in general because of this reason. 

Are the researchers looking into this gene as the possible connection? Because from the view of my husband’s family and my brother’s wife and her family, this connection seems readily plausible and a strong candidate to explore."
2021-04-13 13:13,"I'm taking a deep breath trying to keep my mind from racing out of control. I just got off my return plane ride from across the country visiting family for a week after I was vaccinated. I'm  afraid of vaccine variants taking hold. I'm certain some mutants are going to develop that survive at length on surfaces. The airport was rife with people with masks on, but with both nares uncovered. i.e. nostrils exposed, including airline employees. The TSA lines were out of control jammed. The flight attendants said that the number of air travellers has been exploding in the past few weeks. Airport attendants were loathe to confront passengers flouting the rules, because their livelyhoods depend on appeasing the mood of the general public Passengers should be allowed to deplane from the front and rear exits into the open air. Food should not be served. Opening plastic snack bags is pretty unsanitary in a pandemic. Only cellphone texting should be allowed. A lot of people were removing masks to eat and to speak on cellphones. Disabled people should not be required by the TSA to prove their prosthetic devices are not potential weapons.  The TSA should shoo visitors away from the security lines. Saying goodbye should be done outside the airport. On the pacific coast teenaged libertarian wannabees without masks were open carrying small daggers on their belts. What's wrong with this picture ?? Oh yes, and the vaccine has real and measurable side effects."

Symptoms of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis may vary, depending on the location of the thrombus. Responding quickly to these symptoms makes it more possible to recover.

2021-04-13 14:09,"The adenovirus vector delivery system of DNA coding for virus spike is unique to J and J and AZ, but all the current vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna included, go on to product mRNA and eventually spike protein. It is most likely this end of the process is where the central cerebral venous thrombosis risk occurs. If B and plasma cells exposed to the spike undergo a clonal expansion, due to a strong signal, they can produce crossover antibodies to platelets, something known as HIT-2. As platelets decrease due to antibody mediated attacks clot forms, in this case in a very unusual and rare location. It is the plasma cell expansion as a result of the vaccine that needs looking into. If the expansion of plasma cells produces one particular antibody in large amounts that is known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). MGUS is associated with auto immune disorders and something called Capillary Leak Syndrome or Clarkson’s syndrome where antibodies attack the endothelium, the inner lining of all of our blood vessels. Capillary leak syndrome has been identified in a few AZ and J and J recipients. The signal of concern here is that the immune response or vaccine endpoint might be heading towards MGUS in some people. Who and why is a valid question because MGUS is a precursor to Multiple Myeloma. I think the FDA is correct in its recommendation and I think the investigation should be extended to looking at this issue in Moderna and Pfizer recipients as well."
2021-04-13 14:25,"I just read an article that says women produce antibodies more readily than men, yet vaccine doses are set based on men’s responses only. This problem seems to need more attention. (Sorry I can’t point to the article, but it was in a reputable news source like NYT.)"

I can imagine that there are a few million women that might be worrying a little; men as well who received it, even though the 6 affected were all women.

The mistake by Biden was pushing the eligibility for all adults too soon (with reliance on J&J). The Aged-Based roll-out was working well, but now getting an appointment will be harder than it was, and I suspect that the new narrative will be that 1 shot of Pfizer or Moderna will be good enough (its not been tested) in order for Biden to tout his ""shots in the arm"" statements."

Right away, I suspected that the vaccine causes blood clots: (1) the fatal blood clot occurred in an otherwise healthy young person, i.e., very low probability of occurring spontaneously; (2) the first clotting event occurred within the first few hundred doses, suggesting that abnormal blood clots are a reasonably common side effect; (3) blood clots are an extremely common complication of the immune response to COVID-19.  The trial coordinators/workers doing the consent totally downplayed the fatal event in the early participant and tried to persuade me to sign up, but I could tell that they either didn't have the knowledge to connect the dots or were lying about the risks.

2021-04-13 14:27,"""Abundance of caution"" is the bone-headed way to think about this. There is an opportunity cost - I haven't done the math but I guess a delay of few weeks will cause more than six deaths at the US population level. 

The right way to deal was to release some advisory/have a playbook for women between the age group and whenever symptoms appear - immediately be rushed to emergency.

2021-04-13 14:39,@bm1877 makes the excellent point (with calculations I haven’t checked) that risk is always relative and must be placed in context - as do many others in these comments. The NYTimes would be doing a public service by providing the relative risk in context as determined by professionals regarding this potential adverse effect. The vaccine-hesitant will read this as written and potentially be frightened off completely. We take risks higher than these numbers indicate for the J&J vaccine everyday.
2021-04-13 15:00,"I did medical screening at a County vaccination site yesterday that was solely Johnson & Johnson. A large percentage came because it was a single dose. I’d say one in three chose to get this vaccine due to a fear of needles, that one shot would be better to handle than two. Others expressed concerns about the safety of the the Johnson & Johnson but decided to go ahead anyway. Several people were so fearful of the injection they needed medical attention. I cannot imagine how those people feel this morning after overcoming their fear and getting the vaccination. And now those scheduled will get a Pfizer or Moderna two dose, if they so choose.

There are a lot of comments saying 7 adverse reactions are not that many, all things considered.  Well, all 7 are women under 60, one woman died, and another woman is in critical condition.  If you were one of these women or members of their families, it would matter to you.

The human body and science is complex.  They don't fit into neat little narratives or soundbytes.  Am I still getting vaccinated?  Yes.  I'm getting the Pfizer vaccine.  But as a woman in my 30s, if I had received the J&J vaccine in the last 14 days, I would be concerned by a report like this, and rightfully so."
2021-04-13 15:10,"I understand that we were obviously working with limited time in this instance what with the ongoing pandemic, but I hope going forward the experience of this pandemic informs more thorough investigation of vaccine and other medical dosing. 

Women are typically smaller than men, and as we’ve heard over and over now with immunology/epidemiology front and center of the national conversation, we tend to have stronger immune responses than men. A one-size-fits-all standard for dosing is likely to be overkill for us. 

I know anecdotally, everyone I know who experienced moderate to severe side effects from Covid vaccination is female, including myself. 

I don’t regret taking a vaccine at all, but when the potential side effects lead to effective interventions like J&J getting pulled for safety concerns, there’s a clear cost to everyone, male and female, from just setting a single dosing standard without questioning it. And there’s a long history of such blind spots in medicine."
2021-04-13 15:13,"Penicillin kills roughly 500 people per year in the USA. No medicine (including vaccines) or surgery is without risks. We knew that going in. 

It is a good sign that the risk is being seriously evaluated early. Also whether the production mechanisms of the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines have a common mechanism risk and mechanism for the problem.

The world is attempting to protect billions of people worldwide during a deadly pandemic. At this juncture far more lives will be saved if a safe way can be found to deal with and treat the observed problems (such as not using these two vaccines for women under 60?). 

Like many others I am hopeful that once physicians (and others) can recognize this rare syndrome quickly, it can be treated more effectively--in addition to using other vaccines for higher risk groups."
2021-04-13 15:39,"If I understand the article, around 1 in a 1,000 Americans develop blood clots each year.  For recipients of the J&J vaccine, 1 in 1,000,000 develop a rare type of clot.  Seems like an excess of caution.  I would rather take my chances with the J&J vaccine than with covid-19 which has killed 500,000 Americans.

It’s great to raise the alarm, but it’s even better to provide a solution—or a suggestion, if that can’t be managed. The article leaves me to believe I should just sit around with my fingers crossed? Surely there could have been a sentence about possible ways to proceed—even a simple: “you might wish to call your doctor because the CDC hasn’t yet advised of pertinent options” would do.

There is clear causality between the pathogenic antibody & the thrombotic complications, & we have found this antibody in many people who have developed these complications after the AstraZeneca vaccine."" J&J has the same problem with a ""rogue antibody"" against platelet factor 4 (PF4) which is the cause of both clots AND bleeding. Heparin can't be used here because of the two juxtaposed findings. These vaccines for COVID are experimental. That's why we do 2 years worth of clinical trials on them. That is why wiser people have vaccine hesitancy. Ones who take the risk because of better odds for benefit, still risk morbidities and deaths like those from the creation of the unforeseen PF4 antibodies, but the odds are good. mRNA vaccines are showing to be safer choices. But the Pfizer vax has problems with allergic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, & yes there have been some deaths from this. The incidence with these vaccines usually would be one in a million, but the allergic/anaphylaxis included reactions are occurring in 1-2.5 cases per 100,000 patients depending on who you read. If you are not hyperallergic, this is probably the most practical vaccine choice. Moderna vax associated with 'COVID Arm' where painful red swelling/inflammation springs up on average 8 days after vaccination."

Is this going to be like AstraZeneca's vaccine and the studies will find that it wasn't associated with an increased risk of blood clots.
And treatment with Warfarin ""may"" be dangerous?  
Do some research.  Is it or isn't it?"
2021-04-13 15:13,"34 million doses administered, 222 experienced blood clots. Nearly 9000 dying daily due to covid. People getting COVID after having the vaccine is around .01, compared to the .0006529%."
2021-04-13 16:09,Blood clots are a rare side effect of birth control use. May be a coincidence or a rare correlation with vaccine.
2021-04-13 15:10,"If the clots are only in women are or almost always going to be in women, doesn’t it still make sense to still vaccinate men just because we need to bring the virus under control?

2021-04-13 16:17,"This isn't good news, and particularly concerning that all reactions were among women who should be in the primes of their lives, but six adverse reactions out of over 7 million shots?  How many people would have been hospitalized or died with COVID in the same time frame, if not for the J&J immunizations?

My wife and I both got some of the first J&J vaccines distributed in our state, back at the first of March.  It's been tremendously liberating, living as we do in a Congressional district that went for Trump in both 2016 and 2020 - occupied by a significant number of anti-maskers ...... I think I'd be quite willing to get the J&J vaccine even now, with this potential side effect out there."
2021-04-13 16:48,"As I recall various articles on the J&J vaccine, during the trials 4 people in the  J&J control groups experienced blood clots and no one in the group that got the vaccine did - and there were nowhere near 7 million people in the trails. So, 4 blood clots in the control group would seem to indicate that a population at large of 7 million people would likely have more than than 6-7 individuals who develop blood clots, with  or without the J&J Vaccine. Not to mention the number of people who will die from the virus because of delayed J&J vaccinations."
2021-04-13 16:54,"This latest news should serve as a reminder to us all that there are risks associated with almost anything--and therefore, it is one's personal choice whether to be vaccinated or not.  Many people who feel ""vaccine hesitancy"" have valid reasons for it.  Not everyone is a ""conspiracy-theorist""--many of us simply prefer to make up our own minds with the best information available.  And we aren't too thrilled with ""Have you gotten the vaccine?!"" being the new opening line many greet each other with nowadays.  It's a private matter.  As a woman trying to conceive, I think it best to avoid the vaccine for now.  I'll continue washing my hands repeatedly and wearing my mask and doing my part to keep others safe.  But I choose to wait this one out.  Meanwhile, I'm wondering where the ""My body, my choice"" supporters are on the issue. . ."

There are ways to mitigate risk in almost any behavior, but you can never reduce that to zero. The unfortunate part of this is we all take inherent risk everyday, yet are prone to irrational responses when any risk is presented. The best you can do is take a look at the data and see if the risk is worse than the other outcomes for the alternatives, but even that will not sway a fairly large part of the population."

2021-04-13 15:23,"A general issue with any medication, including vaccines is that smaller people need smaller doses in order not to be over medicated and suffer unnecessary symptoms.  Children routinely receive vaccines and medications with lower doses for their lower body weight.  Why don’t we do this for women?  Some women are almost half the weight of the average man.

We routinely treat women differently from men, we police what they wear, what sports aren’t acceptable, and make them the gatekeepers of morality.  So why aren’t women being treated differently in this instance?"

In people at high risk such as women at the age of abou 40 taking oral contraceptives, the risk of developing CVST is even higher: 30 per million people per year-And that’s likely about the incidence we’re seeing here. Therefore, in such large populations, please don’t forget statistics, please don’t forget coincidence-You might save the worldwide vaccination efforts from being thrown under the bus..."

6 cases out of more than. 100,000.000.  Caught. Stopped. And will only be restarted when Dr Marks at FDA says these were unrelated to vaccine.

The FDA and CDC under current leadership stand as sentinels to protect us and we are seeing it in real time 

This should give us all more, not less confidence"
2021-04-13 17:31,I wonder what other things these cases might have in common. Same blood type perhaps? Previously undetected underlying conditions?
2021-04-13 15:16,"Are any of these women currently taking birth control? Prior research has shown that hormonal contraceptives (particularly ones that use estrogen) carry an increased risk of blood clots. This might explain the age group and the fact that so far, only women have developed this rare condition."
2021-04-13 17:45,"As a young woman who wants to get vaccinated and has a family history of blood clotting issues, I am very interested in knowing more about these cases. Obviously the privacy of these women needs to be respected, but there are so many factors that could be at work here, such as a predisposition to developing blood clots and having the genetic markers for it. After the AstraZeneca issues in Europe, I worry people will avoid vaccines altogether if this isn't cleared up soon. I'm hardly the only person who makes health decisions based on their family history, and I don't mind opting for another vaccine if there is a risk here, the same way my doctor doesn't recommend hormonal birth control to me. That doesn't mean avoiding birth control or vaccination completely, it means reviewing the options and making the best choice from what is available. If these women have any history of clotting and as a result people who are more likely to develop clots should opt for a different vaccine on the market, that should be made very clear. From what we know so far the vast majority is unaffected and unlikely to develop these issues. I don't get scared by hormonal birth control commercials whenever they talk about potential clotting. I accept it's not the right option for me but it is for others and move on. I'll probably do the same with the J&J vaccine since I fit the criteria. But if that doesn't apply to you that shouldn't stop you from protecting yourself & helping us end this nightmare"
2021-04-13 15:26,"What many readers are not getting here is that the concern is not so much because of the rare occurrence of blood clots, but the appearance of autoantibodies that might have been induced by the vaccine.  This could mean the vaccine has caused a breakdown in immune tolerance, which can lead to other autoantibodies that might lead to other medical conditions.  These conditions might not appear immediately but could take months or years to develop.  These vaccines are potent immunogens that induces an antibody response several orders of magnitude higher than a COVID infection.  Any associated autoimmunity could likewise be amplified by the vaccines.  Many autoimmune diseases have been linked to infections, such as type I diabetes, TTP (such as this case), Grave's Disease, encephalitis lethargica (following the Spanish Flu epidemic, but might not be causative) etc.  This will be devastating if we only see the increase in incidence after hundreds of millions have been vaccinated.  Therefore, they must urgently investigate the mechanism that leads to the production of these anti-heparin antibodies."
2021-04-13 17:59,"The lesser risk, by far, is to get a COVID vaccine as soon as possible – any vaccine.
COVID has already killed almost 600,000 Americans, and left millions more with long-lasting injuries.
If enough people get vaccinated, the pandemic will end.  
If people do not get vaccinated, new viral variants will evolve, and the pandemic will continue, year after year, forever.
This should not be a difficult decision."
2021-04-13 19:18,"I read a story today about a previously healthy man who had a double-lung transplant two months ago as a result of his lung function being ruined by Covid - there are currently three more people being assessed for the same surgery for the same reason at the same transplant centre.  While this particular physical outcome for Covid is obviously rare, it is however, real, and represents one of many possible serious and completely unpredictable risks associated with contracting the virus.  I will gratefully take my chances with the vaccine at this point, thank you very much:

What on earth is going on apart from lots of money being made by the rumormongers?"
2021-04-13 18:08,It seems the majority of these rare blood clots are affecting women. Has it been considered that most of these women are in an age group that have a menstrual cycle. I have heard that platelet levels vary at different times in a menstrual  cycle - does this make a difference when the vaccine is administered?
2021-04-13 18:11,"Too bad there is a pause on J&J vaccine based on RARE CLOTS which could well have been a coincidence of preexisting underlying conditions. As a Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, I remember teaching medical students with passion, the rare (1 in 100,000) but serious complications of one of the most successful smallpox eradication program primarily due to the vaccine that was painlessly administered on a mass scale in the past. One young US army recruit actually died of generalized vaccina, the live virus administered as a vaccine. An autopsy of that army recruit showed that the person was HIV positive and had acquired immunodeficiency and hence unable to mount a protective response against an attenuated live vaccina delivered as a vaccine at a time when vaccination against vaccinia was stopped and small pox was declared eradicated.

So what is the lesson from the complications of mass immunization against small pox for COVID. First and foremost, stop the cookie cutter thinking that because a vaccine has been approved for emergency use by the FDA that it will be good for all adults and for all humans no matter what their health condition is. Follow the history of those experiencing rare blood clots or other serious discomfort and exclude such categories of people with certain underlying conditions. It is becoming increasingly clear that the response elicited by vaccine is variable and those with autoimmune elevation of immune components like complement could be at risk."

2021-04-13 12:50,"Let’s be clear. They aren’t pausing just because of clots. They are pausing because a number of people have also died from said clots or other complications that may be linked to the vaccine. I have a family member who received the J&J vaccine in early March and then died one month later with complete organ failure. While his death wasn’t directly attributed to the vaccine, he had, according to his doctor, only suffered from high blood pressure for years (mainly due to being overweight) and was in reasonable health beyond that. 

Needless to say, the family is very suspicious about the cause of his death given how quickly things deteriorated right after receiving the shot. 

There are a substantial amount of adverse effects not being widely reported about all the vaccines which you’d only see via the VAERS database. It’s unwieldy and most events aren’t even reported but it’s the best source we have.

Meanwhile, all over the world, including in hospitals in Houston and Florida, Covid patients are being successfully treated and released via the use of Ivermectin. This drug has been around for decades and its side effects are well known and understood. 

It’s baffling why this info isn’t also being widely reported since lives are being saved by doctors using Ivermectin as a Covid treatment and it works across ALL the variants so far.

Hopefully, the clots and deaths aren’t the tip of the iceberg for other long-term adverse effects from these still-relatively-unproven vaccines."

What's more though, nearly all reported cases of these blood clots occur in women of a certain range. If they feel that this caution is necessary, why not limit J&J doses to men, or to people outside this age range? This could open up more Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for others, and keep the vaccination rate going. It seems to me that it would be a waste of vaccines to pull them altogether, when the data pretty clearly points to one affected population.

I just got my first shot of Moderna today and it feels like one more step towards normal. On my mind also are the hundreds of thousands who did not make it and we should still take precautions as much as we can. It’s not perfect, of course, but we have to balance trooping the economy vs public health. Unfortunately Europe is stuck in reverse right now, I feel like here we are still going forward. Peace."

Fortunately, a few weeks ago, our son was able to purchase NIOSH approved N-95 masks online, available from China. He says the N-95 is his favorite mask.  He finds it remarkably comfortable and feels safer at work. Even better, on March 31, Washington State added restaurant workers to the list of those eligible for the vaccine. His restaurant jumped on it, offered him an appointment, and our son has already received his first vaccine!  Such a relief!

A longtime employee who was among the 9 infected has since died.

That server could then go on to infect hundreds of different people each day. Not only that, they can infect their co-workers, whom they spend hours with every day in a closed building. A disease vector, like rats or mosquitos.

Servers, grocery store workers, anyone who daily interfaces with hundreds of customers and cannot be shielded with a plexiglass plate, need to be near if not at the top of the immunization list, far above anyone who can, say, work from home and hang out with a small group of friends and family. 

As an emotionless robot-person, rather than asking oneself, ""are these low-rent, minimum wage people expendable?"" one needs to ask, ""are their customers expendable?""

The governor stated that restaurant workers would be prioritized when he opened up the vaccine requirements last week, then failed to provide a way for restaurant workers to be prioritized.    It sure sounded good in the news though."
2021-04-07 22:22,All front line workers and customer facing employees should be vaccinated ASAP.
2021-04-07 22:32,Why is this news? NYC has given restaurant workers priority vaccinations since February. Hopefully they have all gotten fully vaccinated weeks ago.
2021-04-07 22:51,"My 28 year old son, a waiter, received the J & J vaccine 2 weeks ago in California. How? He is fortunate to be in the union, and they set up appointments for all of their members."

2021-04-08 13:47,"""A recent report by the C.D.C. found that after mask and other restrictions were lifted, on-premise restaurants led to daily increase in cases and death rates between 40 and 100 days later.""  Yet the article focuses on providing vaccinations for workers rather than the stupidity of rushing to allow dining in restaurants and drinking in bars.  Completely unnecessary activity that increases everyone's risk - great idea, and emblematic of how we ended up with 500,000+ deaths.  Rather than prioritizing workers, the restaurant industry should have been realigned to focus on safe, efficient takeout operations with curbside pickup.

Allowing the government to pick winners and losers in a ""vaccine lottery"" was a mistake from the start.  It added to the chaos and uncertainty created by the failed former president's failure to set up federal mass vaccination centers.  The idiosyncratic state processes, priority groups, etc., have been a nightmare.  We should have had FEMA-run walk-in sites in every state from day 1."
2021-04-08 13:53,"Once again, the public are the goats, victims of a completely incompetent vaccination non-rollout, with the responsible elected officials now scurrying for damage control by opening things up while not having produced the vaccine supply needed, then blaming the public for the increase in infections.

Thanks for nothing Fauci and Dr Malarky."

Why would immigrants be different from anybody else, unless they were ILLEGAL immigrants? In which case they should go home or be deported. 

I've tried to get info locally about cases caught in restaurants, and am being stone-walled by the people who know."

I'm finished with the two doses of the Pfizer vaccine but I know many others who are waiting. Talk is cheap; action isn't. NYC seems to be trying hard to make things better but here in NJ the situation is not so good. There are too many people still waiting. I know supplies are still tight but the politicians should keep quiet until supplies are abundant enough to meet demand. Promises do not protect; only vaccines do.
2021-04-07 10:59,"In Massachusetts, residents have to rely on a third-party Twitter account to inform them of openings as they occur and then it depends on how quickly they can click on a link and fill in their information, usually needing to do so in 10 seconds or less in order to secure a vaccine somewhere within 100 miles of their location. It’s less like a well-organized rollout and more like the Hunger Games. And if you don’t have internet access? You’ll have better luck securing a vaccine by starting your own pharmaceutical company from your garage."
2021-04-07 11:03,"Making the vaccine available to all is a very clever PR stunt by Biden.  Great progress has been made and continues to be made.  However, the distribution capability is still not in place to make a difference.  States like Connecticut have the highest vaccination rate because they had a very simple approach: age based availability and advertising to encourage their constituents to get vaccinated.  States like PA are still the lowest vaccinated because they tried to micro manage distribution. 

The US is averaging over 3 million vaccinations a day.  Adding more people to the queue will not increase the number of people vaccinated.  But it is a great PR stunt."
2021-04-07 10:22,"Thank you Pfizer Moderna JJ and every American that voted the human pathogen out of office.

2021-04-07 11:29,"If the writer does some unbiased research on this story she will see a clip from last year where President Trump predicted all citizens will be able to be vaccinated by April 2021. I’m also sorry that so many citizens are having difficulty in getting vax

2021-04-07 11:58,"There’s a lot of embittered complaining here, but better to focus on the positive, that a deadly pandemic could soon be defeated as more and more Americans get the vaccine.  Of course the vaccine rollout has major bumps in the road, but that’s not unusual in emergency situations such as a worldwide pandemic.  

Kindly consider looking on the bright side, since we now have the vaccines and the end is in sight, so long as we sit tight and act responsibly for the common good, for just a few more months."

I hope whenever if  they end up in the hospital they will think hard about following the rules and being a patriot .  Get the vaccine .  Our Pope Francis said it is a moral obligation to get the vaccines so since you follow your angry leader no heaven for you.  I am glad i am not in your religion.

2021-04-07 12:51,"After building everything from ""scratch"", Biden has now reached the timetable put in place by Trump and his people for vaccine eligibility. Even if he doesn't move up,  states have already moved far ahead of Biden.  Biden probably made it slow by his plan for 100M shots in 100 days. Almost ninety percent of the Biden plan is the one put in place by Trump. Republican governors are opening schools and businesses in their states increasing employment, but Biden is taking credit for it. He has already messed up the border, made many people unemployed by cancelling Keystone XL pipeline, and sowed the seed for American decline by wasting so many trillions of dollars which we don't have for his pet programs and social engineering in the name of coronavirus and infrastructure. He is digging big holes domestically and internationally from which it will be difficult for us to get out."
2021-04-07 12:19,"While it's very good news that more people will be eligible for vaccine, getting an appointment for a vaccine is still difficult here in NY.

I haven't heard anything from the Biden administration on therapeutics to treat Covid or any updated guidance on what to do should you test positive for Covid.  What's happening in the way of developing therapeutics like Molnupiravir or other new drug treatments for Covid?  I've read that Moderna and Pfizer vaccines last six months - does that mean that additional vaccine shots after six months?"
2021-04-07 12:22,"President cannot set vaccination eligibility goals and deadlines. States set goals and deadlines. Biden set goals and deadlines slightly behind  those set by states so he can claim credit when states meet their deadlines. In Texas, everyone age 16 and older became  eligible in March."
2021-04-07 12:16,Biden/Harris are complete out of touch  disasters and perfect examples of the democratic elite political leaders. I doubt either one has any clue or even cares to know what is happening on the ground. That wall they have built around the capitol is a great metaphor for how they operate.
2021-04-07 13:17,"It's evident there's more than one person in charge. Between 50 or 51 at least. In an unrelated instance the Governor of Texas, or was it the Lieutenant Governor, said Harris County was not separate State.
 
Kind of like the relationship  NYS and NYC have. Who's in charge? A distant capitol may or may not be out of touch or a local government which may or may not be out of touch? Or the Federal Government? Does it matter?

I always thought the virus was in charge. Read the dire warnings about a forth wave,  Germany considering another shut down and Fuachi saying there won't be a fourth wave. While the manufactures and distributors of the vaccine break all records.

Is the time table being changed because there is a surplus of vaccines caused by a portion of the population who won't take it? Hard to give credit for that.

Still blaming Trump? He appealed to people who weren't as risk adverse as some here. He was wrong but all the rest of the thousands involved seemed to be doing something right. Even with an occasional disagreement now and then.

Remember: You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink."

It it is still necessary to hold on to the masks and really good personal hygiene, because of the variants and our children who are under the age of 16. But it will give the people  the freedom to get together again. Millions of singles live alone in an apartment and often work since over a year from home,  I  think those have and need the right to meet their friends and family after this long time. Its for their mental health. I know now more then three people in the USA and in Europe who commited suicide because of the lock downs and for months working from home with no contacts to others. Humans are social beings we need each other to survive."

2021-04-07 11:10,"Being eligible does not equate to being able to get a vaccine. 
The appointment system (in CT, at least) is one that relies on the individual to continually log onto numerous websites (CVS, Walgreens, local hospital, etc) for the chance of getting an appointment.  Just log onto cvs.com and you’ll see “Fully Booked” for the entire state.  At what point does one stop wasting time and just give up?   Why isn’t there a waitlist at these sites where one could enter their contact info and then just wait for a call that an appointment is made?"
2021-04-07 11:42,"I agree with the comments made so far regarding the lack of supply.  Making me eligible for the vaccine does not put the vaccine in my arm. Mr. President.  We need you to step up in a massive way and get the vaccine supplied to the country!!!

2021-04-07 10:13,"This is a public health issue. To protect their patrons, owners/operators of restaurants, retail stores, ballparks, churches should be able to quickly assess if someone is vaccinated or not. People who are not vaccinated should be excluded until such time as they are vaccinated.

The benefits are two-fold: (1) it gives a high level of assurance to patrons of a place that they are safe from the virus and (2) it communicates to the vaccine reluctant that, if they want to participate in society they need to get with the program.

2021-04-07 10:33,"Sadly, you know it's a great idea when Republicans and conservatives, for whatever reasons are against it.
We're at a point in this pandemic where it's incumbent on all Americans to be vaccinated; or at least follow the rules of the CDC by wearing a mask, washing one's hands and practice social distancing.
And too many can't even do that -- which exactly what makes a 'vaccine passport' even more necessary."
2021-04-07 10:14,"Business and corporate entities will have to really put pressure on the conservative members and politicians to force their hands.

2021-04-07 10:24,"So, there are 5 restaurants downtown. One has an employee at the door scanning digital vaccine passports on smartphones, the others do not.

Which venue are you, who for over a year sacrificed, quarantined, and finally stepped forward to get vaccinated going to patronize?

As the other four establishments look on at the lines out the door, watching their best servers bolt for the better opportunity and contemplate their stagnant revenues, do you think they may follow suit?"
2021-04-07 10:47,"The Biden Administration will campaign in the midterm election on their competence in handling the pandemic, but they are at risk of fumbling this last step.  Getting everyone vaccinated is the key to opening the economy, but simply relying on one's word is a recipe for disaster.  

What happens next year when the vaccine is approved by the ACIP for children and it becomes a mandatory vaccine for school entry?  COVID is much more serious than chicken pox.  Will we simply say it's ok to ignore protecting our children?  Setting the right expectation now is essential."

2021-04-07 10:47,"I read a recent NYT article about the majority of white evangelical Christians declaring they have no plans to get vaccinated. This same group, part of the same political party, were loudly against masks, coronavirus restrictions, and businesses having to close to stop the spread a year ago. Here we are with a chance to be able to open back up and return to some semblance of normalcy and they've found another reason to complain. You can't have it both ways.

Furthermore, I'm confused by the argument against vaccine passports due to a centralized database containing people's information. Your name and date of birth are listed on a vaccine card. This same information is already associated with your driver's license and social security number, both of which many people have, and are also part of centralized databases. The only extra information a vaccine card has is the vaccine lot number and site where it was administered and I'm failing to see how this all constitutes an invasion of privacy."
2021-04-07 10:49,"What has always been the danger surrounding vaccination status is the lack of informational data.  Agencies report number of deaths but they report nothing else.  There is a high correlation between the BMI (body mass index) of a person and an adverse outcome.  Same with age and underlying conditions.  For each death related to COVID corresponding data such as age, weight, height and any previous underlying conditions should also be reported. This would lead to informed decision making.  Let the vulnerable get their vaccinations.  A healthy person who has a normal body weight, exercises and no underlying conditions should not be forced to get a vaccine and should not have their freedoms taken away.  The mantra from our government and public health agencies that every one must be vaccinated borders on hysteria and reminds me of the movie, Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Also the idea that variants are stopped by vaccination is a false proposition.  All one has to do is study the animal world to see how vaccinations have failed to control corona viruses and variants in the animals we eat."
2021-04-07 10:52,"Used to be when you travelled out side the country, along with a passport you had a document on stiff yellow paper that was an immunization record.  It was as essential as a passport for admission to a foreign country.  I always kept mine inside my passport.  As far as I remember it stopped being used after smallpox was completely eradicated.  I don’t remember any fights about its being required ."
2021-04-07 10:52,"When you are vaccinated you are provided a standard CDC card with the data about the inoculation. That would seem to be a non digital passport as well. I wonder who would care if you provide one or the other. For airlines or other forms of transport they could just accept a scan in your profile or include the Lot data, manufacturer etc. Lets not make this too hard. We do this for many items such as credit cards, travel passports etc."
2021-04-07 10:52,I feel this is a good idea. It will encourage people to get vaccinated. It will also contribute to ending the pandemic and attaining herd immunity. How long do people want this to go on?

2021-04-07 10:44,"Vaccine passports, which are new only in that they involve coronavirus immunization, are of course opposed by the far right.  The passports exert pressure on people to get vaccinated, and the far right does not want a liberal Democrat's vaccination program to succeed.  For them, the best thing politically is an out of control spread of the virus.  

Governor Abbott of Texas is well aware of the risk of opening his state before infection rates are under control.  He did that in the summer of 2020, and his action led to a surge that killed thousands.  Yet he's doing it even more aggressively now, while vaccination rates in Texas are among the lowest in the country.

Let's not be naive.  The Republicans' political gambit is to try to make the pandemic worse.  We know from Trump's interviews with Bob Woodward in early 2020 that they put politics above the safety and health of the public.  

Republicans may not be infected with covid-19, but they sure are sick."
2021-04-07 11:07,"Why isn't there a pushback from the ordinary citizens of the world who actually WANT a vaccine cert?

I'll get one as soon as they're available.

I have signed several on-line petitions over here demanding the UK government implement vaccine passports as quickly as possible. Obviously, that will have little practical effect - I'm just surprised that the voices of the 'pro-cert' faction are simply not being heard."
2021-04-07 11:08,"There a lot of folks out there who like me choose not to carry a smart phone. I would hate to see a passport system that requires the use of a smart phone. I am happy to see that New York's system provides for a printable version of the digital certificate.
I am also concerned about the proliferation of different systems. Will venues have to cater to all of these formats or will folks need to have multiple versions to be able to enter everywhere, particularly when traveling?
It seems to me that by the time all of the implementation bugs are worked out the emergency may be over, or will we have to go through the rest of our lives proving our COVID status?"
2021-04-07 11:07,"Walk me through this logic: it’s perfectly acceptable to make sure people provide identification that lets you know their personal health / vaccine history, but it’s not acceptable to have people produce evidence of existence to cast a vote for people who make decisions for the entire country.

I’ve got another: if the vaccines are effective, and they seem to be, what stops you from being free to do what you want if you worry about yourself and get vaccinated? Isn’t this how every vaccine we have works? I don’t rely on the guy next to me on the bus to tell me he got his MMR vaccine when he was 2."
2021-04-07 11:12,"I think it's a great idea. I think a conscientious objector vaccine cards should also be issued. People have a right to just say no to drugs. People who have a been vaccinated and carded already have a right to know who they are associating with. This is a public health draft. The less informed population needs to remember the current virus is just the first battle.

Subsequent variant outbreaks will continue and be put down by new immunization events. New variants are guaranteed, Corona has gone viral, just like its twin, internet hate and conspiracies.

The immunization war is a permanent process in public health. 9 Billion people are on our planets surface and are its combatants.

There will never be herd immunity. Especially in the U.S. where our need for personal freedom outweighs being rational and following the CDC and personally scaling up to the crisis.

We are the beginning of a existential planetary event. In the comfortable U.S. world where we would rather fight than switch the way we think, its somebody else's problem. This is the meteor that hit our planet and we can't even see this in more ways than one.

Not only did we cook the planet, we murdered it without science."

2021-04-07 11:18,"There's no great answer here given the politically fraught nature of the topic.
If you mandate vaccines, people will rebel.
If you allow businesses to require vaccines, then you make them enforcers (remember the mask/no mask fights?)
If you prevent businesses from requiring vaccines, you put at risk those who CANNOT be vaccinated. 

I think the guiding principle of, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"", or ""first do no harm"" might be applicable.

Lets just hold off on casting judgement until we see more of what happens. I don't think there's a benefit to immediately passing legislation as a reactionary measure. When you take action before having evidence, only luck can make you successful."
2021-04-07 11:19,"We are already required to present our vaccination history to attend schools, colleges, work in hospitals, etc. I have been updating and sharing my vaccination record for years.

And the more we make headlines about it, the more polarizing it will become."
2021-04-07 11:24,"Why is it that the people who complain about vaccination passports as a restriction of freedom and a government intrusion are the same people who are happy to interfere with people’s right to vote by demanding all sorts of, ahem, government ID. Many people don’t have a driver’s license. All adults are eligible (or soon will be) for a vaccine."
2021-04-07 11:15,"I want the passport, digital or hard copy. It may help convince more folks to get vaccinated. More vaccines, more protection for all of us. It ain't rocket science. Why is the GOP being so obstructionist? This merits a deep and thorough conversation, not partisan posing. Ask the people -- we want to be safe. It's hard to be ""free"" when you are not safe."
2021-04-07 11:20,"As one lawyer stated, requiring a vaccine passport is just an extension of the 'no shoes, no service' policy. Businesses are free to make conditions based on public health.

If the Repubs get their way, Americans will be the last to be able to travel internationally, for there will surely be a vaccine passport required for international air travel. 

If a person has a disability that prevents vaccination, that's a case that needs to be dealt with fairly, but if people are just refusing to get vaccinated, then they are just public health menaces and don't deserve any consideration. 

A vaccine passport is no more an intrusion into personal privacy than proving to a school that your children are vaccinated or providing the information necessary to register to vote.  This is just more Republican propaganda used to whip up the base. They couldn't care less about the welfare of most of us."
2021-04-07 11:10,"Let’s not pretend this debate is in good faith. This is a manufactured issue whose aim is to make ending the pandemic more difficult at the democrats’ expense. My kids have to have all sorts of vaccinations already just to go summer camp. No problem. I had to prove I’d been vaccinated for various diseases when I went to Botswana. Fine. I wanted to see the elephants. 

This is not a real issue. It’s a bad faith reaction."
2021-04-07 11:05,"Why is the media insisting on covering this from the gop talking points playbook?  Language matters.  The gop knows that, one moment they decry cancel culture the next they demand to cancel things like a covid passport.  Trump was a master at language manipulation and too many people still believe anything he says as a result.

The pandemic has killed more than 570k in the US to date.  Businesses aren’t only struggling under government rules like capacity  to keep us safer but much more under a lack of confidence to go to them.  The majority of Americans will be vaccinated soon but the republicans refusing to be vaccinated will continue to weigh down that confidence.  Vaccination passports can be used to increase that confidence but the media covering it as if it’s a controversy will help the gop stop this logical action.

If we could get issues discussed without trying to stir controversy for clicks and shares maybe we could have progress."
2021-04-07 11:28,"I needed an official vaccine record to be accepted into graduate school. I needed an official passport to verify who I am while traveling abroad. I needed an official driver’s license with my personal information in order to drive a car. 

It would be unAmerican not to have a Covid vaccine record in the form of an official passport. There’s much precedent for such a passport and it’s the right thing to do to protect one another and remain safe."
2021-04-07 11:33,"We have many requirements for access in this country.  A drivers license is required to drive a car, age requirements to enter a bar or purchase guns or liquor, a photo ID to board a plane.  I could go on.

2021-04-07 11:36,"I agree with many of the other commenters that some form of proof of vaccination status and status-based admission policies will enable a safe return to public gatherings. The implications of a *digital* vaccine passport are what I ultimately have issue with. The author of this article, and many commenters, imply that privacy concerns are only coming from tinfoil hatters and anti-vaxxers, but I am neither of those, yet have real reservations about trusting my health data with one or fifteen different private companies contracted by my gym or a local government in a rush to score reopening brownie points. We have seen personal data used, misused, sold, scraped, and used for invasive advertising and surveillance practices by tech companies, and since the incentives to collect GPS and purchase data for newly mobile vaccinated consumers would be huge, why would these apps be any exception?

The other issue is equitable access. The pandemic has already devastated brown and Black communities, essential workers, and low income households. Restricting access to public life with a smartphone app is effectively providing a $300 barrier to that freedom, and will let the young, well-off, and tech savvy to the front of the line for the privilege of reopening, where they have remained for every stage of the pandemic.

Forget the apps and just let people show their laminated CDC cards! Even better, equip health departments to issue a neat little wallet sized card! It’ll be fine!"
2021-04-07 11:42,"Why are we talking about vaccine passports instead of immunity passports?  In other nations, people who have had the illness can also get certified.  The illness hit our poorest and most vulnerable severely, and many of them may choose not to get vaccinated since they are already immune.  I am all for safety, but over 30 million people had the disease itself, and we need to be sure to include that group in whatever certifying process we use."
2021-04-07 11:42,"Haves and have nots? My vaccine was paid for by the US government and I deeply appreciate it. As far as I can tell, there’s a good faith effort to make sure anyone who wants it can get it. 

Anyone want to go back to the time of rampant smallpox or polio? I think it could easily be argued that it’s a national security issue for the country to get past this, so I am happy to see public venues and institutions use this certification."
2021-04-07 11:44,"The problem isn’t the need to show one’s vaccination status; that’s something we do all the time, when sending kids to camp and school, and traveling internationally.  

The problem, as always with tech, is privacy.  App makers aren’t known for their benevolence but rather for mining user’s phones for location, contact and other info unnecessary to the operation of the app ( in other words, for data mining, so the app developers can monetize user’s personal information).

So long as a paper receipt showing vaccinated status is considered as good as digital proof, ok.  Let people unconcerned about privacy use an app while the rest of us go the old school route with paper."

For example, stripping rights away from transgender people, telling women what they can do with their bodies. I won't list any more; we all know what they are."
2021-04-07 11:06,"Let us make sure we don't force old folks like me to have to invest in a ""Smart"" phone that we don't  want. There must be a hard copy alternative. Without an alternative poor people will literally be left out."

2021-04-07 11:13,"Privacy rights? Are these the same Republicans who don’t believe in a woman’s right to control her own body? I see.

The reality is that privacy rights are a smoke screen in this case. A huge percentage of Republicans are unwilling to be vaccinated because Fox News, OAN, and other right wing propaganda sources are, once again, lying to scare their viewers. Other right wing citizens just want to show that they can refuse no matter what because “no one is going to tell me what I have to do.” Their selfishness puts the whole country at risk. But, as has been the case since the pandemic began, venal Republican politicians have made this political so they can continue to rile their base.

Not only should proof of vaccination be mandatory for the next year, getting vaccinated itself should be except in very limited circumstances. A terrible pandemic is one instance in which members of society need to give up a tiny bit of their rights so we’re all protected. That’s not politics, it civic responsibility and common sense."

2021-04-07 10:44,"Since early last year, I've been incredibly diligent, taking this virus seriously. I am NOT an anti-vaxxer, anti-masker etc. by ANY means. But...
I do not want to have my vaccine status or any health information on my phone in an ""app"" or program. I am one of those people who does not upload my life to the cloud. I don't do things like track my fitness on apps. I think this is dystopian. Why not have some other way of verifying, like with other vaccines, with actual documents *gasp*? There must be other ways. There's nothing convenient about having to flash my health status on my phone everywhere I go. Super creepy and a huge invasion of privacy. That doesn't say ""freedom"" to me."
2021-04-07 11:07,"Funny how the same republicans who are against vaccinations passports are the same ones who are for requiring photo ID to vote... seems it’s really just about giving unchecked freedom and privacy to their anti-science, non-vaccinated constituents and no one else."
2021-04-07 11:10,"What the anti vaccination crowd does not have in huge amounts is time because at some point the time will come when they contract the virus or someone they love may get very sick or possibly die. 

I liken this dilemma to the motorcycle helmet laws that some states have and others don’t. The helmet law is on the books to save lives, but in other states you can take the risk and go without one, but pray you don’t have to put your bike down and risk sliding into a concrete lane divider because that’s what kills many motorcyclists who choose to not wear a helmet."
2021-04-07 11:18,"How do you tell the difference between legitimate expressions of ethical boundaries (no matter how selfish), and simple, opportunistic political posturing?
I'll tell you how.
After howling about freedom and privacy infringements, I would wager that a huge percentage of these people hop onto their social media accounts, having never so much as glanced at their privacy settings, which are of course set at default - eg: WIDE OPEN.
Nothing like selective ethical outrage."

2021-04-07 11:21,"It’s ironic that it’s republicans who are against this idea. It is simply the free market working efficiently. Private businesses should be able to place requirements on their patrons be it a dress code, basic hygiene or as in this case meeting reasonable public safety requirements. If you don’t want to get vaccinated, then your access privileges will be more limited. Republicans support the idea that a business can refuse to make a wedding cake for a same sex couple but not that it can require proof of vaccination? That’s a nonsensical double standard. Of course many democrats would have an equally nonsensical inverse to that example.

As long as the government doesn’t force people to do it, then it’s a great idea."
2021-04-07 10:50,"Shame on me for being astounded that yet again the GOP opposes anything rational and science based in the interest of public health.

2021-04-07 10:41,"A big difference between an actually deadly disease like smallpox (30% death rate per WHO) and a flu, like COVID (under 1%).

There are way more of them than there are of us and we need to deploy every method available if we are to win that war. Our little notions of “privacy” are as nothing in that war and it is past time for every one of us to recognize that we live in a society - or community - and that doing so imposes mutual obligations to protect the common welfare

While it may be a choice to be vaccinated or not, it is clearly reasonable that those who chose not to do so be excludable from the company of those who do. A reliable ‘proof of vaccination’ will be essential for this exclusion process - - but the little, hand-written paper ‘card’ issued with the CDC’s initials on it is so easily counterfeited that it is totally unreliable for the purpose."

2021-04-07 10:40,"No doubt the irony of the “make the vaccination passport obligatory” drumbeat is not lost on my fellow anti-MAGA sympathizers: 

For months and years we railed against and gnashed our teeth about the Trump-led slide into authoritarianism in the US, only to find some of us loudly proclaiming the necessity to take just such actions now.  

Our excuse: “This time it’s different,” (said the pot to the kettle).

Sound familiar? Merch available soon!"
2021-04-07 10:46,"Oh, the irony here is rich. Or is it?

Those on the left demanding proof of vaccination yet not demanding proof of identification to vote. Those on the right insisting on the freedom not to show proof of vaccination yet insisting voters show proof of identification. 

My take - if you aren’t vaccinated yet have proper PPE, you should be afforded the same rights as everyone else. As to voter identification requirements here in the US, that is up to each state to determine as so laid out in the Constitution."
2021-04-07 11:20,It's fascinating that the GOP is worrying about a privacy intrusion with the notion of a vaccine passport when they couldn't care less about the privacy intrusion of their anti abortion stance. A woman's right to choose is a private decision. How do these things square?
2021-04-07 11:25,"I don't understand this messaging. If someone is vaccinated, why do they care if people around them are? The vaccines are ridiculously effective.

Since testing and tracing are the next step in containing deadly and vaccine-evading variants of COVID19, a vaccine passport app should be married with the SlowCovidXX app developed by Apple and Google.  This will be the only way to kill the worst variants which are certain to appear somewhere on this earth before the pandemic is completely eradicated (or nearly)."

Can a passport QR code from vaccine center in Finland or Belize, be as acceptable as one from Walgreens, Philadelphia?
Maybe think through the logistics of this?"

2021-04-07 11:46,I was required to have various vaccinations for both college (mostly distance learning) and then for graduate school. My doctor and I both rolled our eyes and went ahead with it. What is all this fuss about? One more access requirement -- get over it.
2021-04-07 11:47,"It's telling that Governor Abbott took this on almost to the day that he allowed the Texas Rangers to pack 40,000 people into a ballpark for their home opener. Had there been an app showing fans' vaccine status (or at least a negative Covid test), it probably would have excluded a number of infected people from entering the ballpark that day.

I suspect that in a year from now, we'll be at the point where there will be whole states (primarily in the south) that are to be avoided because they never got the virus under control, and remain high-risk zones."
2021-04-07 11:48,"So make it optional to get a passport or not and let business owners— including airlines and restaurant owners— decide for themselves if they want to require customers to show passports  of if they prefer to take the chance.

2021-04-07 11:49,"There is a big difference between the government keeping tabs on or requiring vaccine compliance in order to receive Social Security, for instance, versus private companies requiring employees to be vaccinated.  I worked in hospitals, some prestigious, before retiring.  We were often required to get vaccinated in order to work. There was a whooping cough outbreak and we all lined up for the  vaccine.  Tests are required regularly for TB in hospital workers. If positive, you must be treated or stop working. I had to have inoculation against 3-day measles before I could work in the Neonatal ICU.   Vaccination was voluntary, but necessary, if we wanted to keep our jobs.

Public schools require a long list of vaccinations in order for students to attend. If their families are anti-vaxxers, they have the freedom to home school or use private schools without such requirements. If a business wants to require proof of covid19 vaccination in order employ people or to let the public use their facilities, that is their right.
 People, get over it!"

We've been extremely careful for the past year, exercise being our ""fall back"" activity which we enjoy and it has contributed greatly to our overall physical and mental health. We've avoided any indoor gatherings other than going to the supermarket during off-hours and ordering take-out from local restaurants. I've worked from home for 14 years so I didn't have to ""adjust"" to a different work environment or situation. I relished the extra 2 hours a day I had from not having to commute and used that time to read, exercise, or just do a random home project.

My 92 year old mother has been fully vaccinated as well, and since she lives in a residential retirement home she had to endure months of isolation from us before things slightly opened up last summer. Her facility did an incredible job in protecting all 124 residents, many of whom are have demential or are otherwise physically limited. 

We gladly support a vaccine ""passport"" whether digital or on paper. In fact, my wife just made copies of ours and had them laminated. We are required to have social sec. numbers, passports or enhanced driver's licenses when we travel, vaccines for admission to school for youngsters. We've been through a horrific pandemic considerably worsened by the previous administration. Having proof that one is vaccinated is a small price to pay for all we've lost."

It must not be turned by the Republican Conservatives and their White Evangelical Christian base  into a political issue of freedom and rights. But  it should be considered a public health requirement like quarantining ill patients.

This was a rude surprise, but never argue with an agent, because a new law has been established and luck was on my side, he let me embark.

A friend and me reminisced about when we were armed with a thin, small international vaccination passport. A vaccination for 'Polio' was mandatory in our youth, and today a humanitarian worker friend who travels the world, deemed 'Extraordinary' status by the U.S. Government in 2012 for her contribution as a top water-engineer and public health expert, is in possession of a vaccine document.  As of now and over the years, she has recuperated from Malaria, Dengue Fever, bouncing back like an Indian Ball.

Always told her that her qualifications and experience would be needed in The U.S.A. where we may be facing a water-deficit.  Paying attention to the World Food Program as well, and the unwittingly waste of $145 billion a year annually is weighing on ten million children who go to bed hungry at night.

A toiler of the soil, Frankie, a former boxer with a wife and two children, does not want to be vaccinated like 'one of those Lab animals'.  His spouse, a teacher and a care- giver for the Elderly, has been given a Covid-vaccine.

What ever happened to the vaccination record booklet put out by The Who.  I certainly had my vaccination registered in one along with the CDC white card.
2021-04-07 11:47,"So the claims in the comment section about privacy are funny. From the time we are born we are being followed. The government does not need a person to have a smart phone in order to ""follow"" them. All they need is your social security number. That SS number is issued when you are born as long as you want the tax deduction. The only way a child does not receive a card would be if the parent does not want the deduction. 

This issue is nothing but red meat for people who do not believe in government. This is an issue for people who believe in ""I"" not ""us"". this is an issue for people who believe they did it all by them selves. In other words people who are selfish."

Republicans have shown since the pandemic began that they are willing to sacrifice lives for political power.

Well, it's our turn for those of us who've done our part and are now vaccinated. A ""passport"" is our ticket to be able to comfortably enjoy concerts, theater and other indoor group activities again. If the selfish partiers who have made the spread of illness infinitely worse don't want to participate, they can stay home and be excluded. The idea that this is somehow more a grab of personal information than any time you use any other connected app on your phone is laughable."
2021-04-07 11:29,"A way to make this easy for all those states moving to restrict voting rights is to put a line for COVID vaccine on their much touted voter ID. They should embrace it because it could be a new way to restrict voting: ""No Vaccine = No Vote. They should be all over this!"

I used to assume that the pandemic would be wrangled under control reasonably quickly and we wouldn't have a repeat of the drawn out flu pandemic of 1918-20. Clearly, I was wrong."

Many countries require it and no one bulks at it. Leave it to the Republican to add this to their laundry list of grievances just because. Their propensity for culture wars including this one is becoming laughable because it has no value. They are becoming irrelevant by the day. Unfortunately, in the end, many people are gullible and believe that vaccine passports, just as vaccines themselves, go against their freedom, their religion or their right to be who they are. It wouldn't be a surprise if some of the vaccine passports will turn out to be fakes. But for a lot of these anti vaxxers / anti passports, their liberty has more value than the health and the life  of others. Maybe that is why a lot of them have guns as well. Aren't they the ones who say guns don't kill. Maybe for them Covid-19 does not either."

This is an official vaccination record created by the World Health Organization (WHO) many years ago and carried by international travelers to show proof of vaccine. The nurse administering my vaccine said I was not the only person to present this card but they were not authorized to enter information.

The point is there is a document already in place for those who need to show proof of vaccinations. I’ll guess members of Congress and diplomats traveling abroad already have it, depending upon their destination. I’ll also speculate the US may require this card for foreign officials and guests entering this country, depending on country of origin.

I get that the press did not make up from whole cloth but I can’t help but think the issues are made that much more derisive by the press constantly drawing lines and asking, which side are you on? Those who didn’t even know there was a side to be had suddenly find themselves compelled to fall into their respective political camp as drawn by these articles."
2021-04-07 11:39,"Yes it was a bit of a hassle to get the two Covid shots, and a couple of sore arms were just part of that process.
Still, not to get vaccinated means that one just doesn't care about one's neighbors or others one is around all day, including teachers and store employees.
I would have no problem with a school system demanding that all students get vaccinated if they want a public education. What part of nearly 600,00 Americans dead says, 'no big thing' to people?"
2021-04-07 11:29,"While I have gotten vaccinated, and I would like for things to open up even more. We shouldn’t assume that all the people that haven’t gotten vaccinated is because they’re ignorant or because they belong to a group. It could be that they have some valid doubts and are waiting for more information regarding other side effects. How about poor countries where they don’t have easy access to vaccination?. I think this idea of requiring vaccine passports while it is good on paper it shouldn’t be rushed so people who have been vaccinated can resume activities while others are discriminated. 

Perhaps a middle of the road approach should be taken before we enforce these policies. We should wait on this vaccine passport until there’s wide spread access to the vaccine, or it is required by all state health departments that you get vaccinated for COVID (for example as an immigrant myself they required for me to get the TB vaccine, chicken pox...). In the meantime we could require the option of either a negative COVID-19 test or show the vaccination record, continue to wear the mask until we reach herd immunity, some form of social distancing (maybe with more people vaccinated we can social distance 3ft like they do in schools) and hopefully as vaccines are more readily available throughout the world, then we could start implementing a vaccination passport.

While we are anxious for things to resume, we shouldn’t rush the vaccine passport, and take other safety measures for the moment."

2021-04-07 11:34,"Basic to all the Covid suppression issues is the fact that no freedom granted by law includes the right to endanger others.  Everyone who objects to Covid shots, wearing masks, social distancing, and not carrying evidence of vaccination, is claiming the non-existent right to endanger others.  That said, I find the casual reliance on digital data disturbing. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Americans have no access to cell phones of any kind, let alone smart phones.  Any system designed to provide a “vaccine passport” must make possible use of a non-digital form of such a document, and make it as easy to obtain as a digital version. Otherwise, the system will discriminate against probably millions who, because of economics or location, do not have available digital media. The issue carries the further likelihood that the majority of those lacking a digital connection are minorities. Any system of vaccine passports must be readily and equally available to all Americans. Reliance on digital media here would fall far short of that standard."
2021-04-07 11:36,"There are many groups with high rates of vaccination refusal, not only ""Republican evangelicals."" In one study from Yale, only 40% of African Americans said they would take the vaccine. 

Social media posts of the former group being refused service will be met with righteous approval and condescending eye rolls. It will be interesting to see how refusal of service will be handled for the latter group..."

2021-04-07 11:39,"There's a lot of dissonance between the GOP positions on free enterprise. 

First, they pursued and/or explicitly supported all the way to the Supreme Court the right of a baker to deny service to a gay couple based on ""religious liberty""; now, the same folks are adamant about not allowing businesses to discriminate against people who've not been vaccinated. Yet again, the GOP seems to want to foist their own values about sexuality onto the public, but doesn't really care about the health of the populace generally.

Second, the GOP supported the position of Citizen United at the SCOTUS to ensure the free speech rights of corporations; now, the same folks are suggesting they ought to ""stay out of politics"".  The ""outrage industrial complex"" is dominated by the right wing - Fox News has been at it for 20+ years, and Newt Gingrich was the architect, funded my one of the Mellons. 

Third, the manufactured notion of election fraud is the germ of outrage planted by the GOP leadership, fertilized by Fox, OAN, watered by Q disciples; remarkably, the presence of sunlight on these plantings has not resulted in any sort of fruit for the GOP. So, in order to fix a problem that doesn't exist, they enact laws restricting the right to vote.

I'm sure there are plenty of cases where the Dems have some hypocrisy, but I've yet to see any that are so bald-faced and within moments of each other."
2021-04-07 11:58,"I think we can start taking about this when anyone can go into a clinic or drug store and get a vaccine the same day. Right now there are many people who would like to get vaccinated and are still unable to get an appointment. 

What about young kids? Those trials have barely begun.

Until there is easy availability of the vaccine for everyone, this risks producing a system of haves and have nots."
2021-04-07 12:01,"Another conundrum. I don’t have the answer to whether vaccination cards should be shown before entering a business or attending an event. 
Although the following incident is not directly related to vaccination cards I think it encapsulates the situation and choices we currently are experiencing as a result of COVID. Last weekend I needed to buy some stain for a home project. I am fully vaccinated and 68 years old. I went to a local store, instead of a chain store thinking I should patronize a small business. Wearing my mask, I entered and saw one of the shoppers had no mask. Then I saw another also not wearing a mask. Then I saw that the employee working behind the counter was also maskless. I immediately left the store. 
I found the complete disregard for public safety protocol abhorrent. I made a choice not to shop at this establishment. Yet, the store is open and apparently conducts business in this fashion."
2021-04-07 12:04,"I am a little confused.   It would appear that vaccines are virtually 100% effective in preventing any serious Covid disease, and over 98%  effective in preventing any infection.  Thus vaccinated people have little to worry from unvaccinated people.   Unvaccinated people carry on life at their own individual risk tolerance.  So what is the purpose of the passport?"

2021-04-07 12:07,"Let’s see. 
You can’t get a loan for a car or house without proving you have a job or the means to pay back the money borrowed. You need proof of insurance to have a mortgage on that house, and in most states to drive a car.  Which,  by the way, requires a license as proof you have passed a driving test.  You can’t get on a plane to another nation without a passport. You aren’t allowed to fly an airplane without a license. You can’t be a doctor with passing all the classes in medical school.  You can’t get a license to practice law without going to law school and passing the bar exam. And many stores have signs saying “No shirt, no shoes, no service.”  The list goes on.

In my opinion, people should no be allowed to return to any workplace without proof of vaccination. Businesses can do this. 

Meanwhile, Republicans, who can politicize the weather, tells us a vaccine passport is an infringement on freedom. After all, why should anyone care about the health or well being of another person?

If Trump had proposed this there would be massive protests and articles about dividing the country. This is why I have always thought Trump was a necessary evil that galvanized the people. Now everyone is lulled into a passive sleep similar to what I saw under Reagan when they fell for the friendly old grandpa routine. Maybe this will reawaken people into realizing Biden is just as bad as Trump."

"" conservative politicians have turned “vaccine passports” into a cultural flash point""

It's time to stop confusing ""conservatives"" with ""Republicans."" 

Conservatives and old-timey Republicans believed in personal responsibility. That would include asking people to take personal responsibility to ensure that they don't harm other people.  

The ""new GOP"" opposes steps to prove that  you've taken this responsibility to not harm (or kill) other peopel with Covid seriously.  Put another way - they think that people should have the right to be taken at their word regarding this - but they don't think that a person's word is sufficient proof as it relates to voting. 

That's the GOP - not conservatism."

My 13-year old son and I were recently discussing the state of 1950s-1960s America compared to today.  Obviously as a culture we still had a long way to go in terms of equity for all people, as we still have a long way to go in terms of equity for all people.  I did make this point, however: At least we embraced science and reason.  Now we have new universes of knowledge at our fingertips but allow ourselves to be held hostage by the angry, frightened emotions of ignorant and paranoid conspiracy theorists.

Calling it hypocrisy is not enough.  Rights given to individuals and protecting those rights from harm from others must be distinguished.

In nearly every state, you cannot enroll a child in school without proof of vaccination for Mumps, Measles, Diptheria and so on. Vaccines are what  stopped childhood diseases.

I guess that redemption can rise to a point of drawing the line against ""stupid"". Slowly, some of these folks are crawling out from under the 2 ton rock that Trump placed on them. These politicians stopping vaccine IDs are losing their base."

But some companies have already announced them for items such as taking a cruise. If DeSantis were wise, he would remain silent on this matter. But then, the Republican principle of government not intruding on citizens' lives only extends as far as Trumpites want it too. What a dumb thing to politicize. Your right to spread SARS-Cov2 stops at my nose."
2021-04-07 11:37,"LOL, WHO whose agenda is set by China is helping to ensure that the US stays bogged down in this health crisis by opposing a vaccine passport.

2021-04-07 10:43,"This is a good thing. 

Just because a few illiterates among us are not believing in the vaccine, why should the rest be penalized.

Most NYT readers are US passport holders, travel internationally, and will welcome this.

Except for collages that teach theology, most schools will mandate the vaccine passport.

Personally, we will now ask our suppliers, restaurants we frequent, etc to tell us, they have had the Jabs.."

It’s not discrimination. It’s public health 101. Prevent spread of disease. Period. It’s not new and it’s not political. Kids need measles vaccines to go to school. Grownups need this one to go the movies. Get over it.

Republicans should really like that as it celebrates the second amendment, and private property rights.  That's real freedom man!

Of course, Republicans want 17 pieces of ID and a blood sample to be able to cast a ballot to prevent nonexistent voter fraud.

Or we could all act like responsible citizens and do what we can to protect ourselves and each other and just get the shot.  Then all we need to carry is just one little ID that Republicans would never accept at the polls as sufficient without the other 17 pieces of ID.

Ah the slippery slope!  Might force people to act responsibly.  Let's not confuse social responsibility with patriotism.  During WWII, people recycled bacon grease and meat was rationed.  Today, that would be considered fascism by the right."
2021-04-07 12:18,"I've not real ideological objection to covid passports.  I can accept showing such proof just as some jobs require drug testing etc.

But then there's the issue of who's ""passport"" do you use?

You report that NYS has developed Excelsior Pass.  I loaded the App onto my iPhone.

I then attempted to upload my ""proof"" of vaccine.  A vaccine I'd received while in CA in February.

Yet even though I took the necessary photo of the CA ""proof"" with the required QR code -- NY's App doesn't recognize it!

Now I have that same ""proof"" in my Apple Wallet so maybe that's okay -- but what is the sense of NY setting up an App that isn't universal?

Did anyone conceiving this pass even consider the fact that many NY'ers may have obtained their vaccines elsewhere?  How many ""snowbird"" NY'ers were in FL when they got vaccinated or have p/time residences in places like CA such as myself?

If you want to create a Covid Passport -- make it universal for crying out loud!"
2021-04-07 12:22,"So it’s ok for Republicans and Conservatives to require a picture ID to vote but it’s an intrusion of their liberty to require a vaccine passport to use a private or public establishment for public health and safety reasons.

Hypocrisy run amok! 

Nobody can die from casting a vote.

But a restaurant or airline can’t require a vaccine passport to ensure that their employees and patrons don’t catch a deadly virus? 

The Republicans followed Trump’s ridiculous denial about COVID19 which allowed a deadly virus to become political. Now they’re stuck with that stance and this will cause unnecessary deaths.

This is infuriating because others will die due to false narratives and political posturing. It’s incredibly sad that our country has come to this.

Regarding picture ID’s: unless the government provides every person eligible to vote with a free picture ID, the requirement is onerous and targeted at those who are poor and that tends to be black and brown people. Not everyone drives, so they don’t have a driver’s license. I know NY offers a non driver picture ID, but you must pay for it. Voting is a Constitutional right, there shouldn’t be impediments to exercise that right that cost money."
2021-04-07 12:05,"This is a public health situation.  For many businesses you must show that you were vacinated.  Healthcare is a prime example.  I get shots every year because I want to PROTECT my PATIENTS and MYSELF from an infectious disease, flu and now covid.  All you republicans need to give it all a rest and stop acting like 2 year olds.  I do not want to die.  You may be perfectly OK with your family, friends and co-workers dieing.  This could be viewed as I have a Constitutional Right to LIVE and be protected and safe.  And making sure people can show others thay they were vacinated is nothing. Do you carry a drivers license?  Same thing, government intrusion then into my personal and private life. And according to you all it does not matter if I may kill someone with my car in an accident.  Risk to the public is not an important consideration, huh?"
2021-04-07 12:18,Does unfettered civil liberty apply to actions that can make other people sick or die? Do I have the right to go to a restaurant while infected with small pox? It is also not clear that the unvaccinated population is only a danger to itself and does not pose a threat to vaccinated persons. Continued spread among the unvaccinated will lead to mutations that may sicken the vaccinated. The 1905 Supreme Court decision got it right.
2021-04-07 12:12,"Over in Europe we are counting on that to restart tourism. But then again I am happy with now having so many tourists crowd the beach.

USA is doing great job rolling out vaccine.  I came to USA Saturday and got vaccine Sunday. Hope to get second short in Cyprus, but they are way behind the US. They use a government system there and the web site crashed yesterday.  Just opened it up to 61 year olds.

America has lots of problems with greedy capitalists but their logistic systems and web sites work.  Imagine if the CDC ran the web sites what a mess that would be. I can see how America won World War II: unrivalled industrial and logistics capacity."

So, a simple question....Republican leaders, what IS your plan ? That’s right, you have none."
2021-04-07 12:15,"Unvaccinated people continue to spread the virus. So, they allow the virus to mutate into variants that may eventually become resistant to the vaccines. That negates the protection for all of us who are vaccinated.

A bakery is allowed to refuse to bake a cake for a gay wedding. Hobby Lobby is allowed to refuse to provide insurance coverage for contraception. Therefore, a private business should be allowed to demand proof of vaccination. 

In addition, public schools and private schools are allowed to demand proof of vaccination for mumps, rubella, and measles. So, I don't see the issue here except once again, own the libs."
2021-04-07 12:17,While I know planes have air filters like those used in hospital surgeries I also know sitting 8 hours in a flight to London behind an obviously sick family in December 1999 resulted in a nasty cold a few days later.  We have had our two COVID vaccine shots and should have 95% immunity.  But in a plane with 300+ people on board no one should have the right to compromise 5% of the occupants (15 or more).  I am more than willing to use a proof of vaccination app and for those I know who give excuses not to get vaccinated I say educate yourself!  Over 100 million in the US have received at least one shot with relatively few issues.  How much proof do you need that the 2 shot protocol vaccines are safe.
2021-04-07 12:21,"The complaint against vaccine passports is an exertion of control by the right.  Most folks will do the right thing and get vaccinated (if medically feasible).  Most folks will be prudent and inform their choices whether there are others similarly protected.

When that situation is ambiguous, folks may stay on the sidelines or at least have legit anxiety over the situation.  The anti-vaxer/anti-passport type has the control here.  Just like any other culture or control issue; abortion, masks, guns, voting (ironic regarding voting IDs), etc.

Tyranny of the minority again."
2021-04-07 12:15,"Why does the focus land on ""conservative politicians""? Other people who align themselves with other parties, or don't align with any parties, don't wish to get the vaccine. Blaming one group for the divide seems kind of divisive."
2021-04-07 12:30,"Hey, if you want to assert your “freedom” to endanger the rest of us, that’s your good right, I suppose, but that doesn’t mean that you won’t face consequences. Private entities (and other countries) will bar you from entry. No shirt, no shoes, no vaccination, no service. Freedom isn’t free!"
2021-04-07 12:30,"I've spent over a year being careful, isolated from family and friends, staying home, no trips, no shopping, no concerts, no museum visits, no evenings with friends playing cards, etc.  I would LOVE to have a vaccination passport that would show anyone who is concerned that I am ready to start doing things again. And I would hope that out of common respect for fellow man, others would also want to share a vaccination passport to make others feel comfortable about getting back with life.  This does not have to be a permanent situation, but at least a way of helping us feel comfortable with living our lives again.  If there is a vaccination passport to be had, I will gladly sign up."
2021-04-07 12:32,"It’s clear to me that to protect the majority of students and teachers, proof of vaccination should be required, as it already is for measles, polio, etc. People who choose not to vaccinate still have the freedom to stay away. It’s called home schooling. And we know how popular that is..."
2021-04-07 12:34,"Thanks for the historical perspective in this article. And thanks for all the good comments, on both sides of the issue. But as a fairly progressive liberal (except on foreign affairs), having just gotten my second vaccine shot, I’m still on the fence on this question."
2021-04-07 12:45,"I’m leaning toward the support of a vaccine passport, but think government organizations and businesses should determine (with guidelines from public health officials) when and where to require them.

I do think it’s entirely appropriate to question and debate the notion of a vaccine passport, or anything that may curtail free movement and one’s ability to participate in society. We should consider and solve for the potential impact on marginalized members of our community; for the same reason many on the left push back against voter ID requirements, we should consider that it will not be easy or feasible for all people to carry/present a vaccine passport. We do not want to unintentionally further ostracize those people who are already most vulnerable in our society."
2021-04-07 12:48,I wish the article had explored the real reason I think red states are opposing vaccine passports:  Vaccine hesitancy.  A portion of the Republican base consists of anti-vaxxers.  Vaccine passports would exclude these people from full participation in society.  I think DeSantis is simply playing to his base.
2021-04-07 12:33,My European partner had to be RE-VACCINATED with MMR to get his US green card. I’m sure other immigrants will be required to do this as part of their requirement to live/work in the US. Now we are saying public health is in-American?
2021-04-07 12:50,I spend at least a couple hours a day trying to arrange a vaccine for my 17-year-old. None are available. We are worrying about the wrong problem here. The distribution of the vaccine is chaos. Fretting over a vaccine passport is like fretting over what color to paint your mansion after you win the lottery.
2021-04-07 12:42,"A terrible idea that seems good but look closely....a slippery slope that should not be considered...among other things it would create a terrible class divide reinforcing the have & have-not economy & society that we currently suffer. everyone or no one...none of these special passports or elite passes....follow the money w/ these vaccine passport companies, how do they profit? Everyone means everyone not just the rich, insiders and well connected.....my parents immigrated to the USA to escape an oppressive class system, I find this sort of special passport thinking to be quite disgusting and the problems this sort of privilege will create will be more destructive than the virus. Totally unDemocratic and extremely Un-American. I find this to be very disturbing and not something this Administration should even be considering.....sounds more like Trump then Biden. A terrible idea from impatient greed driven people. Haven't we all had enough of this sort of thinking?"
2021-04-07 12:37,There is a very good reason the Biden administration is not getting involved in this. It is a politically loosing proposition. He will leave it to the states to decide so it doesn't become an albatross in the 2022 midterms for the Democrats.
2021-04-07 12:26,"When ID requirements are used to make it harder for people to vote, the GOP is all for it, but if they're used to help stop the spreading of a deadly disease, it's called ""tyranny"". What else should we expect from the Party that thinks everyone should have a gun, but not food on the table?"
2021-04-07 12:33,"You need a license to drive a car, a visa to travel overseas, and proof of specific inoculations to visit certain countries. So why not vaccination passports? This is a pandemic, not a rock concert where your hand gets stamped. This is serious, deadly business. If vaccination passports help save lives and keep people safe, make them mandatory. We can live with it."
2021-04-07 12:26,"OK, how about this...let businesses apply a surcharge to customers who haven't been vaccinated?  Vaccinations aren't required, but make the anti-vaxers pay for the added cost of employee PPE, extra sanitization, reduced capacity, etc. that never ends because we can't reach herd immunity.  I look forward to the day I can go shopping, enter a restaurant, and board a plane without a mask (for my safety and others, whether required or not).  Republican politicians will eventually have to answer to their corporate donors if this pandemic isn't brought under control due to their ignorance."

I will hesitate to take a flight with an airline that does not."
2021-04-07 12:59,"I'm all for getting vaccinated and plan to soon myself, but let's not forget that none of the vaccines have been fully approved by the FDA yet. In comparison, smallpox vaccines were in use for over a century when Jacobson v. Massachusetts was decided in 1905. Requiring citizens to get a new and unapproved medical product in order to participate in society does not seem right and is unlikely to ease the fears of those who are already skeptical of the vaccines."
2021-04-07 12:55,"I'm a bit perplexed. Does 'freedom' mean that I can do anything I want, regardless of the consequences to or sensibilities of other people? Do I not have to wear a seatbelt on public highways??? Can businesses or private entities not require that everyone who enters the establishment wear shirts and shoes? Is that infringing on someone's liberty??? Surely, shoes are voluntary, as are shirts -- as my wife will tell you about my fashion choices in the summer. Surely I am free to keep my body shirtless, but does that give me the right to walk into someone else's space when such display is expressly prohibited? Surely not. My rights don't trump (pardon the expression) anyone else's rights. 'Conservatives' need to grow up and join the ranks of the reasonable."
2021-04-07 12:31,"What is the big deal about proof of vaccinations?  The anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers are saying, in effect, ""It is my right to spread the disease to my fellow citizens.  Causing harm to others is my inalienable right.""  What's next, the right to ignore rules of the road which will cause traffic accidents?  Selfishness disguised as personal prerogative cannot sustain a society."
2021-04-07 12:37,The people who insist the only way to have safe elections is to require IDs think it is oppressive to require proof of vaccination to create a safe public health environment. While there is no evidence of voter misbehavior changing election outcomes there is ample evidence for people being vaccinated to prevent disease spread at gatherings. Conservative irrationally on full display.
2021-04-07 12:49,"The ""government"" of New Jersey already knows I received the vaccine.  I had to register, show my ID when I showed up, and sign a consent.

2021-04-07 12:34,"I (we) have a right to live in a society that affords us with a modicum, at the very least, of certain levels of safety against threats.
COVID-19 is clearly a deadly threat.
Having a Vaccine Passport demonstrates that I care about the safety of my fellow members of society as well as mine.
The opposite speaks for itself."
2021-04-07 12:43,"Why all the debate? If you don’t get vaccinated that is fine. But you may be excluded from events, establishments, workplaces, schools etc. or required to wear a mask indefinitely."
2021-04-07 12:31,"So let me get this right.  When it comes to COVID, conservatives are worried about individual privacy, but when it comes to a woman's privacy as it relates to her reproductive health, they are not.  I'm confused."
2021-04-07 12:34,"The private sector can handle this better than the government.  It seems like a particularly good task for the tech giants - GoogleVac.  

Take one look at any attempt by the US government to create computer programs and it becomes obvious. 

If Republicans want to continue their Know Nothing line of reasoning, they can stay in their rural outposts, uneducated, unemployed, and handle snakes on Sundays."
2021-04-07 12:40,"As usual, seems republicans continue to be the party of “NO” instead working together with democrats to come up with sensible rules for designing a method of encouraging vaccination. 
I have Republican friends who insist that now that they have been vaccinated they don’t need to wear a mask, while absurd in itself, if there was a digital passport maybe they could show proof and get their wish. It would boost participation in vaccination."
2021-04-07 12:58,"So, all the freedom-screamers suddenly think businesses shouldn't be free to choose whom they serve?  Is there no end to the hypocrisy?  Hint: no."
2021-04-07 12:58,"Unfortunately this is a continuation of the sad reality we have been watching since Day 1. All the Republicans have done since the start of this pandemic is deny, confuse and obstruct. 
First it was about the existence of the pandemic, then about lockdowns, masks, and social distancing and now about vaccines. I have yet to see a single solution or leadership from any Republican either at the national level or at the state level. No policy, no science, no economics. No idea is small enough to be obstructed. What's worse, their actions have been shown to actively cost lives."

2021-04-07 12:30,"It seems somewhat hypocritical that some governors are protecting the right not to get vaccinated and that those unvaccinated people should have equal treatment in public and in businesses, but those same states seem to have trouble protecting the rights and freedoms that are already part of the law."
2021-04-07 12:43,"I’m not sure what privacy conservatives think they’re protecting. Here in MO, the department of health is tracking who has gotten the shot(s) and sharing that information with employers. My employer has made it well known that they’re tracking who of their employees have received the shot(s). So really, conservatives are spreading lies and hampering a process that can save lives and the economy. Why would they want to do such a thing? I think this goes beyond wanting to hinder democrat success in vaccine distribution. I think conservatives have a vision for this country that has nothing to do with freedom and everything to do with their personal finances."
2021-04-07 12:47,"Shouldn’t this be a temporary problem?

After all, no one asks to see my flu shot passport or my shingles shots passport. 

But, until the virus is adequately contained, the unvaccinated present more of a health risk than the vaccinated.  So knowing the vaccinated status and dealing with the risk of unvaccinated people are going to be important for schools, businesses, and other organizations who must physically interact with people.

Right wing politicians and media are so eager to pick a fight with the “enemy”, that they will manufacture a controversy.  And, since, they don’t much care about logical consistency and hypocrisy, this particular cri de coeur is bound to force them into awkward conversations, if the responsible news media asks."
2021-04-07 12:47,"These governors should have also made it a crime to lie about being vaccinated or a negative covid test result.

Every sporting event and airport I have gone to in the last five years, or more,  I have to empty my pockets, stand for a wand or scanner, by subject to a physical pat-down, had to have all other possessions in clear bag - and Republicans are concerned about privacy? 

Make it optional, sections or areas where people opt into having a vaccine passport can enjoy being with others who are vaccinated.  The 'unwashed' can have their own section, whether vaccinated, or not."

Businesses in Florida are prohibited from requiring patrons or customers to provide any documentation certifying COVID-19 vaccination or post-transmission recovery to gain access to, entry upon, or service from the business.

I'm not a lawyer, but my guess is that this is illegal.  He rationalized this on the basis of an emergency act passed in FL, but it is likely an over-reaching policy.  If a cruise line or airline sets a policy to require vaccination for entry, there likely will be a court case to define how far government can go on this process.  Imagine that a cruise will stop at ports in other countries where vaccine passports are required.  How will that work?  Imagine that an airline departing Miami is going to a country that requires vaccination to enter.  How will that work?  

Regarding TX, imagine the US border policy changes to require a vaccination passport for entry of all persons into the US, even US citizens.  How will that play out at the border with Mexico?"

Without this concept chaos will ensue, the society will collapse. It's why we have driver's licenses."
2021-04-07 12:41,"Why is this issue, like many others, reduced to an ""either, or"" discussion? 

I have not problem with anyone being required to show proof of vaccination against a deadly disease before being allowed to interact with the public (in public, or in a  private business), but why is it that the only option presented for that requirement be linked to having a smart phone and/or some other form of electronic proof? If you have and can present your vaccination card, why is that not enough?

Why are all solutions today seemingly based upon a device (smart phones) that by virtue of their user agreements require that you give up all privacy and allow an untold number of businesses (every app you have and all of their ""partners"") to know and track everything about you that passes through your phone.

All manner of articles decry the loss of privacy, yet all the solutions to problems seem to tout the use of, and dependence upon the use of, the very device that is the root of cause of that loss- with no serious attempt to change the regulation of it. It's madness to me."
2021-04-07 12:51,"Not sure why you assume those who question vaccine passports are Republican, anti-maskers, and anti-vaxxers.  I am not a Republican, I wear a mask, and I am fully vaccinated.  I do question the vaccine passport.  Will our data really be secure?  Will the elderly be able to navigate the requirements?  Will those who cannot be vaccinated due to health reasons be turned away from public places?  Will minorities who choose not to be vaccinated due to historically justified distrust of the government, be turned away from public places?  What does the bureaucracy look like?  These questions are worth asking, and no one should be afraid to ask them for fear of judgement or denigration."
2021-04-07 12:52,"There is a hole in this vaccine passport argument and that is a vaccinated person can still spread the virus (hence vaccinated people still wearing masks).  Yes, its likely rare, but it can happen. So the only reasons I see a passport providing value are 1) international travel, so the destination country knows you won't become a drain on their hospital system, 2) special vaccination-only sections or limits on indoor access (e.g. dining) to vaccinated only so people take masks off.  Net-net, being vaccinated does not mean you are not a danger to others, it only means you, yourself, are protected from getting sick on the off chance you do contract it."
2021-04-07 12:40,I'd say treat vaccine passports like drivers licenses.  Sane and safe and protecting the common good.

But I do not want to go through the fiddle faddle and expense of currently mandated (for most countries) COVID-19 testing first for the departure trip and then again for the return trip.  The latter is particularly unpalatable, given that it requires navigating the health care system in another country, in another language.   It would be so much easier if, as an alternative to testing, I could simply prove vaccination status to authorities in the destination country, and then to the U.S. upon my return."

Clearly a smart requirement to ensure that I didn’t run the risk of infecting patients with these communicable diseases. Do the likes of governors DeSantis, Noem and Abbot feel that this is overreach by the hospital? Are my rights being infringed upon by this requirement? Based on their positions regarding COVID vaccinations I would have to say it is. By their standard I guess going forward I shouldn’t have to prove my vaccination status to any hospital in their state, as by doing so it would infringe on my freedom. Heck, let’s carry it to the next step. Why should I have to show my medical license or medical school diploma to be able to work in a hospital?"

Would they be banned from places requiring a passport or would they have a separate exemption passport?  As a vaccinated Democrat - not that it should matter - I think this is a horribly intrusive idea that apparently no one is thinking through practically.  Sure, the GOP has been vocally against this and that is easy to report and oppose by the other side.  But aside from Cuomo, are there any Democratic leaders pushing for this?

2021-04-07 12:59,"As noted by many, children must show proof of immunization before enrolling in school, and the menningococcal vaccine is required before enrollment in college or on joining the U.S. military.  Additionally, hospitals frequently require that workers (physicians, nurses, therapist, etc) receive the annual influenza vaccine with an employee's vaccination status being indicated on their ID badge.  While those employees who decline/refuse vaccination can still work, they are required to wear a mask while at work. Whether these requirements are much different from a ""Covid Passport"" is open to discussion.
These requirements are in place to not only protect the recipient, but to protect everyone else.  Why no outcry here?  Because to a large extent, the infections against which these vaccines are directed have not been politicized. TFG and his supporters have mutated a generally benign public health practice into a grotesque example of mindless malignant political expression. Those of us in the population who understand that a virus does not have any political affiliation know that only by protecting ourselves do we protect those we love, do we protect the entire country.  Failure to accept vaccination is a reflection of ignorance or of a conscious expression of a lack of compassion or concern for others.

2021-04-07 13:14,"The idea of a vaccine passport has no rational basis in science and therefore no justification in law.

If we view freedom of movement as a fundamental right, then government must have a compelling reason for limiting that right. Proponents of vaccine passport point to school enrollment laws, which have been upheld by courts.

Courts have simply assumed their social utility and rarely look at the actual science behind them. But the Covid ""Vaccine"" is by the definition included in the product insert a treatment, not an inoculation.

This is why vaccinated people are told to still wear masks and social distance. They can acquire the virus and they can spread the virus. The vaccine simply limits the capacity for the virus to become the disease Covid-19.

If I can achieve the exact same result by measures other than a vaccine then why should I be required to accept that treatment over all others?

A recent Danish study with 4,000 people found that the difference of virus susceptibility between those who wore a mask and those that didn't was ""statistically insignificant.""

Yet, our politicians are willing to make a law requiring a mask even when science says it accomplishes nothing.

Our constitutional civil liberties have nothing to do with party affiliation. And maybe the flawed science that politicians are claiming as justification will have to be put to the test in court.

I look forward to that because expert testimony under oath is better than speculation by journalists."

Vaccinations, SS number, direct deposit, the creation of the worldwide web, basically anything that makes us safer or benefits the whole of the nation? No context, no understanding of metaphor, no irony as they refuse vaccinations but rabidly heed the call of a failed autocrat to storm the Capitol and overthrow democracy? A population that worships a god created in the image of their own ignorance and paranoia? Biden's hesitance to antagonize this lot mystifies them?"

As Rich said and I've believed this too, we have laws and rules that we must follow every day, but the government restricting people even more is out of line. Cards are given for the vaccine with the date, time, dose 1 and 2, and the kind of vaccine, Pfizer Moderna. What more is needed? Why do they need my picture?

In the dog world, save for Rabies you can show proof of antibodies by having your dog titered in lieu of vaccine boosters, which may or may not be necessary and can at times adversely affect some animals.

There is no hard proof that the vaccines provide long term immunity. Why not have a passport for those folks who instead get tested for antibodies if you are going to have a vaccine passport? And who says vaccinated folks cannot still infect iothrrs?

Earlier this week on a dog walk, I passed a house where an  obese man of more than 60 years old was standing in his driveway. We exchanged pleasantries. Then the conversation turned to the vaccine. He proceeded to lecture me on the importance of getting vaxxed. You can fly, you can eat in a restaurant, You can return to a normal life. I kept my tongue.  But as I walked away I wondered how many donuts did he scarf down that morning to fuel up for his waddle to the mailbox. The vaccine might give him a false sense of security so he can stuff his face with some genethically engineered food at a chain restaurant.

We'll get by this pandemic.   I myself am getting vaccinated next week.  I believe in the vaccine.  Most people do and most people will get the vaccine.

But the ""passport""?  All I will say is they didn't even have a vaccine for the Spanish Flu when it was raging, nor for many years after that.   And America and world got through it, eventually.   We have a big leg up over those days.   Most will get the vaccine gladly, like me.   We just don't need the war that goes with it now."

They ALL deserve the protections, as well as the right to participate in all activities outlined in this article. Employment and shopping, etc. 

Every State should be paid by the Federal Government to mount an effort to get into homes where necessary to administer the vaccines. As soon as possible.

While we  are on the subject of religion, my understanding of God's Word tells me that as a follower of Jesus Christ  I am expected to show love, to work for justice, to show humility and to think of others more highly than myself.    This is God's Will for my life and for the lives of fellow Christians.  This same theme is stressed throughout the Bible.

 Continuing to wear a mask, getting  vaccinated, social distancing all reflect my respect for God's Will and love for my fellow human beings.  I'm bothered that some fellow Christians try to make this more difficult than it needs to be.

Fact, Covid-19 is an infectious disease, a worldwide public health issue. The choice of not getting vaccinated based on an array of subjective reasoning void of any logical and scientific proof is a threat to us all. The requirement of  “vaccine passports” is the only way to safeguard everyone and begin to erratic this virus.  Justice John Marshall;

I followed the rules throughout the pandemic and am not anti-science - in fact I provide evidence based treatment in a mental health care setting every day. But proving health status to be able to do things is intrusive. It's why we have HIPPA, so that we can keep information about our body private. I'm also in agreement with Apple about backdoors into phones. I don't believe just because crime is committed that Apple should give government a back door into their operating systems (in case they ever need it - if they want information get a warrant). I have lived in many countries and I found the UK, with it's CCTV on every corner, to be incredibly intrusive - their reasoning is crime, but it records everybody all the time. It's not ok. Neither are backdoors into operating systems 'just in case.' Neither are vaccine passports. Nobody has a right to my personal health information except me. You don't have to be a 'stupid conservative' to have these opinions. I simply care about who has information about me - that's all."

We already ensure our children are vaccinated for a list of diseases before they go to school, and add in another vaccine for meningitis before they can go to the university. We have to be vaccinated for travel to other countries and anyone who has traveled at all knows that. So why is this a big deal? It's not.

She lives in Florida, has been eating at restaurants indoors for months, and entertaining indoors. She even resumed her volunteer work at a youth detention center until it closed down for COVID!!!Fortunately, she lives in an upscale country club community that has taken the virus seriously, and many of her friends are vaccinated. She calls a monitor at her church a mask Nazi because she keeps tapping my mother on the shoulder to cover her nose. And no, my mother is not senile. She has always been like this.

I’m one shot done, waiting eagerly to get my second in a few weeks, now that MA is finally letting front line workers like retail get vaccinated. 

Left unanswered in this discussion is, what exactly would a “reasonable accommodation” for those who are not yet vaccinated due to health issues or religious belief, both protected classes under the ADA. The EEOC ruling just discusses employees, not customers. 

I know I have customers who will not want to shop in any store with non vaccinated customers. I know I have other customers who are not vaccinated and may never be. I, like everyone else, want to get rid of my masks and allow my customers to see my face again - smiling at people is actually a really big part of a sales conversation.

“Backers of digital vaccination cards are pressing the Biden administration to become involved, at least by setting standards for privacy and for verifying the accuracy of the records.
The White House is clearly skittish.”

For the Biden administration to be hesitant about getting involved makes little sense.   We have witnessed the damage caused by letting the virus take hold and sicken and kill millions around the world.   

It’s not akin to a debate about wearing shirts and shoes to enter a place of business as the Harvard law professor states, it’s about protecting each other from a deadly virus in ways that scientific experts have advised.   There should be a clear difference here.   If some people don’t like it, because it’s become politically correct to do the right thing, so be it.

So, let it be voluntary allowing those like me who want and/or need such a passport to easily get one and let the stubborn irresponsible Republican governors, anti-vaxxers and others not be forced to have one.

First, getting vaccinated is a responsible thing to do. Second, certain vaccinations may be required by the countries you travel to. Third, it is in your self-interest to be vaccinated so you can leave a country during an outbreak.  Many people have had a WHO yellow card in their passport. How is this different?   
Considering how poorly many government databases are protected, how will security be managed? A vendor installed remote access device for service calls, can bypass firewalls.
How do we protect against counterfeiting (digital or analog)?  The person checking IDs needs to recognize legitimate/counterfeit forms of ID. Will they be able to? 
How can a person get an ID? It looks like the emphasis will be on APPs and other digital means. What happens to the person who does not have a smart phone, internet access or the know-how to use a digital device? Too many people designing these systems do not recognize that there are people who cannot or do not have the ability to access digital records. They do not recognize the world existed before the digital age. Digital access should be an option, not a requirement. 
We need to make sure a vaccine ID does not become an overreaching government program."

2021-04-07 13:53,Apparently we all define freedom differently.  I define freedom as being safe from the virus.   To end this pandemic we all need to participate.    It is a group effort.  A vaccine passport is an excellent idea.
2021-04-07 13:55,"Proof of vaccination is a very reasonable thing for business owners and the general public to expect while the pandemic continues. It’s a simple matter of protecting public health and safety. Those who choose to opt out may do so, but they have no right to endanger anyone else and should be prepared to deal with the consequences - including denial of access to places of business. Normally the Republicans would approve of allowing private business owners to run their businesses as they see fit. Instead they’ve chosen to double down on their rejection of science, logic and our collective well-being. The ideological bankruptcy of the GOP is complete."

Don't let right wing twitter scare you from making the correct policy decisions."
2021-04-07 13:39,"Vaccinations passports are exacerbating the class divide? Really?
Not redlining? Not gerrymandering? Not income inequality? Not poor schools? Not lack of health insurance? And the list goes on.
We have yellow vaccination cards required for travel to many countries. Our children must be vaccinated to attend school. Adults receive vaccines for a myriad of reasons. Student athletes must be vaccinated. Records are kept of all these inoculations.
Presently we are in the middle of a major health crisis. People are using their credit cards, PreCheck, EASY passes, shopping on the internet, filling out health forms, and using their cell phones. All are being tracked by both the government and private entities.
Little of our information is private, and yet critics are yelling, “ privacy, socialism, government takeover or freedom.”
Life has consequences...not “cancel culture or woke-ness or socialism.”  
Vaccine passports are completely voluntary. However, if not vaccinated, please do not attempt to gather in large venues, airports, arenas, concerts etc. If unvaccinated, you are a public health hazard to those of us who are.
Rich or poor, life is full of choices and consequences. So no vaccine...no participation. 
And remember to buckle your seatbelt, wear shoes and shirts while dining in restaurants, pay your car insurance and taxes, and drive within the speed limit. All government mandated activities.
Choices = Consequences. So stop whining and get vaccinated...or not. Your choice."

Sorry, but a disability is not a person's choice, whereas believing in a deity is a choice. 

People have a constitutional right to observe [x] religion in the U.S., but there is no legal or moral basis for insisting on the right to endanger the lives of others.  

If the adherents of [x] religion want to knowingly endanger each other's lives, have at it--but keep your ordained microbes to yourselves."

You make your choices and you pay the prices."

2021-04-07 13:44,Let’s be perfectly clear. Republican leadership wants this vaccine campaign to fail because it will make Joe Biden look good. They are willing to sacrifice the economy and our lives to regain power. Since Jimmy Carter’s presidency and the arrival of the sainted Ronald Reagan they have done nothing but obstruct the agenda of Democrat Presidents even if it benefitted the country. Mitch McConnell has been the master of this. But somehow they have manipulated and convinced Conservative and Evangelical Americans that they are protecting them.
2021-04-07 13:46,"The party of ""private property rights"" has repeatedly gone to the Supreme Court to demand that businesses be able to discriminate against others based on the owners' privately held beliefs. They have successfully argued that being forced making a gay wedding cake or to insure birth control coverage is an existential threat. 

And yet now, in the face of a literal existential threat, they argue that private property owners have no right to protect themselves and their patrons. They demand that they be allowed to potentially carry a deadly disease into private areas and spread it around as they like. 

They demand to exclude others at will but never be excluded themselves. They demand that we see a same-sex wedding as a greater injury than death.

Give me a break."
2021-04-07 13:48,"In order to have exclusive/expensive experiences, the lap-top class wants to know that they won't be infected by lower-class people who haven't been vetted.  The vaccine passport is the first step to that."
2021-04-07 13:50,Unfortunately this may end up in the federal courts and with all those Trump appointees on the bench there is a high probability that any vaccine verification measures will be struck down.
2021-04-07 13:53,"Those of us on the left who are so quick to support this in the name of supposed “pro-science” and humanist principles need to pause for a moment and consider the implications for the working class, particularly regarding employment.

Based on the guidance from the EEOC, employers can fire workers who refuse to show proof of vaccination. This is only possible in the first place thanks to the downfall of unions. We should be empowering workers to bargain for improved conditions and protections, not further undermining their position. Those unions that do still remain are already coming out in support of their members on this - particularly the right to protect employment status regardless of vaccination status. 

We who promptly conjure backwards “Republicans” as the antagonists here would do well to remember their underlying principles and values, even when applying them is uncomfortable."
2021-04-07 13:50,"I remember a GOP rally in Texas in 2011 where the whole crowd on TV chanted ""Let them Die"" after suggesting people who can't fund their own healthcare should be left to die.

This is the mantra of the GOP now. If anything, the Texas, Miss. and Florida governors have made decisions that HAS and can lead to more death to protect their ""freedoms"". 

I think the Biden administration needs to take on these outrageous GOP governors and fight for the health and well being of all of us.  For years people have had to be vaccinated for measles, polio, etc. and apart from those who can't or have religious beliefs against, most of us all get vaccinated for the sake of public health."

2021-04-07 13:58,"It should be noted that there is one huge difference between the masking issue and the passport issue (in reference to a tag line for this article). Masks really mattered - and still do - for controlling the pandemic. Vaccine passports? Not so much. So, the political argument going on about passports is so much smoke, while masks are the real issue. Keep your eye on the ball...."
2021-04-07 14:01,"I want a vaccine passport to facilitate travel to other countries and even states like Hawaii or Alaska.  The PCR test is too difficult to arrange in a reliable and timely manner.  The US government should follow the example of other countries, including Britain, which will implement a reliable and verifiable method to reflect vaccine status.  For me, it is a high priority in order to connect with the wider world.  The Biden administration should either implement it immediately or allow a private standard setting group to do so."
2021-04-07 14:03,"The US can permit people to remain unvaccinated- however I think this will change if insurance companies get involved- ie if it is a personal decision not to get vaccinated, then you may find your insurance company will chose not to cover you if you contract SARS-COV-2 or it's varients. 
You may find other countries require a proof of vaccination before permitting entry- (as will, I suspect, the USA). Currently many countries require a negative Covid- test- even for returning residents. Not too far-reaching to see those requirements extend to a vaccine after end-2022, which time should allow most countries to vaccinate. 
My own country, a small caribbean island with limited medical facilities, now requires a negative covid pcr test and health and repatriation insurance before visitors can enter- for their sake as well as those of us living here.
As residents, we have been fortunate to have been issued with sufficient Pfizer vaccine to vaccinate 80% of our population, hopefully by end June 2021 and hopefully if the Pfizer trials on 12-16 year olds are approved, we can vaccinate that age group before school starts in September."
2021-04-07 14:04,"Why do the authors use ""ostensibly"" to qualify ""voluntary""? There is no state mandate to get the vaccine, although everyone certainly should if we want to move beyond our current nightmare. Using ""ostensibly"" suggests that getting the vaccine may be something other than voluntary, which is simply not true."
2021-04-07 14:05,"The crazy thing is that Republicans oppose the idea of the government having a database of vaccinated people, the use of which would be highly regulated by law.  However, they are fine with corporations creating vast databases with all sorts of information, including vaccination status, with virtually no controls or regulation."
2021-04-07 14:03,"This is yet another hopeless, desperate grasp for relevance.  
Republicans only hope is to create cultural wars and wine about their own liberties. God knows they are otherwise devoid of any mission or policies that are of any benefit to anyone but themselves.

My mom used to make sure we went swimming after the 'gamma globulin' butt shots, which were known to be painful, a pain remediated by exercise..I remember swimming the the  pool at the residence of the US Ambassador to Athens, just our family, after the gamma globulin shot... There was a lovely pistachio tree producing pistachios, at the pool..You can eat them when they are green, even! But the shot card - what is the big deal??

(Yes I am 32 and healthy with no medical problems, but my 13yr old daughter has 4 chronic diseases including an autoimmune and can't get a shot because of her age. I saw a chance to keep her a little more safe so I took it.) Aside from that, everyone laughed at me when I told them that one day we won't be able to go into a Walmart without that stupid little covid shot card. They laughed and said I was acting like a typical conspiracy theorist, conservative woman. Well... here we are talking about covid passports."

2021-04-07 14:11,"When I entered graduate school at the University of Virginia, I was required to get several vaccinations before being allowed to attend classes. Among these was a smallpox vaccination, which I had had as a child and for which I had a prominent scar as proof. No matter. I had to have another, which left a second prominent scar. I don’t think my freedom was at all compromised by the University’s requirement because I was completely free to leave the school if I had refused the shots.

My attitude concerning coronavirus vaccination passports has been shaped by this experience: People are free to refuse the vaccine, but they need to accept denial of employment, education, travel, or other desirables as a consequence."
2021-04-07 13:59,"You notice right away, we also have the same people so vehemently espousing a vaccine passport also stipulating the exceptions, like for people who are immune-compromised.  I thought our public health policies were based on science and safety?  The Covid virus doesn't care whether or not people are immune-compromised and such individuals could still spread the virus if they don't have the vaccine.  If Joe Blow from Red-State USA can't get on a plane without a vaccine, why should somebody who is immune-compromised be able to do so?  Covid doesn't care about ""ethics"" or ""discrimination.""  It's a virus with zero ethics.  As usual, double-standards and exceptions built-into ever more powerful and intrusive policies undermine true equality and effective policies.  I thought we were following ""science,' not philosophy class ethics."

Case closed. Wear a mask, get the jab, let’s get on with our lives."

2021-04-07 14:04,"No shirt, no shoes, no vax, no service.

As to the rest of us, it is an intrusion on our right to prevent the documentation of our decision to get properly vaccinated, in order to stay healthy, to protect the health of others, and to function freely in our communities as a consequence of our decisions.

I find the conservative position on this matter downright bizarre, nothing more than an effort the debase the American health standard to its lowest common denominator. If vaccination passports constitute an infringement on the rights of those who refuse to protect themselves, then it is they who are infringing on their own rights.

Don't infringe on my rights to justify your own dull recalcitrance."

Verification of all sorts of aspects of our society are already required. Verification of our societal responsibilities--having a driver's license and proof of insurance aren't for our own good. They are to protect others. If these people want to protest something, do it with driver's licenses--they are very expensive and I could spend that money on something else that I could enjoy!"

There is no religion that holds you cannot be vaccinated against a life-threatening disease and thereby risk infecting and killing others. Some in the Jewish community tried that here and, once COVID ravaged the community, the Rabbis corrected them.

I think it SHOULD be mandated. But, if not, let's start creating separate sections/places for those who are not vaccinated and they can swap virus variants with one another if they choose.

We recently saw a resurgence of measles because of so many exemptions. And then, finally, eliminated all but valid/verified medical exemptions. COVID is a virulent killer. Well over 550,000 dead and we're nowhere near the end of the variants.

Vaccines are safe and effective. There is no key freedom at stake here, even for Texans or Floridians."

Vaccine passports are far more important than driver's licenses and insurance.  Car accidents can kill or injure people, but they are not contagious.  They cannot spread across the country, killing or disabling people who are nowhere near the accident site.  And they can't shut down the economy.

For people who can't get vaccinated because of sincerely held religious beliefs or medical conditions, they should be allowed to substitute regular negative COVID-19 tests.  But even they need the rest of us to be vaccinated so that they can be protected by herd immunity."
2021-04-07 13:56,"As Republicans are insistent on the use of a photo ID as proof that an individual has registered to vote, there is no small degree of irony that they are so opposed to a vaccine passport as a government intrusion into our personal lives. You cannot have it both ways."
2021-04-07 14:25,"For those of us with medical reason not to vaccinate with the Covid vaccine, being excluded from travel and work based on our status is alarming. I had a medical exclusion to the smallpox vaccine that was still causing problems for me in 1970, when the last case of smallpox in the U.S. was in 1947. Covid is not smallpox, yellow fever, or Ebola. For some demographics, the fatality rate for Covid is 0.001% - that's one in one-hundred thousand cases. 

The vaccine passport is not scientifically warranted or ethically justifiable. The vaccinated still can contract and transmit the virus and break-through cases requiring hospitalization are already being seen. The vaccine passport is a scapegoating mechanism. Lack of a 'Vaccine Passport' will provoke violence. 

We have failed to learn the lessons of history such as when 1) West Coast Japanese were interred because of fear some them might be disloyal and 2) Jews were forced to wear a Star of David in order to make it easier to avoid them."

It is absolutely exhausting to live in a country with political party that turns any practical issue into a fight to the death over some fantastical idea of “freedom”.

I guess my major issue is that at that point, who are we really protecting? If you've done your societal duty and gotten the vaccine, you're already protected. And if you haven't, at that point it's your own personal responsibility if you get sick. The decision to require a vaccine passport seems to me like a ploy to pressure people into making a particular decision rather than a strategy to actually protect people. And that's fine, businesses have the right to do that, but please call it what it is."
2021-04-07 14:17,"Vaccination passports would not be necessary if people practiced prevention medicine. Benjamin Franklin said ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" Also, the Declaration of Independence guarantees us ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" Well, it used to, but it doesn't anymore, the coronavirus has seen to that. Besides vaccinations can't be the answer because more and more people are being vaccinated every day but we are being told that the virus is getting worse not better, it should be the other way around since more and more people are being vaccinated. But, thinking seems to be a lost art these days, just obey the government and you will be just fine, don't think for yourself."
2021-04-07 14:28,Of course a vaccine passport makes sense.  Of course a vaccine passport will be another harmful cultural war.  Of course I’ll choose to reward any business that requires one.
2021-04-07 14:31,"When I got my first shot at Walgreens they ca gave me a card with my personal info on it and listed the date, time and versions of the vaccine that they gave me. this morning I'll take the card with me when I get my second shot.  That should be enough proof that I receive both shots. 

As a school child I had to show proof of being vaccinated for the childhood disease before I was allowed in school.   Showing proof of vaccination before getting on mass trasit is a no brainer."
2021-04-07 14:32,"Welcome to the 20th and 21st century. Man/Woman up. These ""passports"" are nothing new. During and after my military service I received many vaccines and inoculations. I carried multiple medical ""passports"". It is not your choice when a country is experiencing an outbreak of Yellow Fever or where Typhoid is prevalent. It will not your choice if a country bars you from entry. So take medicines and take measures to keep you and your family/fellow humans safe and avoid being an intentional source of infection. There is a business opportunity for quarantine centers and technologies but I expect the Risk/Profit ratio will not be favorable."
2021-04-07 14:05,"Vaccine passports are not desirable for most, but given the politically charge state of the country, I concede, they are necessary.

And, to those who will most likely make the most noise against such, you can thank our previous president and those of his ilk who have decried most recommended health safety issues and, while claiming to have made vaccine available, do not promote its application and/or advise against science."
2021-04-07 14:19,"One immediate problem out the gate is — I don’t think the CDC and federal and state governments considered this early enough. I, as 59 y.o., on my way to get second shot in 30 minutes in Texas. I signed up without documentation. But I did provide driver’s license at initial inoculation. Not certain ID is absolutely required because that would shut out some eligible and needed recipients. Next, I got a paper index card with a CDC header; the assistant put a sticker on it. March 17 - Pfizer dose 1. Otherwise, the card was BLANK. I could hand write any person’s name, my own or someone else’s. So the integrity of the system of proof is moot. It is as if I put my name on my license after I depart DMV. Forgeries will be simple. There won’t be a data base which is accessible to third parties to validate due to HIPPA laws. In effect, it will be a flawed passport system build on a house of CDC paper cards and stickers and self filled information fields."
2021-04-07 14:23,"This article does this issue disservice by conflating two issues--a ""passport"" for elective activities like travel, and requiring kids to be vaccinated to attend school.  Although the vaccine is a wonder (I've received mine), it's only a few months old, and we do not know of any issues it may have, save for those identified by AstraZeneca.  Want to take a trip to Fiji?  Sure--show me your vaccine passport.  But why require my ten year-old to take this vaccine, when they are at nearly zero risk from this virus, when there has not been enough time to study any potential effects on children?  I'm still stinging from the teacher's unions anti-science closure of schools, so I'm not particularly sympathetic to their views on this issue."
2021-04-07 14:25,"While strategizing and planning makes sense, actual implementation of such “passports” seems somehow premature to me. This isn’t about should or shouldn’t people get vaccinated—of course they should. Or do employers have a right to require vaccination—I think they do. But we don’t even really know how long these immunizations are good for. What will be the expiration dates on these “passports?” Some of these implementations make the assumption that everyone has a smart phone or could figure out how to get digital proof onto the smart phone they have—have they never seen the Dr. Rick Progressive commercials? It would seem so much easier to simply stick with universal mask wearing until vaccinations reach herd immunity level. I mean, it’s not as if people haven’t been going to movies, going shopping, and flying domestically all this time. They just do it with masks on and they are about as safe as if they had been vaccinated. I fear a big rigamarole over this topic, then more scientific discovery around the vaccines, then needing to amend or start over and all that just erodes people’s faith in science. I’d prefer we just stick with masks and a big push to get get everyone vaccinated and worry about proof requirements when we are further along."
2021-04-07 14:28,"Gov. Ron DeSantis, by issuing an executive order on Friday prohibiting businesses from requiring patrons or customers to show vaccine documentation, or risk losing grants or contracts is nothing short of strong arming citizens to see if their way, or else."
2021-04-07 13:56,"I agree with showing proof of vaccination, especially if it gets us to our new normal. The idea of a vaccination passport is basically ""pay-to-play, and conservative (Read GQP) politicians think that's a great idea when it comes to Citizens United...    So, what's the problem?"
2021-04-07 14:17,"Aren’t restaurants inspected, and required to post the certificate, to demonstrate that they are safe and clean? If they can’t require that everyone in their confined space has taken reasonable steps to make sure they are COVID free then the restaurant can no longer claim to be “safe” and that will reduce their business.
So the executive orders have a material negative impact. Are the Republican governors planning to compensate them?"
2021-04-07 14:37,"No shirt, no shoes, no vaccine, no service.

Seems like a logical conclusion to the worst pandemic in over a century.

So whose against this common sense requirement?

Oh, that’s right, the anti-maskers and folks that impede defeating the pandemic; all the more reason for the vaccine passports.

When I enter an establishment, concert venue, or board a plane, I want the peace of mind of knowing that everyone there has been vaccinated; this is the freedom I will fight for."
2021-04-07 14:01,"“But the idea is raising charged legal and ethical questions: Can businesses require employees or customers to provide proof — digital or otherwise — that they have been vaccinated when the coronavirus vaccine is ostensibly voluntary?”

My job requires me to drive. So, even though getting a driver’s license is ostensibly voluntary, I’m required to submit proof to my employer that I have one. 

My job requires a college degree. So, even though going to college is ostensibly voluntary, I’m required to agree to a background check that can verify for my employer that I graduated. 

If I was skeptical about higher education or the DMV, and was concerned that they might put a microchip in my driver’s license or infect me with liberal propaganda at the university, I would be free to forego education and the driver’s test. 

But I’d have to live with the consequences."
2021-04-07 14:04,"It seems like many commenters here are cheering on the idea of using Covid-19 vaccine passports as a cudgel to try and force others to get the vaccine. This is a fool's errand, of course, because the vaccine passport is being left up to private businesses, not the US government. Many businesses won't require a passport for fear of losing customers. If the majority of Americans are vaccinated, herd immunity, not vaccine passports, will protect you. 
Also, it's remarkable how people - Democrats included - fall over themselves to race to their respective political corners with any new major issue in the US today without any critical thinking or analysis."
2021-04-07 14:30,"There are always trade offs in our doing anything from crossing the road to dealing with China — in our personal, community and national lives. The pros and cons are seldom neatly divided and so decisions such as whether to have vaccination identification are full of both. Assessment of the benefits and risks is required — and that comes down to understanding and then simple arithmetic. Go with the choice where the benefits outweigh the downsides and then manage both to best and least effects. 

All I have said above is invalid should we bunk reality, carry alternative agendas and hold out for the ideal — that only prevent us from moving forward."
2021-04-07 14:31,"In 1777 George Washington made the decision to vaccinate all new recruits to the Continental Army with smallpox, and during the Valley Forge winter, vaccinated all troops in the encampment who had not had the disease. How is it that the impact of scientific thinking and the understanding of the balance of risk and benefit of vaccination was more mature over 240 years ago than it is now?"
2021-04-07 14:32,"People need to be accountable for their decisions.  While the government should not require people to take a vaccine, the unvaccinated have to understand that for the sake of the greater good, their movement may be restricted.  The choice is theirs.  Life is full of tough decisions."
2021-04-07 14:35,"When you read Jacobson v. Massachusetts  carefully two facts emerge.

Mr. Jacobson was never required to get a vaccination, nor were any of his basic constitutional rights removed. He was simply fined, and while that was significant, he didn't forfeit any other basic rights.

Jacobson was also never represented by counsel at his trial. As a result, the state paraded Boston's medical gentry into court all extolling the virus of the smallpox vaccine.

Jacobson only had his own testimony to counter them. He had previously been vaccinated and had a terrible reaction to the shot. He was asking to avoid future risk and potential harm.

The court concluded that Jacobson's experience was not ""medical science"" and so his fine for refusing to comply with the law was upheld.

But the court never held that the state had a free had in requiring vaccination. It had to be established that there was a public necessity and that it was based on sound science.

That was easy for the state to prove in 1905 against a lay person. But we have never had an open debate, much less testimony under oath establishing the science or the methods of our current Covid response.

The public policy response to this ""novel' virus has been one size fits all. And that one size has been an experimental vaccine.

If other treatments are equally effective does the state have a compelling interest in requiring a vaccine?

I think not. This is a simply issue of fundamental rights, not party affiliation."
2021-04-07 14:34,"If people chose to get vaccinated, that's fine! However, one's right to participate in society should never, under any circumstances, be dependent on their willingness to take any pharmaceutical product, including vaccines. 

If people for some bizarre reason don't feel comfortable being in close proximity to other who have not proven they have been vaccinated, then those people have every right to make the choice to modify their behavior and avoid crowds, wear a mask etc. It is up to those people, not the ones who chose not to take an unnecessary vaccine, who need to adjust. The idea that somehow those who chose not to get vaccinated should be excluded from society is terrifying and borderline insane to me.

I've been a life long Democrat and certainly don't think COVID is a hoax, but the radical alterations to society and extreme risk aversion that by many Democrats and other on the left of the political spectrum are embarrassing is really scary and has me rethinking my political alliances for the first time in decades."
2021-04-07 14:47,"As long as a paper version is acceptable, I, one of the few who don't own a smart phone, am on board. Plus, knowing a cruise ship, hotel, restaurant and other venues require vaccination proof will give me peace of mind. And given what's transpired, with Covid, couldn't we all use that?"
2021-04-07 14:33,"Lots of great and sensible comments below, so allI will say is....it’s legal, it’s sensible, any one screaming Liberty or religious reasons is stupid, and of course the feds should drive a common system.

I can still vividly recall the line I stood in as a child in the mid-50s awaiting the newly developed Salk vaccine for the devastatingly prevalent disease, polio. We were given no choice in the matter...we simply lined up and received our injections. And the result? Today polio has been eliminated in a ll bu the most remote and intransigently resistant villages that rail against vaccines. There is no question that the Salk (later, the Sabin) vaccine save countless people from either crippling disabilities or death. None of these vaccines had the benefit of years and years of trials. And yet, here we are, decades after appreciating the inestimable benefit of these vaccines, talking about whether it is OK to require the latest medical development in our fight against this terrible pandemic. Yes. it is more than OK...it is a necessity."

2021-04-07 14:56,"i am pro-science, pro-wearing masks, pro-vaccination in general.

but the concept of a ""vaccine passport"" is worrisome to me. i worry it will further the divide between the haves and have-nots. 

not everyone has a smart phone, and even of those who do, not everyone is savvy enough to download an app, upload their information, and carry it around with them (i know, a wild idea for those under 40). many people who want vaccines still do not qualify for them. then there are people who have legitimate reasons to be wary of the vaccine, such as pregnant women and those with allergies to ingredients used in the vaccine (uncommon, but it happens). 

i also worry about the ramifications globally. what about nation-less people? what about the less wealthy countries? when the wealthy countries ""go back to normal"", what about the non-wealthy ones? there's no incentive to give vaccines to poorer nations if we use a ""vaccine passport"" to let the global wealthy (which includes most americans) go on with life while excluding those who do not have access to the vaccine. 

and then of course, what about all the people who are normally pro-vaccination but are hesitant about this vaccine because of the speed in which it was created and the never-been used before technology that made it possible? there's no long term studies, because that's simply impossible, and the hesitation, while frustrating to many, is valid. 

TL;DR: this is going to worsen inequality, especially globally."
2021-04-07 14:58,"In a few months we will have herd immunity. Anyone who wants a vaccine will easily get one. What purpose will these passports serve besides continued bureaucratic control?

They can require one wears shirt and shoes - or no service. These are private companies and can't discriminate by race, religion or sometime sexual orientation but they can have ""ground rules"" for customers in their private facilities. A Starbucks isn't a public place, its is privately owned. Same with DD, McD's or and airline and any other form of transportation where one pays a fee. Same with schools or say for the past 150 years or so (The first state law mandating vaccination was enacted in Massachusetts in 1809; in 1855, Massachusetts became the first state to enact a school vaccination requirement.) And foreign travel for years . So require the proof, if people don't want to be vaccinated, great - stay home."
2021-04-07 15:04,"The first thing I did after getting vaccinated (J&J) was take a photo of my COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card and send it out to my family/friends.  I did it while waiting the 15 minutes to see if I developed any allergic reaction to the shot.  So I shared my card with my little corner of the world before I even set foot outside the CVS.

What they are really scared of is that their base ,which has incessantly been brainwashed against a vaccine for a ""hoax of a virus"" by Trump and the right wing media, will have a really hard time navigating everyday life without "" a vaccine passport"", maybe including voting for them .

My thoughts and advice after a year of change, loss, transformation: 

I needed to stop, reframe, and go inward and get quiet. 

Look at my own health. Listen to my body (if I feel pain- where is it coming from?). 
 Wake up my mind, my heart, and body and look at my diet of nutrition, diet of the news I consume, my daily life and practice, and my past and what I hold within my body which could be toxic and need to release, rest and sleep. Practices and rituals that can keep me grounded, sometimes that is even just a quiet walk through the Park and showing my son how the Earth is starting to bloom into Spring. I am Grateful, I am humble - this is what I have right now. These are simple things. But they are resources we all have. 
What is the most important of all - is that we all should feel empowered within ourselves. We are the source of wisdom. I was not taught to listen or to trust my intuition by my parents or school settings. With the great care, I have taken of my body and my mind in this past year where I have followed every rule set during the pandemic, my questions are:
What is actually in these vaccines?
Will the vaccine affect my longterm immunity?
Will it it be required to take booster shots every year?"
2021-04-07 14:58,"I went to a doctor yesterday. Along with temperature check and questions about Covid exposure, they asked if I was vaccinated (I was). The next patient waltzed up with a useless cloth bandana for a mask. Not only was he not vaccinated, he launched into an argument about how the mRNA vaccines weren’t really vaccines at all and that they messed with the DNA. With all of this ignorance and irresponsibility, he received treatment by a highly renowned specialist in my area. At some point, I hope that people who insist on endangering others will be refused access to medical care, airlines, and a myriad of other services and businesses which require personal contact. Their choice."
2021-04-07 14:42,"As somebody who has to look at official documents and I.D.'s these Covid vaccination cards seem very easy to forge. I have seen comments that say they have taken a photo of theirs and will rely on it to use as proof of vaccination. Somebody even said they had a shirt made with an image of the card. I am curious why these seem so flimsy? The size is hard to fit in your wallet unless it is folded is another thing.  I can't help but think there will be or already is a black market for these ""passports"". Is anything being done to make them harder to forge?"

Because its not personal, its not private, its public by its very nature. If you want to live in a society, you must participate in the society's best interest. There is a choice. You can leave.

I hope that app developers will take into consideration situations like my own.  I received my first Pfizer dose in a facility run by New York State and my second from a CVS Pharmacy in Miami Beach.  Both were recorded on a white card provided by New York.   I would like to have a more reliable proof of vaccination for upcoming European Travel plans in September.

Conservatives will support it if it contains all the truthful info necessary to run a modern society.

Until they do, they are endangering public safety by interfering with a measure that's necessary to control the spread of a deadly disease.

The only reasonable explanation is decisions are based on political pandering at the cost of lives?"

2021-04-07 15:26,"Vaccine passports don't have to be the next divide. The vaccine is free to all. Get vaccinated, and then get a document proving it. Everyone gets one and there is no divide. It could not be simpler. As to the faux ""privacy"" concerns, those are nonsense too. The system or database should just hold basic identifying information about the person, and about their vaccination. It doesn't need to hold other medical information, credit card numbers, etc. No more, and in fact a lot less, than is currently held by the government for driver's licenses. People should have the option of getting a non-digital form of proof, e.g., a piece of paper, perhaps with a QR code that could be read digitally if necessary."
2021-04-07 15:27,"Vaccine passports ought to give those refusing the shots incentive to get them.  All it might take is being refused admission to a favorite event.  Then minds can change from ideological to practical.

2021-04-07 15:28,I think government would be wise to stay well away from this already politicized issue. Businesses will be in a lose-lose situation and will have to somehow calculate which course of action will cause the least loss of business and the lowest level of legal exposure.

This was a lot of rigaramol to go through, but I wanted to be with my husband and I have been brought up to respect travel and the rights and responsibilities that go along with the privilege of having a passport. We are planning a trip to Kenya in the next couple of years and I fully expect my husband and me to have to get vaccines for that and a child-appropriate one for our daughter. This has been happening for years - it is nothing new and the uproar against it is very much over the top. I am going to need one to get home to Australia to see my family. Many peoples' lives (personal and professional) straddle the globe now and this might be one step towards making it easier to build those lives and stay connected to our jobs and our families and friends."
2021-04-07 15:30,"I am absolutely pro-vaccine but my big issue is with being required to tell my employer when I have been vaccinated. 

Being vaccinated does not mean we are magically absolved from getting the virus- the chances are significantly lower, but it is still possible, especially if maintaining precautions lapse.  

I work for a big name in life sciences. Reopening our workplace is a horror show. If you’re vaccinated, you must go into the office, but the precautions are just not being taken seriously.  

As a low earning person in a junior position it has been proven time and time again throughout the pandemic that my life is not valuable with the way our workplace operates.  And I am not sharing my vaccination status with anyone in my workplace because of that."
2021-04-07 15:31,"Eye roll here. Is requiring a drivers license in order to operate a vehicle on public thoroughfares an invasion of privacy? It’s in a government data base. Why then should any entity, public or private, be prevented from requiring proof of vaccination as a means of insuring the safety of customers, employees or people utilizing a physical space. 

This is an argument of distraction from more important things that government should be paying attention to."

Everyone know all about you already: Google and Facebook already know more about you than a Soviet agency could have dreamed; Your cell phone company tracks you; Your internet provider scans your internet usage to send you “targeted advertising”; hackers have posted your information for sale on dark webs many, many times after DoD, Experian, Yahoo, and other hacks; credit card companies know what you buy, take their 2-6% cut, and then sell that info; and most people walk around giving away personally identifying information (PII) every day in crowded rooms or inline at the cash register (“What’s your phone number for our rewards program?”)."
2021-04-07 14:12,“Intrusion into privacy”—-that’s special for the Republicans to say about vaccine passports! Never mind that they almost outlaw legal abortions; restrict voting; and are against people joining any aspect of the Affordable Care Act.  E’nuf said
2021-04-07 15:42,"I believe the objection to the vaccine passport is because those on the right are not getting vaccinated. This is not a privacy issue. It's political.

Could their ever have been a more anti-American party than the current republicans. It is as if putin were being allowed to run our government simultaneously with his control of Russia."
2021-04-07 15:41,"Whatever this country decides to do, other countries (those that have less concern that anti-sciencers will rise up with pitchforks) will more likely require proof of vaccination to enter. Good. I suppose Europe will be free of anti-science Americans for a while. Myself, I’m so ready to go back to the EU and will gladly show my proof of vaccination."
2021-04-07 15:35,"I feel like every pandemic movie dramatically underestimates the number of people who would be on ""Team Virus."" It's no surprise that a large number of people won't get vaccinated; the US has a long and proud tradition tradition of belligerent anti-scientific sentiment. But the aggressive attempts to prevent other people from taking reasonable mitigation steps, i.e., private businesses requiring masks and proof of vaccination? That's chutzpah!"

No to gun legislation that would keep us safer. No to a stimulus bill that helps many of us stay afloat. No to immigration reform. No to a federal wage boost that would help many of us live a better life. No to an effort to discover why the Capitol was ransacked in January. No to infrastructure spending that would help us have safer roads and bridges and now no to proof of being vaccinated.

Now we are face to face with the greatest risk to everyone's health across the globe. We are all in this together. Regardless of somebody's personal beliefs it is imperative that everyone gets vaccinations not just to protect themselves but also to protect everyone from them. That is the best way to defeat Covid. I'm fully in favor of Vac  passports and mandatory mask wearing regulations.
For the life of me, and my loved one's I can't understand why others are not. It is ignorance and selfishness to the 9th degree."
2021-04-07 15:32,"I am not staunchly opposed to this idea by any means, but I do have some hesitations.  Isn't it true that we don't know if vaccinated individuals can still contract the virus and transmit it to others?  The science just doesn't seem to be there yet.  So what is the purpose of this?"
2021-04-07 15:34,"Does no one else see a problem with compulsory vaccination passports under penalty being banned from society for a voluntary vaccine? What's to stop the government from drumming up any old ""public health crisis"", a subsequent vaccine (paid for by tax payers and making big pharma even bigger), or even some nefarious injection required by all citizens to their detriment? 

And to all those saying, ""join the cause, there's no problem here. If you don't like it, leave."" - leave for where? If it becomes compulsory to get vaccinated or you cannot be a contributing member of society, but you don't agree with this gross intrusion into personal autonomy and freedom, why do you expect us to simply renounce our citizenship?

Of course, there are those whose immune system might be compromised with vaccines.

My valid NM driver's license is a plasticized photo-ID card with an embedded hologram, and my valid passport is a paper booklet which includes a plasticized photo-ID page with an arc of hologram stars running through the photo.  With my driver's license I can travel the USA, and with my passport I can travel the world.  So why wouldn't a plasticized photo-ID card similar to a driver's license be good enough as proof of my Covid-19 vaccination?  New Mexico is a relatively poor state, and it has large mountainous areas where there is no cell phone service.  As a result, many New Mexican's either can't afford a cell phone, or can't get cell phone service where they live.  What are you going to do with them?  A validated plasticized photo-ID card proving Covid-19 vaccination can do the job just fine."

Retailers are not going to pay people to stand at the entrances to check vaccine credentials, nor do they want to hire rent-a-cops to deal with the public meltdowns when someone is denied entrance. They do not want this. 

No retailer will want to deal with the cost of deploying the systems or pay for extra people to manage it. 

Will college student want an app, probably. Will airlines as for foreign travel, more than likely.

2021-04-07 15:45,"Of course the party that anoints itself a s the party of ""personal responsibility"" is the first to toss any semblance of personal responsibility into the the toilet.   You can't have freedom without responsibility because you can't be free without having a choice. And when you choose between one thing and another you are now responsible for the ramifications of your actions. In this case, infecting others and prolonging a scourge we ALL suffer with.

So let them be responsible in the real sense of the word. For instance, every time there is a needless outbreak in a school that makes the school shut down they can start by compensating the parents that are victimized by their freedom. They can now be free to act and take personal responsibility for my, and others, losses.

This is another conspiracy theory, and another clash of people who want it both ways, desiring to be separate and yet enjoying all the privileges of being part of a huge modern society. Being intolerant and “protecting” ourselves from each other rather than a virus will continue to be an issue until we begin to regard all of us as part of who we are as a people. 
   It has been pointed out in other comments that mass inoculations have been with us since the ‘50s. So this isn’t just about to vaccinate or not. This is another issue about separation and division between people who seem to pose a threat of change and those unwilling to see the past end. The fact that certain politicians are pandering to their constituents by fighting for their “right” to be separate from the community of humans they are a part of is a desperate attempt to stay employed in a world that is changing and seemingly leaving others behind."

Covid and the variants are still spreading and unless everyone in those seats had been vaccinated, then that was one big, super-spreader event. It even made me uncomfortable seeing that it was a Canadian team playing there, it all seemed so wrong.

Ubiquitous cameras on our phones, porches, and in public are always recording, and that data is preservable forever. Facial recognition software (getting better and more accessible all the time) was already enabling anyone, especially the US government, to determine who is where, and when.

These police powers applied to smallpox that had a death rate of 30% and left the majority of survivors scarred. I'll pay a $5 fine, annually if I must, if the powers that be refuse to accept my medical exemption letter, but the Covid death rate in the US is hovering around 1% overall."

You can spend your time and effort looking up and trying to avoid all the governmental data bases that already exist.  

You wouldn't have to show proof of vaccination if only you  didn't fly or attend a baseball came or go to the movies.  OR you could spend the time and money to get a rapid test before doing any of those things.  

BUT, if you refuse to show that you've been vaccinated or tested negative, you are denying everyone else the means to protect themselves from you.  And you are denying society a reasonable way to get back to normal.  Yours is not the only ""freedom"" that matters."

The Milgram Shock experiment found that people will shock other people to death if told that it is necessary to do so by authority.  

""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."" 

There is already a militarized police surveillance state in place - does that make you feel safer?  How much safety do you need?  

Those who are in favor of vaxxing everyone right now to keep themselves ""safe"" from a  virus with a case fatality rate slightly worse than the flu are making policy level judgements that will create a reality Far from normal.

2021-04-07 16:06,"The ""Republican States"" and ""Libertarians"" are whining like the bunch of spoiled brats in ""Lord of the Flies"". I suggest public safety over-ride this bunch in a simple way:

Restaurant businesses that serve the public may provide a ""Vaccinated Section"" in their establishments for patrons who may dine unmasked and with limited social distancing.  The same business must also provide an ""Unvaccinated Section"" with strict social distancing and Covid measures. The patron can choose their section according to their proof or lack of proof of vaccination. 

""No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service"" Covid Style.

For businesses such as department stores, ""Set-aside shopping hours"" for vaccinated and unvaccinated patrons.  Same as was done for elderly shopping hours last year.

This will protect the rights of both groups.

As more and more people get vaccinated, the shopping and dining of non-vaccinated persons will become cumbersome but not impossible. And, when the Herd Immunity is finally reached, we can drop the whole issue until the next pandemic."
2021-04-07 16:12,"In my early teens I had an opportunity to travel abroad but before I could go I had to get a passport and I had to get vaccinated for smallpox as did anyone who wanted to leave America.

Smallpox is no longer the issue today that it was specifically because of the measures that were taken. Why is a COVID-19 vaccination and proof of getting one any different."

2021-04-07 16:01,"The Jacobson decision from the 1005 Supreme Court addresses the underlying philosophy quite well: ""The liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint. There are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good. On any other basis organized society could not exist with safety to its members. Society based on the rule that each one is a law unto himself would soon be confronted with disorder and anarchy. Real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own, whether in respect of his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be done to others. The court has more than once recognized it as a fundamental principle that persons and property are subjected to all kinds of restraints and burdens, in order to secure the general comfort, health, and prosperity of the state; of the perfect right of the legislature to do which no question ever was, or upon acknowledged general principles ever can be made, so far as natural persons are concerned.""

- Not only do I not I have a problem with a vaccine passport, but I've been expecting one, and I WANT one.
- In a recent survey my company conducted to prepare for our eventual return to our offices, I stated that I have no desire to work among unvaccinated individuals (nor do I wish to fly until all passengers and flight crews must present proof of vaccination).

I'm usually big on personal liberties, and I suppose people have the right to remain unvaxed. But at such time (and that moment is upon us) that vaccines are available to all of us, it will also be the right of those of us who have made the prudent decision, for ourselves and society as a whole, to decline to be in the presence of those who willfully have not.

Remaining unvaccinated should come at the cost of mixing freely with those of us who are vaccinated. Vaccination protects everyone, and declining vaccination imperils everyone."
2021-04-07 16:27,"I agree with the many commentators pointing out the hypocrisy of the Republican approach to voter identification and the rights of private businesses to refuse service, as compared with this public health measure.  There is a bad faith argument underpinning much of the discussion, to be sure.

But those of us on the left shouldn't pretend that these measures won't be capitalized upon by private technological interests, deepening already grave inequalities in our society that result from uneven access to such technology.  It is overly-simplistic to ignore this possibility by making historical comparisons, all of which didn't feature devices connected to the world in the pockets of millions.  

Similarly, a child's one time enrollment in school or an occasional trip abroad do not compare in scale and volume to the number of transactions per day that would be necessary to validate general public participation in the economy.  That, and the level of trust needed for such validation combine to make technological solutions impossible to ignore, and all the more likely to be privatized.

Let's not allow our frustration with the pandemic, and with it's obstinate ""objectors"" on the right, make us to succumb to absolutist thinking on this issue.  There are good faith concerns that deserve discussion."

DeSantis that bans any Florida entity with a state contract from requiring passports is ludicrous.  What is next?  A ban on any Florida entity even ISSUING a vaccine passport? 

My wife and I (both over 65 and fully vaccinated) have a daughter, son in law and grandchildren living in Germany.  We yearn to see them in person and have made frequent flyer reservations for later this summer.  If  Germany or the EU requires a digital vaccine passport and we lived in Florida, such a requirement would prevent us from going.  

The Biden administration needs to make it safe and easy for individuals to show definite proof of vaccination when they are required to by businesses, universities or foreign governments."

Though NYTimes readers mostly don't inhabit this world, LOTS of us don't have smartphones. A COVID passport system is acceptable to me, but making it digital is problematic and will disproportionately affect the poor, those with low credit (who can't finance a smartphone), and the tech-averse."

Even Kantian ethicist recognize the categorical imperative that so long as people are “social animals” and require society and government to assure their individual and family safety , then in the face of existential threats to the society the welfare of that society has precedence over the particular right of an individual citizen to refuse to comply  with societal mandates.
 Examples in this report  of enforceable  mandates society  uniformly imposes on all its citizens in times of crisis simply reviews the historical evidence that protection of the entire society has moral precedence over  individuals  right to refuse to comply.

This is cynical politics at its worst and it is costing lives."

I don't have a problem with this once everyone has had a chance to get the vaccine. Considering the inequity of who is getting the vaccine, it isn't reasonable right now to have it be mandatory.  The second is the idea of a digital vaccine passport.  To me, that sounds like a big problem.  I have a problem with anything that requires that you have a smart phone.  It discriminates against those who don't have one.  There's also the issue of technology failing when you need it.  There are also too many options for which passport you are enrolled in.  I could see a situation where 3 different activities would require you to be enrolled with 3 different apps.

These are things we've agreed to because we know that they save lives and prevent accidents - which, if we feel the need to distill it to such, also improves the economic health of our country.  For as long as I've been alive, vaccines have been required to go to public schools - elementary, middle, high school, and college - because it protects those school communities.  Why do the very concepts of public health - much less a baseline understanding of the social contract - evade the GOP so completely?  People are trying to find ways to protect their communities.  We've been doing this for decades.  Does the GOP simply oppose anything and everything that acknowledges our interconnectedness as Americans?"

Now, because of the skepticism they have created, we are being exposed unnecessarily to life-threatening risks.

I am entitled to defend myself against a gun toting attacker.  A COVID carrier exhaling into my breathing space is equally dangerous -- indeed, more so, for if I am infected as a result, I will be unknowingly carrying that attack onto others.

It listed not only our smallpox vaccination but other vaccinations as well, including ones against diseases such as typhoid, yellow fever and the like. We carried it with us when we travelled, and there was a time we would be obliged to produce it for border control when traveling abroad. No one thought twice about it. No one saw it as an infringement on personal liberty. Rater, it seemed more an emblem of a godsend, a miracle, and a civic duty that all who could ought to fulfill.

It is not about privacy because there is no privacy in driving a car because the act itself is public.   You have to have a license as a demonstration of your competency (hopefully) to protect others.  And periodically, that competency must be re-demonstrated, and if it is not demonstrated, your license is voided.  

Seems pretty much analogous."

We’re left to our own devices as usual.

Well young people and children are at the same or lower risk of death from a SARS-CoV-2 infection than from influenza. This is not in dispute by CDC or others. The vaccines are under emergency use authorizations, are very effective at reducing symptoms and appear to reduce transmission. They are not free of side effects - there appears at least a certain risk of clotting disorders (as there is from COVID itself). The Pfizer and Moderna EUA submissions list various adverse events, mostly mild. FDA requires fully informed consent (as do the Nuremberg codes, the Helsinki Declaration). To vaccinate those where there is not a clear direct benefit, or use coercive, is frankly against basic medical ethics and against these codes, developed by well-thinking people.
It's not political, not left vs. right. Basic human rights were formerly a priority of 'left' politics. It's about proportionality and common sense. 
Watch the numbers in Texas.  They are falling steadily.  If having a packed stadium has no impact on them in 2-3 weeks, shouldn't we think again about risk?
COVID19 is  a deadly disease, with a defined high risk group. Perhaps the best approach is to follow the former evidence-based CDC and WHO pandemic guidance, and coercion, removal of basic liberties and rights over own body are not justified and not going to significantly improve outcomes?"

On what basis did people south of the Mason-Dixon line assert the right to force other human beings into involuntary servitude (including sexual servitude)?

Freedom in this country has been historically misdefined to mean ""whatever I wish, whatever I please"". If that includes committing genocide against the original Americans, destroying their food sources (the buffalo herds), carrying out forced marches to an ""Indian Territory"" a thousand miles from their homes (the Trail of Tears), and kidnapping people in Africa to labor at your will in perpetuity - so be it.

Man is a social being. Humans do not live independently of their interactions with others (particularly at both ends of the cycle of dependency - childhood and old age). Freedom is not doing whatever you want to. That's the ""crisis of the commons"" brewing where individual short sightedness and selfish behavior leads directly to the destruction of the social infrastructure (the shared fields and meadows in the Middle Ages) that we all depend on.

The GOP is leading us straight down the path of self-seeking annihilation and the Dems have offered meager defense... at best. The public must rise up against this crazed assault on present and future generations.

I want people to be nudged to being vaccinated even if they think Covid is a hoax, that they can't get Covid because they take a homeopathic concoction, that the vaccines implant microchips that communicate to Mark Zuckerberg through one's fillings, or that anything that profits Big Pharma must be shunned.

I want this because I don't want to have to keep wearing a mask to accommodate the conspiracy-minded and the just plain stupid.

I want this because the worst outbreak of the Brazil P.1 variant outside of Brazil is in British Columbia. Legions of truckers cross the border at Blaine, Wash., daily. They will inevitably bring P.1 into my part of the country, and the unvaccinated could cause P.1 to morph into something even worse.

I want this because if I break a bone while mountain biking I don't want the hospitals to be full of the muleheaded and the ignorant who refused to be vaccinated.

I am basically a libertarian, but my libertarianism stops when my insistence on my civil rights poses grave risks to others' health and to the U.S. economy. If I felt otherwise, I should move to another country and take my chances.

I was thrilled to be vaccinated. If others don't want to be, they can sit in the back of the plane, having had to purchase the entire row of seats and wear an N95 mask. Think of it as a tax on ideologues and ignoramuses."

People would need a way to know the health risk I posed, so they need me to show proof of vaccination or else to stay clear of them.
I have no right to put my neighbors' lives, health and businesses at risk. To claim that right in the name of 'free choice', 'liberty' or 'privacy' is simply insane.

I think vaccine passports (and limitations related to a lack thereof) are an excellent idea. We need as many people vaccinated as possible to prevent mutations from growing and spreading.

Because a group of anti-science and/or seriously misinformed people believes it is their “liberty” to refuse vaccination, impede herd immunity, and thereby infect innocent people and increase the odds of a vaccine-resistant variant with no consequence, the rest of us should have our freedoms and right to life, health, work, travel, and to enjoy group activities curtailed. If they don’t want the vaccine, they should live with the consequences of being refused admission to school, workplaces, mass transit, etc., and let the rest of us get back to an approximation of normal life.

Why is it that those on the right are always defending personal liberties that can result in the deaths of others, while not only denying other people's right to be protected from the expected results of those freedoms, but refusing to take any responsibility for those freedoms in the first place?

That's a lot of cherry picking going on. And when people cherry pick their moral positions, it means they don't really have one. It means their morality is expedient. And as far as I can tell, for Republicans, that moral expediency is always driven by cost, rather than any real moral or ethical conviction.

And where VA ""health providers"" receive performance pay and incentive pay for denying medications.

2021-04-03 19:38,"Public health experts are understandably frustrated, but humans cannot live a monastic life for very long. We’ve been thus far incapable (or unwilling, for political ends) of properly communicating relative risk. There is an extremely steep age gradient for hospitalizations and death from covid. In my county, 99% of the covid deaths were over 50 years old and 70 % were over 75.  Most seniors have already been vaccinated and everyone in this age cohort have access to the vaccine. This should have a dramatic impact on the burden of the disease. The mood in much of the country is shifting with covid  vaccinations rapidly becoming available to those that want it. Despite the variants, hospitalizations and deaths have been dropping in Texas, California, Florida, NY and most other states.  In 4-6 weeks, vaccines will be universally available even for younger people, for whom the risk of covid is similar to the seasonal flu. This reality needs to be factored into our strategy to balance public health concerns with societal needs."
2021-04-03 19:43,"This is exactly the wrong message we need right now, as articles like this discourage people from getting the vaccines. We should be emphasizing that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was tested on three continents, including in Brazil and South Africa, and found to be effective against variants. I understand that the number of cases is going back up, but the people most likely to die (those over 65) have been vaccinated so it's unlikely we will see the number of deaths we saw last year. Ignore the case numbers, watch the death numbers. if the latter keep going down, it's all good."
2021-04-03 19:55,"Another perspective:

The variants sets the U.S. back by no more than roughly 2 weeks on our road to herd immunity. Thus far, the vaccines in the U.S. perform astoundingly well against known variants, almost entirely eliminating risk of hospitalization death. If they had been tested only against the variants, the results would still be champagne-popping good news. What the variants mainly do is raise the virus' reproduction number (R0) - the people an infected person spreads it to - by a factor of roughly 1.4. If the R0 without variants was 1, with only variants it becomes 1.4. An R0 of 0.5 without variants becomes an R0 of 0.7, and so on.

In the short-term, common-sense precautions such as masking and avoiding big, dense indoor gatherings remain effective. In the long-run, the variants raise the percent of people who need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity by no more than 4-8% depending on their prevalence. We are achieving this level of coverage about two weeks."
2021-04-03 19:56,"My grandmother was born in 1900 and lived until 2005. Her memory was impressive up til 105. Her scope of opinions and thought were beyond the paradigm of contemporary concerns. She spoke often of the flu of 1918. Until 2020 I aligned those memories with her 2nd hand recollections of  the Civil War veterans she knew growing up--the stuff of history...nothing I would ever experience or obsess upon.

She was very clear about the flu. It mutated and was significantly more virulent the ""second time around."" She didn't use the words mutated, variant, or virulent. She described a flu that moved through town the first time ""while the boys were still in Europe"" and a second time once they were home.That second time around (the planet) the flu killed more boys than died in the war. 

Needless to say, I no longer treat her recollections as remote  thought. The flu rocked her soul because it decimated her small Nebraska township. And she talked about that ""second time around"" eighty years after the event...more often than WWI or WWII. Now I get it.

I am not a medical professional. I know more anti-government conspiracists than I do doctors; but i suspect if my grandmother's  version of variants (the second time around) is correct, more--much more--vaccine will need to be manufactured. And quickly! My conspiracist friends will go nuts. Big government will be required. Testing will be hurried--as it has been the first time around.

If they are under age 50, their chances of death are vanishingly small. If they have relatives over 65, those relatives are either already vaccinated or anti-vax. It looks like there are declining infection  rates, but it's because people under the weather for a few days have no reason to go tested to be told something that is irrelevant to their lives."

2021-04-03 20:09,"Well, that's encouraging that Fauci thinks a third round of the current vaccines will protect against the variants. That implies that those who are already vaccinated are currently not likely to get - or spread around - a variant of the infection; but that, a few months down the road, antibodies to variants might drop to the point of needing a booster.

I am reading a lot of contradictory messaging about the variants. Specifically, what is the likelihood that a vaccinated person can be infected by the variant, and therefore spread this infection to another unvaccinated person? One study says that the vaccine (I believe it was Pfizer) only produced very inferior numbers of antibodies to the variant in 40% of cases. However, this was under lab conditions. People are saying that, in real world conditions, actually the vaccines protect very well against variants, even with the lower level of antibodies. Apparently, some antibodies is good enough.

It would really be nice to know which is the case. My partner is vaccinated and has to go to work with kids every day, plus he takes the bus. So he is covered - even if he gets sick, he will not get a bad illness. But what about me? How likely is he to pass it to me? The new variants are accounting for the majority of illnesses where I am, so it would really be good to have some more reliable and consistent data about this."

Only a few months ago this paper was reporting the opinion of scientists that it would take years for variants to develop that would make current vaccines less effective.  Now we are told that has happened in a matter of months.  What next?  At some point many will come to the conclusion that the ""all clear"" will never sound and that they can either go back to their lives and deal with infection or commit to living with restrictions permanently.  Which do you think most people will choose?"
2021-04-03 20:27,"I'm curious why no one is discussing how the current variants of concern arose. Kristian Anderson, one of the scientists quoted here, has suggested on Twitter that all dangerous variants seem to have emerged in immunocompromised individuals. Why is this significant? Well, because measures taken to prevent population-level evolution will help, but not necessarily prevent intra-host evolution. Why don't we have more specific measures in place to monitor infections in 3.6% of the population whose immune systems are compromised? This kind of evolution happens in extremely prolonged infections. How many of these might occur in hospital settings? Are we going to wait, like we did with masks, before taking some common sense measures to reduce this risk?"
2021-04-03 20:28,"I do not like the variants because it’s hard to prevent them from taking hold.  

The only way we win is to vaccinate everyone now and to make sure that people with COVID-19 are isolated. Then we can have heard immunity."
2021-04-03 20:29,"""Keeping them at bay may require an annual shot, like the flu vaccine.""

My heart sinks when I read scientists saying that.

It's because we already know that the uptake for seasonal flu shots is fairly low (43 - 45% I believe) and if this stays with us and becomes accepted ""like the flu"" it suggests a similar low uptake for seasonal vaccinations...nothing near enough to produce herd immunity or stop life-impeding flare-ups of the virus and it's mutations.  People may become lackadaisical as they are for getting their flu shot, but given the nature of this disease, the consequences are worse."
2021-04-03 20:29,"A recent New England Journal of Medicine article reported that the Astra Zeneca vaccine was ineffective against mild or moderate Covid for the South African variant.

Bear in mind that moderate Covid is defined as some lung involvement, i.e. ""Covid pneumonia"".

2021-04-03 20:45,"I am shocked at the lack of a consistent Federal vaccination policy.  I still don't qualify to get the shot while I sit and read about the fear of these variants taking hold.  My state's policy is a hodgepodge of public and private at several inconsistent levels. The vaccine is the best option we have to stop this and we are lucky to have gotten one (or several) so soon. 

This pandemic is of historic significance.  It should be hard to avoid getting the shot.  But all the people I know who've received it either fudged the truth or drove hundreds of miles or both to get it.  The vaccination measures should be in our face everyday until all (who want it) get it.  Door to door. The leadership who were so onerous about lockdowns etc. seem to be missing now that we can really solve this."
2021-04-03 21:01,"Avoid unnecessary public outings and socially distance and wear a mask when such outings are necessary. This is a sacrifice, but not an unbearable one.

Such op-ed pieces provide us both entertainment and something to think about. Which is good. But they provide us neither authoritative advice nor information. Anyone with a serious interest always needs to dig into the matter more seriously."

I’ll be 75 in three weeks (still very healthy and active) and figure solitude is pretty much my life from now on.  I’m an introvert so the past year hadn’t been too awful for me, but now I’m feeling sad that my life’s remaining experiences will likely be so truncated.  Sad, but also grateful that I’m still among the living.  My heart goes out to young people, to those who have lost loved ones, jobs or homes.

2021-04-03 21:13,"Excellent report of the current situation.  The actual impact of new virus mutants is far from clear (just clear enough to be worrying), because timely sequence data are so scanty.  Can the CDC take the lead in setting up a systematic sampling protocol so that sequence data can be obtained for a reasonable fraction of new cases throughout the country?  The problem of insufficient data is national in scope, and so must the solution be too.  For the problem of follow-up booster shots or a modified vaccine, the infrastructure and expertise for vaccine delivery have developed rapidly over the past few months.  As long as we don’t dismantle the infrastructure and forget how to do it, additional shots shouldn’t be that difficult. As long as we get thorough reports every month or so!"
2021-04-03 21:16,"In a few months from now we will mostly be vaccinated and the actual threat from COVID will be reduced substantially, but I predict we will continue to see fear mongering articles that intend to extend the crisis far longer.

Those state and local localities that behaved recklessly shouldn’t have become entitled to Federal bailouts. Without such requirements, a state or locality would have an incentive to recklessly loosen public health restrictions and the associated exposure to Covid because, with Federal bailouts available if things go wrong, it does not bear the full financial costs of taking that risk, which is the very definition of moral hazard."
2021-04-03 21:52,"I am grateful for this article. I have been saying all along that the vaccine is absolutely needed, but it’s NOT a free pass.
I am totally in awe at the lack of understanding with regards to the numerous variants in general and the known decreased efficiency of the vaccines.  Stats are still out but it’s leaning toward decreased efficiency at some level.
Everyone is Covid fatigued and just want to move on. Cancel Covid.
The CDC and local government information is confusing. Why are we fully opened up if the variants are circulating and the vaccine may not be effective?  
In CT we are a mostly HIGH alert state, yet we fully reopened, thankfulky with mask mandates. We spend millions on consultants who, by the charts they provided, say we should be rolling back our phase, NOT opening up further.
CDC is saying if you are vaccinated you can be indoors unmasked with select others. Really? Do they have the stats on the efficacy of the vaccines against all the variants and the EEK mutations?  Am I missing something?
We are doomed to have another surge here in the US with all the holiday gatherings, Spring breakers, and flights/travel on the rise.  
Ignorance is bliss, until it isn’t."
2021-04-03 20:48,"When it comes to Florida, I see lots of comments about the issue being people ""bringing the virus"", so I guess that means tourism is to blame. Who opened Florida for tourism ?

From the broken record department, this virus could have been stopped in its tracks in 6 weeks. But nooooooo we prefer to make it last for years."
2021-04-03 21:01,"I find it beyond incredible that so many people refuse vaccinations, masks, distancing, hand washing and pleas from doctors not to travel. We have both received our first coronavirus shots and expect boosters on April 14. Some would rather risk getting the virus or passing it onto others. These same people are beyond selfish. My husband and I are over 70 years old and have multiple health issues. 

Since the pandemic, we have stayed home and went outside (all masked up) only if we must. Food is delivered and doctor visits are made as a telephone conference. We want to live and we resent those who do everything in their power to block out attempts to stay healthy.

I fear that unless there is a total lock down ordered by President Biden, we are doomed"

I shudder to think what would have happened if these very people had comprised the World War II generation. It's all but certain that this selfish lot would have insured that we would all be speaking German or Japanese today."
2021-04-03 21:09,"“New variants have continued to pop up — in California one week, in New York and Oregon the next. As they take root, these new versions of the coronavirus threaten to postpone an end to the pandemic.”

With this reality, why push to open schools and potentially expose more people to this deadly virus?  While infections among young children are currently low, scientists do not know if this will continue as COVID continues to mutate.  Why take this risk?"
2021-04-03 21:42,"Current members of the FDA have not been willing to recognize or candidly acknowledge that 20th century tweaked antibody vaccine platforms do not engage sufficient T-cell responses to continue to defeat this particular virus which is in a constant state of mutation to suppress being defeated.  Each new form is termed a variant as the spike protein changes shape which makes it increasingly more difficult for the antibody platforms to recognize the spike protein.

Scientists in the know realize engaging more T-cells is the 21th scientific answer to combating SARS-CoV-2, a 21st century coronavirus.

And the best way to engage T-cells is to deliver a targeted killer T-cell into the static nucleocapsid inside the spike protein. This revolutionary science is developed and under production now, but awaits FDA approval for testing, although it has been approved for human testing by a major hospital that has long been prominent in researching T-cells to fight cancer.

It is a shame that the authors are not interviewing ""experts"" who are either not candid or not aware of the right approach.  I have been vaccinated, and everyone should be, however, regrettably it is a stop gap to a permanent solution.  

 When this news is released in the near future, a public outcry to get the Gov on board  will be required, because big pharma  has  a stranglehold on the FDA and Gov grants that should be awarded to deserving R & D entities to defeat Covid."

Given the random way that variants evolve, we're fortunate that they have stayed close enough to the original coronavirus template that the morbidity, the infectiousness, and and the response to vaccines hasn't changed too dramatically. It might be one simple random change in the RNA that renders it a super-virus. Imagine the consequences if a new mutant strain was like Ebola in its morbidity AND it was immune to the antibodies produced by our current vaccines. The longer the current coronavirus and its derivatives spread, the more likely that a new variant might be devastatingly deadly. The comfort I take in being twice inoculated would disappear. Chaos..."
2021-04-03 22:01,"As this continuing epidemic takes more lives than all our wars, I despair to think of the number of citizens who refuse masks, group get togethers, vaccinations, acceptance of reality.

Leaders, at the moment sulky Republican governors and senators, don't want to cooperate, even refuse expansion of Medicaid and berate government as  untrustworthy. 
       Democratic President Biden's plan for  growth and new jobs  should inspire the do nothings, do nothing but complain, to rethink our future. The future is ours for the making."
2021-04-03 22:11,"Why does this article not mention even once that deaths have been declining by 30 percent every two weeks for the past two months? Even as cases have rise, deaths have continued to decline. 

Variants are concerning but ignoring the positive outcomes from people not actually dying from the disease increasingly more and more, makes this article seem misrepresentative. 

If the trends with deaths continue as they are now, there will be around 100 deaths per day on average in 2 months. That is quite significant and will in fact make a big difference in policy and people's behaviour."
2021-04-03 21:36,"I just can't imagine any doctor on TV ever saying it's okay to not wear a mask (or two) and social distance anymore. HIV resulted in condoms for life. It's quite likely COVID will result in masks and social distancing for life. Is this the ""new normal"" all the experts and politicians on TV were telling us about from the very beginning?"
2021-04-03 19:36,Did we really need experts to tell us that?
2021-04-03 22:22,"If people are to accept the limitations upon their normal behaviors to slow a pandemic, they must know that it’s necessary. Unfortunately, the facts that support the need are only considered truthful by people who are willing to listen with open minds. The rest simply do not take the disease seriously for all kinds of reasons. So they refuse to cooperate. But even the people who do listen are less informed than is needed.

When experts say the effectiveness of the vaccines are 70 percent or 95 percent, many people think that that means the vaccinated are protected, not that those percentages of the vaccinated are protected. When public officials say everyone will be vaccinated in two months, they think that the pandemic is going away. They ignore how many hundreds of millions of Americans, and billions of humans can still be infected in vast numbers. Until the spreading drops to very few, the virus is going to mutate and can become so novel that nothing we have fine can stop such a new form ravaging humanity, again."

Multiple variants may be circulating in the country at the same time, as is the case for common cold coronaviruses and influenza. Keeping them at bay may require an annual shot, like the flu vaccine.""

This is the bottom line. The virus is out there, and will continue to mutate. Some years there will be flare-ups, some years the ""Covid season"" might be milder. Some years vaccines will appear to have a greater/lesser effect."

I wore my mask inside and the place was crowded, with most people seated not wearing a mask. The manager was wearing one but he wasn’t turning anyone away. When I went outside to eat, even more people weren’t wearing one. Had they been vaccinated like me? Or have they all had it with the restrictions? The Times’ tracker said my county is at very high risk. I fear there’ll be darker times ahead."

Not sure I agree with Fauci 's comments - we play Whac-a-Mole every year with the flu vaccine.  The coronavirus has a proven track record with its ability to mutate independently, yet remain virulent and become even more contageous.  We need to use every bit of vaccine technology we have to beat this thing down."

Are we supposed to believe every person who claims to be an expert?"
2021-04-03 20:43,"We could simply do what we should have done long ago, and that is to wear a mask and stay the heck away from others.

1. The vaccines, depending on the number of doses you have gotten, are roughly about 80-90% effective.

2. Staying the heck away from people not in your small and isolated group of contacts is 100% effective, if no one cheats

3. Fouci said on TV the other day, if I heard him correctly that double masking was found to be about 90% effective

We have all of these tools that range from 80-100% protection. Combine the strategies and we are protected

If we were not rather dumb creatures (collectively) who can't seem to comprehend science and/or who do can't delay gratification (pass a simple marshmallow test) getting this under control would really be a no brainer

We have all the tools we need - just not the brains or will

Think about it for next time (and there will be a next time).  If a true stay at home order was passed for a sufficient period, and/or quality masks were 100% mandated as well as travel (severely restricted) we could have largely beat this thing in a couple of months from when it was first detected, but we lacked the will, the supplies, and all the info, but we knew enough 

Had there been no mask shortage it would have been recommended from day 1 and the cost to the economy is exponentially higher from letting this drag on than had we truly locked down, etc

We have to be ready for next time and we have the tools we need to be successful now"

2021-04-03 22:23,These variants are scary. Really wish the nation would be prudent and stop opening everything and lifting traveling restrictions.

An excellent summary of where we are at and the path ahead. Thank you."
2021-04-03 22:13,"There are scientific studies reported in JAMA Medical and NEJM that support the presence of significant antibody levels, an indication of protection against variants and not just against the wild type COVID. The same is true of those who had COVID and cleared the virus.

Those who are unwilling or hesitant to receive one of the vaccines can be a problem, just as the those who refused to wear a proper mask properly or practice common sense safety measures. That is why CDC is messaging not to let your guard down. No sorry Americans are not under any dictatorship and they will do what they have been waiting to do after they are fully vaccinated or were fully cured. Domestic travel is about to explode across our vast beautiful land. It is time to get outdoors and fill lungs with fresh air and soak sunshine and spend time in national parks and stay at a safe distance from every other person outside the family. 

Places to avoid celebrations is indoors in restaurants and bars or gatherings inside homes, where masks get pulled down or removed while eating or drinking. Outdoor dining and backyard gatherings should be no problem if all are fully immunized. There is nothing to fear but fear itself........FDR. ""Impending doom"" as the CDC Director feels is certainly worth considering while celebrating but what else remains to be done besides receiving vaccines that are now in greater supply than demand and taking safety precautions? Death is inevitable and not all deaths are preventable"
2021-04-03 21:54,"The irony is that the state that rejected lockdowns and masks weeks ago, Texas, now has some of the lowest COVID cases and deaths of any US state -- they are at a level that was not seen since September 2020.

While Florida has had a marginal increase, the states with significantly increasing COVID -- New York, NJ, PA and Michigan are all states that are still partially shut and demand masks.

The scientific method has never been a part of COVID.  Politics, fear and hysteria still rule the show -- and apparently still cause more cases and death than doing nothing at all.

But reality never really was part of the goal."
2021-04-03 22:11,"If anything has been revealed by this pandemic it is that Americans behave like children.  Mature behavior and ""Americans"" are clearly mutually exclusive concepts.

The idea of delaying ""celebration"" for a while longer simply goes counter to psychological profile experiments and results dating back the the 1970's.  These experiments showed that children, when confronted with immediate gratification of a single treat or the alternative of a double treat if enjoyment is delayed, led to a majority opting for the former.  

It will be individuals, likely comprising only a minority of the total population, who'll delay any ""celebration"".  The rest will ""party hearty"" and spread the variants as they spread the original.

This will thus ensure both a prolonged pandemic and consequentially higher death rate together with all the economic and social costs that entails."
2021-04-03 22:34,"It’s going to get exponentially harder to convince people to socially distance as those of us who have been responsible and made sacrifices for a whole year stop being willing to sacrifice the prime of our lives. I’ve given up a year of my mid twenties just sitting at home watching tv. I want to date and spend time with my friends and go out for drinks and food and travel. I feel like I’ve done my part and once I’m fully vaccinated I will be going out into the world. You can tell me that’s selfish but realistically a lot of people are going to be doing the same thing, after acting selflessly for a whole year."
2021-04-03 19:00,"I hope my fellow humans will keep up the precautions for a couple of more months.  Even if you are vaccinated it does not mean you cannot get COVID and then pass it to others.

2021-04-03 20:00,"Social distancing, masks, hand washing, avoiding crowds, avoiding travel, are more effective than any current or future vaccine can ever be. The virus is like a line of computer code. (That is why we call some malware ""viruses"".) Covid19 must be able to infect a host, highjack that host's cell machinery, then multiply, eject from that host, and reinfect another host. This is true regardless of the virus strain. If we deny it access to new hosts, it cannot spread. It is all very low-tech. 

Waiting for science to win this battle for us, while we flaunt simple personal restrictions, is juvenile. (""Juvenile"" as in, ""Spring Break"".)"

As we did in the beginning create informative public campaigns about the variants. Too many also think vaccines are a pass to freedom. They are a tool and it’s an evolving situation. Just got my 2nd dose and not I’m not changing a thing.

When 90 percent of Americans are two weeks past their last scheduled dose, be it one or two, and there is plenty left for whatever boosters we might need, then you can presume we are all set.  But we still have a very long way to go."

We need to pass tort reform at the federal level. The pharmaceutical industry, working with government and academia, was essential in developing, testing, manufacturing and distributing the vaccines that have saved the day.  Yet, the drug industry faces a truly existential threat from lawsuits, mostly suits bases on ""junk"" science and sympathetic patients.  Lawsuits almost ended the availability of vaccines in the US in the 1970's and 80's, only a last minute no fault liability law, the 1986 Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, allowed vaccine manufacturing to continue. 

In 2002 the only vaccine against Lyme disease was taken off the market, in large part because of a probably baseless, but expensive, class action lawsuit. Today, there is no vaccine available against Lyme.

We must not allow this history to be repeated, we need tort reform. Today, literally 10 of thousands of multibillion dollar lawsuits are pending, threatening several major firms engaged in vaccine development with bankruptcy.  We need vaccines far more than we need lawsuits."
2021-04-03 23:33,"I have been watching the CDC variant numbers closely for weeks. (I wanted to make sure the problem wasn't rampant in Arizona before flying there, two weeks after my second Moderna vaccine.) I am by no means a COVID skeptic, but as of April 1st the CDC is reporting about 12,500 cases of the UK variant nationwide to date, compared to a daily case average of about 65,000 cases. A handful of states (Florida, Michigan and a few others) have a bigger problem than most. See for yourself:

<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant-cases.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant-cases.html</a>

The growth of variant cases in most states is very low. (78 cases of the UK variant here in Wisconsin, 95 in Arizona.) The UK variant represents the vast majority, and the vaccines are reportedly effective against its impact. Is the ""variant"" drumbeat louder than it needs to be?"
2021-04-03 23:38,"We will overcome Covid, but there are some sacrifices we will all have to make.

The obvious ones are to get vaccinated, with annual boosters if necessary, and to in the short run wear masks.  Some degree of social distancing remains necessary, but perhaps not draconian lockdowns.

We must also allow the CDC to track vaccination on an individual level, and also track who develops Covid, how serious their disease is, and when available the genetic variant of the virus.  This will entail some loss of privacy, but it is essential if we are to control the pandemic.

It would also be helpful to implement a national patient identifier number, similar to our social security number, and similar to the system many other countries have.  Such a patient identification number is effectively illegal under current federal law.  It is time for this law to change; the benefits outweigh the loss of privacy."
2021-04-03 23:41,"You should take an updated look at the UK. We are 5-6 weeks behind their schedule of getting people >50 at least one vaccine dose.

BTW, the variant b1117 was first identified in the UK and has been the dominant strain there this year.  The US is very likely to have those same outcomes in 5-6 weeks."
2021-04-03 23:41,"The simple truth is that the Balkanized policies of state governments and the backward public health mores of American society have made this pandemic much worse here with no end in sight.  The near complete failure of people in the US to coordinate measures to stop the virus stands in stark contrast to China where ironically, even under the direction of a corrupt CPC, the population has kept spread to few cases for nearly a year.  We have been our own worst enemies here in the US, and with premature openings, and spotty mask and social distancing compliance, we will live with this plague for at least another year notwithstanding vaccination.

2021-04-04 0:40,"Overall, people tend to avoid facing reality, if the reality is very unpleasant or even just inconvenient. The key role is with the government, particularly the state-level governments. In Australia, state governments, regardless of which party they belong to, all seem to stand quite firm on the same approach: clear and consistent message to the public, enforceable rules if any outbreak happens (some are rather strict and there is little room left for personal interpretation). For example, there is a recent outbreak of less than 20 cases of community transmission in the capital of Queensland (state). In three days, about 10k tests were done in a city with just over 2m. Test is continuing even during Easter holiday. It's because the message is clear- if you had been to certain venues at certain time, you must get tested and self-isolate until result comes back. At the same time, masks are mandated in public places (A$200 fine apply). It looks like things are under-control now. If not, I am sure there will be further measures to make that happen. The public is willing to cooperate now, also because they've seen what happened elsewhere."

One day the CDC says one thing, the next day one reads something that seems to question what was said the previous day. So, how can there be worry at these variants, while the CDC is saying people can fly with less risk if they’re vaccinated?! Which is which?! If the variants are worrying, then, how is it less risky to fly when vaccinated? How do those two positions reconcile?!"

2021-04-04 0:17,"The most effective protection, together with vaccines, is appropriately wearing masks and keeping a social distance of at least 6-7 feet. 
Unfortunately, wearing a mask is everywhere considered a nuisance by too many people, and at least in my state (and I see similar images coming from many other US states and countries) the mask mandate is not enforced at all. I can see a lot of people showing their mask-freedom with a defiant, arrogant (and totally ignorant) smile, mainly among young guys, and nobody does anything to enforce the rules. Another used trick is placing the mask over the chin...
Only in the UK, as far as I know, the recent severe restrictions were observed and efficiently enforced, and this led, with the second best vaccine rollout in the world (after Israel), to a dramatic improvement in the fight against the virus.
I would suggest the governments to maintain and seriously enforce the mask mandate: together with an efficient vaccine administration, only this will lead to a lasting deep decrease of the disease prevalence to values low enough to prevent the rise of new dangerous mutations."
2021-04-03 23:11,"This illustrates why it is still so important to wear a mask (2 of them when possible).

Medical experts said, before the vaccine came out, that they felt that wearing a mask as well as social distancing, would still be the number1 tool to fight the virus even after a successful vaccine become available due to reasons mentioned here.

Variants are caused by naturally occurring random genetic mutations. Mutations that prove to be successful, become dominant. Thus, the more cases that are out there, the more chances there are for new mutations and opportunities for  new successful variants to emerge. Evolution is driven by these random and successful genetic mutations, as well.

Because this is a novel virus, most of the world is infected. Thus, large numbers of infections means the odds for, and the speed with which, these mutations can randomly occur increases.

This is why, even though young people are less likely to have a severe outcome from the virus, it is still important for them to follow guidelines. Their bodes still provide places for mutations to form and new variations to occur

Because masks are so extremely important, venues where eating and drinking in crowds occurs is really still a vary very bad idea

People also seem to have the false belief masks are not required outside.  You may be slightly safer due to ventilation, but that does not stop the virus at all if someone is less than 6 feet away from you or if you are downwind from a sick person

The other artice today about the Governors flexing their muscle to get kids back in class illustrates another problem--the politicization of the reopening is now bi-partisan. In eastern Washington (yes, Inslee, that's you) school COVID dashboards show in-school case counts that are *double* community case-counts--and community case-counts are now trending high enough to push many sections if not the whole State of Washington back into lockdown. 

Whether Red or Blue, 'power tendeth to corrupt, and absolute power tendeth to corrupt absolutely'.

Similarly high quality masks should be given free to every American and must be required to be used all the time until the pandemic ends. Plans to vaccinate children should be accelerated and booster shots should be given probably 6 months after the last vaccination date starting in the summer for those vaccinated early.

3. Vaccines are 80-90% effective, as well.

If we all get vaccinated and also wear masks, we can stay safe, until we reach herd, and when we reach herd, the virus will no longer have such an easy time of finding host bodies where a new variant can then emerge from a random genetic mutation of the virus. The virus can't do this without a body.

Anyway, masks are no big deal anyway, nor is getting a shot.

Why would anyone complain about doing such simple things that actually work and work well?

That part I do not get.

Some say they have a right to get sick if they choose, but wearing a mask and staying healthy, also protects others, so 
 it is patriotic to do this for our nation.

The Constitution has never given people the right and freedom to infringe on the health and rights and freedoms of others.

For example, free speech does not give one he right to yell, ""Fire"" in a crowded theatre when there is no fire, and you can't throw garbage in a pubic well, etc. or drive the wrong way down a highway. Laws are enacted to draw a line where one person's rights and freedoms end and begin to infringe on another's rights and this includes health and safety.

Requiring people to do things for general public health and safety is not even a new thing."

2021-04-04 3:48,"It's called immunity escape.  Since the vaccines are not 100% effective, some virons escape.  They become the variants.  Pressure from the vaccines is causing these variants.  It's no different from the annual Flu, which requires a new vaccine - which is only about 50% effective - every season.  It is also like taking too many antibiotics.  Eventually you get super bugs that are immune to all antibiotics."
2021-04-04 3:32,"Americans for the most part have failed to understand the virus and how it proliferates. Until we end the lines of transmission it will continue to proliferate. The virus doesn’t live independently of a host and every time you go out and interact with others you make
Yourself available to be the next host and by doing so you extend the pandemic. Ironically those who hate masks and refuse to wear them and who despise isolating and social distancing  are extending the pandemic and therefore the need for masks, social distancing and isolation. So go about your business as usual if you line having a pandemic and if you don’t then stop whining and put your mask on and social distance from others."
2021-04-04 3:52,"There are far more than a handful of “variants” out there. Odds are, there are millions.
But that’s not a terrible thing. Because out of those millions, only the handful that we hear about are malignant. The vast majority of variants are benign with characteristics that make them less able to infect or sicken their hosts, so they simply die off before they can even be identified.
The fact is that the creation of variants requires the virus to replicate, albeit with a slight change in genetic structure. When we vaccinate, we slow the spread, and when we slow the spread we reduce the rate of replication. And the result of THAT is a reduction in variants, both benign and malignant."
2021-04-04 3:57,"Disclaimer: I am not an epidemiologist like most of people commenting here, just an anesthesiologist.
In my  hospital there has been huge drop of Covid-19 cases over last few weeks.
In the peak of Pandemic we were performing 2-3 emergency operations on Covid-19 positive patients daily, then same amount weekly, but last week we didn't have any case.
Almost 30% of US population is at least partially immunized and if you add some natural immunity it may be about  40-50% of population with substantial immunity.
Surely it is too early to lift all the restrictions. Next few weeks will show which way are we going. My educated guess is that cases will diminish, but not cease completely.
I think that there will be at least 30% of US population declining immunization and I am against forcing them to comply."
2021-04-04 4:00,"This virus is perfectly suited to take advantage of us—our social nature, our impatience, our short attention span, our value of money over health and life, our selfishness, our stubborn refusal to sacrifice short-term pleasures for long-term gain, and our tendency to reject facts that don’t square with the way we prefer to view the world. If we are not yet in awe of this virus and fully respectful of it, we are in for a world of more hurt."
2021-04-04 4:07,"We are not facing a binary choice between going on with life and take risks - and isolating ourselves for the rest of our lives. Both of these alternatives are extremes. More reasonable would be an effort to turn the pandemic into an endemic with low infection numbers and a less severe outcome. The way to get there is obvious to most people (I hope): follow the mitigation efforts (masks, distancing, avoid crowds, wash hands) and get vaccinated. When we all do that until a sufficiently large portion of us is vaccinated and we reached herd immunity (keep masks on until then),  we should be okay to resume life safely. If we lack the discipline and solidarity to do that, we ask for more of the same. People who refuse to comply with Covid mitigation measures aggravate and perpetuate the pandemic. Lockdowns and other measures are a result of irresponsible behavior. Many complain about mitigation measures they themselves have caused. That's weird."
2021-04-04 4:19,"It gets extremely confusing when our leaders tell us one day they have a sense of doom, the next that vaccinated people don't spread the virus, and then walk it back again. I understand we're learning more every day but my heads beginning to spin!"

2021-04-04 5:36,"Our Supreme Court said the governors masks rules were illegal. Although our county has a mask rule, my employer decided to take the position that since we are not a business open to the public, masks are optional. They had a choice and chose in favor of “individual liberty” versus the overall health of the workforce. This after we successfully navigated the pandemic for over a year with limited infections. I’m not particularly optimistic that if every other employer takes a similar approach, we will get to a better place."
2021-04-04 5:40,"Agree that precautions are still needed, but those who have been vaccinated can go out and celebrate a little and not endanger public health. CDC's own study released last week showed that two weeks after second dose of Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, infection rate was 1 per 25,000 person days. That is virtually nothing. And only a fraction of those infected would perhaps transmit, so the odds of a vaccinated person transmitting the virus are very remote."
2021-04-04 5:58,"The concern that people of a certain political persuasion do not want to get vaccinated is real. Unless effective herd immunity is achieved, the virus will continue to thrive and mutate. Combined with similar resistance to a ""vaccination passport"" the end of the pandemic is even further away."
2021-04-04 6:02,"""But because each infection gives the coronavirus a chance to evolve still further, vaccinations in the United States and elsewhere must proceed as fast as possible.""

Which makes it even more inexplicable why the FDA and CDC have resisted extending the interval between doses to allow more people to get at least one dose, as the UK is doing. Prominent American epidemiologist like Jha and Osterholm have forcefully argued for this, but have been met with a specious ""follow the science"" (ie stick blindly to the existing EUAs).

The present mRNA vaccines are so effective after only one shot that there is no obvious downside to extending the interval by a few weeks (which is not the same thing as doing without a second shot). Leaving people unvaccinated will promote variants more than partially vaccinating them temporarily, according to a recent study by Lipsitch et al. The risk aversion and rule obsequiousness of the FDA and CDC may cost us dearly."
2021-04-04 6:12,"The variants may be more contagious, for a longer period of time, but so far there are no scientifically-supported data that they are more lethal.  The weight- and strength-of-evidence of other viral diseases shows that that mutant variants are less lethal than the original although they may be more contagious.  Mixing scientific knowledge with emotionally-based fears is not sound policy.  “Impending doom” is not a phrase found in any scientific or biomedical dictionary.  

Let’s stick to the facts. Let’s acknowledge that the last pandemic occurred 100 years ago, and that today’s leaders, scientific experts, and policy makers are forging an trail unknown in living memory.  It’s a brave new word.

Hopefully, we will learn enough from this pandemic to provide precedence for dealing with future pandemics if and when they occur."
2021-04-04 7:35,My body reacted so violently and for so long to both shots (Moderna) that the prospect of needing boosters or repeated shots against the many/increasing variants and/or annual shots like flu shots is making me more distressed than before I had the first shot. I really don't know if I can take it.
2021-04-04 9:12,The real answer is to require States to mandate masking and for those who do not raise health insurance taxes on its citizens. Same with those who refused vaccinations. Their insurance premiums should rise as they are raising health costs for everyone else by their actions. No free riders.
2021-04-04 9:18,"If variants are a concern because they are more contagious and cause more serious disease, why are schools reopening?

2021-04-04 9:27,"People seem to believe we live in a risk free environment.  We take precautions every day to protect ourselves.  We lock doors, we look both ways when crossing the street and a thousand other examples.  Executive orders and mandates will not do anything to halt the virus.  Personal behavior and vaccination will.  We saw the lockdowns in Europe, California and New York in some cases abated the virus and in others did nothing.  Be careful and get vaccinated."
2021-04-04 9:34,"This is scary. We are into the second year of the pandemic and are no near to getting back to normalcy. It is unclear how many trillions the White House and Congress can issue to keep us going. If we want to go back to normal, we to practice the covid prevention guidelines including masks and vaccinations. If this virus is not controlled, we are unlikely to go back to normal anytime soon. 
Unfortunately, this is true not just for US but all countries. We, humans, now than ever need to act global. Social distancing, testing, quarantine and vaccinations need to be done everywhere under the sun. Otherwise, we are all going to continue to be either hiding or getting infected for years."
2021-04-04 9:48,I had my shot 5 days ago meaning that in 9 days I will be considered fully vaccinated. Guess what? I'm still going to wear my mask and socially distance. Why will I do that? Both to set a good example for others not fully vaccinated and because I do not know if even though I'm essentially safe from infection can I be a carrier. I will gladly trade a little inconvenience in order to get Covid-19 under control.
2021-04-04 10:49,Receiving the vaccine is a physical or biological protection against the virus but many of us have to conquer the psychological barriers to normalcy.  I'm half vaccinated but I don't feel half better about going to restaurants or parties and I'm pretty sure that when I get my second shot I won't be jumping on a plane or attending a large gathering anytime soon. Eek is the feeling I get when I read that Dr. Fauci thinks chasing variants is like playing Whac-A-Mole.
2021-04-04 10:55,"Amazing how this article flags growth in Florida. Why? Nothing about Florida's growth rate stands out as unusual or particularly dramatic. The states with very sharp upward curves right now are: Michigan, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. 

I realize these facts are problematic for journalists' steadfast belief that NPIs work to prevent surges. They don't and they haven't: not here in the US and not around the world. There is literally no correlation between the stringency of NPIs and COVID death rates: these measures just DO NOT WORK.

Florida and Texas and most of the South are doing well right now, despite dropping restrictions. Meanwhile more restrictive states are suffering. This reality is just too painful to be acknowledged. No amount of real-world experience with failed containment efforts seems to shake the belief that tough governors can somehow protect us from this virus. I wonder how long people will persist in refusing to face these hard truths."
2021-04-04 11:10,"Beware the B117 variant. Stop traveling.

Walensky's messaging has been counter-productive and once again Fauci is called upon to clean up the mess. Is it that difficult to speak with one, measured voice?"
2021-04-04 12:18,The past year has shown we cannot live with this virus - the longer it is allowed to survive the more time it has to mutate into forms that our defense systems cannot stop.  The current round of mutations are evidence of this conclusion.  We in Canada are in the midst of yet another surge and are into a near total lock down - one year after our first go around.   This will go on and on until and unless we are prepared to admit we cannot live with this virus at any level and are willing to adopt the strict measures needed to eradicate it from our midst. Apparently China and New Zealand have done so.

If covid had arrived a few decades earlier before we had the new vaccine technology, we would have had many millions dead and a devestated economy with little hope for a quick recovery.  However, even with this achievement many complain we are not taking measures to save every life possible.  This is true, but we have made the same calculation (life = $) in so many areas before ... and will going forward - a fact of life that will not change."
2021-04-04 12:27,"That the CDC allowed its reputation to be destroyed by the prior administration was a disaster, in part because once gone, trust is hard to rebuild.  The B.117 situation was predicted months ago, yet much of what we heard was sunshine about how great the vaccines are (true) without clear, unequivocal messaging about the need for on-going mitigation strategies.  Now “authorities” are pressing to keep schools open, despite the fact that children are susceptible to this variant—some of them will become ill from it, some will die from it, and they will inevitably facilitate its spread.  At least B.117 is susceptible to our vaccines.  Even more disturbing is the likely inevitable spread of P.1, currently wreaking havoc in Brazil.  The CDC has indicated that vaccinated individuals are at low risk for travel; sounds pleasant, but at low risk for which variants?  Where are the data on vaccine effectiveness against the different variants?  How much does the US even know about the true spread of variants, given our weak and lagging efforts at sequencing?  After over a year of mixed messaging, individuals are still in a position of having to devise their own risk assessment and mitigation strategies, regardless of vaccination status—an unfortunate state of affairs.  (And I wish we’d stop hearing about the mythical “light at the end of the tunnel”; some of us remember when that lie was used constantly during the Vietnam war, which ended in our defeat.)"
2021-04-04 12:35,"I have no confidence that Biden administration can handle this virus problem.  This is a critical moment for our country, and president Biden should take drastic actions to decisively and convincingly stop virus.  We should not rely on vaccines alone to stop the virus.

I attended a soccer game yesterday to watch my grandkid played in Woodlands, a suburban Houston. Houston Dynamo sponsored these matches.  There were at least 10 other matches played at the same time. It was a whole day event with large gathering with many adults and kids. The most frightening thing is that we were the very few who wore masks among all these people.

Now I have post covid, I've had fever for 45 days and nonstop aches. I'll be okay, I have a vaccine appointment for May (I've tried since January). It doesn't matter, I have been negative for the virus for 45 days and have the antibody load to cure the entire Republican party. Can I make a buck?"
2021-04-04 12:42,"It is disheartening to see the selfishness and irresponsibility of many Americans. Perhaps it’s because we’ve never been through worse, at least not in our lifetimes. War-torn countries in Europe have endured occupation by the enemy for years at a time- with curfews and many other restrictions, limited access to food, immediate persecution if you spoke up-and they got through it. We have much more freedom and we’re merely asking people for responsible self-determination."
2021-04-04 12:57,"This is where the logic that precautions are a ""personal choice"" fails most resoundingly.  We have been warned by the medical community that the virus mutates when it is given a chance - that is, when it can infect in large numbers.  It's simple math, folks.  Reduce the rate of infection and the mutation rate falls with it.  So refusing to wear a mask or self-quarantine isn't a statement of your individual rights - it endangers non-participants, like everyone else, by creating more opportunities for the virus to mutate and evade the immune response.   Yes, we can blame irresponsible governors - FL and TX in particular - for recklessness, but if you can read or watch TV, this isn't rocket science.  At this point, we're all individually responsible for ourselves and each other."

If we do not use the humane methods we have available to us to tame out-of-control human population Mother Nature will.  And her population control methods are infinitely less humane than ours.

So to recap, we need to support and promote age-appropriate sex education, free and easily accessible contraception of all kinds, and yes, even abortion when a woman requests it.  ALL of these methods are far more humane than death by plague and/or starvation."

There is also no mention of herd immunity achieved by natural infection, which is likelier than vaccines to be the reason for the precipitous drop in infections in January. States like Michigan, who had stricter lockdowns, are now taking their turn to be hotspots. For better or worse, Covid19 has already swept through a lot of communities, and this herd immunity plus vaccines means were much likelier to see deaths and hospitalizations continue to fall, which was the goal after all."

2021-04-04 11:54,"The bottom line is that the vaccine can protect your body’s response to the vaccine. You will most likely never get a severe case (after vaccination) that would require more than a day or two of rest.  The goal of the vaccination was to decrease serious illness from Covid. How many times have we heard of those who receive the flu vaccine but get the flu...... a mild case. 
Bottom line is...... the vaccine does not make us impervious from catching Covid, it just makes symptoms and the chance of getting really ill slim.  I personally know three people who have been fully vaccinated since February and have recently tested positive for Covid with no symptoms (mandatory job testing). The problem lies with them being asymptomatic carriers and passing it on to those who are not vaccinated and the unvaccinated person getting sick. 
Soon enough, we will hopefully a tami flu like drug that alleviates Covid symptoms rapidly they way tami flu does."

2021-04-04 13:55,"Deaths aside. (Just for a moment.) I've never read an expert article that supports the default view that widespread sickness and death are better for the economy than doing what it takes to stop covid in its tracks while waiting for a vaccine, including locking down temporarily if contact tracing and quarantine get overwhelmed in an area until the virus is back under control in that area. I understand that doing what it takes puts a strain on the economy. What isn't clear is that it's less strain than that due to widespread sickness and death.
Then there's the deaths.
Countries that have stopped covid spreading seem to be doing relatively well economically.China, for example. Not well compared to pre-covid, but well compared to other major economies."
2021-04-04 13:56,"Just to clarify, variants do not actively ""blunt"" the immune response. Rather some variants evade (escape) the immune responses established by current vaccines and previous infections with the original strain. A booster shot that targets the ""eek"" variants will  train the immune system to recognize the known escape variants and should help protect against disease.  We already use vaccines that target multiple strains of viruses, such as the influenza and HPV vaccines. BTW, I am a retired infectious disease researcher."
2021-04-04 14:06,"This article is a great example of fear mongering. Last week the CDC released a study that showed vaccines almost completely stopped infections in the real world between December and March, when variants were already rampant. Sure, it’s possible that new variants could be worse. A lot of things are possible."
2021-04-04 14:13,"This article explains the persistence of the spread of infection as due to new “variants, versions, so called variants and new viruses.”

None of these are scientific terms. We know that viruses mutate. That means they restructure their DNA or produce new or different proteins than the vaccine was designed to address.

It would be helpful if we had a little more science on this. This is especially important since the current RNA vaccine contains one specific protein from the spike of the corona virus.

Our own cells then reproduce that spike protein which our immune system recognizes and attacks.

So what has gone wrong? Is the virus mutating and producing a different protein? Is the problem with our own cell reproduction of that protein? Or is the problem with our immune response? Or is the problem with the design of the vaccine?

Also the author doesn’t cite any studies that indicate that these “variants” are either more contagious or more deadly. You can’t make assertions about something being either more or less without first establishing a baseline for making such a comparison. That requires rigorous analysis of lots of data.

2021-04-04 14:18,"There is still a pandemic, but things are not a dire as the pessimists indicate. The vaccines work, even against variants, though with reduced efficacy. Vaccine manufacturers will be able to develop boosters, and annual shots are likely to be part of our future.

Draconian lockdowns are probably a mistake; the collateral damage they cause worldwide is severe and underestimated. We still need to wear masks, and many large public events are inappropriate. This includes motorcycle rallies, many public sporting events, and most public protests, even those for good causes (whatever you believe those to be).  But as vaccination levels rise, it is time to reopen society, if we do so intelligently.  

There will never be ""zero"" risk; over 30,000 people die each year in car accidents, and many more are injured, and still we drive. The benefits of mobility outweigh the risks.

We need to continue to develop drugs to treat the disease as well as vaccines to prevent it. This requires a vigorous pharmaceutical industry, and collaborations between industry, academia, and the government. This also requires tort reform - not elimination of legal liability, but serious reform of our laws at the Federal level, so that pharmaceutical companies are not threatened with bankruptcy by tens of thousands of multi-billion dollar suits based on junk science, and sympathetic plaintiffs. There used to be a vaccine against Lyme disease, today it is off the market due in large part to lawsuits."

The first thing that needs to happen is that the vaccine, and all successive vaccines need to be mandatory. Other than legitimate medical reasons, no excuses. Next, the world needs a sort of international vaccine system of which all nations and the medical industry are beholden to; intended to stem the rollout disparity and ensure that areas experiencing the highest squalor be prioritized, rather than those with the most money. This isn't a crisis of any one nation, but humanity itself, and it's going to take all 7.674 billion of us working together as a singular force to beat it.

Remember the Biker rally in Sturgis? Remember the Previous Guy claiming the pandemic was a hoax? Remember Dr. Fauci’s somber face as he had to stand next to the Previous Guy during the so called Coronavirus  briefings?

You must remember all sorts of Conservatives stridently refusing to even wear breathing masks in public. You must remember governors of Red States refusing to mandate Stay-at-Home and masking orders. You can’t forget how the Previous Guy allegedly got the coronavirus and was allegedly cured virtually overnight by a combination of treatments available to no one else.

When the first vaccines were developed (truly a miracle of modern science, medicine, and molecular  biology),  that was a gift to Humanity. All we had to do was protect ourselves and each other a little longer by isolating, hand-hygiene, air-flow management, and masking... but we were tired of all those precautions.

More contagious variants simply increase the R0 of the virus. For example the R0 has gone up roughly from 0.5 to 0.8 with the advent of B.117 and the California/NY strains. That is all.

What the NYT should be publishing is the weekly average R0 of SARS-COV2. Less social distance and more contagious variants will increase the R0. More vaccinations and already infected people, more social distancing will decrease the average R0.

That is all we need to know. If R0 is increasing we need to tighten social distancing measures. If R0 is decreasing we can relax them.

So, NYT, publish the weekly average R0 for the country. You will find that it is flat to slightly decreasing. It may not make headlines, but it is an easy fact to report on."

The food you eat plays a key aspect in determining your overall health and immunity. Eat low carb diets, as this will help control high blood sugar and pressure.  A low carb diet will help slow down diabetes and focus on a protein-rich diet to keep you in good shape. And regularly consume vegetables and fruits rich in Beta carotene, Ascorbic acid & other essential vitamins. Certain foods like mushrooms, tomato, bell pepper and green vegetables like broccoli, spinach are also good options to build resilience in the body against infections.

You can also eat supplements rich in omega 3 & 6 fatty acids for your daily dose, if stepping out to buy groceries is not an option during social distancing. Some natural immunity supplements include ginger, gooseberries and turmeric. Some of these superfoods are common ingredients in Indian dishes and snacks. There are several herbs that help in boosting immunity like garlic, Basel leaves and Black cumin. Certain seeds and nuts like sunflower seeds, Flax seed, pumpkin seeds and melon seeds are excellent sources of protein and vitamin E.

Probiotics like Yoghurt, Yakult and fermented food are also excellent sources to rejuvenate the composition of gut bacteria, which is important for nutrient absorption by the body. These are good options for the older generation too."

We're doing this completely wrong and we will end up with an irreversible catastrophe on our hands if we don't listen to this scientist and stop the madness. 

Basically, what he's saying is that the unprecedented action of mass vaccination with prophylactic vaccines (those that reduce symptoms but don't fully stop infection or prevent transmission) in the middle of a global pandemic, will lead to what he calls ""immune escape"" by creating huge evolutionary pressure on the virus to develop mutations in the specific region of the virus that the vaccines are targeted towards: the spike protein. Regular mutations driven by the spread of infection will and can happen randomly in any part of the virus. However, when we mass vaccinate with such ""leaky"" vaccines in the middle of a pandemic, we force the virus to create mutations in its most ""precious"" region: the spike protein. It is such mutations in the spike protein that give rise to more infectious and more deadly variants. 

There's more that he says, but it's a lot of complex immunology and virology, so we need more ""experts"" willing to dive in and debate this with him in the open. And the media to stop ignoring what he's saying."

The truth is that this virus and other emerging viruses is ugly, but government leaders don't want to spook the herd.

And then the head of the CDC has a feeling of doom. I appreciate that feeling. I appreciate that honesty. But stop with the ping-pong advice! Say it: The virus is not at bay. If you carry a new variant of the virus, you are way more likely to pass it on. The variants will kill many more people, and quickly, as they take hold.

As long as most of the world remains unvaccinated, the virus will find opportunities to mutate into a form that renders today’s vaccines less or not at all effective. And with global travel what it was pre covid, the new viruses will be able to spread again. We need to realize that it will likely be years before the virus is truly conquered.

Instead of that fact the media has chosen to focus on speculation about the vaccines not working and new vaccines having to be developed.  Most recently Pfizer found that its vaccine is 100% effective in preventing severe disease from 7 days to six months after the second dose and 91.3% effective against any infection.  There have been plenty of variants that have emerged during that six months.  We don't know how long the effectiveness last because the vaccines are new but so far there is no time related decline in prevention of severe disease.  In another study they found it is safe and 100% effective when administered to adolescents age 12 to 15.  It is time for the media to give up the ""gotcha journalism"" that always focuses of potential problems that in this case are literally imaginary.

If we can get to herd immunity which is somewhere around 80% of the population vaccinated new variants will become much less common."
2021-04-04 17:01,"I disagree with two statements:

“The best way to think about B.1.1.7 and other variants is to treat them as separate epidemics,”

That statement would only be valid if B117 were completely resistant to the current vaccines.  But it is not.  So all it does is change the transmission rate, making the virus to spread faster.  Overall, the rate of spread vs the rate of vaccination will determine how fast case numbers are rising.

The second statement by Tony Fauci says:   ""Instead of a new vaccine against variants, however, it may be just as effective for Americans to receive a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech or Moderna vaccines in six months to a year, ""

I agree that a booster should be given, but that booster should contain the E484K mutation.  That would boost all other epitopes and also create a base immunity for the neoepitope that reduces the ability of the existing vaccine to work at full efficacy.   Just giving a 3rd injection with a suboptimal vaccine is not going to cut it on the long run.  There will be viral escapes otherwise."

Stores and businesses are still encouraging masks like before. Most all school districts are still following CDC guidelines, although a few have made the news, imagine that, for not enforcing it. Most people are doing their best to follow guidelines, vaccinate, and stop the spread. Like everywhere, there are always those who will go against the norm, in all states."
2021-04-04 17:18,"People don't understand – and many don't care – how evolution works.  But evolution will determine how we get through the current coronavirus pandemic.

Every time viruses reproduce, they generate more or less random mutations in their genomes (for coronavirus, that's RNA).  Many of these mutations lead to inactive progeny viruses (called daughter viruses).  Many make little or no change in virus activity.

Some, however, confer some sort of advantage in terms of causing disease, such as replicating more efficiently, producing more progeny, surviving better when dried, causing longer disease (and so making more progeny) and, importantly, becoming resistant to the defenses of the host.  Those defenses may include pre-existing immunity (from vaccines) or immunity generated by the infection itself.

The more unvaccinated people there are, and so the more potential hosts for the viruses that are now circulating, the greater the chance that one of these more problematic (or resistant) mutant viruses will emerge.  Once a resistant virus emerges, it has a survival advantage and so may eventually take over, shoving the original virus aside.

THIS IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE TO BE IMMUNIZED: BECAUSE IT RESTRICTS THE EMERGENCE OF VIRUSES THAT ARE MORE VIRULENT OR MORE RESISTANT TO THE IMMUNITY CONFERRED BY VACCINES OR PREVIOUS INFECTION."

The “variants” you see erupting (UK, South African, Brazil, etc.) are clear examples of the process. It’s not a US vaccination problem, it’s a world-wide vaccination problem.

Dr. Walensky of the CDC is right to be alarmed. We are just one mutation away from a variant that’s much more easily transmitted, far more lethal, and impervious to the present vaccines. I’m sure Republican Governor Greg Abbott of Texas would offer heart-felt sympathies.

2021-04-03 23:05,"I wish the CDC and all levels of government would do a better job of educating  people about the virus variants.  

The more covid-19 hangs around in vulnerable, unvaccinated people, the longer it has to morph into something else like a variant and then something else again that our vaccines may be less effective against.

Covid has ravaged our country like a forest fire - killing 550,000.  We have to work together to get this thing stamped out.  At the very least, consider the humanity of first responders and front-line workers who risk their lives for you and me and all the idiots among us who value our 'freedom' not to wear a mask or socially distance."

2021-04-04 6:21,"The only transmissible variant spinning out of control is these articles about “more infectious strains”. There are not simultaneously multiple mutations around the world that are both becoming more transmissible and more deadly. It is not a thing that has ever been observed in the history of epidemiology. If there is a new peer reviewed paper on the topic, great, I will be very interested to read it. Otherwise enough with the speculation and hyperventilating. 

Back in February the NYT was publishing articles about how B117 was going to be 80% of US cases by the beginning of March. Now we’re supposed to freak out because it could be as high as 20%, blah, blah, blah, weasel words about how it probably isn’t but they don’t want to say that because it would negate their overblown article.

Just as an example, we now know B117 has been around since at least as far back as Oct and yet it has made up a significant % of the cases in only one geographical region during that time. Researchers don’t even think it originated in the U.K.! Why wasn’t it able to dominate its home region if it’s that good?

Let me know when you have something better than an assertion by Boris Johnson about how much more transmissible some variant is. Or better yet, let me know when one of the UK, South Africa, or Brazil, variants takes over another one of those countries. That might actually show that one of them is more transmissible. Until then, enough."

2021-04-04 10:49,"Covid-19.  Possibly a “designer” virus, an unpredictable pandemic, relentless anti-vaxxers and conspiracists preying on fear and gullibility, endless contradictory news stories and “official” pronouncements, Wuhan gaslighting “investigations,” a chaotic, frustrating vaccine rollout, widespread Covid-emergency exhaustion and deepening anxiety.  Death and sickness.  All this just on Blursday.  Who could ask for anything more?"
2021-04-04 15:02,"So much of NYT reporting on COVID-19, like this piece, represents a lazy, one-sided stoking of fears rather than a balanced review of the evidence and trends. 

""[It] is increasingly clear that the next few months will be painful."" Really? The evidence from countries such as the UK and Israel, both ahead of the US in vaccinations but in the UK's case, not by that much, is the opposite. Take the UK, where the UK variant is (obviously) dominant: Vaccinations and immunity from prior infections have pushed the new infection rate steadily down from the highest in the world to one-third of the US level, and the decline appears to be continuing. 

Judging from both the UK and Israel experience, it seems reaching a population immunity of around 55%-60% is sufficient for a meaningful, if partial, ""herd immunity"". Where are we in the US? Considering both prior infections (~25%) and the proportion receiving at least one dose (~31%) we are now near or above 50% immunity, and are about 4 weeks behind the UK. 

Equally lost in the article is the point that the vaccines are effective against the UK variant, and the Pfizer and Modern vaccines also work against the feared South Africa variant.

For all these reasons, the much-trumpeted ""fourth wave"" is likely to be muted. Is there risk of a worse outcome? Of course. But is it the most likely scenario? Even the CDC's own base case forecast suggests not. And the NYT should start reporting that."
2021-04-04 4:42,"I have tracked the COVID-19 Death Rates (DRs) AKA the Case Fatality Ratio (Deaths / Cases) since Jan 2020 on Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 Dashboard.

The Global and USA DRs peaked on May 1st, and May 15th, 2020, at 7.13% and 6.06% respectively.

Those rates were 71 and 60 times that of the Common Flu's 1/10th of 1% (0.001), respectively, in case you were Tweeting (complaining) that  ""we never shut down the economy over the Common Flu"", as President Trump did in his March 9th, 2020 Tweet.

That was ignorant for him to focus on the number of Deaths, rather than the Death RATE!

As of Feb 1st, 2021, the World Wide and USA DRs fell to 2.163% and 1.684%, respectively.
However, then the DRs began to increase, I think, due to the Variants (Mutations).

However, since March 11th, the Global DR fell from 2.219% to 2.177%  on April 3rd at 11:20 PM EST.

Since March 11, the USA DR fell from 1.8153% to 1.8087%.

Divide 1.8087% (0.0187 as a Decimal) by the DR of the Common Flu (1/10th of 1% (0.001 as a Decimal) and you see that, in the USA, over 50 States, our DR is still over 18 (EIGHTEEN) times the Death Rate of the Common Flu.
Why doesn't the Media explain it like that?

PS: Thank you to Sister Mary Bernadine of the Grey Nuns of the Sacred Heart (GNSH), my 5th Grade Teacher in Blessed Sacrament Elementary School (1964-65) for teaching me how to convert fractions and percents into Decimals and how to divide them.

Each infected person is used to reproduce the virus billions of times, and with many mistakes. Those mistakes can be more deadly viruses. The longer and more people infected, the more chance of a Novel virus that is far more deadly. 

A novel virus to which nobody is immune could produce a new pandemic. End this one without delay or risk worse."

All sorts of out of state plates. I suppose many coming to visit their retired parents for Easter, we do have the highest percentage of people over 65 in the state,35%.All I could think of was that many of these visitors will be bringing back the Brazil variant back to their communities.

I have had my first vaccine. I double mask, and only leave my house for walks in isolated places. I grocery shop once a week at 7 am in the morning double masked. I know everyone is tired of staying home, but we are almost there. I'm just stunned at people's level of denial."

But that wish to always demand ""freedom"" or ""justice"" or ""no less than what we had before this !""  - then sounds like a national anthem.

2021-04-04 14:04,"The map of vaccination level by state provided by the NY Times has become a mirror image of the 2020 electoral map.

The bluer the state, the higher the % vaccinated. Conversely, the redder the state the lower the % vaccinated. There are few exceptions, the Dakotas among them. 

For the most part, the southern, ""minimum government is best"" states, epitomize this pattern. They are also testing less, so the variant may be running rampant there as well. We may never know because they are unlikely to change their behavior at this late stage. So those who get sick and die may never be recorded as COVID victims. Texas, Georgia and Florida will legislate to reduce access to the polls, but do allow COVID free access to their citizens.

Thankfully, the Biden administration continues to increase rates of vaccination nationwide. They do so despite the intractable resistance of some gop governors.  Others like Hogan and Justice have been more responsive to the needs of their constituents.

Much of this can be placed squarely at the feet of trump, who politicized COVID from the get-go. Dr. Birx framed it well when she stated that the first 100,000 that died from COVID were awful; but understandable. The 400,000 and more who have died since, are shameful and cannot be justified."

It's not that confusing: if you haven't gotten any vaccine, don't travel. If you're fully vaccinated, you can travel but be smart and wear a mask, wash hands, etc. If you're halfway through the vaccination process like me, you should still be careful because COVID is still out there and try to defer travel until fully vaccinated. Not that hard.

This is like abstinence-only sex education--scaring people while ignoring the reality of what they're going to do and trying to make that safer doesn't work."

None were located in Montgomery county, which is home to one million people--or 1/6 of the state population. My elderly mother had to make a 2-hour round trip to get a vaccine. The line about ""wealthy Washington suburbs whose residents have proved adept at vacuuming up shots meant for other ZIP codes"" should be put in this broader context."
2021-04-01 19:33,"""Wealthy Washington suburbs whose residents have proved adept at vacuuming up shots meant for other ZIP codes""

This is not true.  Montgomery County did not have its own mass vaccination site, despite being the most populous county in the state.  We were forced to use the one in Prince George's County."
2021-04-01 19:41,"Our state does not have a single online platform for scheduling vaccination appointments, most frustrating. The state site provides a list of sites that are active but with no indication of the availability of dates and times. You have to hunt through the various web sites and even if one indicates that appointments are available they do not indicate when. After you register with the individual site it can take up to several weeks before they notify you. Even then you are not presented with a full calendar of dates showing openings. They just will state the first day available is ""date"" if you click on a ""time"" it may say unavailable so it is hit or miss. Calling to schedule is most frustrating as wait times on the phone can be 30 to 45 minutes on hold. Come on Governor Inslee this is Washington Sate, home of Microsoft, surely we can do better with online registrations."
2021-04-01 19:43,"I received the first does of the vaccine this morning and while my experience was fast with virtually no waiting, the medical facility I went to needs some operations engineers to help them speed things up.  The person who did my injection had to ask me a bunch of questions and enter the responses in their system.  I was in the room for perhaps 7 minutes of which the injection took 10 seconds and the bandaid 5.  If the limitation is injection rate, then one person could be set up to do 4000 per day if the systems around them were organized to enable that."
2021-04-01 19:45,Wouldn't one of the best ways to reach hard to reach folks is by giving vaccines to local doctors- especially in those underserved areas? Also they can do their own outreach since they generally have local patient records. People would also be more likely to trust the vaccine from a known doctor than a pop-up clinic.  I'm curious why we are favoring these popup clinics when the local doctors are already established.

I’m 62 years old￼, I signed up on the MD Mass vaccination site on Sunday, with my eligibility opening on Tuesday￼.  By noon Tuesday I received a text asking if I could go to Hagerstown, a 1.5 hour drive away￼, the following Sunday.  But, If you don’t have a car, money for gas, or time off to travel, there is no way to reach a mass vaccination site in our county, the wealthiest in the state￼, until April 1.  It took a massive lobbying ￼effort by our county council to Governor Hogan before he agreed to open the site in Montgomery County.  Also Montgomery County is the most liberal county in Maryland.  Jamie Raskin is our fantastic congressman, to give you an idea of the political leanings of this County."
2021-04-01 20:06,"There seems to be an issue in getting the vaccines from point A to point B.  There are many people who want the vaccine but in Maryland, it is not easily accessible even though there is a large number of vaccines made.  It would be much more beneficial if vaccination sites, like the one in Prince George's County, were set up in each county and if people could quickly schedule appointments online.  It is difficult for many to drive hours and wait all day to get a shot when they could already have other commitments."
2021-04-01 20:08,I was surprised last week when my doctor called me and gave me a date and time. I got vaccinated at my doctor's office and the nurse said they were doing about 100 vaccinations a week. So the local doctor thing is working.

  The population of the Eastern shore is older, Whiter, and more republican than Maryland as a whole. From what I have read there is vaccine hesitancy in that group, so take advantage of their surplus if you can.

We would have preferred to go to our local health department closer to her house, but there were no appointments and our county does not have a mass vaccination site. In fact if you go to our county health department it will direct you try to get an appointment at a mass vaccination site. So yes - people from the surrounding suburbs are going to PG County and Baltimore City - that's not a bug, that seems to be the way it was designed. Anyway I am grateful she got vaccinated."
2021-04-01 20:21,"The big gap in Maryland's plan remains undiscussed: There is no prioritization by age of those who don't have underlying medical conditions.

We know that age is a much greater driver of mortality than medical conditions.

Yes, those with one or more of these conditions is at greater risk compared to their peers, but that effect is dwarfed by the extraordinary variability in mortality based on age.

Consider these numbers from the CDC (link below):

Compared to someone ages 5 to 17 ...

People 50 to 64 are 440 TIMES more likely to die when infected with Covid.

People 40 to 49 are 130 TIMES more likely to die.

People 30 to 39 are 45 TIMES more likely to die.

People 20 to 29 are 10 TIMES more likely to die.

Deaths during the next surge could be greatly lower Maryland would resume vaccinating by age band.

And if you think these dramatic differences in mortality are matched by younger people's greater exposure due to their lifestyles, consider this:

Out of 526,000 Covid deaths, fewer than 23,000 were in people under 50. (As of data posted by CDC on April 1). 

In other words, fewer than 5% of Covid deaths have been in people under 50.

Real fast the lady at the center recognized I was witless about filling in my details so she takes over for me real nice. Detecting I would not be able to follow through, this lady connects me via phone with another lady who fills in my personal stuff with my permission. It's a late Friday and the office is staying open for my data to be processed. And by George it was: within a few days I received via internet an appointment for my 1st shot. That accomplished by really nice people, I received an appointment for my 2nd shot two weeks down the road. I showed up for that appointment late but those good people took me in. 2nd shot received . Got my card verifying the deed. I'm still amazed by the courtesy, the speed & smoothness of the process. So when I hear in an article like this one about the hazel, confusion, mess-up,
I have to shine a different light on this matter of vaccination horror stories--not that I doubt them one bit but let's shine a light on the good guys, on the success stories being accomplished protect us-The Greatest Generation unfolding before our very eyes---altho mine are drastically failing due to 81 years a grateful citizen of the USA."

It was a long process due to the number of people but all in all, I thought it was well orchestrated.  The National Guard was helping, everyone was grateful and cooperative.

2021-04-01 20:27,"I live in Montgomery County, MD and my 82 year old Mom lives in Anne Arundel County. It took several weeks of phone calls and registering on websites before I finally got her vaccine appointments at Six Flags. My boyfriend and I have driven to the Waldorf mass vaccination site to get our vaccinations.

Hogan indeed had a 'middle of the road' approach which wasted time and caused lots of frustration. Montgomery County residents have been forced to drive over an hour to different counties to get vaccinated which is just ridiculous.

Hogan was also slow to awaken to the need to engage Black and Hispanic churches and community-based centers. The improvements made to the state Covid website to pre-register have helped but he's been asleep at the wheel for too long."
2021-04-01 20:28,"Wasn’t one of the reasons that West Virginia (!) pulled off such a superb vaccination effort that they gave vaccines to local pharmacies? Local people who knew their customers, their health status, ability to (more likely not) drive in from somewhere, where they lived, finances, etc.

And then they distributed vaccines. Themselves. Everywhere. To everybody."
2021-04-01 20:29,"Maryland resident here, despite the posting address. The rollout was awful and I say that despite having gotten my shots when my age group became eligible. In order to track down an appointment, I had to go to multiple websites at odd hours of the day and night. It wasn't easy using a PC and would have been impossible with just a smartphone. In addition, one feature that seems to have been overlooked is the high percentage of allocations going to hospitals and medical groups (rather than to counties, pharmacies, and mass vaccination sites). Those providers accepted appointments from patients in their system first, so if you were in a Johns Hopkins-affiliated PPO you could get it from one of their hospitals (e.g., Suburban)  but not if you were in another practice, or not in any. Additionally, at least at the beginning, smaller counties were getting a significantly higher per capita allocation than larger ones (e.g., Montgomery, Howard, PG).

Bottom line is that there were significant systemic issues around this that made it more difficult for some Marylanders to get vaccinations than others. Gov. Hogan has done some things right around the pandemic, but this was a fail."

So why are we opening schools, restaurants and sporting events now?  If we must open, then only open to the fully vaccinated (which, now that we’re moving towards all adults being eligible, will only encourage vaccinations)."
2021-04-01 20:23,"It is amazing to me that the New York Times and rest of the media haven't addressed the OTHER challenge which is getting people booster shots when their vaccines wear off...which I've been reading is every six months for Pfizer and Moderna.

I imagine a scenario where rates of infection and death decline to point where people dont want to get their booster shots then we get upticks over and over again in a vicious cycle.

COVID 19 is beginning to look a lot like it will repeat our annual flu cycle of infections and reinfection only worse."
2021-04-01 20:21,"It boggles my mind. All 50 states have had 12 months to get a vaccine program designed and implemented. The blame always goes back to the President. Every Governor knew they were alone in this dogfight, you would think they would have accepted the responsibility and started the planning last year. The only people to blame for this inadequate fiasco is our state government and their lack of initiative."
2021-04-01 20:50,"Maryland is an example of exactly how not to handle this.  No central place to sign up for appointments, wildly complicated eligibility rules, and an absolutely glacial roll-out.  The whole thing is completely haphazard and needlessly difficult to deal with. 

I expect Maryland will be one of the very last states in the country to open eligibility to all adults, and I'd be surprised if they don't lag behind most of their peer states in percentage of citizens vaccinated over the next few months.  

So much for the vaunted efficiency of our Republican governor.  He is lucky he isn't running again in this liberal state."

We lucked out when a local health system we used frequently in the past, Adventist Health, started administering vaccines. They actually emailed us telling us they had vaccines available and sent us a link to their own registration site. My wife used her iPhone and got an appointment very easily. She got her second shot yesterday. 

Me? I rolled the dice last August and volunteered to participate in the Moderna trial. I found out in February of this year (when the study was unblinded) that I had received a vaccine and not a placebo. 

Fellow Marylanders, try Adventist Health. They really have their act together."
2021-04-01 19:44,In the picture with the person getting a vaccination nearly at the top of his arm that is just terrible - no shot should be that high - ever.
2021-04-01 20:12,"Maryland only has 6mm people and most of this is dense (5th most dense state) and urban. It is the 2nd highest in income per capita. It is both uniquely well positioned to stick a needle in people’s arms quickly and pay for it, and so it makes a poor example for other states which are less dense or simply need more doses administered.  Maryland’s failures are instead representative of the “me first” culture that is so pervasive today. People are manipulating the system for themselves. 

Once the rich and connected are vaccinated, I am sure they will all work tirelessly to ensure their poorer fellow Marylanders will get a shot. Just like they share their wealth to ensure everyone has equal access to good schools. Oh? They don’t do that?"
2021-04-01 21:01,"It amazes me how much people are criticizing the vaccine rollout. Yes, it's been far from perfect, and there are a lot of inequalities - inequalities which seem to be on the radar of those in charge and they are trying to fix them. But if you look at the big picture, the progress in the US is astounding and it gets faster every day. Even the last 10% of Americans to get the vaccine are going to probably be in the first 10% of the global population to get it. Sometimes, it is good to recognize how lucky we are, and how well we are doing compared to most of the world. I work with colleagues in Europe and Africa who are not yet close to getting it, and I am painfully aware of Americans' privilege when it comes to the vaccine."
2021-04-01 21:07,"I don't know what constitutes an under served neighborhood. Until a couple of weeks ago there were no vaccines available in my neighborhood at all and I live in a middle class section of Queens. This meant that every available shot was quickly reserved when they finally became available. 
Now it really gets ugly. Appointments are fully booked,mostly for people getting their second dose. By April 6, every person over the age 16 will qualify. Where are those doses going to come from? There has not been enough since the vaccine became available.
I am 67 and probably won't get vaccinated for weeks if am I lucky. It's already April with nothing available . I don't see how we can reach the goal of a vaccinated population by May, at least not in NY.
There is a program at Citifield where appointments are not necessary, but I don't qualify, because you need to be at least 75 years old.
Good thing I don't have plans for the summer and rarely dine out. Can't win!"
2021-04-01 21:12,"Maryland is a mess. The reason why so many people in Montgomery County flocked to the Six Flags site in neighboring PG County is simple: there was no mass vaccination site in Montgomery County, the most populated county in the state. Navigating the online system (or systems, I should say) was like the Hunger Games. My 89 yo mother called the County and got on a list to be called when slots were available; she's still waiting. Meanwhile, I spent considerable hours tracking down appointments for her and finally succeeded at getting her spots through Walgreen's. The first appointment was 3 miles from her house, and the only appointment offered for the second shot was in Baltimore city, in a neighborhood mostly populated by Black residents (she is white). I took the appointment. What was I supposed to do?"
2021-04-01 21:13,"Marylander, here.

As soon as we were eligible, my husband got on the computer and put us on four (!) lists. Whenever he tried to register us, the openings filled up under him.

He decided to get up at 2am, turned on the computer, and got both of us appointments at the same date and time at a CVS a half hour's drive from home.

First vaccine yesterday. Upper arm aches today but other than that, no issues for either of us.

Once we've had both shots and a few weeks have passed, we intend to finally gather with some neighbors who are also vaccinated -- out on their deck, masked unless eating, and distanced. We'll continue to avoid inside spaces and crowds until the ""all clear"" is sounded."
2021-04-01 21:21,"Didn’t the prior guy have a military general in charge of distribution and logistics? Perhaps Operations Warp Speed was more like operation Flat Tire, and we forgot to check on the spare. I’m sorry to admit the US did not show its best during this disaster."
2021-04-01 21:21,"No doubt the COVID-19 vaccination roll out could have been planned better and implemented better, but in my own family's experience, and that of our friends and neighbors, it has worked well enough in Baltimore MD.

An article about Maryland and COVID-19 vaccines such as this one might have referenced the large numbers of vaccine doses that are being produced in Maryland (for the state, the nation, and the world) and also, alas, the 15,000,000 vaccine doses that were ruined recently in a Baltimore MD production facility due to human error. Mistakes happen."
2021-04-01 21:22,"Get your facts straight.  The Six Flags mass vaccination site was and is not intended solely for the zip codes near that site. While it is located in Prince George's County, the Six Flags site is run by the State of Maryland, and is open to all Maryland state residents. 

In mid-February, I received a text alert from Maryland's GoVax system that spots were available at Six Flags for state residents who were eligible at the time.  I promptly signed up my 70yo (and therefore eligible) husband for the vaccine.  In registering for his appointments, I answered all questions -- including our home address, which clearly shows that we do not live in PG County -- honestly.  I had no problem securing an appointment for him.  

We've been told to ""get the vaccine when it is your turn"" since the start of the rollout, so I thought it was a good thing that we were able to arrange that appointment so promptly.  (The alert that Six Flags had spaces available was the first opportunity we had to sign him up for the vaccine.)

While of course vaccine equity is extremely important, it is up to the State/counties to set rules and limits if certain appointments are meant to be available only to those in certain zip codes.  It is wrong to characterize those who are 100% following the state's rules as ""vacuuming up"" appointments at a site that all Maryland residents in the applicable priority group were eligible to sign up for."
2021-04-01 21:24,"Mass vaccination sites aren't convenient for anyone who doesn't own a car. And even if you do, you might not have time to wait in a line of cars. 

Have a central reservation system, both online and by phone. Collect the individual's contact information once. Ask them what dates and times they would be available, and at what  locations. Allocate the vaccine doses based on the data collected. 

Then, assign timed appointments at neighborhood-based sites: physicians' offices, pharmacies, grocery stores, community centers, and libraries."
2021-04-01 21:28,"When one reads the notes below, it becomes clear that just about every ethnic and economic group commenting considers itself victimized.

I'm old enough to remember the nationwide mass polio shots and fluoride treatments that rolled out in good order during the fifties. Maybe if today's populations learned something about working together, things would roll out better today."
2021-04-01 21:52,"Given the enormity of this task --vaccinating hundreds of millions of people -- of course the response has not been perfect.  All-in-all, though, it seems like it going reasonably well.

Somehow vaccines were developed much faster than most believed possible, manufactured in vast numbers at a record pace, and are now being broadly distributed through a makeshift network. 

I'm sure there many improvements that should, can, and will be made.  All in all, though, this country, despite its deep divisions, is doing a good job of making vaccinations happen."
2021-04-01 21:57,"I live in Maryland. The vaccine registration process here is a disaster. You have to check four or five times per day at at least three different websites (CVS, Walgreens, the mass vaccination sites) in an effort to secure an appointment. This great advantages people with time on their hands and acumen at navigating the internet.

We had eight months to prepare for this. We could have had everyone registered and prioritized in November 2020. Your average deli knows how to manage crowds better than Governor Hogan."
2021-04-01 22:11,"People have different attitudes to vaccines. Large groups of people prefer not to be vaccinated and are not required to do so even though it makes the community more vulnerable to potential disease and even death. Those who are willing to be vaccinated because of a greater personal sense of  social responsibility than others should be commended for protecting all of us. 
Those who take the personal risk of getting vaccinated  should not be denigrated as ""vacuuming up the vaccines."""
2021-04-01 22:15,"I am eligible in Maryland and have not been able to get an appointment. I work during the day and cannot go to the sites dozens of times to see if there are openings, which there never are. So many people I know have somehow jumped the line and gotten vaccinated even if they were not officially eligible. It seems very unfair. Virginia does it so much more efficiently."
2021-04-01 22:16,"Yes it is a mess here in Maryland. I go to numerous internet site everyday, and check one-by-one. I find interesting that in populous part of the  state nothing is available. My family and friends in other states don't face this kind of hassle."
2021-04-01 22:17,"The mass vaccination sign-up site here in Maryland site was a nightmare.  We were able to connect for my wife's first shot by contacting a chain drug store in the remotest corner of the state. (I had been able, because of a work connection, to get mine earlier in Virginia, whose process was comparatively sane.)"
2021-04-01 22:17,I live in Maryland. One thing I can’t understand is why didn’t they have vaccine clinics set up at all the schools and colleges? These are are centrally located near populated areas. Vaccinate residence by zip code?
2021-04-01 22:22,"I live in Montgomery County, Maryland and am in the age 65-74 cohort.  I consider myself to be very computer literate, yet was unable to get a COVID vaccine appointment online after 2 months of trying, every day, at all hours of the day and night. The only people getting vaccines that I knew had gotten “hot tips” about where doses were available, or had an “in,” such as someone I know who sits on the board of Suburban Hospital.  

Ultimately, I gave up trying to find an appointment online and instead called the phone number for appointments on the Maryland website.  To my amazement someone answered the phone and signed me up for an appointment at M&T Bank Stadium.  I felt like I’d just won the lottery (which in a way I had).  

The entire rollout of vaccine distribution in Maryland has been a catastrophe, and the buck stops with Larry Hogan.  Shamefully, he grossly under-allocated doses to Montgomery Country, which consists overwhelmingly of Democratic voters.  That was no accident, according to the Montgomery County Council members to whom I’ve spoken.

Needless to say Hogan won’t be getting my vote if he decides to run for higher office."

2021-04-01 21:34,I am so tired of news reports decrying vaccine hesitancy. The willing eligible adults cant get appointments for love or money—-don't you dare bring up “hesitancy” as the “problem“ as long as people who are interested in the vaccine continue to face impossible bureaucracy and incompetence in supposed distribution.  You are reporting the wrong end of the story.
2021-04-01 20:03,“The people in those cars didn’t look like people in this county”.  That’s a pretty racist comment for a pastor or anyone else.  Was he not able to understand what a mass vaccination site meant?
2021-04-01 20:58,"Mass vaccination sites has been Maryland's problem, not its solution.  Get the people to the shots?  We should be getting the shots to the people.  I spent 4 hours taking my neighbor to a drive-in mass site, where we waited 45 minutes in a line of cars burning gas and spouting fumes all over the health care workers and National Guard trying to give the shots.  Stupid and deplorable.  I waited but still had to have someone pull strings for me to get a shot only 1/2 hour away and I live in a fairly large bedroom community for both DC and Baltimore.

Get the shots to the people.  Getting the people to the shots is not working very well."
2021-04-01 21:25,"Another Marylander here.

Poor planning.

Poor execution. 

Poor government collaboration between state and cities/counties.

From 100M in 100 days to 200M and it may reach 300M. Actually what is happening is as predicted by Trump and his people which was ridiculed by liberal media, Biden and Democrats."

She STILL CANNOT get an appointment for the vaccine. I am also 59, with high blood pressure. Neither of these complicating factors are noted on the County virus registration website. Yet I have to read that 10-20 percent of of the vaccinations at the Regency Stadium inoculation super site are given to people from VA and Delaware.  As a result, I am very disappointed in the State Of Maryland’s vaccine rollout. Their criteria that allows out of staters ahead of Marylanders is massive incompetence. I still can’t even get a public COVID test without showing serious symptoms AND a Dr’s note.  Just now getting to  Tier 2B vaccine registrations after four months...four months and still only first responders and those  65/75 and older are getting vaccinated??? Massive idiocy and incompetence by the state of Maryland and County Health Departments. No drugstores in our County can distribute the vaccine, only the health department. I did not think that Hogan and Charles County would mess up COVID testing and vaccinations as bad as his predecessor O’Malley messed up the ACA rollout in Maryland, but Hogan has. Disgraceful. Really makes my blood boil."
2021-04-01 22:01,"Republican Governor Hogan here has botched COVID and the vaccination process.  Hogan says he deferred to local counties on masks and reopening, but rejected the attempts of the more urban and democratic counties to put science and safety first.  He also released vaccines last to those counties and refused to set up a mass vaccination center in the most populous county.  Instead he spent millions of taxpayer dollars on bogus test kits from Korea and wrote a self-promoting book about it. No planning or coordination was done with County governments, as vaccines were prioritized for the connected.  Thousands of lives were lost unnecessarily.  If you like Trump and Chris Christie, you will love Hogan."
2021-04-01 19:56,"As a Marylander (I grew up in sleepy Bethesda, Montgomery County, before the Metro) I am heartened to see the state turning out to make sure everyone gets vaccinated.  The people, the places, and the vaccines are all available for the big push to administer the vaccine.  The problem is assuring access for everyone - this involves a combination of technology (a state-wide computer platform that smoothly links people to the nearest location) and outreach (to the vaccine-hesitant, the disabled, those without computer access).   Bless Governor Hogan for stepping up.  With brains and good will, solving the tech and outreach problems is manageable under his leadership.  My only caveat is to re-open the state's economy with due diligence by continuing following CDC guidelines (see ""Community Mitigation"" web-page) to avoid resurgence of this wily, dangerous virus.  Other Southern Republican governors please take note -  especially bad-boy Florida and clueless Texas."

2021-04-01 21:18,"""Maryland offers a microcosm of the issues states face as they rush to open enough vaccination sites to meet President Biden’s goal of making every adult eligible for Covid-19 shots by May 1.""

This sentence shows the problem with Joe Biden's approach. Making people eligible for the vaccines does not depend on how many vaccination sites are open. Nor with how much vaccine is available. It can simply be done by fiat. 

Thus, Joe Biden's goal of making every adult eligible for vaccines by May 1 makes no sense. In fact, it's counterproductive. Demand still greatly exceeds supply, yet he increases demand. Better to let those who should have priority in getting vaccines get that priority. 

Take my state, California. As of today, I am eligible by age for a vaccine. Yet there are no appointments available, and there won't be for weeks. To make matters worse, tens of millions more people will become eligible in two weeks. It's just chaos. 

To be eligible for a vaccine means nothing when there is no way to get a vaccine. It's just politics to abandon all priorities in the pretense that that will somehow increase vaccination supply or rates. 

Dumb move, Joe Biden. Dumb move."
2021-04-01 22:27,"I think the best approach is all approaches. Mass sites, hospitals, local clinics, primary physicians, pharmacies, pop up clinics, etc. Have phone registration available for people who aren't good with the internet. Have walk-in appointments available. Do it all. 

Oh, and use the J&J vaccine intelligently. Don't give it to someone who owns a car and has a flexible schedule. Give it to someone who doesn't have transportation or who has an inflexible schedule. Give it to people not likely to show up for a second shot. Use it for walk-ins at off times, since it can be stored in a normal freezer. Use it for pop-up clinics, or for home vaccine delivery, due to the much easier transport requirements. 

We need to get shots in the arms of every single person who will take it, even if it means a mobile vax wagon shows up at their residence to give it to them. 

This is our only way to return life in the US to anything approaching normal. 

And get this distribution down properly, because we are probably going to need to do it on a yearly basis for the next few years. 

Have received both doses of Moderna. I didn't have much of a problem getting an appointment once I qualified, but, I'm good at using the internet, own a car, and have a flexible schedule, so i was able to try sites until I got through and accept the first appointment offered."

I signed up on the state’s website (I live in Montgomery Co.)  They offered me an appointment at Six Flags— not convenient, but I was willing to shell out about $40 in each direction for Lyft.  Then I learned that the vaccine is delivered only to those sitting in cars.
I am a good citizen and wait my turn, but that they completely overlooked the problem for non-drivers (many of whom are likely to be disabled, elderly and/or low income) is obnoxious.  I am again on a waiting list for an appointment."
2021-04-01 22:44,"“leaving two-thirds of the population still unprotected.”

What does limiting vaccine eligibility to those 65+  have to do with 2/3 being unprotected? The problem is a supply/demand imbalance, which will continue for the next couple of months. Changing the eligibility criteria would have simply changed who was unprotected."
2021-04-01 22:56,"States and counties need a single web site (or phone number) where you can schedule a vaccination, or at the least get on a waiting list. 
The idea of each pharmacy having its own is nuts. I went through this in NY in February, frequently checking all the pharmacy web sites for availability. Numerous times when I found a slot, it was gone before I could type my info in. And each time, I had to start over again - no waiting list. Eventually I was lucky enough to find one in the next county and was vaccinated. I was fortunate to be web savvy and have the time do this. For others, it would be hopeless.
But it should not have been like this. State and county governments should have started dealing with this last fall when CDC told them to get ready.
Eventually, after I was vaccinated the county and state did set up a centralized system.
That said, the US is doing a whole lot better than Europe."
2021-04-01 22:53,"I wish for everyone who wants a vaccine gets it. I could not understand why, if I’d had the vaccine’s 2 doses and waited 2 weeks to sashay out... why did CDC insist I still wear a mask.
I’m immune, aren’t I?
Apparently, I am... so long as variances don’t get in the way. But, here’s the bad news... I could be a carrier and not know it.
Here’s the deal. Up here in AK, you can go to some providers (Freddys, pharm, Eagle River) and get just 1 shot. Not quite as effective as the 2 dose, but apparently, it’ll keep you out of the hospital and off the ventilator. Pls, pls consider it."

They may be more concerned about the personal risk of the vaccine, less concerned about contributing to community than others, and/or for political reasons. My nurse thanked me for stepping forward and taking the shot, which I very much appreciated and had not expected the thank you.  Those who do step forward and take the personal risk
for the sake of the community, for the sake of community immunity,  of being vaccinated should be thanked for the community spirit which others may not have. The reluctant are an acute risk to the community, and we will solve that problem by thanking those who get the shots. Journalists who characterize those getting the shots as ""vacuuming the shots"" are very sadly part of the problem we are having."

2021-04-01 23:12,"A remarkable inefficiency in scheduling is that these scheduling systems do not talk to each other, so that my wife & I are getting invitations to set appointments from several systems, even after getting one, then two shots.

Sadly, they are needed because the confusion of the rollout, the lack of a central registration system, and other barriers. I was thrilled to also learn that PG County Library is now offering a vaccine hunter’ s hotline to help as well.

2021-04-01 23:37,"Montgomery County resident here, senior citizen. 
 How we got our vaccines: We limited our search to sites that are close by us, as my spouse is in pain, in active cancer treatment, is immune-compromised  and cannot tolerate more than a short car ride. 

So, we signed up with Safeway, Walgreens and Giant but they did not have pre-registration lists so we did not bother to check them after a few days. You had to check constantly apparently. 
We pre-registered with our county health department but they were following their own eligibility guidelines so it would take longer to be eligible. They were the last to contact us. 

The only other sites we tried were hospital groups with locations in our county: Adventist Hospital, Holy Cross Hospital, and MedStar Hospital. All three offer pre-registration but also require you to fill out online forms and/or create an online patient  account. This step may turn off some people who are not used to such things.  The vaccine is free to you no matter where you get it. Insurance card is asked for but is not actually required. 
Bottom line: one of the hospitals offered us appts within a few weeks of sign up. We took them. Soon, another hospital offered us appts, which we declined of course. 
Meanwhile, many of my fellow senior friends spent several hours a day for weeks, chasing shots and then hours driving to other counties to get them. It became a sport for them! Nevertheless, we had our vaccines before at least half of them. Thank Heaven."
2021-04-01 23:37,"I have the luxury to work from home and to take time off in the middle of the day to drive to a mass vax site. I would say I am privilege.  Yesterday, I received my Covid Vax in Hagerstown, MD.  A 59 mile drive from my home.  And during the long drive I kept thinking to myself there is no way to get everyone vax'ed under these conditions.  The system is not sustainable.  For example, how do the long haul truckers who drove next to me on I70 get their vax? Surely you can't expect these folks to ginny up for a vax appointment on a Wednesday afternoon. We need to think more cross cutting than just what is inside state lines.  Industry needs to get involved too - especially those sectors participating in large scale manual labor.   I applaud the efforts of the State of MD to target the needs of various culturals and  economic conditions but we have to go farther."
2021-04-01 23:42,"Reality check time. The state of Maryland has a population of 6 million people spread across 12,407 square miles. Current covid death count: 8,303 dead. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has a population of 7.5 million people cramped into 426 square miles. Current covid death count: 205 dead. The death count was never mentioned in this article. This is all part of American denial of reality, even in the face of historic death. Words can't really describe the level of total failure when it comes to covid in the US, so I guess people don't try. But for the most part, I think it's because Americans don't understand how bad things are.  If Maryland or any other US state wants to improve the situation, it will take a giant cultural change that is not happening. This will include having a nation that values public health, education, and having the ability to follow rules. None of these are currently present in the US."

2021-04-01 23:43,"I am of the opinion we need to vaccinate as quickly as possible. That means get everyone who will go through a mass vac site through it as quickly as possible. In the mean time, figure out clever solutions for getting hesitant people to the table, work to provide help for those who need it. We can do both at the *same time*, because there will be enough vaccine. This doesn’t just go to the first X number of people and the stragglers are left to die. Everyone who wants to be vaccinated will have vaccine available to them. In the mean time, the more arms jabbed, the better for every one. It’s crazy to hold up 100 vaccinations so you can convince 1 person. Especially if they have a “wait and see attitude.”  Ok, fine - how many millions of people do you need to see?"
2021-04-01 23:49,"I had a difficult time, like many of the residents of Maryland, in getting a vaccine appointment (in my case, in rural Alabama). However, when vaccine supply increased significantly in the last few weeks, I was able to schedule my shot at a local Walmart.
   The Walmart web page is well designed, and the individuals involved in giving the shots seem competent and well organized. I don’t know if Walmarts in Maryland are involved in vaccine deployment, but if they are, I highly recommend scheduling an appointment there.
   It’s been exactly a week since my first Moderna vaccine, and I am looking forward to my second on April 22."
2021-04-01 23:57,"I signed up at 12:01 a.m. the day I was eligible for two mass vax sites in Maryland. To my great surprise I got a text the next evening with an appointment availability at Six Flags. I immediately responded yes. One shot down and one to go.

It’s true that people lacking internet access and/or skills are a great disadvantage in Maryland. I managed to get an internet-adverse neighbor an appointment at a local community health center. But you truly have both internet savvy and quick to get an appointment."
2021-04-02 0:13,"In my area of NJ there are Twitter Angels (all female) who have each helped scores and scores of seniors get appointments. I reached out to my community to see if I could help and was rebuffed. I am internet savvy (snagged vaccines for spouse and I as soon as eligible by sheer persistence) but I don’t use Twitter. Apparently there is an info flow on Twitter that is helpful. I don’t know if that is true in other states, but in my neck of the woods it is."
2021-04-02 0:42,"Based on our observations while passing through Maryland this week, getting people vaccinated is not the only hurdle that needs to be overcome. We couldn't believe the number of people on the streets and in the service areas without masks. It left us wondering if masks were optional."
2021-04-02 0:44,"Geez, I thought Maryland was doing pretty well! I am not over 60 and don't have any big comorbidities, so I figured I would have to wait another month or more to get vaccinated. (I do have asthma, but COPD is the only pulmonary condition thatgrantas one eligibility thus far.) But then my Prince George's County Council representative sent an email saying that everyone 16 or over should pre-register at three sites: County, State, and one company site. I did so, and got an email from the private sector site within 48 hours telling me to register for my first vaccination appointment. I got my first shot on Monday - many weeks before I ever expected to. It was all quite efficient."
2021-04-01 21:40,"Since there are many GOP who refuse to take the vaccine make it mandatory.  No vaccine no job ,no airplane ride no schools.  I have underlying health issues and got the vaccine so can you.  Not getting a vaccine shows you are not a true patriot and don’t care about your fellow American.  Shame on you."
2021-04-02 0:48,"I now live in Maryland.

I received both vaccine shots a month ago from my primary care group.  They sent me an email, I responded immediately and had the first shot two days later."
2021-04-02 0:49,"I am now eligible, and the vaccine finder website is showing absolutely no available “first shot” appointments, I keep checking and rechecking. As suggested on the social media universe, I’ve also walked into places ‘end of day’ to check for leftover vaccines, also to no avail. I’ve also signed up for Dr. B without luck. If anything spurred my efforts besides wanting Ii save my life and others, it’s the situation of a friend’s friend, who is watching her father die from COVID, even though he had a vaccine appointment."
2021-04-02 1:20,"This article is a bit misleading. The pastor noting that many of the people going into the Six Flags mass vaccination site didn't look like locals. Well, that's because the neighboring Montgomery County, for one, doesn't have its own mass vaccination site. So, of course, many people from there have to head over to Prince George's County. This was one issue with Maryland that's been frustrating. We've been told, here in Montgomery County, that there's a new site opening up up in Germantown, here in the county, supposedly next week. We'll see."
2021-04-02 1:30,"There's no question that availability is the issue here in MD.  We live in Prince George's.  I'm 69 and only got my first shot a bit more than a week ago.  My spouse is 55 and they don't have vaccine for her yet, despite Gov. Hogan ""opening up the guidelines"".  

We both have the same large healthcare provider with their own website and reservation system.  It worked great for me, but success is contingent on availability and that's the big bottleneck here even until today."
2021-04-02 1:35,"On Tuesday, my custodian at my small business was finally eligible to register for an appointment. I signed him up for two mass sites to contact him for an appointment. Today he was contacted to sign up and he has an appointment next week. Sure, he had a little extra tech support but having to wait 8 days doesn’t seem too bad. Marylanders are just grumpy it took a while to get organized."
2021-04-02 1:41,"I live in MD, and the approach for vaccinating the population is so fractured. Thankfully, there are volunteer groups like Maryland Equity Vaccine Hunters who know how to navigate the system and get people appointments. Through them, my husband and I were vaccinated. 

Some examples of the disarray follow. One, you get a text saying appointments are available, but the link provided takes you to the main State page about vaccination vs. a place to sign up for an appointment. Two, the eligibility criteria differ based on the provider (e.g., department of health, vs. pharmacy) and the location (e.g., my county vs. the neighboring one). The governor is not collaborating with all county executives so ours has to scramble to help county residents when the governor makes proclamations at press conferences without informing them in advance. 

I know one problem is that it’s hard to determine eligibility with a distributed healthcare system. But, there is not excuse for the governor not working with country executives, or blaming residents for slow vaccine uptake cause by his poor execution of the vaccine rollout."
2021-04-02 1:57,"Goes to prove again that private medicine is not public health. NY is similar. Trump, I meant Cuomo, can open up eligibility all he wants, but securing an appointment is not nearly as simple. I wouldn't have found a site had I not been a City employee.

We'll miss de Blasio when it's too late."
2021-04-02 2:05,"I received my first BioNTech shot yesterday. I am 63 and it took 3 weeks of scouring the pharmacy options; CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreens, before I nailed an appointment. It was a ritual every morning for 3 weeks, trying to find a shot.

Despite the difficulties, I am still amazed that we have come this far. I was expecting this virus to destroy us, but we have prevailed. The volunteers who are dedicated to administering the vaccines are amazing."
2021-04-02 2:17,"Providing physicians the vax to give their patients sounds inefficient but in the end is a good strategy especially for those who don't have computers or are reluctant. I spent a lot of time trying to persuade two close friends who were afraid of the vax to get the shots. They finally went ahead and got vaxed, but it wasn't my powers of persuasion that did the trick.  It was their doctor who talked them into it. 

I think doctors' office staff should call patients to see if they have been vaccinated. Then the doctor him/herself should call back those who replied in the negative. Getting their patients vaccinated should be a primary objective of any practice."
2021-04-02 2:15,"I have a good friend in Takoma Park who commented on the dis-organization of the system in MD.  I have heard that the VT online system was having some issues, and luckily I dealt with a real person.  I just keep thinking to myself that this nightmare did not have to be as scary as it is; I know who I am holding complicit.  And it is not a perfume."
2021-04-02 2:28,"Producing and rolling out a vaccine to hundred of millions of people: Complicated (especially when unprepared).

Putting on a mask, washing hands, being mindful of social distancing, when possible: Not complicated."
2021-04-02 2:34,"The idea of signing people up one by one through computers is crazy. How do you sign up and schedule 260 million American adults?

Yet, there was a clear need, especially early on, to match the number coming in to any location on a given day with the capacity, both in vaccines and in shot administrators. It's a complicated matter on a giant scale.

Can there be other approaches to getting this done? YES!

About five to six weeks ago my wife, Janet, and I sat down to try to figure out a better way or at least a way that would be more accessible. One idea we came up with fairly quickly was scheduling people in by zip code, using the US Mail's Every Door Direct System. At that time, no one under 75, with few exceptions, have been vaccinated where we live in Maryland. Of course, there are complications to using such a method but most can be addressed.

Our effort was oriented around a non-profit corporation that I operate with idea of first providing shots near where we live and expanding to the classic underserved areas. We have volunteers, including one retired medical doctor, ready to start any time.

There is no known system for how community groups can sign up to provide shots in Maryland. We have gotten very little or no response from those we have contacted. We are not ready to give up but close.

Our group is called Emergency Services (Network), Inc.  We also operate another non-profit that runs a farmers market donating thousands of pounds of produce every summer."
2021-04-02 2:36,"I live in Maryland and pre-registered online with my county health department on March 13.  They acknowledged my pre-registration the next business day and said they would call me with an appointment time as they became available.  They called me on March 22 with a choice of several appointment times on March 24.  I made the appointment time, then got my vaccine and also made an appointment for my second vaccine before I left.  I was out in 45 minutes.  One email, one phone call and that was it.  The whole process was very well organized."
2021-04-02 2:37,"I'm 61 and completed what was called a vaccine interest form with the County health department and another with the local hospital back in February and then with my primary care physician's office a couple of weeks ago. Last Saturday the state health department sent me a link for appointments at a local health care facility—not a stadium, but pretty big—and I got the first jab on Wednesday. Today my physician's office called offering an appt on Saturday. It has been a very smooth process for me. Also joyful."
2021-04-02 2:38,"In our community, we have lots of options for getting the vaccine, including a mass site prepared with one thousand shots/day.  The challenge is a community where we’ll be lucky if 50% will accept it.  Yesterday, the mass site managed to give 244, and managed to get 30 others to take it at a local grocery."
2021-04-02 2:51,"I live in Baltimore County. I registered on the Baltimore County website two weeks ago. Next Friday, I am scheduled to get my first shot! The place i have to go to get the shot is about a 45-minute drive, which  does not make sense because the Walgreens and CVS are also providing the vaccine, both are 1-mile away from my home. Nevertheless, i will do the 45-minute drive."
2021-04-02 3:15,"I scrambled to find an appointment at one of the pharmacies and pre-registered for the mass vaccination sites.  It took effort (by me and friends) and was offered slots at a Walmart, a CVS and the mass vaccination site in Hagerstown which is the one I choose despite the distance (canceling / declining  the others).

The new problem -- I continue to receive offers for slots through the pre-registration system despite having been vaccinated.  I guess this is only a problem if someone else is not receiving the offer while the system waits for me to reply.  I have tried to figure out how to tell the system that I am done but so far with no luck."
2021-04-02 3:45,"Our choice in rural america was simple.  The county health department or the nearest clinic.  No pharmacies in the county.  The nearest clinic or pharmacy is a 30 mile drive and even there, the pharmacy is not providing service..  Supply was and is the problem.  Once our county got supplies, we have reached 88% of all those over 65, 100% of first responders and a good portion of critical workers.   We just started all adults over 16.  If we had the supply, we would be done by now."
2021-04-02 3:24,"As a resident of Maryland, I know full well the issues described here. This has been an absolute DISASTER. 

""Another focus of criticism in Maryland, as in many other states, has been the system for scheduling vaccine appointments. Instead of a single online portal where people can view available appointments across the state, every provider has its own online appointment system, which means people often have to look through multiple sites to find a slot.""

Liking your local pharmacy is great, and it's a convenient place for your shot. That works OK, for example, with a flu shot which is in plentiful supply.

Where MD lost it is that covid-19 vaccine is in short supply, and every location is doing its own scheduling. And I don't mean Walgreens vs. Safeway vs. Giant. No - every store is doing its own scheduling. So trying to make an appointment means trying hundreds of individual stores !!!  Absolutely insane.

We finally received ours from the county health department, for which you could pre-register once and get notified when appointments were available.

This fiasco put a serious dent in Gov. Hogan's 2024 Presidential effort. People will not forget this any time soon."
2021-04-02 9:28,"I live and work in Montgomery County, MD, a wealthy county. The vaccine rollout here was awful--believe me, it wasn't just the underserved who were unvaxed! They have done a terrible job on the local level--how much is Hogan's fault I do not know, but I DO know other counties (Howard County, for one) did a MUCH better job than Montgomery County! As an urgent care physician in his mid-seventies practicing here, I had to go to Howard County for the vaccine!"
2021-04-02 9:56,"I live in western Maryland. When I first became eligible for the vaccine the supply was very limited. Our county was getting 500 shots a week with an ever growing waiting list over 20,000. While it took awhile to find the right number, I called and found myself in a queue waiting to make an appointment. I got an option to be called back, and within 45 minutes I did receive a call and had an appointment in Baltimore, about 90 minutes away. Got my first shot and an appointment for my second. In the meantime, a mass vaccine center has opened about 20 minutes away and most eligible people I speak to have received or are scheduled. 

I have to complement the civilians and national guard folks that staffed the mass vaccination site in Baltimore. They were highly organized, very polite and handled the process extremely well. Although the initial start here in Maryland was slow, I give the state credit for getting everything organized in the face of an evolving pandemic and the uncertainty of vaccine supply"
2021-04-02 10:06,"Throughout the pandemic, the tendency in reporting news about COVID has been to celebrate certain state governments that somehow fit a political narrative whilst criticizing or demeaning others. I was in Detroit (a poor and shut down inner city for sure) last week for three days, and was happily surprised that many people (under 50) with whom I came into contact had already received at least their first vaccine.  In fact, anyone working in the city limits of Detroit regardless of age or where they reside can get the vaccine.  In my home state of FL, our county has been offering vaccines in a plethora of locations, rural and urban and to people 16+ with existing medical conditions for several weeks.   In fact nearly 10 million Floridians have already received a vaccination.  Apart from some early missteps, most states are beginning to understand that the main issue is not a lack of vaccination or even locations where to administer one.  In fact, the biggest challenge is that the many people have decided not to get vaccinated.  In Massachusetts, over 30% of frontline workers (police and hospital) have refused the vaccine.  Regardless, I am sure that the great state of Maryland will take appropriate actions to successfully vaccinate the majority of the population who want one.  Overall, the US is doing a much better job with the vaccination process than much of the EU, where nations are currently 600 days away from achieving full vaccination.  The US should get there in 120."
2021-04-02 11:26,"As another Marylander adding to this story, I would say that, like every state, we suffered initially through a shortage of available vaccines.  That was bad enough and caused much scrambling to try to find locations where there was vaccine and to secure an appointment.  However, as others have said, what caused the most chaos was the multiplicity of sign up sites and reservation lists, which led to many long and often wasted hours trying to ""get in line"", since each of those sites had limited supplies of vaccines.  This was exacerbated by politicians (including the governor)  going on TV and announcing things that were not reflected on websites or any other reality. Once an appointment was secured, the actual process of going to the site and getting the shots was well managed, smooth and efficient.  Lessons?  Yes. As a post mortem, a serious look needs to be made at the ""process"", especially the registration and sign up methodology.  They made this more chaotic and difficult than it needed to be."
2021-04-02 4:50,"I got my vaccine over a month ago here in Texas and was quite relieved. Meanwhile I sat in my home refreshing the myriad pages I had open between CVS, Walgreens and county health clinics for my mother who is 64 sitting in Maryland who couldn’t find anything for herself. For being a stone’s throw from DC and home to many federal workers, Maryland’s rollout was so poorly done, you’d think incompetent people were running this operation. We always joke give this to a Chick Fil-A to run, I think in Maryland’s case that might have been true."
2021-04-02 5:24,Looking at the NYT data it appears that the worst conditions are in the states with the most restrictions. Is there a reason for this?
2021-04-02 8:19,Shame on Governor Hogan for his partisan decision-making regarding vaccination sites! Truly unbelievable when it is a matter of life and death. I hope he can sleep at night.
2021-04-02 5:42,It is really a shame that the most developed nation in the world does not have a centralized system for scheduling and tracking vaccinations. No wonder the poor cannot afford to get vaccinated; they wouldn't know how to get one.

2021-04-02 11:55,"The US has a fragmented healthcare system using many computer systems which cannot talk to each other.  Many hospital systems want to keep it that way, so that their patients cant easily seek care elsewhere.  The difficulties with covid vaccine online signups are evidence of this fragmentation.  The US should have a system where all healthcare records can be easily accessed and shared while ensuring patient confidentiality.  Walter Weiss, MD, MPH"
2021-04-02 12:11,One big problem for Hogan is putting the failed Trump crony  Robert R. Redfield in charge of Maryland health.
2021-04-02 12:32,"People having a hard time should check vaccinespotter.org — it collates the pharmacies and other smaller providers for each state making it very easy to see where there is availability. There are 10  sites with openings in MD at the moment, for example. It even tells you the vaccine type. This is a nonprofit site meant to make searching easier. Good luck!"
2021-04-02 13:02,"From the beginning, Maryland's system favored people with time, patience, a computer, and a car ... and a high tolerance for frustration and confusion. Things are improving, but it doesn't help that Governor Hogan has opened things up (like sporting events and restaurants) before a substantial portion of the population is vaccinated."

2021-04-02 14:35,"The former guy’s administration had a year to lead in figuring this out and apparently did not. A single payer health care system might have aided in developing a more effective rollout. 

The good news is that as more doses are manufactured more avenues of distribution can be supplied."
2021-04-02 14:42,"Forty years of “ the government is the problem” weakened it. So now we discover that it lacks public health effectiveness, emphasis on “public”. We get what we deserve. From the former guy’s chaos to states’s disorganization."
2021-04-02 15:16,"Let's also remember that unlike CDC guidance, and regional practice, and most other states, Hogan pushed the most vulnerable people - adults with medical conditions that would put them at risk for severe COVID and death, and INCLUDING front facing essential workers like grocery workers - down the list continually.  First, they were all in 1B, after the seniors and medical and first responders who were the most vulnerable.  On Jan. 5 he moved these people and grocery workers to 1c.  On Jan. 25 he moved the medically vulnerable to Phase 2.  Then he moved everyone else ahead of them.  Grocery worker?  Good luck.  Livery driver with cancer?  Diabetic bus driver?  Forget it.  He OPENED the state without vaccinating the medically vulnerable.  And then when he finally got to Phase 2, he AGAIN moved the medically vulnerable down to a newly created 2B.  Only now can they even sign up for vaccinations - and guess what, so can everyone else.  Clear to people here that he does not think people with medical conditions have any lives of value, are worth saving.  Pretty interesting since if he weren't governor he'd be right there too.  His treatment of people with medical conditions doesn't portend well for how he might treat such people on a national scale if he ever does attain national office.  And that's a significant number of Americans whose lives he seems to think aren't of value."
2021-04-02 15:43,"I am a retired physician, but I have maintained an active medical license in the state where I live. In the county where we live the volunteering requirements are needlessly obstructive. I do not know another way to describe them. 

During my active career I'd give thousands of injections--many far more complex than the simple intramuscular injections needed for the COVID vaccines. I have read more articles about COVID and the vaccines via the public and professional press than I've read since my fellowship days.

Looking at all the expected hoops for volunteering in my own county, I gave up and went next door to a smaller (and bit more rural) county where there were not the same obstacles to volunteering; it was much simpler in terms of requirements (copy of medical license, etc) and I have been giving shots one afternoon a week for some time now.

There is little reason why volunteering should be so difficult in several (if not many) parts of the country. This experience with volunteering to give vaccinations is not unusual."
2021-04-02 18:52,"The state's disorganized lack of central methodology in getting an appointment is a disaster, it's like  winning the lottery if you actually get in. It has cost lives and I hope ended Hogan's political career. I'm 68 and have multiple serious health issues,  am computer savvy and have the time to look at all hours. The problem is availability. I live in a very small city in a large rural county (Frederick), and there are no local stores, pharmacies  or hospitals giving the vaccine. In fact, there are no sites within 20 miles of me in the whole county. and I physically can't drive an hour or two to a mass vax site to wait in line. I registered at the county health site when I was first eligible, but as Hogan cut their weekly supply (as reported) and further pushed down my eligibility demographic, I never even got contacted to confirm I was on the list. Finally, I got a call from the local community college I worked at a few hours a week before the shutdown because my supervisor there was kind enough to put me on their educator's list. What a nightmare this has been, I feel like I have PTSD from it, and I feel for everybody else for what they go through to get a shot. I lived through the 50's polio vaccine roll-out, it should not be this hard, it just needs to be organized for better efficiency. This could have all been avoided by utilizing the federal public health system partnering with local and state resources; local community schools would have been the perfect venue."
2021-04-02 17:18,"Maryland's approach has been nothing less than criminal, driven by partisan politics.  Governor Hogan has put Mass Vax sites in Republican counties or Republican areas in Democrat counties. His blatant refusal to make his Mass Vax sites accessible to the largest county in the state, Montgomery County, whose health department is also not able to obtain vaccinations, while rural counties are operating at 33% capacity due to lack of demand is shocking in its openly partisan nature.  He erased all of his good actions of last year with his actions around the vaccinations, putting citizens lives at risk across the most fragile populations."

2021-04-02 14:50,"Governor Hogan seemed to start off on the right foot.  But things have shifted in him from governance to focusing on being the Republican candidate for president, and sadly, he has now seemingly shifted to doing what the donors need----the interests of big business and the white wealthy clique.  I will be forever grateful for his speaking out on Trump, but he needs to get back to governing MD.  To wit:

1) Establishing a single system to register for shots
2) Getting the trash and debris off our roads from government workers not being able to clean up during COVID
3) A developer's child, he is in the midst of cronyism giving developers power over MD.  An overturn of an ethics law in Prince George's County is about to come to his desk that stops politicians from accepting gifts from developers and then voting on their projects.  The black county is now up for sale to the highest white bidder against the wishes of the voters;
4) Changing the ridiculous gerrymandering of legislative districts at the state and county level that keep on party in power. In MD, sadly that is corrupt Democrats.  Just as Hogan took on Trump he needs to take on Dem Party corruption.
5) Helping Biden rebuild America's infrastructure.

Then, Hogan and Maryland won't make NYT front page for incompetence, but for keeping Maryland one of the best places to live in the US. 

By the way, its not just Hogan.  MD politics---Repubs & Dems---is corrupt and self-serving. Democrats have controlled & are the worst."

2021-04-19 15:09,"I wish more people cared about such health related injustices fueled by racial inequalities. Systematic racism affects all facets of life and creates bigger gaps. The problem is we identify what the issues are but have yet to unpack why they continue. I honestly think it’s because when we talk about racial and health inequalities, we group all minorities together. Someone who just migrated here may not necessarily understand there is even a problem with race unless they know the history of this country and to be quite honest, they maybe focused on completely different issues. The same thing goes for health, they may identify their current predicament as a blessing because they migrated from a geographic area where they couldn’t see a doctor as they pleased. Some folks who live in specific communities, have no idea that the healthcare they receive is terrible. Just as some people have no idea racism exists or deny it because they live in their own bubbles. However, some people also may feel racism is everywhere because of their experiences and may be right. I am yet to see an article, documentary or research about what people in communities that suffer health injustices have to say, how they are they educated about these injustices. All I see is objectification; when a health problem is identified, it gets extensive coverage, the what not the why. How can we get to the problem before it festers? Can we get checks and balances for the systems that perpetuate injustices?"
2021-04-14 10:44,"What people fail to realize is the Covid-19  vaccination is not a silver bullet against getting the virus as much as a deterrent, which is why the failure to follow the CDC guideline of wearing a mask, washing one's hands and practicing social distancing continues to be the best way to slow down its spread.
Especially with new variants like the B117 U.K. strain racing among the population, it's more important than ever to take all precautions.
And as someone who contracted Covid-19 last March, and spent two months in the hospital recovering from it -- I guarantee you don't want to get it.

Also, how long will it take to dry after heavy rain?

Can't think why I'd want to ""picnic"" on that surface, or stretch out & read a book, when I'd never do that on the bare pavement of the plaza in the first place.

The synthetic lawn will be as dirty or dirtier than the existing pavement - and, I imagine, harder to clean or to keep clean. I wonder what planning has gone into this aspect.

This is tangential to the subject at hand, but after getting vaccinated I not only suffered through a day of slightly nasty side effects, but for the first time in decades I was hit with seasonal allergies. Is it possible that the vaccine created a general ramping-up of my immune system? I literally haven't had a seasonal allergy problem since I was a young man. I doubt the pollen count this year is way above normal, plus the coincidence (gets vaccinated, allergy symptoms immediately appear) is pretty striking."
2021-04-14 11:21,"Study after study confirms the benefit of Vitamin Xercise. Yet even the Great Investment in infrastructure focuses too heavily on  electric charging stations and robot cars.

2021-04-14 12:21,"The article says that the researchers separated out the related factors of obesity and lack of fitness in severe covid risk.  

But the fact that these factors can be related does raise the question:  Perhaps a lot of the covid risk that has been attributed to obesity should really be assigned to lack of fitness."
2021-04-14 14:02,"Ms. Reynolds, thank you for providing encouraging reasons to starting, and then continuing, to stay active.  Perhaps you could address the lag between when a person begins a 5 walk per week habit and the protective effect of exercise."
2021-04-14 15:08,Exercise and vitamin D. Very helpful. But exercise is a difficult prescription for a society that'd rather have a pill to solve every problem and big pharma willing to provide it.
2021-04-14 15:33,"Well I'm glad the advice for the past year hasn't been to hunker down, watch Netflix, and support your local restaurant by ordering takeout more often.

Wait..."
2021-04-14 15:39,"I’ve long suspected that those who can, do.

In other words, perhaps those who exercise more intensely are healthier overall and thus able to exercise more intensely. Because correlation is not causation. At best, it’s an invitation to further experimentation.

I’m also always disappointed that questions about diet are not included in studies such as these. What we eat is more important than exercise on our health. And eating more whole plant foods is healtheir than what many people in this country eat, which is SAD (Standard American Diet). Eating only whole plant foods, avoiding animal products as well as processed and prepared foods, may be the healthiest way to eat. And live."
2021-04-14 15:43,"Perhaps this is a factor in the low mortality rate of Covid in India, where many cannot afford to be sedentary. Hard to separate from the large effect of the different age distribution."

2021-04-14 16:41,"Because of the pandemic, I stopped taking my dog to the local off-leash dog park and walked him more instead. He and I walk a minimum of three miles a day and up to five miles. The average is more than four miles and about 90 minutes total. I've not had any symptoms of COVID-19. I am four weeks beyond my 2nd dose of the vaccine. I'm still not comfortable going to dog parks again."
2021-04-14 16:48,"I would think overall lung ‘health’ of exercisers would contribute to decreased illness, as well.

Just one sign though: dont want to suggest mortality is imminent."
2021-04-14 17:15,"This is applicable to most disease states, not just Covid. Staying physically active doesn’t necessarily prevent diseases, but it makes us less vulnerable if we get sick."
2021-04-14 17:18,Excellent research. It is seeming more and more likely that covid severe cases and deaths were the straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back in people who were already very unhealthy
2021-04-14 17:22,"What about the physically fit nurses and other healthcare professionals who have fallen gravely ill? I feel like this piece should’ve included something about risk exposure. 

A few years ago, I worked in an elementary school when I’m used to working at the high school level (I’m a librarian), and I contracted the flu. This was the first and only time I’ve ever had flu in my life. I exercise six days a week and try to eat a balanced diet, and normally don’t get sick with colds etc. But because I was in the germiest spot in the school, and elementary kids are the germiest creatures on the planet, the flu knocked me on my backside for ten days. 

I’m sure that plenty of physically fit people have contracted COVID overall, and I’m sure that some of them have experienced severe symptoms. So, while it’s good advice generally to tell people to exercise, it’s probably not prudent to say that exercise in itself is a surefire way to protect them until they can get the vaccine."
2021-04-14 17:28,"I'm surprised that the 'most active' participants only logged 150 minutes per week, that is just 2 & 1/2 hours! Even just a thirty minute walk per day would work out to 240 minutes per week."
2021-04-14 17:31,Something those of us that exercise have always known. A healthy strong body is more resistant to illness.
2021-04-14 17:51,"I am an extremely fit physician/surgeon who hasn't had even a cold in the last 20 years. I am around plenty of infections and infected people on a daily basis but I learned early, wash your hands often (surgeons do this anyway); don't touch your face, and keep active. I run at 4 AM daily so that my exercise is complete before I start my day. Also, decreasing stress is important to avoiding disease; running does this for me as my job is pretty stressful but I continue to be resilient.  Staying physically fit isn't a promise that one can avoid disease but it does add quality to one's life and well-being even in those of us who have been on the front lines of this pandemic from the beginning."
2021-04-14 17:52,"I've always exercised AND I've always carried extra weight. 

Knowing the link between obesity and COVID just motivated me more to exercise consistently and longer this entire year.  I figured that even if I carried extra weight, improved cardiovascular strength and endurance could only be good if I were to catch COVID.

Nice to see my assumptions pan out to be true!"
2021-04-14 18:05,"But what about those of us who are on our feet and moving around for most of the day? I ""exercise"" whenever I can, but when I am asked about it by nurses, on my rare medical appointments, they only want to know about the activities on their approved list. 
When I asked whether 3 hours of gardening counted (I recently turned 80) it seemed to confuse them."
2021-04-14 18:29,"It would be good to know if the study controlled for the risk factors for severe Covid. Otherwise, amount of exercise might just correlated with overall health."
2021-04-14 18:31,"Exercise is essential for well being!  
It’s something we should talk about more and encourage more often because it’s not just Covid. It’s diabetes, hypertension, depression and many other things that are all made worse by lack of exercise. 
We accept that the workday needs meal breaks, what if we normalized exercise hour as much as lunch hour or happy hour?
It took me until my fifties to find an exercise class that I enjoyed and would stick with on a daily basis.  The trainer is excellent and the vibe with my fellow early risers who are also dedicated to taking care of their health is that we are playing at recess.  Whether it’s a running club, a dance class, indoor cycling, yoga, walking your dog, strength training, swimming, tennis, kick-boxing or team sports, each and everyone of us needs something (maybe a few things) to keep moving and motivated."
2021-04-14 18:33,"There are so many variables in human behavior, age, health, and physical characteristics that I think it is impossible to isolate any single factor, in addition to the effect of the amount of viral exposure and viral variant. And how much exercise? Timing of exercise to eating patterns? And so forth.

Americans in general are in abysmal health, and are more vulnerable to every hazard. I am not downplaying the hazards of this virus, not at all, but just shutting down fast food restaurants and subsidizing fruit and vegetable farmers would do more to cure our ills than any other measures. There is no vaccine against obesity."
2021-04-14 18:42,"I am fifty and caught Covid early on during first wave in U.K.  I would swim for an hour two or three times a week and gym two or three times a week prepandemic. 

I really believe I didn’t get very sick; I mean really sick and in hospital because of my routine. Have thought this often for the past year. The irony being the pools and gyms have mostly been closed now during lockdowns - but understandably so. 

Exercise should be more accessible and encouraged by governments in future. It’s a win win for all."
2021-04-14 19:06,"At the beginning of this nightmare, when we were in ""lockdown"" in NYC, people were fighting about runners and cyclists out without masks, and making comments about how entitled people are to think they ""need"" their daily run or other form of exercise. That such things could wait until the pandemic was over. Do we really need another study at this point to tell us that physical fitness is generally a good thing? I'm still wondering if a single case of covid can be traced to an unmasked runner, exercise walker or cyclist.  Does anyone have any information about this?"
2021-04-14 19:11,I caught COVID during a movement class. I definitely think my active lifestyle prevented my COVID case from requiring hospitalization. This study makes sense.
2021-04-14 19:17,"These correlational studies are annoying sometimes, even if the conclusions please me, as someone who works out regularly.

People with co-morbidities are more likely to get hospitalized with covid and also more likely to die. Many people with co-morbidities are less likely to exercise regularly because of the co-morbidities... Need to tease those out: compare people with the same type of co-morbidities and different exercise habits, if that is possible.

We already have learned that hospitalization and death are two of the nasty results of covid. How about long covid? I know one athlete that was never hospitalized but also not recovered more than 6 months later. I have read of other athletes in a similar predicament. Perhaps that is related to a predisposition to autoimmune disease? 

At any rate, I would hope more carefully designed studies address these issues. I am tired of the quick and dirty ""we have data and software... run numbers and publish""."
2021-04-14 19:19,"I know an 85-year old who got Covid last year. His only symptoms were a slight fever and some gastrointestinal issues. He never had to go to the hospital.

He's physically fit and still exercises every day. I'm convinced that was the deciding factor for his relatively benign Covid experience."
2021-04-14 19:30,"No kidding.  It stands to reason that anyone who was living an active/exercise lifestyle just prior to getting COVID, didn't just happen to start living that lifestyle, right before COVID.  They were an active person to begin with.

And those who weren't, aren't.

We've already seen and understand who is generally dying from COVID.  And, in general, it is not the physically fit/active."
2021-04-14 19:31,"There may also be a correlation between those who regularly exercise and those who tend to select more healthy foods in their diets. Food is medicine and will alleviate inflammation if lots of whole foods are regularly eaten. Too bad big pharma and big ag have so much power in this country and cheap foods and pill popping are the solutions for so many.

My cousin in the ICU, was intubated today as she came down with covid last week picking it up from her healthy 25 year old son. She did exercise but also loved to bake foods full of sugar, refined flour and unhealthy fats and therefore overweight. We are hoping for the best outcome but we know the stats aren't in her favor. It's heart wrenching."
2021-04-14 19:33,"This may be or may not be the case - is
it really a causal relationship, or just healthier people being likely and able to exercise in the first place - Now I can see Marjorie Taylor Greene claiming she is vindicated ..."
2021-04-14 19:39,"Keep the gyms open and remove all cardio equipment.  Aerobic exercise should be done outside, or in the privacy and safety of your own home.
Anaerobic exercise (primarily weightlifting), can be done in gyms safely. 
Aerobic - sustained heavier breathing; more ventilation required
Anaerobic - less sustained heavy breathing; ventilation is important, but not as crucial"
2021-04-14 19:52,"The most active people in the study this article is based on are active at least 150 min in a week. In the study, researchers describe ""strenuous exercise"" as ""like a brisk walk "". So, a 25 min brisk walk a day will help protect against severe covid if this study's conclusion is correct."
2021-04-14 19:53,"For over 40 years, I have exercised regularly and strenuously, maintaining  a slim  and youthful figure as well as excellent health throughout.  Now at 70, I am the oldest person in the fitness class, by decades. With no pre-existing conditions  and no prescription meds, I never felt threatened by COVID. This article simply supports what I have always known. Those at risk for serious illness and death were unhealthy to begin with, many obese. I have patiently waited out this last year plus of severe shutdowns. Now, fully vaccinated, my patience for mitigation is gone. Let me live freely as I have done  everything to insure my excellent health and well-being and am no threat to others at all."
2021-04-14 19:54,"I had cancer ten years ago and in my chemotherapy clinic there was a poster that read ""Bewegung ist Leben"" (Exercise is life). Also my oncologists encouraged me to be active whenever and however I could while undergoing chemo. I learned also that active life style lowers the risk of cancer recurrence. I haven't stop moving since.
Nothing is a 100% guarantee (I did not have any cancer risk factors and was young and still got it), but I will do anything to lower my chances of getting any disease. I was glad that my doctors told me. I wish all doctors and media would emphasise more the benefit of the active life style instead of ""hunker down, wait for the vaccine, have faith in pills"" etc."
2021-04-14 19:57,"As a long time cold and other flu-like symptom sufferer (at the rate of perhaps once a month when I was a kid; thankfully as an adult, it's perhaps twice or three times a year top), I found out that the most reliable way to cut your symptoms short is to go for a good 30min jog. By ""good"", I mean: don't take it easy, force the air through your nose as much as possible until the itching and the congestion abate. The relief is immediate. Repeat maybe a day or two days later to get rid of any persistent symptoms and you should at least get your nose and airways back, and your general condition should improve as well (in case you experience fatigue etc.) Don't know if it is wise to do with a fever, though.

I also don't know if it will work on Covid. Back in February 2020, I got a nasty cold (which could have been Covid in retrospect). Nose started running hard on a Monday; by Wednesday evening, I had essentially cut it off after running hard on both Monday and Wednesday. Still got some mild fever and fatigue on Thursday and Friday, and was essentially back to normal for the weekend. After that, I still (and strangely) lost my sense of smell for 1+ week despite my nose being completely clear (hence the reason why I think it was Covid). But other than that, I was fully recovered. To this day, I continue to jog whenever I catch a cold, to great effect. Otherwise, I generally jog only once a week (nothing very special, and probably less than the recommended exercise routine)."

2021-04-14 20:03,"I totally believe that swimming has helped me stay healthy. Before starting swimming 7.5 years ago, I would get about 5 sinus infections or more per year. Since starting swimming, I rarely get any kind of illness and if I do, it is very short lived. I only lost one month of swimming when the local pools closed as I was able to find a hotel that allowed me to swim there. I felt very safe swimming and pushed harder and became more fit than before. I hope this article can entice non-exercisers to start even if it is just walking around the block. I know too many people that do not move. It is very sad."
2021-04-14 20:04,"Thanks for another vitally important education. I'm fully vaccinated but as you know, that 5% is still a risk factor so everyone should be exercising as well. It's good stress relief and a good time to think."
2021-04-14 20:19,"This piece would be so much more informative if it used more precise language. What does the statement that the researchers ""gathered information"" on risk factors for Covid 19 mean? 

Reading on, there is a statement,  ""Of the other common risk factors for severe disease, only advanced age and organ transplants increased the likelihood of hospitalization and mortality from Covid more than being inactive, the scientists found."" To nail this, we should know what risk factors were controlled e.g. respiratory/pulmonary diseases, obesity, gender, socioeconomic status among multiple other factors that can affect risk of severe Covid 19 and physical activity levels."
2021-04-14 20:39,"Have we considered perhaps that is not inherently the exercise that is protective against COVID but that people who have the time and means to be regularly active often tend to be white and wealthy? Sure, everyone can technically “go for walk” but that is inaccessible if you spent 18 out of 24 hours working or live in a dangerous neighborhood. Similarly, people with the time and means to have rigorous exercise routines are also more likely to have time and money to dedicate to their health generally: we see this in their ability to buy more nutritious food, to see doctors regularly, and even to shelter in place. The correlation between racial-economic privilege and fitness routines is well documented, and quite frankly any study that doesn’t consider these factors in lieu of telling people to “get out more” is lazy science."
2021-04-14 21:02,"I think the NTY health reporters need to up their game.  A little critical thinking would go a long way.  

It is impossible to draw conclusions from correlational studies.  People who exercise are more likely to do other things that promote good health, like eat a healthy diet, get routing vaccinations, have a lower stress lifestyle that allows time for exercise, etc..  People who exercise less are less likely to do other things that promote good health, and more likely to have other health issues, stressful work schedules, etc.  A study would have to control for a whole host of variables to have any meaning at all.

Any reporting on a correlational study should point out the obvious reasons why no conclusion can be drawn."
2021-04-14 21:16,"In other news, the sun is hot! It's quite evident that those who exercise are, by and large, in better health which would explain why their bodies are better able to fight infections. I walked like it was my job during the pandemic. It was my therapy - mental and physical - the only time I had alone and the one aspect of my life that felt 'normal' when really nothing else did. That said, I do tire of these types of articles because we all KNOW eating well and exercising is better for our health but those who are inclined to do so are already and those who are not inclined to do so will not. Additionally, I think we use these types of articles to make ourselves better. Oh, *I* exercise and eat well so I'll be FINE unlike those other layabouts! My 85 year old grandmother is morbidly obese, eats hot dogs and cheese with crackers, can't walk to her car without getting winded. She got COVID, was hospitalized twice, and is now fine (miraculously in my mind). My friend's godson was 21, fantastic health with no comorbidities, caught COVID at college and dropped on campus never regaining consciousness. So many similar stories that people who should theoretically not be at high risk die and those who should probably already be dead pull through. We want certainty that if we do X, Y will happen and that just isn't the case."

2021-04-15 0:53,"On day 6 of my Covid illness, I exercised lightly at home on my spin bike for 30 minutes. While my Covid infection was mild, I was terrified the entire time that it would take the much publicized turn for the worst and settle in my lungs.

Fortunately, I only had flu like symptoms for about 7 days, but the fatigue lasted for a month. That meant every day about 2pm I felt I needed a nap. Some days I took a nap; some days I sat listless in an armchair. 

So specific to this article, for years I’ve worked out at least 4x per week vigorously for an hour per session.

On day 10 following doctor’s advise via telehealth, I returned to working out. That day I gently moved for 45 minutes on my home elliptical. From there I returned to my regular schedule 4x per week but kept my heart rate no more than 75 percent max and only for 45 minutes. 

Most every workout was followed by a nasty headache, but I didn’t experience any respiratory difficulty as a result of Covid and no respiratory issues returning to exercise. 

I’d agree that regular exercise enabled my immune system to fight the infection better than had I not been fit. In fact, my doctor encouraged the return to training to support recovery. Despite the headaches, I believe it was supportive. 

Of course, it’s totally qualitative and anecdotal, but I could feel the grip of the illness in body. The Covid virus is strong. Exercise signaled my brain and my cells that we were fighting and getting better."
2021-04-15 1:07,"I feel this article is missing an important piece of information; while moderate exercise improves immune function, prolonged, intense exercise causes immunosuppression. This has been studied and published.

This would be an interesting aspect to follow up on with the Kaiser data; Does SARS-CoV-2 behave like other respiratory track viruses in regard to intense exercise?

I love to workout every day, but science says I am probably too intense, and should add some rest days. Truth is, I'm worried about falling off the wagon. Stay safe out there!"
2021-04-15 5:32,"And yet the powers that be kept the gyms closed for many months, even closed parks and walking/running paths in lots of towns, and told us to stay home and watch TV and stuff our faces."
2021-04-15 3:30,"The data were gathered ..... and do not suggest that .....

irrespective of the content, this detail is greatly appreciated when journalists write about studies. Thank you, Gretchen!"
2021-04-15 11:11,"The most important factor in whether or not you get Covid-19--beyond the obvious prophylactic measures of wearing masks, social distancing and not staying in enclosed spaces with inadequate ventilation--is the strength of your immune system in fighting off the disease if you are exposed to the virus.  

This is the reason obese people succumb overwhelmingly to Covid-19 relative to people of healthy weight:  Being obese, their immune systems are greatly compromised due to their bodies being in a constant state of inflammation.  Degraded by having to fight off this constant low-grade inflammation, their immune systems are too weak/compromised to fight off the Covid virus when it hits them.

How/why are obese human bodies in a constant state of inflammation?  Why, because of the food they eat, three times a day (for some more), seven days a week, 365 days a year.  The ""foods"" that make up the Standard American Diet (processed, fast, laden with salt, oil, sugar, saturated fat and cholesterol) are all highly pro-inflammatory.  

By comparison, the foods that make up the Whole Food Plant Based Diet (fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds) are for the most part completely free of saturated fat, cholesterol and are all anti-inflammatory.  

So, if you want to maximize your chances of avoiding Severe Covid, I strongly encourage you to ""run"" to your local grocery store and then walk to the produce section to fill your shopping cart.

Choices matter."
2021-04-15 11:24,"When I was recovering from devastating cancer, more than a decade ago, I did research on the power of exercise in cancer recovery. Two summary statements may be relevant here. 

1- Your immune system gets a boost in functioning from even a small interval of mild exercise, such as a 5-minute walk. 

2- An MD said, (quotely loosely), ""the effects of exercise are so strongly positive on cancer recovery, if exercise were a drug, we would all prescribe it."" And...there are no negative side effects. 

It's an important message in cancer recovery, and perhaps one day it will also be appreciated widely for Covid-19 prevention. Exercise is good for us. One should act like our lives depend on it."
2021-04-15 13:30,I exercise regularly and I believe it is foundational to all health. It doesn't prevent Covid. It doesn't make for a less severe case either. At least not in my case. I still exercise daily regardless.
2021-04-15 15:00,"While the news pushed washing hands and social distancing, I approached the situation for myself the same way I'd face any other uncertainty about infection, by doubling down on getting proper sleep, eating vegetables and less sugar and caffeine, and getting enough daily exercise and sauna. And unsurprisingly, when something like a flu swept through everyone I know, including me, early last year, and while some got very sick for a couple of weeks, I was mildly feverish for a couple of nights but nothing more.  Early in the pandemic Tom Brady was on the Howard Stern show and said the same thing, he wished there were more of a push to sleep and eat right and exercise in the media. The way I like to say it now is, a virus needs stagnant pools in order to proliferate, and if you keep your skin a running river of sweat, your gut a running river of vegetables, and your mind a running river of prayers and dreams, there's nowhere for the virus to set anchor. And when the news says there's a new virus threat, just turn up the flow on the rivers!"
2021-04-15 15:13,"Regular exercise helps prevent any bad thing.

This study is just given credence to what already is known."
2021-04-15 15:28,"As an avid cyclist I, of course, read this with joy.

But is it really all that surprising to learn this?

The simple reality is that people who regularly exercise are also far more likely to engage in healthy lifestyle habits.

Few runners, cyclists etc., for instance, are tobacco smokers.  Also, while exercise does help manage weight control -- it's also almost demands healthier eating habits.  Loading up on high fat foods is hardly conducive to a good run or ride.

As we've seen, many (most?) of the serious Covid cases and related deaths have been among those with ""co-morbidities"".

While even folks who exercise regularly may have some co-morbidity risk -- it's likely to be due to genetics rather than lifestyle.

Maybe we cannot defeat the DNA but we can moderate our lifestyles and thereby decrease our disease risk factors."
2021-04-15 15:44,"I would love to look at the data because confounding factors that may hinder one's ability to be active include walkability or access to safe places to exercise. A ""social determinants of health"" lens would be helpful here. Also, weight doesn't seem to be a variable in this study. Not sure why (I actually am sure why) people in the comments are so excited to make this about fatness. It's not part of the analysis and would probably introduce bias."
2021-04-15 13:45,"Another one-off study analysing statistical associations and reaching a conclusion dearly desired. 

Meanwhile healthy fit people do die of COVID complications. Are those healthy fit people doing something wrong? 

Oh my we ever so dearly hope so. Otherwise we will have to submit to the notion that blind and deaf and stupid fate has the ultimate say in every outcome. 

So then we can say ""oh if only she'd been a runner"".

I get daily exercise that makes me sweat and pant but I am under no illusion that this will spare me or that this entitles me to a higher level of service than someone who is not so fortunate in my desires."
2021-04-15 14:52,"I wonder if I can get a multi-million dollar grant to study my hypothesis that healthy people are less likely to die after catching a disease than unhealthy people.

2021-04-15 17:00,"Well it's a good thing the politicians closed all the gyms and fitness programs and told everyone to sit at home for a couple months.

It's great when data verifies common sense, but we have known for eons now that exercise plays a role in helping the body deal with all manner of health problems."
2021-04-15 17:29,"This has been such a failure from our public health officials who never empowered people by encouraging them to get healthier to improve their survival odds. It was all about hiding from each other while romanticizing gluttony and drinking, like Zoom happy hours and ordering food from your local restaurants. 

We knew early on obesity was a leading risk factor but we chose to close down schools and leave McDonalds open"
2021-04-15 18:07,"This should surprise nobody. The most interesting aspect of these results is in fact that the difference was so little. I would have guessed the difference in hospitalisation and death between people who never exercise and people who exercise a lot to be far greater than a factor of two. A factor of two is not that huge an effect. Based on the data that has come out thus far about how extremely overrepresented people with underlying health conditions are amongst those with severe covid, a factor of 10 or 100 would seem more expected. I wonder if this could be because, in controlling for underlying health conditions like obesity or high blood pressure, they have reduced some of the effect of exercise in their sample set."
2021-04-15 18:18,I've noticed that young people don't end up in the hospital.  Maybe it because playing video games is protective.

Some of us still recovering from long haul symptoms. Not sedentary in the very least. Many healthy people, sport enthusiasts and professional athletes have had very detrimental side effects worldwide."
2021-04-15 20:06,"The commentators who say ""that's a small effect"" overlook that being consistently inactive increases your risk of death from Covid by more than diabetes or hypertension, and almost as much as severe obesity.

2021-04-15 21:02,"Dear ""W"", Please be aware that neither exercise, nor vaccines, give you a 100% protection, but they strongly reduce the risk of getting sick. Physical inactivity, the greatest health hazard in modern societies, increased the risk of dying from COVID-19 by a factor of 2.5, and of being hospitalized by a factor of 2.3, compared to regular exercise (meeting guidelines=150+ min/week). This is worse than almost all other known risk factors (except for old age and organ transplant).

You don't need to be an athlete to be in good shape.  Lace up a pair of shoes, and go for a run.  The pace does not really matter.
I grow weary of people who somehow claim that runner have some genetic advantage.  Yes, maybe the professionals, but for the average runner, it is just grit and determination."
2021-04-15 19:47,"Huh, regular exercise makes you healthier, and that might help ward off severe covid. Who would have guessed?"
2021-04-15 20:00,"Prior to getting covid last year,  I had been pushing myself to take longer, faster walks in my hilly neighborhood with my dog. We'd had him about a year. I was getting faster up that beast of a hill.  When I got covid - very early in the pandemic, I got super sick. Ended up in the ER and missed a month of work. My dog, and his need to walk, probably save my life or at least kept me from being admitted if this exercise thing is true. I coitus feel how this disease could kill.

Today I walked around my block with my dog and started hyperventilating because of long covid. I hate this disease."
2021-04-15 20:37,"This news article and apparently the study's author (""we can tell people that walking briskly for half an hour five times a week should help protect them against severe Covid-19"") make a fundamental error in interpreting the results. This is a retrospective observational study and therefore conclusions should be made with caution. There are likely many factors that could confound these results.  In this study, a history of high activity level correlates with less severe COVID infection. This study was not designed in a way that allows for the conclusion that exercise prevents severe COVID."
2021-04-15 22:55,"As soon as I got back from work I would change clothes. I found if I changed into workout gear my chances for getting exercise greatly improved. Habit patterns are incredibly important in keeping an exercise regimen. I'm retired now and found that a run every third day is the exercise pattern that works for me. I still walk the dog morning and evening, mostly at the dog's sniffing pace.
I hardly ever get sick. 
I get a flu shot because one kicked my butt about eight years ago. 
Habit patterns, habit patterns...."
2021-04-15 22:20,"But please wear masks while walking.

Pandemic is not over yet!"
2021-04-16 0:03,"My father and his two friends got Covid19 at the same time. His two friends went to ICU, except my father. I asked why he thinks this was the case. He mentioned when he got sick he forced his self to exercise, while his friends just laid in bed. I don't think this is the sole reason, but made me think that exercise may in fact provide some benefits. Of course we don't know the answer yet, but exercise is one off the best proven ways to boost health."
2021-04-16 1:00,"I was in the best shape of my life when I caught Covid last March. At 49 I was in the gym 6 days a week, weight training, rowing machine, swimming, etc. I do it for my mind to release endorphins and feel good about my body. I had a severe case of Covid that lasted 6 weeks but was manageable at home."
2021-04-16 3:58,"Since the outbreak and the massive shutdown last April, I must have ran almost 3 - days a week. And that included a stop at a workout station where I could do pull ups and burpees-with-a-push-up. It helped with the tedious work-from-home sessions and boredom. There was only so much streaming you could watch.
Then in January I was infected and fortunately I don’t have to go to the hospital. It did take a month to recover my athletic routine.
But this article proves the value of exercise."
2021-04-16 10:36,I started running and working out regularly at 25. At 67 i'm still at it and in good health. Will it protect me against Covid-19?  The evidence would seem to suggest that. But even if not the physical and mental benefits of my years of exercising have been a godsend.
2021-04-16 20:16,"All true.   But what most people who are sedentary don't want to admit is that they don't really want to do the exercise.  Oh, sure, many say they do want to do the exercise, but at the same time they have a hundred excuses as to why they don't.   Too hot, too cold, not feeling so well, have relatives visiting, waiting for a delivery, need to clean the house, and on and on.   When they say they want to do the exercise, what they really mean to say is that they would be delighted to do it if it had an immediate beneficial and noticeable effect with minimum effort, inconvenience and discomfort.   I know this from sedentary family members.  What they need to accept is that exercise will have minimum benefit to you unless you are ready to do it even when it's not a sunny, clear day and 75 degrees."
2021-04-17 0:47,"I don't understand people using gyms or parks being closed during the pandemic as an excuse as to why they didn't exercise. I haven't been to the gym in a year, even though gyms here are open, because I'm not willing to take the risk and I've never liked running either. However I still work out, there are literally thousands of free, high quality workout videos online, as easy to access as Netflix is. With a clic you can find videos for all kinds of goals, featuring all kinds of equipment or none at all, for different levels of fitness, etc. Some of my favorite fitness youtube channels are: Fitness Blender, Popsugar Fitness and Yoga with Adrienne. Plus, without a commute, my time at home has increased dramatically and there really is no excuse to not work out."
2021-04-17 0:50,"People who tended to be sedentary are far more likely to die, of all causes, period."
2021-04-17 16:42,"So the bottom line is - being stronger means being more capable of fending off outside attacks. Being capable of running (moving swiftly and purposefully) means being able to runaway. Being able to push/pull at least ones body weight, means being able to fend off, move away from, or out from under, various assaults or mishaps that come our way.

So performing exercise...in a variety of forms means having a body, and of course mind, more able to deal with all the potential outside ""agents"" (viral and other) looking to bring us down.

Do I have the basics of the benefits of regular exercise, right?

That exercise - extra movement well beyond what gets us thru a regular day - makes us more able and much more capable of survival. 

Wow! Mind blown. And here I thought it just felt good, and made me look good/better. 

Seriously, when is this most basic of lessons gonna sink in with us modern humans? That we have the means and ways to be healthier, and to defend against various forms of attack, and its as simple as a near daily dose of fairly rigorous, but not always, exercise. Of extra movement/effort beyond what gets us thru our normal day. 

Exercise. Simple, and even cheap, in fact mostly free.

And yet...it is still resisted by now over half of the population...? 

Crazy that this message cant seem to truly sink in."
2021-04-17 18:15,"I've been a decorated athlete in multiple sports throughout my life. Vibrant athletes on both sides of my family. I was in GREAT shape, running moderate miles, squatting at my standard weight, keeping my body primed but not 'strained' when the early pandemic hit my family last year.

My husband (also quite fit) and healthy 2-yr-old daughter got it first, with mild-moderate symptoms that went away within a couple weeks. Me? Totally different story. Severe reaction, in hindsight definitely should have been hospitalized but was too chicken to go and 'not come back out.' Coughing so hard I dislocated a rib from my sternum that took 11 MONTHS of intense therapy to get back into place.

I tried EVERYTHING before/during/after my acute Covid phase; my heart wasn't right after, my body, brain and energy were shot. Herbs, detox cleanses, steroids (per legit doctor, for 1 week only), food sensitivity tests (to get the excruciating inflammation out of my body), acupuncture, medical massage, PT, EKGs, Chinese medicine, you name it. 

The result? I'm still a long-hauler despite the best medicine available, despite a fit body & immune system going into Covid. And while I can't run yet, I've healed far more than many of my long-hauler sisters & brothers.

What I've learned is what we DON'T know: 
1. Can regular daily stress make Covid worse (i.e.- not taking a full break from work when I was initally sick), and 
2. Why in the world have many other top athletes become long-haulers, as well?"

2021-04-17 13:01,"11x marathoner here, caught Covid March 2020. Severe case, became a long hauler. Finally started running again this week, over a year later. My doctor said had I not been a marathoner when I contracted, I’d be dead. I knew in my gut he was right. Grateful to be here. Run on."

The quantitative conclusion is that it's  ""the least likely.""  It didn't conclude there was no risk.  The study found that people who exercised had a lower (not zero) risk of  severe illness, hospitalization and death as those who did not.

There are a number of contributing factors to consider why this is so, the least of which is that it is just simply good for you to minimize  the sedentary life-style we are all subject to due to work and/or computer time by getting up and walking.   I am well into my 7th decade, and I still hear my grandmother telling me to put on a sweater coat and go outside to get some fresh air."

I have gone up and down with efforts to lose weight.  I did relatively well with COVID having flu like symptoms for 4 days.  My point is that it is much easier for many people to exercise than lose weight, but most studies looked at obesity.  Information like this might encourage people to get out and move."
2021-04-18 19:52,Agree with the premise of the article. If you are going to get sick or have any type of surgery it’s always Helpful to be in top physical shape before hand.

2021-04-18 17:16,"Good article.  About as much space devoted to the topic as one might expect (very little really)...America has a two fold problem on health right now.  1.  The social media police descend on anyone who dares mention that anyone in the US could be in poor health because of their diet and lack of exercise.  2.  A lot of money is tied up in the poor eating habits (what would a grocery store look like if all the prepared foods were resigned to shelves in the back or far reaches of the store and what would the Cheesecake Factory do), lack of exercise, subsequent diet programs, and most importantly, chronic illness treatments. Our political leaders really are not much political leaders but weather vanes blowing as the wind directs.  The only politician who has the nerve to connect COVID and poor health are Boris Johnson and that kook Marjorie Greene Taylor which says a lot"
2021-04-19 3:01,"This article shows correlation, not causation.  The data show that exercise is correlated with covid survival.  It could very well be that there is some underlying condition which results in a certain population of people to resist severe covid outcomes and also to exercise more frequently.  There is no evidence in this article to suggest that starting an exercise regime will lower one's risk of severe covid."
2021-04-19 8:58,"I am a senior.  I live in the suburbs in an area that doesn't allow sprinkler systems because of concern about droughts. We have a new house with grass that was planted September 1.  I like to have a nice yard,  I've been doing all my own yard work. I've planted bushes, trees, flowers etc. I created beds. I've been watering by dragging a 300 foot 3/4 inch heavy hose around.  Supposedly you use a lot less water if you water that way because you direct it to where it is needed. I found that that noticeably increased my core strength -- my back, my posture etc. The downside is that it is really time consuming.  My phone has made all the difference. I started listening to audible recordings of long books, plus music, plus I talk on the phone.  It is really amazing that I can talk with the ear phone microphone attachment to my phone and that other people can hear me perfectly and I can hear them.  I think I saved about 10K on the landscaping by doing my own work plus our yard looks better than any yard in our subdivision. Last winter I dealt with the snow and cross country skied in the yard. I do my own cleaning too which also saves money. My back is strong and never hurts.  Really nothing hurts and I sleep great. I never get headaches and never get sick.   Can't say about COVID since I avoided that."

On Sunday May 17 2020, I did a 20 mile bike ride. On Tuesday I went stand up paddleboarding for 3 hours, loading and unloading my board by myself, after my yoga class. On Wed I had a little “allergy” cough. It was all downhill from there, for 17 days I battled Covid, and that battle continued for almost a year, to this day. I would take 1 step forward and 3 steps back regularly. A yoga class would incapacitate me for a couple of days, a bike ride for a week. Depression and anxiety reigned. Trouble breathing, irregular heart beat, unbelievable fatigue, constant leg pain. I have, finally, and thankfully, turned a corner, and can exercise regularly again, with caution.  I was 63 years old when I got Covid, and I am absolutely sure I would have died if I hadn’t been as fit and healthy as I was."

2021-04-25 10:17,"It is paramount that everyone gets fully vaccinated to end this pandemic. But as you have  just reported regular aerobic exercise, something as simple as a brisk walk, has many health benefits including reducing the risk for getting severe COVID disease. It also protects against cardiovascular disease and even lowers the risk for dementia. So exercise and get vaccinated and continue to exercise afterwards and we will become healthier even after this horrific pandemic ends!"
2021-04-25 11:41,"There is more and more evidence of the benefits of regular exercise. And among the best is walking. This is something almost all of us can do. There is evidence that seated exercise programs for elderly and physically compromised people have physical and cognitive health benefits. Exercise started early has lasting benefits. Exercise started late also has benefits. 

So much of 'modern' life has 'relieved' us of physical exertion which used to be routine. Like relieving us of contact with germs, this has proven a detriment. We need a balance of scientific and technological advances and recognition of our 'primitive' bodies. I bicycled 6 miles to and from my vaccination appointments. The clinicians actually said it might contribute to the vaccine's effectiveness. Win-Win."

Oh, and doesn't take any exercise at all while admitting she should, but she knows she's lazy. Has done a lot of TV binge watching though. 
This article doesn't surprise me. Regular exercise has health benefits that extend far beyond burning calories and losing weight. As the comments show, no one is immune to COVID-19 but we can all try and do what we can to avoid it, like continuing to exercise.
My friend knows that most of her conditions would be helped by a daily walk but won't bother. It's hard to get some people to realise that even a moderate investment of time and energy in exercise can reap huge benefits."
2021-04-25 12:19,"This is not a surprising article, but it is welcome to have scientific evidence to support vigorous exercise

The US government has erred by never really encouraging exercise during the pandemic. Until the vaccines were authorized, the sole focus has been how to reduce transmission.

What about encouraging people to be more fit? Yo try to lose a fire pounds? To make sure they eat a healthy diet? These actions won’t only help with covid, but with life in general."
2021-04-25 14:28,"Thank you for publishing yet one more application of the best medicine known to humankind. 

In 2015 the Academy of Royal Colleges produced a detailed report which, in five words, shows that ""Exercise is a miracle cure."" This fact was not new and it remains profoundly and vitally true, only needing to be repeated and re-verified with studies such as this."
2021-04-25 14:34,"I believe it is imperative that we redevelop our infrastructure with natural exercise in mind. Whenever I move to a city with good walking/biking/public transit infrastructure I tend to lose weight and feel healthier almost immediately. Whenever I move to a city that is car dependent I put on weight and feel unhealthy. This also has the benefit of superseding class/racial disparities. Of course, living in a car dependent society is no excuse to not exercise, but if our goal is to a create a healthier society, redesigning our infrastructure seems like a good place to start."
2021-04-25 14:53,"When word of COVID19 and the risks associated with the spread became clearer late winter/early spring 2020 I began walking everyday. I was 210lbs, 65 years old and smoked a couple of cigars each week (quit march 2020).. for 20 years. Reasonable logic kicked in, nobodies outside and I'm smart enough to judge 10+ feet to stay moving. Slowly working my way from 1 mile to 5 miles a day in a 60 day period. Changed my diet ever so slightly, stretched, worked my up to 100 crunches by May 2020. In June 2020 I dusted off an old bench and found my weights.  All while still walking 5 miles a day. By July I shed 30 pounds. I've continued my strength workout, lifting weights 3-4 times a week.... starting with 10 lb dumbells back in June 2020, gradually building up to 30lb dumbells today. I do a minimum of 1500 crunches a week now too. Strength training, with barbell and dumbells, 25 miles minimum walking per week, and most importantly stretching. I work full time. I use logic, I'm fully vaccinated. 

It's free. I'm free. The movement is on your shoulders. Open the door, walk on out."

It is horrifying to see what a lack of willpower can do to a human body followed immediately by anosognosia in regards to their condition. The virus is doing what it is designed to do: getting rid of the human beings massive overpopulation problem on this planet via the old, the unhealthy, and the genetically unqualified to move forward (not something we can see with the human eye).  If someone is choosing to be unhealthy, normally in nature that person would have been eaten because they were too slow to run away from predators like saber toothed tigers and dinosaurs. But the virus works just as well. If we continue our death spiral of overpopulating and destroying other species and being unhealthy, we can expect no less in return.  Get it together, humans!"

This is VERY different from most health issues. For most things, even a little exercise can help a lot. For Covid protection, not so much.

In a vacuum, that's true.  Getting exercise and eating healthily are very important. People who eat right, exercise, get good sleep and reduce stress will generally have more resistance to disease and frequently recover more rapidly.

But there isn't any recognition of how much more difficult it is for the average person struggling to pay their rent, or the person working in a warehouse or the family that has just been evicted. 

But how much easier is it to eat healthily if you know how to cook, if there are good supermarkets near you, if you can afford healthy produce and good food. How much more energy would you have to work out if you aren't trying to figure out how to pay your rent or cover medical expenses without health care.

As a nation we impose a burden of ill health and stress on those who can least sustain it. If we joined the rest of the developed world and provided health care to everyone, imagine how much better that would be. If we didn't fight over how much a ""living wage"" is and punish people who do not have a profession with the lowest wages for the hardest physical labor then too they might make ""better decisions"" about food, exercise and reducing stress."

I got the coronavirus several times between Mar-May 2020, and was a long-hauler until I got the vaccine last month (I had lost my sense of smell, had bad headaches, and it took a lot of effort to exercise).

Every well-meaning city or county or state government executive has been exhausted by the 24/7 grapple with the virus. Some, of course, kept open their states and counties and cities in deference to an ignoramus’s insistence that “It’s fifteen cases going down to zero.”

Many millions of Americans, 15 months into this public health crisis, are heartily weary of the push-and-pull of mask-wearing and social distancing and simply want to wish away a predator that is still aggressively searching out willing hosts in which to incubate its organism. I’m disappointed that we cannot all agree that an herculean sacrifice is required of all (most/some/few/none) of us if we are ever to get topsides on this killer. Being angry about the sideways turns it has forced upon us will not defeat it.

And, city mayors, especially, see themselves as the maligned, present and identifiable causes of the resentfully discontented; the poor unfortunate disruptions to their erstwhile routines have exposed rifts that ultimately threaten all of us. 

The greatest danger is that responsible mayors and other government executives will be replaced by demagogues and populists, mountebanks and charlatans who offer easy answers to complex situations.

In the case of Mayor Holaday, who left the lights on but didn’t really need to be in the office, well, who pays that electricity bill? The people do. So, that’s just one very minor example of taxpayers dollars doing nothing good for the people. During her tenure she put through an unnecessary parking garage in a small town which has plenty of parking, further more the planned structure is multi-story and on a waterfront area. The beautiful will be soon have a hulking eyesore, where a public park would served to secure the beauty of the area.  Haven’t we learned anything from the Joni Mitchell lyric: “they paved paradise and put up a parking garage.”?

2021-04-11 20:00,"I’m sympathetic, especially with all the buck-passing that has happened from the federal level on down, which sometimes has pushed local officials into a pretty narrow corner.  Still, three issues:

1) Why is there nothing, at least in the main body of this article, about mayors connecting with constituents, regularly, in some type of online format?

2) Even in small communities in which mayors have few to no staff, there is at least a governance body (town council?).  Yes, it may only have a 2-3 people and they all have jobs and other responsibilities outside of this work (in other words no part-or full-time paid status).  But what about delegating more tasks to them, here and there, in this situation to relieve mayors of at least some of the pressure?  (Interesting that so many quotes feature I/me/my compared to we/us/our.)

3) Are mayors seeking out family, close friends, medical professionals...whomever they can have as a practical sounding board...to talk things out regularly (minus the government stuff, of course, that is covered by privacy laws) and therefore help alleviate stress to a fair degree, etc.?  I get from this coverage that mayors are talking to such people or you wouldn’t have references to them being advised to “take a step back” and such; however...leaving the position is all that comes out of this?  As just one example, nothing at all about getting relief from some home responsibilities, in the short term, that can help with the professional pressures?"

She has been a high-tech supporter which I do not agree with, as the City of San Francisco has gotten more crowded, more expensive, more crime-ridden over the past five years than I remember.  But, she was the first mayor to call for a shelter-in-place, and lockdown on March 16 because of COVID.  People groused, swore, and talked trash about her, but we have had one of the lowest COVID rates of cases, and deaths of a major cosmopolitan city.  Just last month she sued our own school board to get the schools back open.  Even today, as the City cautiously opens, the majority (90% from my observation) wear masks, and maintain social distancing."

2021-04-11 23:15,All these mayors that put their towns' needs ahead of their campaigns are the ones that should be mayors. They actually care. It's rather sad that the system puts them at a disadvantage for actually doing their jobs and taking care of their responsibilities.

2021-04-11 23:27,"It's not just mayors, though they, as well as governors, have really been in a crucible for the last year.  Unlike congressmen who don't fear anything but a primary and can spend their time on Fox News or wearing gas masks into the Capitol Building, mayors and governors have to actually answer the phone.   The fact that Trump undermined political leaders who were trying to enforce the mandates of his own CDC made local leaders' jobs almost impossible.
In Hawaii, where we've had the lowest COVID-19 case rates of any of the 50th state, our State Department of Health Director, State Epidemiologist, Chair of the Department of Education and Honolulu Police Chief, people of high regard and long resumes, have all been run out of office by the pandemic.   Our governor is only still in place because he has but a year left on his term.   It's been positively brutal to watch....."
2021-04-11 23:30,"Wow, I did not realize how cold hearted I was.  I’m afraid my response to this article is to be largely unsympathetic to the Mayors.  Surely it is more fun to be a Mayor in good times BUT you are elected to be a leader in good times and bad times.  These are very bad times.  Do your best.  Be a leader.  Seek expert opinions when possible.  Reach out to other Mayors, former Mayors any contacts you have.  This is a unique and challenging situation with few guidelines.  When you don’t know the answers, for heaven’s sake, say so!   Offer comfort, share your own pain and above all have courage and act like a leader.  No rational constituent expects you to be a miracle worker."
2021-04-11 23:52,Actually having to do something and take responsibility is hard work. Go figure. I guess having to put on big boy pants and lead was more than their ego's could handle. The sad part is the innocent people who voted for and believed in them.

2021-04-12 0:11,"I wish that our Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, would not run again, for obvious reasons.  He makes dumb decisions and then boasts about them, while Minneapolis taxpayers foot the bill.  I cant wait to move away.  Meanwhile, I will look for another candidate vote for in the mayoral election later this year."
2021-04-12 0:15,"Not sure why anyone would want to run for mayor of anything at this point.  People have become so nasty and uncharitable.  Actually, you can add to the list of jobs that no one will want to do in the near future public health and  school teachers."
2021-04-12 1:01,"As citizens, we should all Zoom into our City Council and Board of Supervisors meetings and, during the public comment period, THANK THEM for their great service and sacrifice. Many work for little or no pay and shoulder enormous burdens no one else wants to deal with."
2021-04-12 1:07,Oh boo hoo. Imagine being a nurse or a doctor or a respiratory therapist in ER. If we had to do their jobs I suspect the pandemic would have been dealt with much differently.

2021-04-12 6:38,"Mayors as well as any and every person responsible for allocating a yearly fiscal budget are facing a monetary cliff. Last year saw major shutdowns of businesses and services, the money to keep cites running came from savings that budget spending specialists are required to keep on hand in cases of emergency. The emergency slush fund is gone.This new year will see no budgetary cushion as well as diminishing tax revenue, where’s the money gonna come from?
    Mayors are bailing out like parachuting out of a burning plane before it crashes."
2021-04-12 5:43,"Minneapolis; a once wonderful, now pit of city.  Land of rampant; carjackings, sidewalk holdups at gun point, catalytic converter thefts, and all night street racing. A less than fully staffed and soon to be defunded police department to address a city out of control. Many, many residents are requesting the entire wayward City Council and Mayor leave office immediately."
2021-04-12 10:45,"No doubt the Trump administration was extremely negligent in many ways as it mishandled the pandemic and all of its consequences.  I'm curious about what a mayor of a small town expected or would have liked from the federal government.   

Clearer and more consistent guidance and messaging from the CDC would be a guess, as well as alternative forms of financial assistance.  I wish this article (or future NYT reporting) would at least briefly explore that issue, as well as what, if any, guidance for local officials was contained in the pandemic preparation report from the Obama administration."
2021-04-12 11:49,"Imagine being a mayor who has to deal with a hospital that is over capacity, lines for food banks and school kids without highspeed internet access.

And now imagine being that mayor and also having to deal with a governor, an ideologically driven Republican governor, preventing you from imposing a lockdown or requiring people to wear masks. 

Imagine the stress of feeling so many people's pain, the frustration of not being able to respond and the rightful anger at the horrendous politics that has captured so many state governments.  These mayors need a break. Hopefully they will someday run for governor on a reality based platform."
2021-04-12 13:53,"I was Mayor of Madison for eight years. This story captures the experience of being mayor very well. It's a grueling job. People want to see their mayor around. And you recharge the batteries by doing the fun stuff -- tossing out the first pitch at a ballgame, riding in the Home Coming Parade, flipping the holiday lights on for the first time. Losing all that and having only the grind (and an historically difficult grind at that) would be just awful. I have a lot of empathy for the mayors, including my own, who have gone through this last year."
2021-04-12 18:40,"Her Honor Donna Holaday has done an outstanding job. She's handled the challenges of our city here with perseverance and grace. And she's done it without partisan fuss. She outlasted some corrupt police leadership. In this mostly affluent city, she's pushed hard to improve the lives of public-housing residents.

During the earlier days of COVID she spoke up saying that she didn't want to close our parks but she would do so if people weren't careful about social distancing. That worked, mostly: she had to get the DPW crew to put a mess of bark mulch in the skatepark for a few months, but only after giving fair warning to its users and their parents. She rarely has had occasion to be that hard-nosed, so people pay attention.

It helps a lot that we have the Newburyport Daily News and their conscientious staff making the workings of local government transparent. Transparency favors and strengthens good government, of course. It's been a virtuous circle.

I'm going to miss her. Thanks, Donna!"

2021-04-12 19:08,"It is easy to understand the frustration of many of these mayors. On the one hand trump and his administration left them twisting in the wind because ""like magic"" he predicted that the pandemic was suppose to ""disappear"". Instead of providing support and leadership trump went golfing. And one can only imagine the constant whine from constituents who horror of horrors were asked to mask up and forego dinners out. The isolation felt at the top during these darkest of times must be unbearable. So it is also appropriate here to thank on bended knee the other heroes with a thankless task, all of the first responders and health care professionals who are on the front lines. I hope when this is all over we throw you a celebratory  national parade and the Biden administration and congress awards you all bonuses and a paid vacation."
2021-04-12 14:07,"such decisions are unfortunate, given that many of these people have served their respective communities for years. But, in all honesty, I cannot, we cannot, blame them.
They have stood up and organised where Federal government has not/did not. Now they need a rest, step back and, perhaps, reflect. Leaving others to rebuild communitIES."
2021-04-12 18:14,"As the Selectboard Chair of a tiny Vermont town I can't wait for my term to be up next year. Trying to keep a retail business afloat, see to remote education of a special needs child and serve my community has exhausted me beyond my years. To those who are playing their tiny fiddles for those of us who hold elected office, often these are unpaid positions or like in my case,  receive a small stipend. I did this because I believe in service, but the constant emails, calls and general disagreeableness of people during Covid means I won't ever hold public office again."
2021-04-12 20:37,"I'm happy to see this article, and I would add that I imagine this same sentiment holds true for untold quantities of middle managers across the country (if not world) in a wide spectrum of different vocations. It has been an exhausting year, on the heels of a divisive presidential term, that followed years of recovery from a ruinous Recession.

Someone else can handle the next mess...."
