2020-10-13 13:35:52,It's amazing that the current president fared so well.
2020-10-13 14:03:44,Being thin as a rail didn’t help Jim Fixx.  People genetically in many shapes and sizes.  Why is the guilt laid on us because we don’t all look like Twiggy?
2020-10-13 14:56:11,This explains much more that anything else why the U.S. rates are so terrible. People need to care about their health everyday; not just during a pandemic.
2020-10-13 13:41:49,"We're all doomed. Doomed, I tell you!"
2020-10-13 17:27:11,"Obesity makes everything more difficult, including just living.
I think the prejudice is the worst. 

I'm genetically disposed to obesity on both sides of my family but I stay within 5 pounds of my desired weight by not eating junk. I lost 25 pounds 3 years ago. That was rough but I did it. 

A fatty liver diagnosis a year and a half ago further changed my eating and I healed my liver with diet. My gastroenterologist was surprised and actually smiled at my second round of tests. He didn't think I'd do it. 
That stated, I have mild asthma, only one large, healthy kidney, a prickly disposition for which I pray daily to tolerate jerks who make fun of obese people because being fat is a health condition, not a choice. 
People eat the wrong stuff because they crave satiety but that bell never gets rung. And the endless food cycle keeps going. 
Some of us have battled obesity since Day One. Being obese isn't fun. 

Will I survive COVID if I get it? It's a toss up. I know people who have died of it that should have survived and vice versa. 
Mask up. Let's give everybody an even break."
2020-10-13 17:29:35,Well how can anyone exercise if all the gyms are closed because of COVID?
2020-10-13 18:50:53,"I find it interesting that this has been known since the spring, but public health officials, at least in the US, are not talking about this.  Here is an incredibly simple to curb the serious illness and death from COVID-19, yet public health officials in the US, at least, won't talk about it, presumably, for fear of upsetting people (most of which are overweight or obese).  It's a sad state of affairs when scientists cannot explain simple facts because so much of the populace is not educated enough to separate facts from their own emotions.  

We truly live in a woefully uneducated, uninformed, and unwise society here in the US.  It is so incredibly disheartening (and exhausting) to try to live here as a person who is capable of critical thinking, in a sea of people who are not."
2020-10-13 19:14:43,"This is conjecture on my part - and I don’t want to get sick and am sorry for those who have gotten sick or have died - but I’m saying weight-related hysteria regarding COVID-19 is reaching hyperbolic levels. 

I need to lose 25 lbs. I gained 15 during lockdown - mostly wine and cheese related. However, I workout 5 days a week an hour a day vigorously and have always exercised or played a sport. Low blood pressure and cholesterol and triglycerides are within normal limits. I eat clean, whole food and am careful to consistently mask-up and sanitize. 

Anything can happen, but I don’t see how COVID 19 kills more people with similar stats as mine than the obese. 

Fat hysteria and flogging people to lose weight for fear of COVID is missing the target audience.

For folks like me, step off!"
2020-10-13 19:46:54,"Just an anecdotal observation, but among the people I know, those who have been most alarmed and reluctant to re-engage with society have also gained most weight. Presumably making them more vulnerable to Covid."
2020-10-13 15:07:01,"So folks,
The bad news: A full 75% of us are ""at increased risk"" of severe Covid, if we catch it. So, resistance is futile. We are DOOMED. (right??)
The good news: If you are overweight, you can DECREASE your risk of severe disease by eating yourself into full-blown obesity (?!).

Does anybody think that this sort of statistical hand-waving is of any practical value?"
2020-10-13 14:16:11,This is a great message but since people of color seem to be more vulnerable to the virus partly because of obesity why isn't that mentioned in this story?  Also seems to be a good message for BLM to be delivering.
2020-10-13 18:50:44,"So many of us take medications that increase our weight and B.M.I ...We do the best that we can....Let's not succumb to fat- shaming, please."
2020-10-13 20:37:49,"First of all, toss out that BMI number as it is worthless.  One night, I was watching a personal trainer on YouTube who mentioned his height and his weight.  So, I quickly went to a BMI counter, punched in his numbers, and whamo! - obese.  Mind you, he had abs upon abs and a huge chest and was a Greek god but according to BMI numbers, he was/is obese.

We have known since the first of the year that being overweight greatly complicates COVID.  We don't need a vaccine to go on a national health craze.  We already have the tools for that.  In fact, I lost 30 pounds last winter and have kept if off by weightlifting/biking/walking and improved eating.  Instead of Jane Fonda hopping on jets to go protest global warming, how about another workout video?  How about a daytime workout show instead of some mindless game show launching people out of cannons into pools?

How about the Times skips comfort food after comfort food recipe for a lockdown and gives nothing but great healthy meals?  Instead of comfort food, how about comfort exercise?

Instead, I am being told that I need to think of obese as beautiful.  There is nothing beautiful about watching your friend (younger) slowly eat herself to death and spend the last couple years of her life trapped in her apartment so sick with diabetes that she can no longer even roll over by herself.    My friend overdosed on Mountain Dew and Jack-in-the-Box and it was not pretty."

2020-10-13 23:41:18,"35 years ago, my dad invited  me to a macrobiotic lecture in Baltimore hosted by Murray Snyder, one of the early teachers, in a room with a bunch of hippies mostly from what I can recall, all very thin , eating brown rice and  fresh cooked greens, some pickled diakon, a little miso soup discussing diet and the connection to illness....

I was a short insecure 16 year old male developing a case of acne and weighed 128  lbs,  I had to figure out how to reduce the scourge of pimples other than Oxy 5. The mostly Vegan macrobiotic diet  worked, I was sold. 

 I'm 52 and weigh 132 lbs now. I 'm still short at 5'-5.5"" but fairly thin, still eating grains , beans  greens etc. Should I catch Covid , I would expect I would have a fighting chance.

Who really knows, my gosh, the macrobiotic lecturer ended up dying of Throat Cancer If my memory serves me right,  Life is short ,nonetheless I feel bad for many Americans who are struggling with chronic diseases.  Covid 19 should be an eye opener like the zits of my youth."
2020-10-13 22:07:13,"It’s hard to listen to this and take it seriously when Donald Trump, Mike Lee (mr. “America is not supposed to be a democracy” and Chris Christy get Covid and survive with no problem or long term hospitalization. Maybe Lee isn’t heavy enough but the other two are obese. Explain that."
2020-10-13 22:09:11,"Hard-headed people are already refusing to wear masks, declaring that it is their choice whether to infect other people;  can you imagine what these ""choice caucus"" members will do when they are told they need to lose weight to protect their health?  They will choose the super fries and the brownie sundae."
2020-10-14 02:07:16,"I don’t see how this statistical nonsense is useful for anything.  This article is stating that based on BMI, approximately 3/4 of the US population is at increased risk for severe disease.  Furthermore, if you are “obese”, now is not the time to loose weight as you will end up in the “overweight” group who are somehow at higher risk."
2020-10-14 00:15:52,"BMI is a garbage measurement for anybody with any sort of muscule mass.

I'm in the 'obese' at 5'7 210 lbs. I regularly go for 30 mile bike rides on the weekends and do 70 lb shoulder presses. I can do 20+ push-ups and am slowly working on doing unassisted chin ups.

It's worse for men. Most athletes are considered obese.

Instead of figuring out a way that looks at adapose fat % -- the real risk factor -- so many rushed doctors fall back on BMI. Not because it means anything, but because it's a number they can put on their data sheets and bill for."
2020-10-14 03:18:17,"Correlation does not equal causation. That's weak science. How do you separate out underlying health conditions, lack of exercise, or harmful conditions like alcoholism, that are likely to cause both weight gain and greater susceptibility to COVID-19? Weight is overemphasised in a simplistic manner. Read Katherine Flegal's epidemiological study again."
2020-10-06 02:52:49,"Humility and admitting error require some sort of stable sense of self. Trump's existence seems to be defined by insecurity, all the while seeking to project ""strength."" We are living with the devastating consequences."
2020-10-06 02:53:49,"Of course Donald Trump has no empathy for the average American. He gets “gold standard “ treatment and thinks that’s what everyone receives. Well there’s myth and reality, and even though Trump was on reality TV, he does not know what reality is. His comments and actions are detrimental to the Nation."
2020-10-06 02:57:24,"I wonder if Trump could ever imagine not having a free ride to the hospital, not having insurance to cover the expense of his care, not having anyone to take care of the family left behind, not having a job to return to. I sincerely hope he has no job at year’s end. Let the search for his next reality show gig dominate his life. And let us change the channel."
2020-10-06 02:57:36,"right, ""don't be afraid of covid"", because if you get infected and your symptoms get bad, there will be a helicopter outside your house that will take you to a top-notch hospital, where a team of 10 nationally recognized covid experts will take care of you 24/7. all the latest treatments will be available to you. and it will all be at tax-payers expense, you won't have to pay a penny. they will even take you for a little joyride in a bulletproof limo, even while you are highly contagious, so that you don't get too bored at the hospital. definitely no reason to be afraid."
2020-10-06 03:04:34,All that government provided treatment and as a billionaire he  paid $750 in taxes.
2020-10-06 03:07:55,"It is not just the comment but the state of mind out of which it proceeds. Saying ""dont be afraid of Covid"" minimizes the significance of the over 200,000 American lives lost in the past 8 months. It tells his followers that despite his illness they don't have too wear masks and social distance as prescribed by public health experts.
Indeed the president's actions convey the mental state of a suicidal individual. We hope he refrains from these actions and that his followers see these as a disqualifying factor in a leader."
2020-10-06 03:08:50,"Dr. Conley refused to answer certain questions, citing HIPAA, which governs medical privacy. 

The problem is that he answered some questions and not others. HIPAA allows him to disclose exactly nothing without the patient's permission. 

Are we to believe that he reviewed everything carefully with Trump and got permission to reveal certain details and not others? 

Frankly, I doubt it. What I don't doubt is that Conley has fallen under Trump's sway and was making it up as he went along - to try to assuage Trump's fragile narcissism."
2020-10-06 03:13:42,"Nearly every week for the past four years, and nearly every day for the past several months, I find myself reading in utter shock something that Trump did or said. Every time, I think he can't possibly go any lower. And then he does."
2020-10-06 03:18:58,"For someone who hasn’t felt this good in 20 years, he sure seemed to be struggling to breathe after that flight of stairs. If must of felt really bad at age 54 then."
2020-10-06 03:19:07,"Today the country reached 210K deaths. There is a high probability that by the date of the inauguration on January 20th, 2021, this number might be 300-400K. 
Make no mistake, thousands of those new deaths will be directly attributed to Trump's statements today, with his followers challenging, even more, the safety restrictions on Covid, convinced that this is no big deal.
He has literally sent thousands more Americans to their future deaths today."
2020-10-06 03:22:06,"210,000 dead Americans.

But, despite the fact that he himself has personally been infected, the President of the United States continues to portray the pandemic as something that we ""don't need to fear"" because he knows that his supporters are deeply invested in the idea that the whole thing was a ""hoax"" from the very beginning.

And his actions over the last 48 hours prove, undeniably, that he would prefer they continue to believe that baseless and extremely dangerous conspiracy theory, and continue to risk their lives and the lives of everyone around them, rather than tell the truth and risk losing a vote.

You see, for a guy like Donald J. Trump, 210,000 Americans losing their lives is not nearly as important as him not losing an election. In fact, for a guy like him, they're not even on the radar."
2020-10-06 03:32:02,Has it occurred to no one that this was a carefully executed campaign stunt and that Trump never had Covid-19? Now he can say he had it and beat it in 72 hours and it’s no big deal. Has anyone been able to verify the positive test? Nope.
2020-10-06 03:34:46,"I watched Trump stand at attention on the White House balcony and remove his mask.  It was an act of defiance for all to see, representing freedom from having to wear a mask.  This is what he is telling all Americans to do.  Take off your masks in the name of liberty and patriotism.  He saluted soon after.  HIs followers may follow his example.  May God help us.  He only did this to try to get re-elected, obviously not because he cares about anyone other than himself.  Masks this winter will be really important and Trump is failing to acknowledge this.  Biden is doing the right thing anyway - calling for a national mask mandate."
2020-10-06 02:45:59,"OK. Now that Trump is back home and we shouldn't be afraid of the Corona Virus because he hasn't felt better in 20 years, Biden can bring back the negative ads."
2020-10-06 02:56:29,"I can’t believe I actually felt sorry for Trump. I should have known better. He will never learn, and he has no humility or humanity. Same old self serving Trump. His selfishness is beyond words."

2020-10-06 03:11:04,"As if Trump wasn't already the most dangerous man on earth.

I don't wish ill on anyone, but I wonder if our nation will survive Trump."
2020-10-06 03:27:46,"In my opinion, President Trump has failed to lead from the get go.  He appears to be gloating over receiving medical treatment which is not available to the vast majority of our citizens.  Now he appears to be increasing the risk of COVID infection to others by ordering the Secret Service to take him on a joy ride and poo pooing the use of masks.  These acts are the last straw.  What the President needs is a full psychological work up as I fear he is an undiagnosed sociopath who relishes adding to his death count.  Perhaps he is trying to cull our herd so that the shrinking white majority can hold on to its misused power for another few years."
2020-10-06 02:54:06,"This is truly appalling. He tells Americans not to be afraid of Covid. Right. Don’t be afraid of an illness that  required him to be hospitalized and receive  polyclonal antibody therapy, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. Not to mention an illness that has killed over 200,000 Americans."
2020-10-06 03:00:35,Says the man who got a special experimental treatment that no one else gets.
2020-10-06 03:01:59,"We should have chosen a president by having everyone in the United States write their name on a piece of paper, built a giant hat on the Washington Mall and simply drawn out a name. That person would surely have been better and safer for all than the (insert your word here) we have now."
2020-10-06 03:05:43,"“Don’t be afraid of Covid,” he wrote. “Don’t let it dominate your life.” When he arrived at the White House a few hours later, Mr. Trump removed his mask before joining several masked people inside. The president was probably still contagious, as many patients can pass on the virus for up to 10 days after symptoms begin.

Trump is always about himself. He says he has learned his lesson about Covid-19 during the past few days, but continues to be dismissive of the continued spread of the virus, which continues to kill hundreds in our country. He took a ride in his hermetically sealed vehicle against health protocol to feel the adulation of his fawning hundreds outside the hospital, needlessly exposing his Secret Service detail. He takes off his mask upon his return to the White House. 

While I hope he has a full recovery, the madness has to end. I am a Republican never Trumper who did not vote for him in 2016, yet I receive a barrage of email and snail mail thanking me for being one of his top supporters - ha! I was right the first time and will not vote Trump this election either.

At the end of the day, Trump is the super spreader (choose your event) and we are the losers."
2020-10-06 03:11:54,"According to what he is saying now, he just went to Walter Read for a spa weekend, a little massage, a little sauna and voila - problem solved. He said “Feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!” So must be he never had covid, because I never heard of anyone who recovered in 3 days. You don't even get over the common cold in three 3 days. According to available  data, ""the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6 weeks for patients with severe or critical disease.""  Must be God's miracle, or just the greatest medical treatment that the American Tax Payer can provide. Sad that the 200,000 people who have already died didn't have access to the same great medical treatment, due to his negligence, This man doesn't have an ounce of shame or decency."
2020-10-06 03:18:09,This man truly believes he’s still on a reality TV show.
2020-10-06 03:20:19,"Trumpites will continue to believe in him no matter what he says, or what he does. It is interesting how people are attracted to autocrats and become how they become ""authoritarian followers"" who who are highly ethnocentric, frequently racist, nationalistic, deeply partisan, and are threatened by “those other people.” It is no accident that such people need/want someone like Trump. IQ=shoe size."
2020-10-06 03:22:37,"Just to note here, but when Trump says he “went home from the hospital,” in actual fact, he is returning to the White House. 

The White House has advanced medical facilities on site that would be the envy of many small hospitals, to say nothing of the dedicated physicians, specialists, specialized drugs and other extraordinary treatments that are available to him at any hour of the day, any day of the week. All paid for by the American taxpayer. 

His lies and misdirection will result in more people dying. It is an obscene affront to the dignity of all Americans."
2020-10-06 03:24:36,"He's a reckless train wreck and I feel sorry for him because he's putting his own health and the health of others at risk. I'd prescribe 14 days bed rest so his body has the best chance of fighting the virus. He's taken an experimental drug and is on steroids, so is pushing is body beyond what it's capable of whilst having covid-19. Trump doesn't have youth on his side to get through this. I wouldn't be surprised if his body reacts to all the drugs in it, and him not being on bed rest, by him having a massive heart attack or a stroke. At least Boris Johnston followed doctors orders and survived."
2020-10-06 03:29:50,"What hypocrisy. Just because President Trump hasn't become seriously ill with COVID-19 (yet), he thinks everyone else should ignore its mortal or crippling danger to many and vote for him.

But that's not the deepest level of his hypocrisy. As the President, he has received top-level treatment by an army of doctors and medical staff, and his White House home essentially contains a hospital to monitor him -- all at taxpayers' expense.

Yet he's planning to use his newly stacked Supreme Court to end the Affordable Care Act, thereby depriving tens of millions of Americans access to affordable healthcare, including much more modest hospitalization for COVID-19. The Democrats should be hammering this point. Mr. Trump doesn't ""get"" anything; he's simply incapable of it."
2020-10-06 02:53:13,"Having received a level of targeted therapy that may possibly exceed that offered to any other coronavirus patient in history,  Donald Trump appears to have been set on the road to recovery. Provided he can keep those incidents of borderline syncope under control, that is."
2020-10-06 02:58:49,I am not surprised at all at Trump's this comment.  Actually it is expected. It is a stark contrast to what Britain PM said after he has recovered from COVIV-19. It again shows amply and clearly Trump has no  ability and compassion to lead USA in this pandemic crisis.

We aren't all tested every day, with teams of doctors ready to spring into action,, equipped with the best treatments available.  To treat this deadly disease as an airy nothing that left him feeling 20 years younger, without any acknowledgement of the 210,000 Americans who have died from the virus, sends a clear message:  he doesn't care about any of us and won't lift a finger to protect us."

2020-10-06 03:09:24,Trump tries to trivialize the infection in order to maintain his longtime message. He has suffered and will likely suffer more but he continues to assert that it’s no big deal. He cannot trust that people can see himself as anything but weak if he admits to being wrong. Such a weak person with responsibilities which requires great courage and modesty.

Yes, Trump took off his mask, etc. But after rebuffing questions from reporters, he turned to face the bank of cameras and signaled to his basest base--with thumbs up and clenched fist symbols.

Trump is thumbing his nose at every family and individual who have suffered grievous losses this year. He is thumbing his nose at the science-based establishment, a bipartisan cadre of believers in science. If Trump prevails, he will attempt to smother the media and silence his critics. He is, today, signaling his ""very good people"" to take up arms if he should fail to win reelection thirty days from now.

Our American democracy is currently in unprecedented danger. We must know the truth and soon. Trump supporters: You must see reason. Together, let's unmake this dire bipartisan split we are suffering. We are better together and we are doomed if we should ever let a right wing demagogue who likely delights at the continued deaths in this country, which lean heavily to people of color."
2020-10-06 03:16:16,"There are major differences between being afraid of the enemy and respecting the enemy's ability to destroy you. All combat veterans can tell you this. Fear imobilizes you giving the enemy an edge to seek you out as you cower in your bunker to kill you. On the other hand, respect of the enemy will allow you to evade and strike first or be able to counterattack effectively. The same applies to the coronavirus with the exception that it has no human fears. It is as indiscriminate as an atomic bomb destroying anything in its path if victims are unprepared to evade then counter its attack. President bone-spurs, of course, never learned this lesson but he is fortunate enough to have other people do his fighting. He can cower behind his walls and superior medical assistance and let others fight and die for him."

I was so pumped up on them I was concerned about crashing. Two days after the last dose, I did. Major rebound, weird new systemic wide symptoms; another 10 days of steroids.

He probably felt great today and decided to check himself out of the hospital and who was going to say no? However, I also noticed that he is on a heavy regimen of steroids. As someone who has had Crohn's disease for several decades I have spent some time on the steroid roller coaster. The first time you take them you take heavy doses and you feel fantastic. I heard Trump say that he hasn't felt so good in 20 years. That's the steroids talking and they may even get him through the election feeling great but you have to get off of them and there is a price to pay and usually a big crash. But as long as he doesn't get pneumonia the steroids will keep him feeling great and he will soon be the same obnoxious person he has always been and that is a good thing. I was afraid he'd have some kind of epiphany and change and get the sympathy vote. I am so glad he seems to be back to normal."
2020-10-06 03:09:58,Guessing the steroid treatment is making him feel like a “new man”! Unfortunately it still doesn’t make him human. It’s apparently making him more selfish and aggressive than ever before.

2020-10-06 03:15:04,"He never tested positive. No doctor can answer clearly when his last negative test was.

This is a complete staged hoax by Trump and we are all falling for it. He wanted to change the subject from his taxes and debate performance. And most of all, wanted to pretend that he had beaten the virus. He is the biggest faker. 

Let's never stop pursuing actual proof that he was ever sick with Covid 19 and EXPOSE this scandal!
This is one lie too far and it should take him DOWN"
2020-10-06 03:21:08,"Watch the video of Trump on the balcony of the White House. That is a man having trouble breathing. He is short of breath, huffing and puffing. His denial and bravado are dangerous to himself, and also dangerous to those whom he wants to believe his bluster about being a conquering hero with this frightening disease."
2020-10-06 03:23:08,Trump and Company has to be totally tone death. After all of the suffering the country has gone through during the Pandemic Trump plays the conquering hero? After three days in the hospital Trump wants to act like a triumphant Caesar returning to Rome? What chance did the thousand Americans have who died today from the Virus? Trump the science denier was saved by science and for anybody other than Trump it would have been a humbling experience. The talk of Trump being a tough guy who beat the Virus is nauseating. Trump lives in a fantasy world that exists between his two ears. Standing on the balcony today saluting he must have thought he was Napoleon. Trump didn't get state of the art treatment he got Special Treatment. The families of the almost quarter of a million people who have died because Trump choked wished their loved ones had the resources to live also. The Right trying to take away Obamacare while Trump flaunts his Special Care is mind boggling. The well connected get to live while the Peons are left to fend for themselves? How can Trump supporters not feel like road kill? Government Health Care saved their Great Leader. Sometimes one have to think people on the Right are living in an alternative universe. Trump forcing his agents to ride around the block yesterday so he could play Der Fuhrer was off the reservation. Good thing for a guy who got a ride to the hospital in a Marine Chopper to tell the people don't be afraid of the Virus? Let Them Eat Cake!

2020-10-06 03:00:24,"In his Tweet announcing his departure from the hospital, Trump says, ""Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!""

Let's translate. He's saying take no precautions to keep from getting Covid-19, because the worst thing that happens is you catch it, and then the docs can give you the cool drugs I helped invent, and you'll be better than ever.

Even presuming he does live, this is flabbergasting. You would think his somewhat near-death experience would have sobered him a tiny bit. Yet it has made him a bigger blowhard than ever. It's slightly entertaining if you're a blowhard down at the corner bar. But this guy is supposed to be managing the welfare of 330 million people. Instead he's totally unengaged, and even worse is pouring gasoline on the fire by trying to convince our people this is not even something to be the least bit afraid of. 

This will be of little consolation to the loved ones of the over 200,000 people who have died of Covid-19, many due to his malfeasance.

And, if the polls tell us anything, although he survived this crisis physically he won’t survive politically. Due to his explosive disaster in last Tuesday’s debate, his poll numbers have tanked, as the remaining undecided voters have pretty-much defected as a group. So, this is the way Trump's world ends, not with a bang but with his usual bombast and lies."

Trump is a disgrace to this country and a disgrace to the world. A vile superspreader and a wretched human being who would frivolously risk the lives of U.S. Secret Service agents in order to indulge his (probably erotically-charged) dictatorial fantasy life, in which he surveys troops and deigns to wave to his subjects from the confines of his armored and hermetically sealed pod, which has severed the president's cerebral cord and has left him unable to think.

All for a tax contribution of $750 year, that is when you actually decide to pay your tax

Reality is poking its nose in the door. Scarily, it doesn't wear a mask, because YOU should be.

All those around him have a duty of care to rein him in, for his and other’s safety. If he had an automatic rifle and was spraying bullets around in a similar way would the same people that are saying nothing still be silent.
All the experts are inferring he was COVID positive during the Barrett ceremony in the Rose Garden. I think it may be likely he went to the debate whilst positive.
It’s time to make a decision. Trump’s display today at the White House was as unhinged as it could be. It is time to allow Pence to take over the Presidency until Trump has recovered his physical and mental ‘health’

The illness he is.
Excerpt:
""He is a weak man who has always longed to be a strong man, and he is a weak man’s idea of a strong man, and right before he got sick he made it clearer than ever that he intends to be a strongman. Some, knowing their history and knowing the pretensions of weak men and strongmen and weak men who become strongmen, have warned us about this potential from the beginning. But others, more cautious, more trusting in the power of institutions to save us, waited until recently to begin sounding the alarm. This is how democracy ends, they began to whisper. This is how it happens. He is attempting to do this right before our eyes.""

It is not easy to escape the nightmare of two viruses, Covid19 and Trump20 but CNN began a series about America's First Ladies  and, as it happened, the first was about Michelle Obama.  And so for 90 minutes I was able to get lost in Michele's world, Michelle's  effervescent personality, her good nature, her commanding presence and good looks and finally her street smarts synthesized with a profound intelligence.   She skillfully spoke as naturally and
effectively as any American public personality.  One of the real champs.

Of course, after the show was over, I awakened to our current reality in which we have no leader, no one in power to admire (outside of Speaker Pelosi who has to constantly face the president and the majority leader in an American version of the Asylum of Charenton.

2020-10-06 03:49:40,"I don't give credence to anything Trump says, not about himself, not about the virus or his medical care, and not about anything.  He lost any credibility with me since his inauguration.

After watching his medical team give their public presentations, I don't give credence to anything any of them says about Trump, about his treatment, or about his condition.  In their presentations they acted similar to Pence's disgusting perpetual behavior of publicly lavishing praise on Trump, although they were more restrained about it than Trump.

His medical team also spoke falsely to us all today when the lead doctor said that his care was the same as CDC guidelines.  Trump received the Regeneron drug despite that it is not an FDA approved treatment and despite that the medical condition of Trump did not meet the FDA requirements for emergency (compassionate) use authorization.  No member of the public would be able to get the Regeneron drug if we were in the same medical condition Trump was in when he received it.

Many partisans who comment on these pages implore us to ""trust the experts"".  Baloney!!  The experts at FDA who instantly agreed to permit emergency use of Regeneron's drug for Trump do not deserve to be trusted.  The Trump team of doctors who spoke falsely to us today and misleadingly to us earlier do not deserve to be trusted.  The experts should be listed to with skepticism.  Their advice should usually be followed but they are not entirely above improper influence."
2020-10-06 03:50:28,"Parallel to the disastrous spread of Covid-19 is the spread of Trump's obstructive misinformation, bad advice and lies.  From the beginning of the pandemic he has been a force for chaos by trying to suppress health measures to control it, lying about the progress made in controlling it, and now the seriousness of the disease. 

Contrary to what he said, he has learned nothing from his own experience of Covid. He continues to pretend that the coronavirus isn't really life-threatening, seems to be s like a case of the flu, and isn't even calling for tracking of the people who have been exposed by contact at his events after he tested positive. 

More than 200 thousand people have died from this disease and  7.5 million have been sicked by it. He has proved to be almost as much of a disaster as the disease itself."

Hence, there is no global effort among countries to ensure that the pandemic remains under control. Other small countries, like where I live, needs and rely on American leadership. This pandemic knows no border. Is not just about the rising number of death, this pandemic destroys jobs, render people jobless and destroy livelihood. Not many Americans may realise this, but your vote matters not just to you but to people living in small states in other parts of the world."
2020-10-06 04:12:26,I don't care whether he wants to risk himself. My only concern is that he will risk the others by going out to infect the public. It's been shown that he has been against all the major guidelines even though he got the virus already.

The entire evening news on all three networks was monopolized by the president's  leaving Walter Reed at the time the broadcasts started. After the meaningless drama of a helicopter ride [followed in its entirety] was over, the president prolonged it by -- unbelievably -- taking off his mask and going among other people. I watched Lester Holt's broadcast, and Mr. Holt remarked on the craziness of it. Mr. Trump no doubt cared little about Lester's comments, the goal was to be the subject of them."

But while temporarily making you feel like superman, and while suppressing cytokine storm in a critically ill covid patient, they actually suppress the immune system and weaken the body.

It is hysteria and hypochondria to be afraid of the virus.  

The only way to resolve the issue is functional immunity through widespread infection. 

If the left took the virus seriously, they would lose the extra weight they were carrying, they would socially distance, they would use the scientific method to come up with viable views about the disease and treatment.  Instead they are obsessed with ineffective masks and using fatalities out of context. 

The death rate from COVID-19 for Caucasians and people without major health concerns is very, very low. 

Thank you for showing us the truth, President Trump."

2020-10-06 04:18:26,"And what will the repercussions be of this president's verbal nonsense? Nothing. 

The GOP will say nothing. The Democrats and scientific community will be outraged. But then the the GOP will say that they are all part of the far left deep state trying to take this country down. The GOP base will believe them and that will be the end of it.

We've been down this path too many times before to expect anything will change now. The only difference will be that the claims by Trump will increase in frequency and in their degree of exaggeration. 

It is too bad we can't declare Trump a national health emergency."

2020-10-06 04:45:12,"From the onset of Trump’s term we have been hoping against hope that he would prove to be anything but the man we had seen during his campaign. But the man was 70 years old when he moved into the Oval Office, and his character had been set long ago. The fact that he was now the most powerful man on earth did not humble him in the slightest, if anything it emboldened him. We cannot expect him to make a U-turn at this late date; he will continue in this vein until he has to leave the White House, whenever that may be."
2020-10-06 04:48:42,"And that is how your elected official is conducting world politics as well. Walking in and out as he pleases. Once, he is voted out of these responsibilities, your system has to change in order to avoid such people holding such important positions in society again and again."

This again?

Sometimes you just have to face reality, no matter how grim it happens to be. He's not going to change."
2020-10-06 04:52:22,"I remember after 9-11 the Media and the government peer pressured Americans into backing the Patriot Act as a necessary means to fight terrorism. If anyone opposed the Patriot Act they were shamed as ""unpatriotic"" ""un American"" and ""disgraceful"".
After the Patriot Act and on to current day our Civil Liberties in the US has declined consistently each year. By Civil Liberties I mean your freedoms and rights and mine too, as individual citizens. The USA's rank for its form of government in the annual review of Democracies worldwide has declined  to 25th in the world as of last year. It is no longer a FULL Democracy but a FLAWED Democracy. Obama and Bush helped create this and Trump now capitalizes on it. Our next President will  capitalize on it as well. And regular citizens like you and I will experience less freedoms, less fairness, more poverty.
I find it very similar that COVID19 deaths parallel in the same peer pressure as the Patriot Act. That we must obey out of being ""respectful"" to those who have died. COVID19 follows this same shaming tactic as it manipulates us by our highest morality. It is not the morality in question but the thieves in politics who are using it to change our country. Both parties are to blame. Why? Because neither side speaks of our declining rank in freedoms for our citizens compared to the rest of the world.

His inability to admit that NOBODY in America (or perhaps the world) would have gotten as rapid treatment and diagnosis, including a recombinant antibody that is still classified as EXPERIMENTAL and which very well may have SAVED HIS LIFE is reprehensible, but true to character. The caps can't be overdone here - Trump will be lucky to feel back to normal anytime in the next three months, let alone three days. ""Long COVID"" (post-COVID syndrome) is very real and doesn't care who you are or what treatments you have access to. And lets not forget that undoubtedly he insisted on the steroids/dexamethasone - NO critical care or infectious disease doctor who has actually treated COVID patients would have endorsed that because steroids are clearly harmful at this stage of illness (suppresses the innate response and interferon production). Steroids just very well may undo any benefit he gained from prescient antibody and remdesivir treatment. So let the prophecy unfold and the false idol reap what he has sowed - jail time for tax fraud, a righteous case of long COVID and a lost election."
2020-10-06 04:53:00,"Convenient how Trump ignores the threat of COVID, leading to the death of over 200,000 Americans, but is happy to accept the help of medical science when convenient and affects him. I don't know how the doctors could treat him.
Those who deny science need to be denied the benefit of science!

On another note, when is Congress going to deem him 'unfit of mind' to govern?  It seems like it is way past the point.  As a doctor, one can schedule a patient who is a risk to themselves and others.  Trump has fulfilled those criteria for months!"

They have been aided by the WHO and the liberal media. I am a lifelong liberal but I hate winning based on a targeted attack by a foreign actor. We must learn from this that war now takes forms much more subtle than cyberattacks. This attack was genius but I fear it will go unpunished and lead to even more vile sabotage by others in the future.  When will we ever learn?"
2020-10-06 05:25:32,"To an extent Trump is right.   Not that we shouldn’t fear COVID, but that we shouldn’t fear it as much as you want us to.   I know people who are young, in perfect health and they are so scared for their lives when the math and science doesn’t support that level of fear.   You don’t have to live in fear, you are choosing to live in fear.   There is a difference."
2020-10-06 04:50:08,"The President had access to the best medical care in the world; was provided medical treatments not available to the public or given only to the sickest individuals; said he learned a great deal about Covid-19 and then proceeded to take a ride in an air tight Chevy Suburban exposing his Secret Service staff and then returns to the White House telling the nation, ""Don't be afraid of Covid"". 

He clearly has learned nothing from his experience.  Why does anyone in his administration believe he would receive empathy from the voting public as a result of his illness when he cares about no one except himself ?"

How many ways will your ""experts"" craft these misleading messages? 
You are not believed anymore because of your own doing. 
Mr Biden preaches about ""public safety"" and continues to wear a measly cheap mask that looks like it's not much better quality than a paper towel with rubber bands. I can get the same one for free at a hardware store. They are WORTHLESS to protect from anything.

Meanwhile his minions are trying to negate proposed new rules (tougher) to approve these ""rocket"" vaccines he keeps promoting. His interference in the vaccine developments underway has made many of the public wary of taking these new vaccines whenever they show up. Man just doesn't understand how leadership works. He could have blunted the effects of the virus early if he had just had the sense to wear a mask and declare it the patriotic thing to do.

2020-10-06 05:19:52,"It’s absolutely unthinkable that even after being stricken by Covid 19 infection, Trump is still full of bloviating braggadocio. 

Trump should have somberly addressed the nation in order to urge everyone to follow the public health guidelines of wearing masks and maintaining social distance.  As opposed to doing the above, Trump callously flouted all precautions to go for a Photo Op with his supporters and thus, endangered the health of Secret Service agents. It’s the same kind of solipsistic narcissism that he projected during the debate by making fun of Biden’s habit of wearing masks. He also discourages Mask wearing in the White House. Trump just returned to the White House from the hospital and took off his mask for a Photo Op. 

GOP and Trump should also be held accountable for recklessly disregarding public heath guidelines during the gathering on the White House lawn to celebrate the new SCOTUS nomination. This event turned into a superspreader. 

Trump’s servile minions also continue to engage in propaganda in order to falsify and minimize his health risks associated with Covid. They are practicing the nefarious notion of propaganda as espoused by a notorious propagandist: If someone tells a BIG LIE and keeps on repeating it, people will ultimately come to believe it. 

Trump is desperately trying to project the image that he is only MILDLY SICK - he is fighting BRAVELY against COVID 19 - so vote for him - don’t  trust the FAKE NEWS - Covid will just DISAPPEAR- poof"

Is that true? Are our public health experts that naive? Have they paid no attention to Donald Trump these past four years? (Or longer.)

The only possible scenario in which I could imagine there being any hope that Trump's behavior would change would be if he were on his death bed for weeks and when he recovered he suffered permanent debilitating damage.

And I'd still bet against any positive change in Trump. That is who he is. 

Trump (Lucy) has made countless Americans into Charlie Browns and he never stops offering to hold the football for them. Sadly, those Charlie Browns always seem to give Lucy one more chance. The problem is Lucy and Charlie Brown are in a comic strip. Trump and those who still hold out hope (for any kind of positive change) are living in the real world where the body count keeps increasing.

Trump is poison. The antidote is a vote for Joe Biden on November 3, 2020."

Their purpose in this undermining of public health messaging is quite simple: To fortify their supporters, encouraging them to vote at the polls on election day, so that in conjunction with the effort to delegitimize mail balloting, they have a strategy for stealing the election."
2020-10-06 05:04:11,"If you think Donald Trump's decision making process is demented now just wait until after he loses the Nov. 3 election. That's when the duck with bone spurs session will begin and with nothing to lose, the Donald, to exact revenge will probably go on a wild rampage that will make what's happening now look like a Sunday School picnic.

And knowing the Donald, expect some behind the scenes last minute (how shall I put this?) looting to occur too. After all, he wouldn't be the Donald if he passed up a final opportunity to fill his pockets with ill gotten gains."

But now, I am even more afraid of people being wreckless as he is being.  

He is like Jim Jones of Jones Town Guyana because he appears to be giving people medical advice, which will harm them and others, a sort of suicidal mission. 

Whereas I was hoping for him to see the light, as nearly every single sufferer of Covid-9 has reported.  So many state, ""It's real.."" As if I didn't know.  They add, and the infection or to be infected is horrible.  

Just more insanity from the White House.

May there never be another President like Trump ever again."
2020-10-06 04:39:08,I know that it may sound strange and strangely simple but Trump doesn't care a fig whether you live or die and actually he might lean to preferring your death. Our President is a very different person from you and his thinking is about as much like yours as is the mental process of a cobra. I'm not saying that he is not of average intelligence but that what IQ he has is very different from yours. I would assume that he would find your mind very odd indeed. Now that he is on high doses of steroids things become still more peculiar. He will likely not sleep much or not at all. His appetite will increase and he will gain weight. Emotionally he will become volatile and easily enraged. In short he may not  be fit company for man or beast. He may have visual hallucinations and even paranoid delusions. But don't worry once he is off his meds he will get back to his old self in a few months or a year or two.

2020-10-06 05:58:29,"The continuous news of Trump's defiance of all of the recommendations from medical professionals, made to help prevent the  spread of COVID 19, means that those with power to preserve our country need to step in and help in all ways possible to preserve the safety of our country. It's vividly apparent that he is no longer fit to be our president due to medical complications that prevent him from being able to make coherent choices to protect people in close proximity to him and for our country, in general. 

It seems that one of the medications he has been taking creates a false sense of euphoria. This medication was said to often create a manic state, according to two medical  professionals, who have been interviewed very recently. Trump said that he hasn't felt so well in the past 20 years.....? Could it be that, he feels this way because of the drug he is taking, due to the severity of his condition? I wonder if there might be some liability for the medical professionals who have allowed him to return to his residence, if Donald decides to take matters into his own hands and violates all of the medical pretocols put in place to keep him isolated until he is no longer contagious."
2020-10-06 06:37:06,"From abroad, and with nearly 50,000 dead in my country and 4 times as many dead I’m your country, I find what has happened to be unbelievable.

The President has not communicated the facts of his lung scan. He has ordered upbeat assessments of his health. He has belittled the suffering of people with covid and the thousands grieving by saying this is nothing to worry about. 

I am torn between believing this is a publicity stunt OR it’s just insanity. Who knows which at this point? All I can say is that it baffled me before how people voted for him - now, it would just be condoning the insanity of the past week."

But, just like he did then, and as he is doing now, his self-destructive, narcissistic behavior will take him down.  The difference is now, it’s not just him, and those around him in business and family who will be affected.  It’s the United States."
2020-10-06 07:19:25,"One of the many disheartening aspects of this crisis has been, as far as I can tell, the complete absence of the concept of courage. No public figure has urged us to be brave and they should have. Trump has come close to doing so. It’s not wrong."
2020-10-06 07:35:49,"I was wondering what the game was.
Now Look at that video. Read the tweet. 
He can’t stop boasting. But because of that he’s giving himself away. 

Slowly, we are getting closer to finding out how his mind actually works.

“As your leader I had to do that. I know there’s a danger to it, but I had to do that. I stood out in front. I led. Nobody who’s a leader would do what I did. And I knew there’s a risk, there’s a danger, but that’s ok. And now I’m better and may be immune...”

If, at this point, people choose politicians over doctors, they no longer deserve our protection. Rough to say so, but the facts are completely obvious."
2020-10-06 08:05:22,"I just hope Joe Biden stays far away from him in the debates and wears a mask at them (a good, virus-blocking one). Maybe now Trump is like a vaccinated child who won't come down with the measles or diphtheria but who can be the carrier of the pathogens, which can be passed on to a person who hasn't been immunized. Wherever Trump is, the virus could be floating around on motes of dust and on aerosol droplets. Perhaps the rest of the debates should be held outdoors, with a large distances between everyone involved in them. 

Just because one person gets through the infection without any major suffering doesn't mean anything; there's a genetic factor involved that can help the virus do extensive damage to people who you wouldn't think likely to become severely stricken. Any one of us could be more at risk than we imagine."
2020-10-06 08:07:22,"Before the virus struck Trump had already proven himself to be unfit for leadership. He was down in the polls and facing rising unpopularity.

One would think that his subsequent disastrous response to Covid would have completely submerged his ratings. Yet his percentage of supporters has hardly changed.

This makes me think that there are two different species of human beings, at least in America, and that one of them has not yet evolved the ability to think rationally."
2020-10-06 08:48:24,Temporary euphoria is a well-known common side effect of Dexamethasone and it can furthermore mask the severity of the patient's condition. It is likely (in fact strikingly so) that this is what Trump experiences. I would not be surprised if in a few days time the name of your president is Mike Pence. Whether that is an improvement or not is a different matter.
2020-10-06 07:22:04,"""Average people"" do not need medical attention for Covid.. 50% are asymptomatic and 85% overall have mild symptoms not requiring medical attention.  This statement is fact, though some may interpret is as lack of empathy for those 15% who do require medical attention, and whose psyches are so upregulated by the media that they fear for their lives, when 99.5% will survive.

Yet the ""average people"" who have been deprived of livelihoods, those literally scared to death by staying at home with heart attacks and strokes for fear of catching virus in emergency rooms, those who delayed their breast biopsies and colonoscopies and will die excess cancer deaths, those with attempted and successful suicides from the hysteria induced anxiety  battered spouses and children sheltering at home, are also dominated by the virus - arguably unnecessarily.  Any empathy  by the media for them?  Any slight guilt?

Example:  Michigan, 10 million people, harshest lockdown in US... over 7,000 covid deaths.   Sweden, 10 million, no lock down under 6,000 deaths.

Empathy is a precious human virtue. We all have our own perspective on what is more harmful and  for whom to be empathetic.

Not much empathy for the 80,000 in US who died from flu in 2017-8  as  I remember.. *California did not even count flu deaths in those over 65, so who knows how many really died?  Is it all situationaL?"
2020-10-06 05:32:50,"How much did President Trump’s care for those three days cost?  That large medical team, the round trip helicopter ambulance?  The morale boosting trip down the street with security?  The experimental drugs?  The high tech testing?

Probably around $5 Million.  

Think about that when you can’t get a test, can’t get a preauthorization for care, have to travel a long distance for care because your local hospital closed, when your premiums go up next year due to the burden of COVID care and subsequent management of long term issues, when your out of pocket maximum goes up, when your copay increases, when more uncovereds are added to your plan, when your healthcare FSA has more restrictions, when your premiums to cover a family are ridiculous, when your employer reduces your coverage, when you get a bill you didn’t expect, when you wait on the phone for 4 hrs, when you get transferred to 10 people who can’t answer your question.

We pay more per capita for healthcare than any country in the world.  Why do we do this to ourselves?"
2020-10-06 06:01:26,"Some people are saying that his decisions since going to the hospital demonstrate ""strength.""  I'd ask them: Demonstrate strength to whom?  To you? Would YOU have thought him less strong if he hadn't taken the car ride and if he now were staying in the hospital through the second week of his infection?  Or if all along he'd been saying (and modeling), ""wear a mask!""  No. 

Is it, instead, for the benefit of everyone else? I think there, too, we can agree the answer is no.  As you know, everyone else sees all of these moves as selfish and childish and destructive.  

That leaves himself - is he demonstrating strength to himself?

Using ""warrior"" to describe his performance last Tuesday is similarly confusing. Would you have said ""oh, he's not a warrior"" if he HADN'T derailed the debate?  And do you think everyone else is now using that word to describe the person they saw and heard on that stage, or very different words?

Maybe you're focusing on ends, not means. Maybe your perception of the ""strong warrior"" is based on concrete things that he GAINED, for himself and perhaps even for the country, by these behaviors.  So if I may:  What concrete things are those?"
2020-10-06 07:57:50,"According to the WHO we have 750M infections (WHO says 10% of world population affected) and 1M death. That puts the IFR (Infection Fatality Rate) at 0.13%. The IFR of yearly influenza is 0.1%. So Covid is, according to the WHO, comparable to the influenza.

Have we ever shut down economies and devolved into a global panic over influenza? No! Neither should we over Covid-19.

As much as I am a leftie, on this one Trump is right."
2020-10-06 06:25:44,"The day's real mediical question, as with Reagan in his last year of the Presidency, is how do you tell normal from pathological?

""On Sunday, when he left his quarters at Walter Reed to wave to supporters from an S.U.V., some doctors and others noted the “irresponsibility” of being in a sealed vehicle and potentially exposing Secret Service agents for an unnecessary stunt.""

President Trump is correct, when he says, ""Don’t be afraid of covid"", as he leaves the hospital. Yes, the odds are genuinely on your side, as long you have an unlimited number of the best doctors hovering over you every minute, as long as you have access to every treatment, and as long as the taxpayers are footing the bill. And, of course, as long as you don't care who else you might infect.

Perhaps the Democrats will be creative enough to use this as an example in favor of single-payer health insurance. Sure, give Trump excellent care. As long as we also have access to it."

2020-10-06 09:04:05,"The two most popular ""explanations"" of this sorry spectacle seem to be:

1) Trump is a ""superspreader"", not caring about even his allies in his pursuit of re-election.

2) Trump has manufactured this as a re-election ploy (for sympathy, or to minimize the COVID-19 threat, etc.) and was never actually infected. (Are some of the allies also faking infection?)

As far as I'm concerned, either scenario is 25th Amendment territory. I just don't understand some Americans."
2020-10-06 09:10:55,"I'm not sure that his taking off his mask when he got up to the Truman balcony on the South Portico was a conscious flaunting of the protection guidelines. Repeatedly seeing the TV clips of his climb up the stairs and watching him take his mask off so he could stand there and show off, he looked quite out of breath. He appeared to be trying to stand there upright for a while breathing normally, but his upper body and mouth were straining for more air after the climb. I think he got up there and feeling that need took his mask off unconsciously to get more air. He seems to be trying to project normalcy while actually being in pretty bad shape. The next week, or so, will tell..."
2020-10-06 09:03:45,"I think Donald Trump and P.T. Barnum had a good deal in common.  It seems Barnum came out the better for what he was made of.  
Both were showman and politicians (Barnum was a Mayor of Bridgeport, CN and served two terms in the CN legislature as a Republican.  He had been both a Democrat and a Republican), Both were businessmen and authors and both promoted and celebrated hoaxes.  

However, there are substantive differences.  Barnum is quoted as saying of himself ""I am a showman by profession...and all the gilding shall make nothing else of me.""   Barnum knew who he was.  He had that precious gift of life, a self identity.  Mr. Trump has roles, important ones, but they are no substitute for an absence of a stable, trustwothy self identity.  He is a dangerous man, yet a man to be pitied, a man who is desperate and a man who is vulnerable to be used by unscrupulous others until they achieve their purpose and have no further use of him.  Mr. Trump missed his calling.  He should have followed Barnum's example.  I think he would have been happier, challenged, less bored and less restless.  Maybe less sick, and less prone to make others sick.  But he would have to be more honest about himself, and he can not.  He falls under the last toxic spells, those of  of political power brokers.   

Term limits for representative democracy is very wise.  Any Constitutional Amendment should  consider term limits for the Supreme Court of 16 years and no, don't add more judges."
2020-10-06 06:03:49,"I was pleased to hear President Trump was going home. But I thought he was going all the way home...to Florida.  That is what he and the country needs, for the president to go home and rest until January."
2020-10-06 07:51:36,"I expected that unless Trump has a near death experience due to the virus, he would never change his assertions that it is not a serious threat to any but a few old people near the end of their lives. That is what has happened, so far. He has also gone into his John Wayne impression to project machismo. 

But he’s not over this disease and it has affected his lungs, so he should be a little more modest, he could still have some rough times. 

As for feeling better than twenty years, ago, that’s a side effect of the medicines he’s been taking. It will go away when the treatment stops."
2020-10-06 07:10:27,"There is an incredible irony in Trump's statement ""Don't be afraid of covid""  because he, more than any other American, is afraid of covid.  His fear is that covid would lay bare his utter weakness as a leader; and that it has done relentlessly. All that is left for the public to see is a sick, withered man whose flagging attempts at leadership amount to nothing more than dangerous publicity stunts. 

We the people, on the other hand are not 'afraid' of covid anymore. We are cautious, and respectful of its ability to indiscriminately sicken and kill, but we're not afraid. We were at first, and we had every right to be. But now, we have the knowledge and the tools to keep us safe, and the disease at bay until we can fairly and ubiquitously distribute safe and effective vaccines and treatments. Yes, it takes hard work, diligence, and sacrifice, but the America I still (perhaps naively) believe in isnt afraid of that. And we need not be 'afraid' of covid either. 

Mr Trump however, has every right to be afraid of covid. While his health may recover, covid has all but vanquished any hope that he may viewed as anything but a weak and incapable leader."
2020-10-06 05:40:15,"Had Trump spent time on a ventilator, he would be singing a different tune. He had premier medical care and should be grateful for his recovery. Over 200,000 people died in our country, yet he encourages people to not fear covid or wear masks. He is a moral hazard in society, a threat to our Democracy, a Coronavirus spreader and failed leader."
2020-10-06 08:02:44,"I don't agree with Trump on much but I can agree with this statement!

There has been too much fear mongering by people apparently afraid of their own shadows over the past 7 months.  Trillions of $$ of assets and investments have been destroyed, including the economic lives of far too many people who will never recover financially.  

Meanwhile countries like Sweden and Denmark that never had strict mask wearing requirements or lockdowns are chugging along economically just fine.

All politicians that supported lockdowns  should be voted out of office!"
2020-10-06 06:55:22,"I do not fall easily to conspiracy theories. However, this COVID infection with such a speedy recovery seems to be very doubtful. Removing ostentatiously his face mask combined with the remark not be be worried about COVID-19 are a mockery of all lives taken. And sadly millions of his supporters will be cheering about."
2020-10-06 08:18:37,"Having spent considerable time as a hospital patient, and now observing Trump's arrogant behavior after 3 days of extraordinary levels of monitoring and the ""kitchen sink"" of available treatments, I'll bet you dollars to donuts he was an irritable demanding ogre. Having to follow hospital protocols, giving up his authority to physicians directing his care must have given him fits.  He should have stayed in bed and rest to allow the drugs to have their maximum benefit. We can all plainly see that didn't happen. 
He probably signed out AMA (against medical advice) because the campaign couldn't wait another day. Who might get the bug from him now with all the people who work at or visit the WH? Or will they simply refuse to take the risk of catching infection?  The added stress on Trump who's ""got to keep going full speed ahead"" with his terrible poll numbers will also affect his prognosis. Whatever happens, he can't do the opposite of what his infectious disease doctor orders him to do. Covid is free to go away, or perhaps it will stay and multiply- no one can change that reality."
2020-10-06 08:35:16,"With his irresponsible and casual remarks about the gravely fatal c9vid pandemic, and the acts of defying the covid safety protocols not only this motormouth US president, Donald Trump, has exposed his lack of maturity and common sense but also undermined the herculean effort of the health experts and medical practioners that they have collectively mounted to save lives risking their own. If it is all to win election through the politics of theatrics and spectacle, it is time the Alerican voters call his bluff loudly and decisively and dump him in the dustbin of history, so that his nuisance in public life ends soon."
2020-10-06 09:34:35,"The tragedy of Trump's denial and phony machismo about covid was apparent long before he contracted  the disease.  During his rallies, despite 'official' press photos of people behind him, most people did not wear masks and were often closer than 6 feet.  But even then, Trump made sure that no one came close to him, and he was tested daily, sometimes more than once.

Some cities where he had rallies reported markedly higher incidents of the virus following his rallies, tho the cause/effect was often hard to prove.   Then there were the 1/4 million bikers, spreading 'the word'. 

This pattern of public denial accompanied by intense private concern for Mr. Trump is not new.  It is how this man has operated for decades; Me, me, me ...

I fervently hope that in a couple of months, as a private citizen, Mr. Trump will survive this disease, so he can deal with the huge legal issues concerning his taxes and other behavior which have recently surfaced."
2020-10-06 06:12:11,"Dear Pam Belluck, I've heard of altered mental status, and neurologic manifestation (used in the article you cited) but never ""altered mental function""."
2020-10-06 09:36:27,"I had covid. It wasn't a walk in the park and it took me three months at least to be symptoms free. Add the brain fog, which is extremely difficult to diagnose and understand. Am i sluggish and forgetful and a bit irrational because of covid or I'm just getting old?
I had access to the best care in the world as well coming from a family of doctors, but i can tell you one thing that everyone of them and their colleagues were adamant about. After covid it's of the utmost importance to rest, rest and rest or long term consequences will ensue. I seriously doubt Trump will follow this advice, thus imperiling his decisional ability and ultimately imperil the country, not that he cares of course, he's more interested in playing Mussolini. What a sad small man and a dangerous period we are living in."
2020-10-06 07:35:59,"Don’t forget that this man has another disease that’s much stronger affecting him than COVID-19. Look it up in DSM. It’s called Narcisistic Personality Disorder. Trump has the best doctors in the world who may be able to keep covid for him (not for millions of other Americans unfortunately) at a ‘workable’/not life threatening level. However, there’s no cure for the other illness. It’s not conteageous (although it looks like it’s hereditary) but nevertheless extremely dangerous to the well being of everyone around him - in this case, the entire world."
2020-10-06 08:35:29,"What the NYTs does not seem to understand is that for 6 months half the country has taken the approach of not being afraid, of not letting Covid dominate every waking moment and learning to live and work within a Covid environment.  There is a reason state unemployment figures in open states are in some cases half the unemployment rates in NY,NJ, CA, MA, etc...  . The people in these states have driven the recovery while places like NYC continue to remain barren of economic activity."
2020-10-06 05:46:19,"(Ordinarily, I am not a conspiracy theorist) . . . but is it absolutely certain he even has the virus? After all, this is the guy who has told more than 20,000 falsehoods since he took office. It would not surprise me if it was discovered that this whole scenario was planned (at his next rally he'll be saying ""I had it! It's not that bad! Just a tiny fever!""), with such dramatic timing mere weeks before the election."
2020-10-06 07:19:31,"Donald Trump politicized Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and its main back-up consulting resource, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, a non-governmental facility in Baltimore. Through those two institutions, Mr. Trump received the finest medical care, including two experimental drugs, for his self-inflicted Covidd-19 infection.

After being discharged, apparently to have his care continued at the White House, Donald Trump turned his return into a political photo-op. He walked briskly from the Marine helicopter, up the exterior stairway to the second floor, dramatically removed his face mask for the cameras and walked inside to join his staff and guests inside, all awaiting his return without masks.

Walter Reed and Johns Hopkins allowed themselves to be manipulated by Donald Trump in a way that will say to the American people that Covid-19 is no big deal, so just go about your business and enjoy yourselves.

The very least that the leaders of Walter Reed and Johns Hopkins should do is to condemn Donald Trump's behavior in harsh, explicit language."
2020-10-06 07:54:29,"Well, i understand the underlying message from him here, to be honest, which is ""don't let it take over your lives"". Most people infected with the virus, doesn't die or even get very ill, in all fairness!

From a campaigning perspective it is a disaster, where he needs the suburbanites and elderly to get back in the race, both of whom, aren't going to think of this as nothing but disrespectful and reckless!

Personally, i see the limitations of a desperate man, and i'm  starting to feel confident that he will actually loose big Nov 3, which is good for both America and the world!"
2020-10-06 09:38:55,"If attendees at the Amy Coner Barrett Rose Garden shindig would have been masked and socially distanced, we could have avoided this falling stack of dominoes at the White House. It would not have been too much to ask. 

What was/is the cost of trump's Walter Reed visit? How much are we, the taxpayers, going to be billed? What about all the other other infected WH employees? What price do we put on someone's health? What price for a life? Who pays?

The vast majority of people are not cowering in fear somewhere from the virus. They are trying to protect themselves and their loved ones, support their families, and bravely get through this whole thing. Modifications are inconvenient, but mean the difference between disability and death and financial ruin. Trump has only increased our suffering and the number of deaths. 

It is a slap in the face to all the front line workers, to all of us struggling to survive this, to suggest the only two sides of this are ""cowering in fear"" or getting out there, unmasked, to further spread the virus. The pandemic was poorly handled, and those following science and choosing not to contract the virus by following guidelines were mocked and bullied. 

I just don't get what kind of thrill one would derive from leading one's own people to walk off a cliff."
2020-10-06 06:40:50,"Because of Trump's abhorrent behavior, the USA has 4 times as many fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants as Germany, and 5 times as many as Austria.  We could have had 50,000 dead, and an economy beginning to re-open.  Instead, because of Trump's chaotic mishandling of this pandemic, we will have 300,000 dead by Christmas.  And he just doesn't care."
2020-10-06 09:39:39,"“Don’t be afraid of Covid,” Trump wrote. “Don’t let it dominate your life.” 
Says the man who receives 'Cadillac' care with 24-hour supervision and intervention for his health and comfort. He essentially moved from one hospital to another at the White House.  The sheer arrogance and indifference toward his followers signals what he thinks about everybody other than himself. We are all stage props in his little psychodrama.  History books will dub this era and Trump's  presidency as the Age of Solipsism."
2020-10-06 05:51:27,"Trump's still undoubtedly carrying the virus but he's already taking off his mask and breathing his disease-ridden breath over everything in sight.

The guy is a life-threatening danger to everyone he's near but he cares so little he won't even keep his mask on.

Come November there's not going to be anyone on his team who isn't infected. And this is the person 30 - 40% of the nation thinks should be leading us."
2020-10-06 06:03:56,"Incredible callousness and tone deafness that is really, not surprising at all, except that hundrdleds of thousands of precious life has perished because of this president's inadequacy."
2020-10-06 06:09:14,It is unfortunate that the people who get this disease and die from it are not concentrated in the people who flaunt the rules to limit its spread.
2020-10-06 09:40:52,"Odd that people cite mortality rate as reason not to worry.  210,000 is a lot of lives.  But even if that doesn’t move you then think of this.  We can now cure another viral infection called hepatitis C with a drug called sovaldi.  It costs $84,000 for a full course of therapy.  It’s priced that high because that is how much it used to cost to treat acute hep C patients before we could cure them with sovaldi.

We have a virus here with unknown long term health effects.  Unknown because this virus didn’t exist in humans a year ago.  When the long term effects become a problem as they are already proving to be the case in many patients, who will pay for that care?  The answer is you and your employer.  Maybe they hire one or two fewer employees because health insurance premiums increase.  Maybe copays go up.  Regardless Trump will be out of the scene by then and won’t care.  He will have left town and stuck us all with the bill.

Nothing to worry about my foot."
2020-10-06 05:32:49,"Trump was gasping for air. That did not look strong. It explains why he took the mask off.

His posing no longer deceives anyone with eyes to see or ears to hear.

His actions - this week alone, throwing shade at voters/voting, emerging as a failed businessman who skirts the law to avoid taxes, bullying and posturing at the debate while answering no questions, and being dishonest about when he became a superspreader - show him as weak and stupid. His choice of leaders to admire show that he would be happy to jail, torture, or kill all his opponents to stay in power. Quite Biblical, and not in a good sense."
2020-10-06 06:27:12,"Why is anyone even slightly surprised? What, specifically, was it about his decades of previous narcissistic and sociopathic behaviors that led you to expect anything else from Trump? It's the scorpion and the frog played out on a national level. 
""A scorpion asks a frog to carry him over a river. The frog is afraid of being stung, but the scorpion argues that if it did so, both would sink and the scorpion would drown. The frog then agrees, but midway across the river the scorpion does indeed sting the frog, dooming them both. When asked why, the scorpion points out that this is its nature."""

2020-10-06 08:45:41,"Trump, like the Kardashians before him, and many others cast in reality shows, participated in a reshoot.....demanding that the photographer recapture his entrance into the White House. He strode up to the entrance, tore off his mask and strode in. Only to demand a redo of the event, his entrance.  No care, whatsoever, as to who he infects with the C-virus. Many offices in the West Wing sit vacant, because the Spreader-in-Chief, the biggest agent of harm and damage in modern history, masquerading as President, has disregarded any safety concerns regarding any other human on the planet. He was the man who helped infect his staff, security detail, and those attending his rallies, a place where Trump was center-stage - whether in a Church basement or a 1/3 filled stadium. We know that he has acted in his own best interests, not ours, and that he believes we are disposable. His base will support him, despite his sleaze, long-term support for white supremacy, stealing, scamming, gutting the government, firing oversight, asking a foreign government for help to remain in power. Any person would never have been allowed to do such harm. Could Trump now be compared to Typhoid Mary? Let's hope there are some in the WH who are brave enough to stop him from harming more people - or that he won't be allowed to hold rallies and infect more of the country."
2020-10-06 07:00:29,Donald..Thank you for continuing to dismiss the effects of the virus. This will assure your removal on 11/3.

2020-10-06 06:41:56,"We should be afraid of Trump. He is committed to a dark nihilistic path, trading lives for power, even those of his own staff. His willingness to exploit disease, even his own, to expose his donors and supporters to his infection, and to deny the pain and losses suffered by hundreds of thousands of Americans, shines a bright light on his true illness:  his lack of any humanity, any morals. His behavior is becoming more irrational and deviant every day at this point, and one wants to turn away as if from something shameful and obscene. Vote as if your life depends on it!"

2020-10-06 06:45:17,"It feels like we’re watching a surreal Stephen King movie of the novel:
With a renewed sense of personal power, pumped up by drugs and world attention after classified treatment in a military clinic, the world’s most powerful leader, a white supremacist, begins to implement his plan for the “perfect solution”. Face like stone, body rigid as steel, he presents himself born anew on the steps of his mansion, as Invincible. The Message, honed and mounded, will lead to more transmissions, more illness, more deaths. The 
world is watching. Millions of people are speechless, helpless, paralyzed, held prisoner by convention, core values and human behavior. No believes it can get worse. Only one person, the leader supreme, is in control and knows how it’s going to end."
2020-10-06 09:55:23,"His message was; we have progressed in medication and are on track to get vaccins, so dont be too alarmed in case you get infected, there is a very good chance you come better, like me. Go on with your life but stay safe. 
Only to report dont be afraid, is missing the whole message.
The emphasis on masks is a bit over the top, it helps somewhat if used properly, it helps a bit when using the right kind of masks but avoiding close conact especially inside etc is a better precaution. When a patient is infected it is normal practice that medical personal have the best medical masks and are in contact with the patient for a limited time. It seems these actions were taken care off while Trump was itransported."

2020-10-06 08:49:18,"Trump said that he had learned a lot about the virus from his sudden hospitalisation. If he learned it from his doctors then they should be fired. Actually we know that it is impossible for Trump to alter his position because that would, in his warped mind, show weakness. The best thing he could do now for the American people is make those ""great drugs"" available to all free of charge. Maybe they could even get to hospital by helicopter."

2020-10-06 10:11:42,"There is another potential medical problem related to his recent behaviors as he leaves the hospital.

Trump is on relatively high doses of glucocorticoids (the steroid dexamethasone). These drugs, not infrequently at these doses, induce a false sense of well-being (euphoria) and occasionally outright mania. We may be seeing some of this play out in his circumstances. Let's see where he is in 7-10 days, as the medicine tapers off.

This is yet another medical reason he should not have left the hospital so early."
2020-10-06 10:08:30,"I'd say he should be in prison, but that would be unfair to everyone in prison. As he has well-known and longstanding love of litigation, I suggest that, as a nation, we honor that. Each and every individual or family member of every individual in the U.S. who has gotten ill or died from Covid-19 ought to accuse him of murder or the intent to commit murder."

2020-10-06 10:01:09,"Unfortunately Trump is a being as mendacious as ever with the seriousness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 Pandemic and utterly reckless with both the public health of the nation and his own personal health.

Trump recognizes that he faces personal and corporate fiscal ruin if he fails to be re-elected.  He has had medical attention that would be fiscally ruinous and logically unattainable to the average citizen or even the well to do.

Trump is utterly contentious of the 210000 American Citizens who have died as a result of the pandemic.  “It is what it is” he says.  More dead Americans than died in WWI! 

Trump is not out of the woods yet medically and politically.  If he looses his morally destitute and desperate gamble to hang on to power, and his medical recovery both, as is likely he stands to loose both his Potemkin business empire and maybe his life.  

If the worst happens as is likely Trump’s epitaph will likely read “It is what it is.”"

2020-10-06 09:44:51,Trump is living in a world of his own making. We are not suppose to be afraid of something that has killed almost a million people worldwide? Trump lies so much that he actually believes his own lies. The president whose party is trying to take Healthcare just got the best Government Medical care in the world. I can no longer fault the Con Men on The Right who enable Trump I have to fault the people who voted for them. This last week is an example of what Government Healthcare can do. If the thousand people who died today had the level of care we saw Trump get would they have been lost? You would expect the leader of a country to have perks that the common man won't. Is the perk of office you can live while the people you serve die? This whole thing reeks of Class and Priveldge. People who hoped Trump would be humbled by his near death experience have seen he did not. The Kitchen Sink was thrown to save Trump folks will ask why wasn't it thrown at their loved ones. Ironically the Trump who mocked science may have been saved by science. Trump has shown No Lives Matter. The drive by he did with the agents in the car proves Blue Lives really don't  Matter either to Trump. Trump removing his mask before walking into the White House should prove to anyone watching whose life really matters to Donald.

Of all the things this man has said and done, this is one of the most revealing. Words alone cannot describe the way I feel about a man who has the BEST health care in the world saying to us and to those 209,000 families who lost a loved one to Covid “Don’t worry about it!” Please people if you have any decency, please vote this man out of our lives."

Most of the lost souls never had the type of testing, treatments and guidance the president had.  Many, if not most, were told to stay at home during the worst of the crises in the east, because hospitals were inundated, PPE scare and ICU beds at capacity.  The longer the virus is in the body, the worse the damage until it's too late

Donald Trump has taken on this virus with his usual mix of lies, bravado, and illusion.  Trying to appear the superman, he climbs the stairs and rips off his mask--but did anyone note the gasping for breath and the wince of pain on his face has he stuffed his only protection for those who cross his path in his pocket?

We've all had covid now, including me (almost 70).  The scariest thing at first is that we couldn't get any good information since the virus was so politicized.  The President is absolutely right.  If you take care of your health you have nothing to worry about.  I was very tired for two days as my body fought the virus but beyond that my only concern was making sure I didn't needlessly spread the virus.  

You'll know you're sick.  If you're scared, get to a hospital as there are many things doctors can do now after learning much more about the virus.

But as the President says, don't let this virus dominate your life.  Don't let the politicization of this virus poison your relationships.  I meet people who are still terrified of the virus.  Accept it and help them get beyond their fear. People are free to be afraid, but understanding diminishes fear.  This is a great country and we need to get back to doing all the great things that we had planned for 2020!"

He has no idea what it is like to face this getting this virus when it’s already taken your job and with it your health insurance.  He has no idea of the loss and deprivation hundreds of thousands of Americans have already suffered in the wake COVID-19.

He thinks he’s capturing hearts and minds and votes because he showed the world another episode of Trump the Invincible.  But what everybody saw was Clueless in the White House."

Another reason professors, teachers and others struggle in political, health and social policy discourse is that intellectualism, research and scientific findings have been equated with subversion. Almost every day men like DJT, Rush Limbaugh and other Tea Party and Freedom Caucus members rage against “liberal elites” that are destroying America by pitching political conflict as a battle between ordinary Americans and an over-educated liberal establishment.

Over at The Washington Post, a headline reads ""The president cares about his image. That's pretty much it."" It's true. All he seems to care about is how he looks, how he is seen. Other people aren't real for him. They're only props in a drama where everyone adores him, showers him with bottomless gratitude and adulation.

You've got to be mighty empty if your entire raison d'être is centered on looking in the mirror. 

He is the most dangerous man in the world because he cares nothing for the world, or anyone who inhabits it. It's all about him. He inhabits a hall of mirrors and if one mirror doesn't show his reflection, he goes into a rage.

But no more.  Last night, reading about his latest stunt, I made a conscious decision.  I am done.  The game is over.  I won’t ignore him until he is safely excised from our government, but I refuse to acknowledge him any longer.  I don’t have to acknowledge any adversary in order to work against him.  I don’t have to give any adversary the anger he so obviously thrives on in order to work against him.  And I certainly don’t have to put myself into an endless emotional loop where I repeatedly lose my temper over behavior I have come to expect.  For me to do that makes me as crazy as he is.

Tell that to those who don't know if they've been exposed because someone didn't wear their masks nor practiced social distancing.  So many reasons to hate and disrespect POTUS.  He is not for the people, of the people, and by the people.

Should I pity his ignorant followers?  Lets hope they come to their senses (but not before the election, I know).  We live in sad times.  I know what I'll be doing next week.  I'll be dropping off my ballot at the recorder's office and voting BLUE."

To my knowledge, we have only had oral representations from Trump's inner circle that he had the virus.  For all we know, he was really admitted for additional mini-strokes. 

Where were all his children when he allegedly was sick. He is the president and do not tell me that his ""loving"" children if they are even capable of love, did not go to Walter Reed to fawn over daddy. 

It would perfectly fit a Trump strategy.  Get some sympathy for the unsympathetic Trump. Trump magically recovers like a super human just so he can say I had it and it was no big deal. 
  
I smell a Trump rat. The whole thing is a Trump hoax and  he never had Covid.  Please Maggie Haberman get the records."
2020-10-06 23:52:38,"He’s not immune to the virus but it seems he is completely immune to any acquired wisdom. I still haven’t learned to set my expectations low enough because I honestly thought there was at least the possibility he would come through this crisis with a touch of feigned humility or compassion (if for no other reason than the political optics). Here was a chance to do a bit of good, by recommending to his followers to wear a mask and be cautious. Instead, he can’t resist swinging the wrecking ball of his ego once again."
2020-10-06 22:04:15,"The President should leave aside all decisions which can be delayed. Both the virus’ affects and the side effects of the medicines can alter a persons cognitive experience and thinking. Trump has been a wild man since the debates last week and he was likely infected at that time. The auto tour about the hospital was nuts. His comments since he was diagnosed has drifted into a feverish manner. His returning to the White House was silly. His advice is frankly, misguided, and is likely affected by his physical condition."
2020-10-07 01:47:30,"It time Liberal media stops being shocked at anything the Trump administration does.  Despite being infected, Trump is now saying not to be afraid, not to let COVID dominate your life.

I'm not sure where Trump has been the past 9 months, but 211,000 plus Americans have died, 7.52 million have been infected, so there's every reason to be afraid.  

Over 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment and other benefits, jobs have evaporated, schools open and close, it is impossible for COVID not to dominate everyone's life.

Trump can't even fake empathy, He received treatment not available to any other American, so he's feeling better, fine, but he leaves the hospital, and enters the WH ripping his face mask off while he's actively shedding virus putting his own staff at risk.  His Limo ride while at Walter Reed put his own Secret Service staff at risk.   At least 14 people in Trump's administration have test positive attending super spreader events, rallies, fund raisers, and with no tracing it's probably much more.

And to prove his tone deaf disconnect with America, Trump has killed any further stimulus relief until after the election.  How he feels that will serve his interests is a mystery.  

So Liberal media stop being incredulous.  And stop pointing out how Trump can turn things around.  He  won't even do what's in his own best interest.  Right now it appears he's got a political death wish, and I for one don't want to alter the path he's chosen."
2020-10-06 21:29:57,There is only one cure for megalomania and delusions of being the most powerful man in the world; vote him out of office.  The world is laughing at this imposter who is antithetical to democracy and decency.  Trump can only take credit for ruining everything he touches.  America is on the precipice of losing its international stature and democracy.  Vote in order to ameliorate the pathology created by a grifter who unfortunately was elected President of the United States of America.
2020-10-14 14:32:22,"“This is why clinical trials are essential,” said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington. “The safety of the product has to be empirically proven.”

And the only way this empirical data can be ascertained IS from many clinical trials over a period of time.

Rushing, fast tracking and conducting this testing process at ""warp speed"" only hurts the process rather than enhance it.

I truly understand and can appreciate the need, desire and necessity of manufacturing vaccines for this virus.  However, these vaccines MUST be safe and effective, regardless of what one may wish or want for a speedier result.

I applaud drugmaker Eli Lilly for ""pausing"" their clinical trials because of a ""potential safety concern.""

In the long run, their will be a better, truth worthy, credible and stronger company for making this decision."
2020-10-14 13:57:45,"A virus doesn’t care about the politics of nations or the egos of scientists, and in its unrelenting drive to endure, it cares not at all for the timetables of human beings.

Paraphrasing  — Muhammad H. Zaman PHD"
2020-10-14 16:40:33,"While it's certain that Eli Lilly is doing the right thing from a scientific perspective--stopping to check out possible problems, in our fully-polarized everythings-a-conspiracy climate this isn't going to play well.  Someone will surely send a message reporting that a truck load of body bags was seen being delivered to Lilly's back door, and away it'll go.

It's said that all tasks face the Big Three choices: Fast, Cheap, or Good.  You can have 2 but never 3.  We're doing Fast and we're not worried about cost, so that leaves Good.  Something's going to give.  I'd prefer it was Fast.  Slower is almost always better for vaccines."
2020-10-14 16:52:20,"""Fast-tracking"" is inherently very dangerous. Many, indeed most therapies, don't disclose their downsides until widely used, mostly because manufacturers have been given licenses before adequate testing has been done. The commercial pressures -- costs and potential profits -- are huge, and regulators are pretty much in the pocket of industry. In general, the clinical trial science isn't very good in application. Study end points are often poorly defined, data from patients who drop out of trials are often not incorporated properly, comparisons with placebos as opposed to recognized effective therapies exaggerate benefits, adverse effects are downplayed, and time frames are too short -- often adverse effects will take years to fully manifest and be recognized. Worse, studies are done on narrowly defined populations under well controlled conditions. Real patients are from a wide range of populations with a wide range of personal features, co-morbidities and receiving more than one treatment. Trial results simply don't apply to those heterogeneous people and circumstances. Worse still: once a drug is licensed, makers push to have their drug prescribed for conditions and people who have never been researched in the trials. It's a toss-up whether many drugs do more harm than good."
2020-10-14 18:55:53,"Bravo that a drug conglomerate is thinking about the sanctity of life versus the enormity of future profits if not shelved.  The rush to manufacture a vaccine puts additional pressure on the fast tracking of a vaccine to FDA approval and licensing rights for the company.   Once a vaccine is approved, even if proven to have  some benefits versus liabilities, once in the manufacturing pipeline, it is very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle.  As some have already remarked, a limited sampling of trial volunteers may doom it to gaps in treatment coverage.  Some people may not be helped by a viable vaccine due to age, ethnicity, co-morbidities, and the like.  Godspeed on further trials, and even if this trial doesn't work, my Nana used to say, ""nothing beats a failure, but a try."""
2020-10-14 21:01:20,"In principle, the stoppage of a trial for safety reviews should not be news. It is the norm and only in the interest of manufacturers and scientists. 
But a dark fog has descended on all treatments of COVID-19. Non-disclosure agreements signed by the vaccine trial management companies, unproven claims, exaggerated expectations all contribute to the problem. 
There is but one person to blame: Trump trying to hijack the medical science for gaining electoral advantage. The train wreck in my view is unstoppable."
2020-10-14 20:22:23,"I am surprised that this company would stop a trial. These money hungry companies, their CEOs, and stock holders only care for profits. Where was this being conducted? Here at home in the good old USA, perhaps Europe? I am sure there is no sanctity of life in the developing world. If these people were conducting this trial in India or Ethiopia this trial would go on, the dead would just be thrown away without anyone's knowledge. I hope the developing countries DO NOT allow these vultures to experiment on their people for there would be no repercussions if some people there ended up dead as long as these folks could tweak their formula."
2020-10-14 23:08:47,"As a senior leader in biotech drug development and manufacturing, I can say that this happens every week. Trials are paused, evaluated, redesigned and redeployed all the time. During a pandemic, I suppose these updates make juicy headlines. Nothing to see here other than good clinical practice as expected."
2020-10-15 01:11:20,"As the article mentions part of the process is these pauses, they happen with many studies and trials during normal times let alone during such challenging times.

Let’s be cautious, the rush alone doesn’t solve things, take HIV for example. Four decades in and many patients still are promised a functional cure ‘right around the corner’ but despite advancements and billion of dollars and 30  million lives lost, a cure remains allusive. 

Prevention is key, this virus can be controlled and unlike early years of HIV, we actually know how it transmits and what to do. We must learn to live with this thing before we can destroy it. The cure is already with us."

They were corralled like cattle and the pictures of desperate and hungry people walking miles are truly heartbreaking. It was clear that a massive outbreak is in waiting and here it is. The incompetence of the government is staggering. Anyone pointing to the government failure is declared a foreign agent or a communist by a very effective government propaganda machine. I have very little hope that India would come out of this anytime soon.

2020-10-08 16:03:12,"In a densely populated country like India, it is very difficult to control respiratory viruses like the corona. Even advanced countries are struggling to deal with this disease. This virus is mostly transmitted by community transmission. Social distancing is impossible in a densely populated country like India. Many people are illiterate, they are not going to wear masks. This is not the government's failure.
Hopefully, herd immunity will develop faster and with the arrival of vaccines, this disease will be controlled in India."
2020-10-08 16:12:54,"Its not any better in the cities. Practically no one follows the proper mask usage or the social distancing guidelines. People that put on masks use them as chin diapers. The death rate is so low because most go unreported. Families opt for quick cremations so as escape scrutiny, questions and eventual dishonour. Doctors purposely misdiagnose at the behest of patient's family or the government. There is a prevailing deep rooted culture of systemic corruption and the current pandemic and healthcare response has not escaped it. The Prime Ministers CARES fund designed for pandemic response has zero public accountability. The mainstream media chooses to turn a blind eye and instead diverts public attention to the frivolous culture war."
2020-10-08 16:55:04,"I have relatives in several small villages in the southern state of Telangana. The vector of transmission appears to be those who were in big cities recently. They use cash for travel without prior reservations. So it's impossible to contact trace.
Of around 120 or so infections they had, just 2 fatalities who had pre-existing conditions. Everyone else recovered without the need for supplemental oxygen. So they don't think it's as big a deal as we in the US think it is. But we have higher infection and fatality rates.
Someone needs to investigate if the strain of virus circulating there is same as the one here."

Thanks to the genius the late PM PV Narasimha Rao, and ex PM MM Singh, India got lifted out of poverty for nearly 3 decades and people were able to eat at least one square meal.

But what is surprising is US, with it's wealth, universities, is No 1,

And in future, hopefully there won't be any looting of other nations. Get rid of the stupid caste system. Not a tall order.

The novel Caronavirus taught us there is no God, and it just attacks anyone rich, poor, race, religion, caste ..., does not matter, everyone is equal to the virus, just an opportunity.
Except the most powerful guy has medicine and medical personnel at his door step. And what does he do it with it?

When we go out we are in masks, the senior citizens also wear face shields. We hired a part time house help (all middle class and up households have one) in August. The help lives in the village next door. She wears a mask inside our house at our insistence. She says Covid is a city issue and that in the villages there is no problem. When we go out no one is wearing mask; they wear it around their necks to pull it up in time if the police come around to check. The markets are crowded, people are out and about. We had a few cases nearby - none serious, thankfully. But, till when? My only goal is to ensure that none in my family have to go to the hospital. In normal times, a family member would be with a patient at all times and is the patient's medical advocate. In times of Covid, no one is allowed. Once the patient goes in they are on their own, information doesn't come out as the medical staff has too much to do. The care the patient gets depends on how tired the staff is that day and the number of patients they have to deal with that day. We are the fortunate ones, but how long can we all go on like this? We are all tired, tired of staying home, tired of not knowing till when this will last. And we are the fortunate ones."

It is horrible that in many parts of our country it has come to this.  VOTE now if you can and in any event by November 3 but only if you will vote a straight Democratic ticket.  That won't totally stop this madness, of course, but the course correction will be able to begin in January."

3)  Eject the fool from the store

People wearing masks in stores now vastly outnumber people who don't in much of the country, and it's time to make sure those who don't understand that on a fundamental level.  They're the ones putting our lives at risk, and we don't need to accept that with a smile."

The 52% of super spreaders are the cause of the shutdown, and the second wave.  Health experts agree we would have been through the worst of this months ago, but your selfish countrymen have prolonged and increased the deaths in this country.
Imagine if a foreign enemy attacked us and killed 210,000 Americans in a war?  The entire country banded together after 9/11, where only a small portion of Americans were killed.
Well, that's exactly what's happened now, a foreign enemy has attacked us, and 210,000+ Americans are now dead, more every day.

It is very stressful, particularly with those who work in the meat department and other areas where food is exposed. Complaints to headquarters and managers did not work."

No one did anything except for another customer who wouldn’t allow me to talk to the manager, claiming I would be responsible for the store losing customers and going out of business.   It wasn’t the stores fault he claimed. 

This happened because when waiting and paying for my bagel, the small area by the cash register became increasingly crowded.   Another customer stood too close by me waiting to pay and I made a comment about “let’s please socially distance” in vague terms. 

I’ve since spoken to the store owner who apologized. He’s normally there and perhaps this wouldn’t have gotten out of control if he was.

I won’t go back there because I’ve learned that signs about masks and social distancing stickers on the floor are meaningless when the setup allows for unlimited entry into the establishment and there’s no staff monitoring anything to ensure appropriate behaviors. 

I blame our president for creating this division of masks/no masks despite the governor’s rule to wear them. The example Trump sets by his refusal to wear masks and his circus performance of taking his mask off after returning from the hospital incites his followers to lash out at others and has made it unsafe for those who want to wear masks in public."

Average employees should not be expected to play cop and put themselves in potential danger.   As for the training it seems rather flimsy just window dressing really."

2020-10-16 16:25:51,"Keep in mind that there can be legal and legitimate exceptions to wearing masks such as the hearing impaired.   The very first reaction should be non-judgmental assuming there might be a valid reason for wearing a mask.  Keep in mind the need to remove your mask or wear a clear mask so you can be understood in case the person is hearing impaired.  They often have no idea you are even speaking to them in the first place and if they can tell you are speaking they often have no idea what you are saying. 

Your speaking behind a mask sounds like a bad drive thru speaker or awful cell reception—sounds are heard but meaning is not clear. 

So be considerate and know the accessibility laws in your location—hearing impaired often have to face constant and repeated scrutiny each time they go out in public and are on edge with tremendous anxiety because they have no idea what people are saying and are stressed at having to ask others to remove their masks 

Starting this off not only can quickly resolve the situation if there is a valid reason but it also conveys a tone of polite considering that can help get the confrontation resolved more politely."
2020-10-16 16:34:43,"Do you know what would be super swell?- if all of the anti-maskers could be relocated to a nice island somewhere, where they can live free and not pose a danger to others.

It was traumatizing to say the least. Her Manager eventually came and fought more with the crazy guy who needed his cigarettes but in the end we decided, her job was just not worth the risk and trauma. She quit.  Not every store has a large staff and mgmt and security on hand. Many are skeleton crews and just getting by."
2020-10-16 16:51:20,"No mask
No service
Zero tolerance

If we had all Masked up in March and our federal government engaged in producing PPE tens of thousands more would be alive.  

Why do republicans respect a persons autonomy choice on masking but not family planning?  There is nothing pro-life about anti maskers."
2020-10-16 16:54:27,"This same sort of training is needed in gyms and any other establishment where people congregate.

I routinely see people at my gym with their masks pulled down (though most are compliant). I’ve spoken to the manager and he agreed that this is wrong but explained some of the issues. Among these are concerns that confrontations with members could escalate to violence. Understandably, he does not want to put himself or his staff at risk of injury. He even told me that they have to be careful about what they say to members violating the mask rules because all of a sudden he’ll get hit with a lawsuit over emotional distress. Regardless, gyms must enforce the mask rules. Clearly, the type of training that some retail workers are getting should also be given to gym workers."
2020-10-16 17:00:38,"I’m a retail manager.  This is such a big issue that our company is having us log all “incidents” so they can track it. Stores in our center have reworked signage to demonstrate what proper mask usage looks like. Over the last two weeks, it has gotten much worse.  We have had returning snowbirds, tourists, “first time out since March” customers who we have to educate on our stores cloth mask policy. The majority wear the mask in but it is getting them to keep it on or wear it properly.  Last week, I had a customer who ever time I asked her a question, she pulled down the mask to answer me!  We have people telling us tall medical tales why they can’t wear them, we’ve heard it all.  But thankfully, our company’s policy allows to us politely steer them toward our website and the front door."
2020-10-16 17:01:24,"Thank you Mr. Trump, for singlehandedly creating this scenario. I hope you join thousands of other Americans who will lose their jobs and their homes in the coming weeks."
2020-10-16 16:13:57,"Dear people who think wearing a mask to protect others somehow infringes on your rights:

Stay home. Leave the mask off and breathe the air of freedom without endangering others in the public.

Drive around. Leave the mask off and breathe your own freedom gases in your car.

But don't imagine that your rights allow you to put others at risk in public indoor spaces.

This pandemic is caused by a virus that can infect someone and make them able to infect others, without showing symptoms, just by exhaling.  So you, or me, or anyone could be infecting others who might suffer death or grave complications and financial losses, and we wouldn't even know we'd done that.

Masks and social distancing when we are around others is how we prevent risking our actions causing injury to others. It's been proved over and over to work.

I don't pretend my imagined 'right' to show my bare face in a store is somehow sacred, when compared to other people's rights to not get ill because of my precious freedom to not protect others.

So when you're in a store, wear a mask. And don't be a jerk if a store employee reminds you that you can help keep others safe by wearing one.

Thank you.

And if that version was too long, what I'm asking you to do is to grow up and show some respect for other people."
2020-10-16 16:16:56,I witnessed three incidents in one day. Most unforgettable was a woman in a high end market who was approached politely by a manager. She quickly escalated to accusing him of assaulting her.
2020-10-16 16:20:13,"When the president is a big whiny dishonest bullying baby-child, his supporters feel similarly entitled. The tantrums they toss about wearing masks are among the most infantile things I've ever witnessed. They bleat and whinge about their ""rights"" and then enter private businesses and violate the rights of the people who own them and work in them. One cannot reason with people like this -- they are immature, petulant bullies, just like their president."
2020-10-16 16:40:07,Retail stores should hire 300 pound bouncers to enforce mask policy at the door and as needed inside when people take their masks off or wear them inappropriately.
2020-10-16 17:02:15,"I’m not shopping for fun anytime soon. Just food and cleaning supplies. I want to stay safe and keep others safe. I see people walking around with masks on their chins, sorry but people aren’t following rules or common sense plus why should retailers have to enforce behavior? We need a national strategy to fight this virus and everyone needs to do their part."

2020-10-16 17:52:45,"Every confrontation between an employee and a difficult customer should bring in another employee with a camera to record and pursue charges if necessary.  

My husband and I do not patronize any business that is not demanding and enforcing mask wearing and proper distancing.

2020-10-16 18:16:15,"These folks do not get paid enough to deal with Trumpers who could potentially get violent over having to wear a mask.  No mask, no admittance.

2020-10-16 18:41:51,"What a sad commentary about our current state of affairs.  We live in a society where some members feel entitled to be ""free"" at a cost of other's health and life.  Please remember to be nice to the retail clerk as now their health is at risk enforcing a simple public health measure ...wearing a mask. For those that don't want to wear a mask, please remember that in order to enter a store, one must extinguish and put away cigarettes, in some cases wear shirts and/or shoes (again, a public health measure). We do these things to protect ourselves and others."
2020-10-16 19:00:31,"My state has a mandate that masks be worn in public places (i.e., retail stores). However, you can go into virtually any grocery (e.g., King Soopers, Safeway)  or big box store  (e.g., Costco and Sams) and you will encounter individuals with no mask, mask on the chin/neck, or hanging right below the nose. The corporate retailers instruct their employees that they are not to confront or even suggest to non-mask wearing customers that they must wear a mask. This is disheartening to us older individuals who have a medical condition that along with age increase our risk of death from Covid-19. I have a stent from two years ago and my spouse has asthma. The county health department and police both refuse to do enforcement of the state mandate. It appears it is ok with these agencies if a corporation by instructing managers to not require a mask or even suggest the wearing of a mask.  It is not clear to me how we expect to get this pandemic under control. The majority of us do not wish to get Covid-19 but the minority of non-mask wearing individuals get to put the rest of us at risk. The police and health agencies enforce cleanliness in food stores and the police enforce traffic laws. However, mask wearing which is now a political issue and not even a real public health issue gets no enforcement. Perhaps when Covid kills enough people we can get a boycott of these retailers."
2020-10-16 19:08:56,"Our county libraries have remained closed to the public because staff do not want to deal with people who refuse to wear masks or abide by building capacity limits. The library system has offered curbside pickup for items requested online or by phone since May, and recently they began to offer a way to print documents from home computers for a small fee, with curbside pickup of the documents. For those who miss browsing the shelves, they offer book bundles selected by librarians based on the customer’s interests or favorite authors."
2020-10-16 19:10:24,"Many retailers are struggling to keep their doors open. Suggestions that they hire bouncers and door security to enforce mask wearing are ludicrous. Due to law suits and employee safety concerns many stores do not even attempt to stop shoplifters ( managed a small outlet center for six years). And if a security guard did get in a tangle with a non-mask wearer and picked up Covid in the process?

No, we need a national plan and a widespread education campaign. If you grew up in America in the 60's you will remember the problem with Body Odor and the Dial campaign; I use Dial deodorant soap, don't you wish everyone did?  It was very effective (thank God). 

We need leadership at the top. Unfortunately January is far away and I expect new records to be set. Make sure that you are not one of the statistics!  The Trump flu is here and growing!"
2020-10-16 19:36:24,"A cannabis store in my neighborhood has a big sign on the front door.  It reads, ""No mask, no service, NO WEED!""

No matter when you walk past the store, looking inside is like peering at grandma's dinner table when her pastor has been invited.  EVERYONE is wearing a mask, standing 6' apart from each other, and no one touches the counter.  I remembered my mask yesterday but forgot my license and medical card.  No sale!  I was so close.  I wore the mask, I kept my distance, I didn't touch the counter, I pre-ordered online reducing my time in the store, but I forgot the piece of plastic giving me the medical discount.  So, I left the store, ran home, got it, and returned.  I then presented three medical cards from the store taken over the years and said, ""I forgot my glasses but one of these is the current one.  A worker laughed and said, ""We should make you run home and get those, too.  NO Sale!  The old man forgot his glasses!!  Next!!"":))  We can still laugh.  

For the longest time, the Home Depot in my area had all the doors closed except one entrance.  And at the entrance was an employee enforcing masks before you could even enter the store.  Again, do you want the products or walk up to the register and suddenly have the asst. manager tell your clerk they are now on break?

This works here in Seattle because by and large, folks are following the rules.  Sure, I can find you lots of examples where people are ignoring the CDC protocols but most got on board long ago."
2020-10-16 19:37:39,"Here in my rural area, there are many pre-Covid situations where retailers have to deal with belligerent customers whom Momma never taught any manners. The usual solution? They write out an ""86"" which is a criminal no-trespass notice. Then, the next time the former customer shows up, the police are called and they are cited or, if they argue, arrested. This, in a rural area where my neighbors are quick to remind me that Covid is a hoax that was cooked up by Fauci and Bill Gates to make a lot of money. Law enforcement has no problem cuffing the right wing scofflaws who escalate a mask dispute into a ""drunk and disorderly"" exhibition. 

Of course, over in Washington (the scofflaws think), Trump has guaranteed to cover their lawyers, their bail, and to vitiate the Liberals who are bringing this scourge. Even as the rural areas are overrun with infections. Reality these days, is elusive."
2020-10-16 19:37:40,"I believe this is a societal crisis and that we all have to step up to support new behavioral norms.  Let's not place the entire burden on essential workers who are likely to be younger and earning minimum wage.  In other words, don't expect anyone to do what you wouldn't or refuse to do.   

When I see someone in a store without a mask or with a mask that does not also cover their nose, I very politely suggest that the person wear one or adjust it to cover their nose as well.  Some people simply forget that they have not donned a mask.  We are, after all, creatures of habit and a lifetime of habit is hard to break.  Or perhaps they were in a hurry or thinking about something else and simply forgot.  It happens to me, too.  We're human.  The point is: don't get upset or angry.

Of course, some people brush me off if they don't ignore me altogether.  Unfortunately, there are many who have no social skills and believe that any request coming from a stranger is inappropriate.  They wouldn't know a polite approach ""if it hit them upside the haid with a two-by-four"".

If I encounter any refusal or aggression, I go right to the store staff or management to report the transgressor, then go about my business.  If there is any resistance from store personnel or I notice a reluctance to act or a pattern of not enforcing what often is locally or state mandated, I am free not to shop there anymore.

So are you."
2020-10-16 19:39:17,"Really stunning that we don't have a national mandate and leadership and policy and campaigns behind it to encourage and enforce that we wear masks in public. And so here are described  some of the peculiarities and weird fallout of states and individuals deciding things, deciding for themselves how to tackle the pandemic, disputing the practice of wearing masks  for God knows what reasons.  What a paradox.  Masks have turned out to be incredibly effective against getting and spreading Covid19. It's almost as if we could be so lucky that this deadly, atrociously-communicable virus is handicapping itself and handing us an easy interim panacea. Yet, there are huge tranches of population that combat the mask wearing?! So what do they have that works instead?
One of the more fascinating things I read is the science of variolation. That each mask wearer gets a small inoculation of virus embedded in their mask, and they build up some immune resistance to becoming infected."

2020-10-16 18:55:59,"Sadly, people tend to do what they can get away with if they feel it's more convenient for them.  Before COVID I would routinely see people in grocery stores and Target (the worst by far) with their pets sitting in their grocery cart or on leashes (not service animals, just pets).  I finally gave up on shopping at Target because I would encounter dog poop in the aisles and the managers didn't seem to care."

Because the amount of people being let in is restricted what they need is a lock on that door that they can remotely unlock and lock as customers walk up. Simply don't allow anybody in the door that does not wear a mask. I don't care if people want to be idiots they can go outside their homes without a mask all they want but they can't go shopping where I'm stopping

2020-10-16 20:02:46,"I've worked in involuntary psychiatric units where CPI training was used to physically restrain patients and give them injections (court-ordered). It is abysmal; it will fail miserably. Asking recalcitrant customers if they want to get out of line, or speak to the manager is the equivalent of asking them if they want to ""take it outside."" In this context, a better response would be to refuse to check them out at the register. Make them waste time gathering their items, and feel the real cost of their insouciance. If they continue escalate, have multiple staff approach them at the same time. It is not worth jeopardizing your own safety for a company that couldn't care less for yours."
2020-10-16 18:34:54,"Asking and expecting overworked and underpaid retail workers to act as the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing police is a pretty pathetic portrayal of the current Black Hole Age.

Calling the real cops seems equally stupid.

During the Dark Ages pandemics they wore masks and social distanced before the Age of Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution and Germ theory.

2020-10-16 18:27:00,"This is NOT the responsibility of store clerks, cashiers, and the guy in the yellow safety vest collecting the carts in the parking lot.  It is the manager's responsibility to handle these ""uncomfortable and sometimes frightening positions.""  Manager is a title; manage is a verb.  Managers need to do their jobs and manage every situation that occurs because of non-compliant COVID-deniers.  If they won't, then they should hire security officers to handle these people.  Don't expect your staff to become social workers and anger management professionals.  You are the manager - YOU manage the problems."

2020-10-16 18:33:03,"Why do we have this problem? Narcissism! Donald J. Trump felt that the appearance of a problem on his watch would damage his re-election prospects. His solution? Hey, that's simple - deny the problem! The consequence? Unending misery and lives lost.

This is a man who believes in the pseudo-power of positive thinking. This first manifested itself when he did not want a cruise ship to dock in Oakland because it would increase the infection count by what? 15? Seven million plus later and 215,000 deaths - he's still ""predicting miracles"", telling people what a great job he's done, and discounting the role of disciplined and science-based behavior such as mask-wearing.

The problem with narcissists is that when confronted with the intelligent, reasonable alternative - they are rarely persuaded. Unless threatened and compelled to back down with overwhelming force they consider themselves provoked and become belligerent. Trump is 1,000 times worse than a handful of people running around in black tee-shirts called Antifa. At least they've got the sense to wear masks.

Hopefully we can solve the short term problem on November 3 by removing the hammer from the hands of babies through the democratic process.

The more expansive problem (sustained anti-social behavior fueled by narcissism and a sense of entitlement)? That's a longer term project."

Store staff said the woman is in all time and they have to serve her.  National management was condescending and unhhelpful when i inquired about their mask policies.

The checker whose line I got in first with my box of fried chicken wasn’t wearing one but was going to be handling my food so I moved to another one.

2020-10-16 21:57:08,"The retailers need to consider that those of us who understand the importance of masks will be driven away by the anti-maskers.  We'll go maybe once... see the lack of mask enforcement, then find somewhere else to shop or figure out online options.

The other day I stepped into a gas station convenience store. There were signs about mandatory mask-wearing posted everywhere. But the cashier was not wearing a mask!  And not only that, but she coughed and coughed.  Her eyes were red and she sounded really sick.  She gave me a look, like she knew this was freaky but she didn't care.

His anti-mask and anti-science views has directly put the safety and lives of retail works in jeopardy. No other developed country on this planet has to deal with the ridiculousness this article describes. How sad Trump has made it all!
2020-10-16 21:46:59,"A big part of the reason that the job of enforcement is so stressful and difficult for retail workers is lack of support from namby-pamby managers who don't want to upset a customer who is likely to be belligerent.  Much easier to just shrug shoulders at the customers who ask why nothing can be done.  I believe the best strategy for customers is to just boycott stores with poor enforcement, but to let management know why you will not be shopping there.  If most establishment simply enforced the requirements without exception, violations would quickly diminish.  Americans are getting entirely too comfortable with caving to bully tactics, which makes those who obey the rules look and feel like suckers and emboldens more people to act like bullies themselves."

Even now, more and more people are walking in and out of stores without masks on in my state (Maryland), including mine.  Some apologize saying they forgot but I always tell them, ""If you don't care, I don't care.""  The truth is, while mask may work, it's not full proof and they shouldn't be mandatory.  If someone wants to wear a mask, that's fine.  I have no issue with that.  But it shouldn't be forced upon us.

First he asked the passenger to wear the mask that was around her neck, when she refused, he asked her to get off the bus, when she refused, he got off the bus and stood on the sidewalk announcing to the passengers that the bus was not going anywhere until the maskless passenger got off the bus.  She left the bus, those wearing masks got back on, and the bus resumed its route."
2020-10-17 15:54:21,"One of our most popular retailers on our tiny island in Maine is a women-owned business selling their island roasted coffee and offers artisanal baked goods from local sellers at their 2 cafes. One particular artisanal bread loaf which is baked in limited number at a farm has become a coveted item and hard-to-get in summer when PFAs (People From Away) are here. With COVID19, many more PFAs arrived to our ""safe haven"" and are staying much longer (big real estate boom here, too). One result was that the small cafe owners had to put a limit to how many loaves a bread a person could purchase in order to be equitable to their regular year round island customers. Some of the newbie PFAs became quite agitated, rude, and so obnoxious to the retailers and their hired help that the cafe owners decided to pull the bread from their shelves entirely (making it necessary for someone like me to place my bread order with the original farm and make a 50 mile RT drive every Saturday off the island to pick it up (yes, the bread is THAT good!) which is of course inconvenient, costly in fuel, and adds to my carbon footprint. All because some customers couldn't handle wearing their masks (""It's in my car"" or ""I'll only be here a minute to buy some bread!"") or being limited to a purchase of 2 loaves per person at a time. Their sense of entitlement has always been a summer joke here .Much of it is Fear based on a loss of being in control (which was always an illusion anyway). POTUS45 doesn't help."
2020-10-17 18:07:31,"I see so many school-age children without masks accompanied by their parents in retail stores in Manhattan where I live (as well as other public space).  Children may not become sick when infected with COVID-19, but they can still be spreaders as they can carry as much virus as an adult.  Especially when screaming and running around everywhere indoors.  Just as children are taught and required to wear a mask in school, there is no reason for them to be exempt from wearing one in public.

When I asked an employee at a national chain pharmacy to speak to a parent of two children without a mask, she argued that she was not going to tell a parent what to do with her own children.  I reminded her that mask wearing and social distancing are her store’s policy as well as a New York State mandate, but she flatly and rudely refused.  

Ironically, just a few feet away from where this employee was standing guard was a display of colorful masks for children of all ages.  (She lost a perfect opportunity to unload more of those over-priced masks sold at that store!)

I hope the much needed training includes dealing with customers who themselves may be wearing a mask but falsely think that their children are exempt."

His doctors signed NDA, no chest images were released, and he time in the hospital was way to short for treatment. Could he have faked this? The sparse details released to not contradict this possibility. Not releasing when he was tested negative or positive does not argue against this hypothesis. Just imagine the idea that one of his advisors cooked-up this idea, that if he claimed he was positive, and was quickly back on the job, it would substantiate his claim that the virus is no big deal. Yes, it is crazy, but how does that invalidate the possibility?"

Why else would he demand MD""s at Walter Reed hospital sign NDA's? He ordered doctors not to reveal the true nature of his visit to the hospital..He simply wasn't sick from it."
2020-10-16 17:04:14,"I believe that Donald Trump had COVID-19 and a more than mild symptom case as no big macho man goes to the hospital about anything unless he absolutely needs to.  In San Diego, only 7% of cases are hospitalized. 

I believe the cortisone steroids he was given reduced the inflammation of the lung infection as they do lung inflammations in asthmatics like me. In that regard they are truly miracle drugs. 

I  do not believe anything else as I  have seen months and years of alternate facts and truthiness  from this White House.

Here we are 9 or 10 months (depends how you count...) into the pandemic and we are arguing instead about 'rights' to subvert the judgements of our highest appointed officials. I couldn't help but notice that in a link, the  FDA attempted to rate the various tests and ~1/3 of the vendors didn't reply, isn't this the same as a rating of zero? Are the results of such tests meaningless? or is it better to have the illusion that you were tested? and the bad tests sill make a profit for someone...who has the responsibility to judge? or is a right to laissez-faire operation more important? Who cares for the American people?"
2020-10-19 16:49:04,"Ms. Mandavilli is extremely competent. Her article expresses a broad array of views. Nevertheless, people can read this article and come away befuddled.

The befuddlement: ""But when they only considered P.C.R. results that corresponded to high viral loads, the researchers found that the BinaxNOW test detected 15 of the 16 people who were most likely to transmit the virus."" Are we comparing apples to apples or apples to oranges? 

It should be: ""16 P.C.R. results and 15 BinaxNOW results detected viral loads high enough for a person to transmit the virus to others."" It's apples to apples. The results are statistically equivalent.

I'm a school board President with a microbiological background. The logic of rapid, cheap tests for a school or most business is impeccable. Here, compliance can be mandated. With pooled testing, we could do 100 students for $350/month. About 8 false positives a month, which mean someone has to stay home, wait, and take another test. That prevents over 95% of the 20 or 30 infections that will otherwise occur every 100 days, if there's community spread.

2020-10-19 21:43:12,"This article seems to be a case of the reporter wanting to write a breakthrough story, even though the data are quite disappointing.

Only 15 of the 26 patients who were positive by PCR were positive by the rapid test - that means that 42% of covid-positive patients were negative on the rapid test. That's interesting for all the opposite reasons - a real-world test that suggests that the test is less accurate than previously reported (though the numbers are woefully small, so it's not at all conclusive).

The statement that the rapid test was more likely to catch those with very high viral load (by PCR) is pretty obvious, but nowhere does the reporter demonstrate that those are the most contagious - I think there's really no clear evidence out there yet.

I'm a big fan of the rapid test, to be used regularly, in cases where people wouldn't use the PCR test - after all, better to catch those 15 positives than none at all - but, as we've seen with the White House, it's critical that those taking this test do not treat a negative result as proof that they are negative."

It's simply the expression  of a general mindset that 
one chooses government service to profit from inside
knowledge and make connections useful for after one
leaves the public sector. In other words, it's all just another
rung on the personal enrichment ladder that can stay below

There was still something a little human and understandable about it - you could see where the people in each tier of the system just put their heads down and did their ""jobs"", ignoring the signs and hoping someone else would step in.

That these views were hardly as optimistic as what Trump, Kudlow and others were pumping out to the public is shameful.

Yes, this is normal - even expected - for ""economic"" advisors to scrunch their noses with thought-leaders, while the ""political"" story for the public is all roses.

And it is also normal for these though-leaders to be the connectors in a nexus of investors.  People bring them hints so they can offer hints to others, and eventually you'll be repaid in kind.  

The central players get carefully queued-up, clean, long-term investments, and the peripheral players get the later-stage, more-risky, supportive investments that pay the early-stage investors.  You'll never find a direct link between the disclosure of inside information and a beneficial trade unless you're dealing with amateur opportunists.  These are pro's.

A small percentage of these deals involve public-policy facts, but the vast majority of this information trafficking is confidential information about companies obtained from consultants or partners.  The pro's are almost annoyed by the added risk of public information, but they tolerate it to keep their networks. (Trafficking in private information has its own disciplinary system.)

From the very start of trump's campaign, it was perfectly clear to a lot of people that any claims and accusations that Trump flung at anyone or about anything else were merely projections of crimes and slimy tactics that he himself was guilty of.

It's never been all that hard to decipher Trumpspeak; just read the opposite of what he says (and then just wait for him to walk it back by claiming that he was ""joking"").  All that ever changes is the scope and/or brazenness of his self-referential projections.

All those small business owners who are being forced to give up because of Trump's lying and venal, incompetent response to the covid pandemic, many of them were in Trump's base because they got a few hundred bucks off their taxes, fools.  Character counts, choosing to support a lying immoral self centered leader has terrible consequences.  Ask the Germans and the Italians in 1946, ask the Venezuelans, the Brazilians, and the Americans today."

The big surprise and disappointment is that our federal government, the normal bulwark and defender against nationwide calamity TOOK THE EXACT SAME TACK! Despite being briefed as early as late fall 2019, Trump unwisely took it on himself to conceal the entire situation, on same concern that bad news equals a bad economy. Trouble is when you are president you cannot choose to ignore something as dangerous as a pandemic, you need to act. He then doubled down by trying to hang COVID anchor-like on the opposing party.

Why do investors at the Hoover Institute get the benefit of personal meetings with government employees where important information is being disclosed? The answer is simple: Because political appointees no longer see themselves as answerable to the public. Nor are they interested in the ""greatest good for the greatest number"".

Most recently, he joined up with former ( and since fired) Kansas governor Brownback on a radical tax cut plan that decimated our state's education system.   Naturally, the dreaded Arthur Laffer was involved in the fiscal carnage that had to be dug out.

2. On 2/12/2020 BKNG opened at 1923.95 and went up to 1967. For those of you that don't know it is a travel stock.  On that date someone purchase 525 put contracts for $30 per contract with a strike price of 1300 expiring in Jan 2021.  To translate the bet was BKNG would fall to $1300 by Jan 2021.

""I had a long talk with President Xi — for the people in this room — two nights ago, and he feels very confident.  He feels very confident. And he feels that, again, as I mentioned, by April or during the month of April, the heat, generally speaking, kills this kind of virus,"" the president said during a White House meeting with governors.

Does anyone think he will concede if he loses the election?  Of course he won’t, he NEVER accepts reality; it’s just fake news.  Remember the photos of the inauguration?  Something can be totally obvious but if it is against what he wants it to be, he will just say it is the opposite, and he will NEVER back down.  He will fight the results of the election tooth and nail, and all the better if it goes to the Supreme Court where he has put two going on three sycophants.  And even if he somehow gets swatted aside as to re-election, he’ll pardon himself, which the current Supreme Court nominee seems to think is just fine, there is nothing wrong with that interpretation at all."

Rather than stopping insider trading, our government promoted it.

Earlier, I was wondering why the Republicans get away with murder. It is becoming more clear to me. Ultimately, it is about race. The criminal republicans are overwhelmingly white. The opposing democrats are mixed, but still with significant percentage of white people in them. The democratic resistance from the white sector is in some way token as they still continue to benefit from those policies although the little voice of moral compass in them says it is wrong. They are mostly observers in this social struggle where ultimately they are not affected as much as their non white policy shareholders and so their resistance is not vigorous.

By August, it rose to 32.00. This was caused by Trump's announcement of a huge 750 million dollar government loan.  Before that information was released, Kodak company insiders gave themselves millions of shares in stock options. This multi-million dollar scheme has led to allegations of insider trading, but no action taken.  Trump's administration is replete with this behavior. This article indicates that Trump's well-healed donors at the hedge funds were likely 'informed'. His cessation of covid stimulus negotiations, then his whiplash announcement for even greater stimulus served to swing the market violently and for corrupt purposes. The public are apathetic to this, preferring to believe instead that he's a man-of-the-people.  That's even more nauseating than the corruption."

If you’re Donald Trump, you’re going to make sure your political donors are protected. After all, when you’re on the hook for billions in personal loans and have sold off large amounts of your stock portfolio, you need these people to help you stay in office and out of jail. When has a little thing like the law ever stopped Trump? 

And since no buck ever stopped with him, he’s not complicit. His bad, bad economic and health advisors provided inside information — he barely knows them, he’s only spoken to them once or twice.

But I’m really curious — the various hedge fund and financial employees who started purchasing toilet paper and household disinfectants in late February, did they corner the “personal commodities” market? And was their return greater than that of their peers who only made money off of shorting the stocks?"
2020-10-15 02:49:54,"Those of us who have watched the wildly swinging stock prices have long suspected market manipulation by insider trading. What a way to recruit donors and supporters by Trump and his GOP gang. In normal times, we mostly remember daily swings of maybe 10 points in the averages.

That evening of February 26th, Trump returned from overseas, and gave a presentation on Covid-19 where he lied about the impact of the virus.  Before this presentation by Trump admin officials, they knew about the first community spread case.

My family listened to Trump that night, and realized Trump was lying, and after only ten minutes discussion, we decided to liquidate our portfolio.  Within 30 minutes of the market open on Thursday, February 27th, we sold securities worth $8 million the night before, and managed to get $6 million. The previous Friday, the portfolio was worth $11 million.

I am furious that Trump insiders got the truth, and hit the ground selling and shorting Monday morning, on essentially inside information. But at least my family realized Trump was lying, after listening to his barrage of nonsense Wednesday night. Our financial investments have done very well this year, up over 1000%, after we learned not to trust Trump. Other non-sophisticated investors did not fare as well.

We have seen white collar crime and corruption before, but the Trumps have taken the corruption to a level we haven't seen since the era of Kenneth Lay and Bernie Ebbers, the guys who funded GW Bush's inauguration, and who later went to prison.

This is outrageously corrupt.  His administration's actions and inactions got many thousands killed, while at the same time getting a very few Trump insiders enriched.

For one thing, by February 24, everyone who was paying attention already knew or strongly suspected that this Covid thing was a big fat problem.  How do we know that?  By February 24, the US stock market had cratered over a two week period, losing about fifteen percent or trillions upon trillions of dollars in value.

The Hoover Institution issued a contemporaneous newsletter describing the three day meeting and disclosing that they had been briefed on COVID by government officials, including Larry Kudlow. So the fact of the meeting and the agenda were both disclosed. The newsletter was not long and detailed, however, and there was no mention of government pessimism over the virus. Still, because of the newsletter disclosure, the media was on notice that the meeting had occurred and COVID had been discussed and was free to interview Kudlow or the Board about what had been said. 

Second, the February 24 disclosures did not move the market on February 25. The S&P 500 dropped 1% that day, which happens quite often and is not eventful. It was the next day, February 26, when a serious decline first occurred.

As exposed in this article, the national press should be doing in general a much better job covering the economic news for the ordinary investor rather than quoting so often their misleading amicus, Mr. Kudlow.  He has too many traits in common with his boss, Donald Trump."
2020-10-15 05:35:07,"Ultimately, the investors seem to gave liked what they heard because the downturn was momentary and markets are at all-time highs now. Why? What do I know?

Are they being investigated ? 
Also have the Sackler family been forced to pay Billions of dollars for killing 400,000 Americans by getting them addicted to their opioid product that they wanted to make more profits on by pushing its user base far beyond its authorised market . 

Did they end up making an agreement with State Attorneys giving back that 20% of what they made on their drugs and those victims who paid with their lives  (with no requirement to  admit or accept liability , of course)?

2020-10-15 08:04:02,"All my life, I will never forget that the Republican Party lied and did nothing while hundreds of thousands of Americans died. All the while their donors profited. A generation of us will never forgive them. God willing they will be completely shut out of power for the rest of time. 
I don’t forget that the last administration also mostly stood by and shored up the banks while millions of Americans lost their jobs, savings, and homes. I know that for many of us their complacency, too, feels unforgivable. 
I feel broken and hopeless. The system does not represent us anymore, if it ever did. We are pawns in the games of rich men who measure our lives in dollar amounts. 
I can only hope that my generation does not forget this awful time. Only then can we hope to build something better."

I’d like to know how much was money was made because of the early warning, and then divide that by the 200,000-plus deaths thus far.  Is that the dollar value of a life?  Would each death be “worth it?”  The parents, the grandparents, the nurses, the athletes, the artists, the blue-collar workers, many dying alone in cold hospital rooms, the last words from loved ones coming through computers?  No punishment seems adequate to begin to compensate for such sadness and suffering.  Perhaps the punishment is being able to function and benefit without the conscience to care, an arid land of grasping and empty souls.  Perhaps the punishment is to be recorded in history as a timeless example of fundamental human failure, seeing only self and blinded to cruelty.  I write this at night mostly in sorrow, and wonder, how did we get here?  And is there a way back?"
2020-10-15 08:57:47,"The reason the markets are trading near historic highs right now is because they are anticipating a blue wave in a few weeks.  If Trump were to eek out a win, the markets would crater because people who trade stocks would realize that four more years of erratic leadership and poor pandemic response would sink the economy further than ever.  Trump loves to take responsibility for inheriting Obama’s economy, but not the current economic state that is of his own administration’s doing."
2020-10-15 10:09:13,"This is government of the 1%, by the 1%, for the 1%, a direct result of the campaign finance and lobbying laws and practices we have now.

Strict alignment of campaign funding to those, only those, registered to vote in the particular election to be funded, would bring government of the people, by the people, for the people.   A limit on individual donations and sunlight on the whole process is necessary too.

Corporations, think tanks, foreigners, might be 'people' according to some misguided legal thinkers, but voting is not free speech.  Voting is confined to those persons, of age and residence, who meet registration standards."
2020-10-15 11:10:11,Let’s not be surprised that the robber barons calculated a cost/benefit analysis and decided that the death count was an acceptable offset to financial gain. Any effort that reflects a greater focus on meeting Maslow’s hierarchy of basic needs for every human is branded socialism by the robber barons and promptly discarded. If only there were examples in history where such egregious abuse of the system effected radical change...
2020-10-15 11:08:54,"When I first heard Trump's comment to Bob Woodward that he played down the virus because he didn't want to cause a ""panic"", I immediately thought he was referring to the stock market, not the American people.  To him, the stock market is the ""economy"".  He doesn't care about the American people, just doing everything he can to prop up the market for his mega-maga donors."
2020-10-15 09:31:43,"The key takeaway from this investigative reporting is that Donald Trump and members of the Trump administration were giving the public, including viewers of the most popular financial news channels like CNBC, a rosy picture of Covid in February.

At the very same time, Trump officials were giving very dire private information to conservative groups like the Hoover Institution and favored conservative hedge funds, which caused the insiders to avoid financial losses in the stock market and even make tidy profits by shorts and puts.

In a normal world, the Republican con artists would be going to jail, regardless of the fancy connected lawyers they hired.

Good reporting, Kate Kelly and Mark Mazzetti. Like tens of thousands of investors, I wish that I had known I was being manipulated by Trump's friends."
2020-10-15 09:30:26,I spent 50 years in the pension and investment profession.  I worked on Wall Street for a few years.  At one time our markets actually raised capital for small regional businesses like one my uncle started in Rochester New York.  It employees many people.  For the life of me I have felt Hedge Funds and repeal of Glass-Stegal have been a disaster.  Hedge Funds have too much power and are a blot on the securities industry.  No wonder people have no faith in our institutions.  The game is rigged!
2020-10-15 09:29:35,"Yes the administration lied, but where were the investigative journalists and a loyal opposition to call their bluff in February.We already knew after three years that the White House is a giant factory of deception after three years of inanity in every other context. China built a hospital in days. Air pollution was down world wide. I recall being as outraged at Kudlow’s Polyannish statements as much as I was the lack of full throated skepticism or denouncement except for a few ( see Jim Cramer reporting on his disheartening conversations with financial bigwigs at the Super Bowl in early February) and the lack of a total crackdown on St Patrick’s day or Mardi Gras by local officials while their European counterparts did quite the opposite. This does not excuse the cesspool of lies that is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue but common sense, vigilance and backbone were lacking elsewhere."
2020-10-15 10:42:51,"In other words, insider trading. Has anyone looked at the Trump Organization stock trading activity for that period?"
2020-10-15 09:27:56,"Could an article be written, publishing a list of names (and their places of employment) of those who who had access to and benefited from early “true” knowledge of the economic and health projections from the Trump administration. These are real people who benefitted while the rest of us chumps lost meager investments and jobs.  I always remember the stories, yet I forget the names, probably because there are so many. If I had access to such a list, I would use it to avoid services and products associated with these learned fellows."
2020-10-15 10:18:12,"Isn’t that called inside trading, or something similar? Wasn’t Martha Stewart jailed because of using inside information to her advantage? More evidence that the Trump administration does not care about the people but hedge funds. More evidence that this administration broke its social contract and must be replaced."
2020-10-15 10:54:00,"No surprise that they did it, but I'm still puzzled as to how they keep getting away with it.  Maybe I should just stop paying my taxes, and start robbing banks."
2020-10-15 11:10:57,"Would any of us be surprised if we were told that government officials and their friends were trading regularly off of inside information provided by Trump and those around him?  And who does not think that people are buying on the dips when Trump tweets out some negative economic news and then reverses himself hours later?

The only thing surprising these days is that we hear not a peep from the SEC.  I haven’t been following that agency lately, but it’s safe to assume it has been gutted and stuffed with Trump hacks . . . like all the others."
2020-10-15 09:25:39,"Why isn't this a headline in 200-point type?  220,000 are dead, 1,000 of which were healthcare providers.  And these people could have been letting us prepare for the onslaught.

I can't think of a punishment too severe.

The alert came during my dinner.  I read the article and almost vomited.  I am an emergency physician.  I have lost colleagues and patients to COVID.  This is no joke to me, or the people I work with.  We've got nurses furloughed because of financial shortfalls to the hospitals, we've seen layoffs at our university.  A lot of my colleagues got a paycut of up to 20% WHILE they were dealing with COVID.

These people destroyed not only the economy, but destroyed families whose loved ones are either never coming home, suffered strokes or blood clots or heart damage that left them permanently disabled.

And these people are short selling their stocks?

I would say, ""Trump and Kudlow:  Have you no humanity?""  But we all know the answer, and it will depress us to hear it out loud."
2020-10-15 09:43:51,"When Trump defended his public lie about the severity of the coming pandemic, he said he didn’t want people to panic. Reporters failed to ask: which people? By my lights: he didn’t want investors to panic, having no concern for anyone else. 

The would-be hero of this story is the CDC official who sounded the warning on February 25, if only she had taken the politics of the president's priorities into account."
2020-10-15 11:20:31,"Another great and important article and thank you for continuing to shine a light on the most reprehensible administration in modern times. Will justice be served? 
And I'm not just talking about Trump losing the election. 
Democrats and intelligence Republicans do not sweep his long list of criminal and immoral acts under a rug there must be consequences."
2020-10-15 06:14:19,"But hasn't Trump being playing the market for 4 years. He knew every comment he made about trade or tariffs would move  the market, so knowing how dishonest he is it is inconceivable that he didn't profit from pre-knowledge."

Trump refused to admit COVID was a big deal.  Not a new story.  “Everyone else” did think it was a big deal. Not a new story.  I bought N95 masks in January and dumped my stocks in February, not because I am such a genius but because all papers, including the NYT, were freaking me out.  Rightfully so, as it turns out.

Mr Trump is exceedingly savvy when he goes about protecting himself.
God bless the successful business man sent by the All Mighty.
Mr Trump has made it very clear:
Hillary. Lame stream media. Liberals. Fake News. No Collusion. Radical Left. Believe me. I am the least racist person in history. You know it. I know it. They know it. Rigged election- I know it because I did it. Collusion? I deny it very powerfully and strongly.

2020-10-15 06:07:29,"The top ten hedge fund managers earned $13.5bn in 2019, according to Institutional Investor. Given their immense resources, and China's critical role in global markets, big investors have spent years developing proprietary, on-the-ground sources of information that rival most countries' intelligence services. 

The anonymous short seller's report on Luckin Coffee released in January 2020 provides one insight into these intelligence gathering efforts: ""We mobilized 92 full-time and 1,418 part-time staff on the ground to run surveillance and record store traffic for 981 store-days covering 100% of the operating hours."" Satellite photos and cellphone records provide other insights. The unreliability of Chinese government and corporate statistics makes this proprietary data incredibly valuable. 

David Tepper, who warned CNBC viewers on Feb 3 of the coming storm, reportedly earned $1.3bn in 2019. (To compare, the revenues of the NYT Company in '19 were $1.6bn.) The notes from the Hoover meeting were likely just another minor datapoint in his decision matrix, not the deciding factor. 

Obviously, the fact that the Trump administration was privately freaked out about Covid-19 while publicly downplaying its severity is a scandal for which they should be held accountable on Nov 3. But it's equally troublesome that a handful of billionaires, accountable to nobody besides their ultra-wealthy ""accredited investors,"" command the resources to run what is essentially a private CIA."

What is going on in this country? The Republican Party is involved in all kinds of financial corruption, yet it pretends nothing is wrong with what its members do. It is currently doing its best to pack the courts with ideologically sympathetic judges in its long-term quest for more legal cover for the multiple crimes of its members and big donors, all the while flogging its “who me?” brand of disingenuous denial.

Blaming Mr. Trump for the smarty-pants is the intent, along with duping the American citizenry and small investors who are bombarded with encouragement to trust institutions and to fawn over celebrities.

Bi-coastalism exploitation by a few highly organized criminal syndicates is why the heartland is rightly suspicious of bi-coastal elites who jet back and forth to swap slobber of sophisticated opportunities for wealth accumulation. Mr. Trump's public performances in the heart of the country is pure carnivalism wrapped in captialistic evangelism for the market.

Getting rid of Mr. Trump by election will not end this longstanding chicanery. Instead, locking up Wall Street along with the top hedge fund and financial advisors is in order.

""During the 1980s, Donald Trump became notorious for leaking word that he was taking positions in stocks, hinting of a possible takeover, and then either selling on the run-up or trying to extract lucrative concessions from the target company to make him go away. It was a form of stock manipulation with an unsavory label: “greenmailing.” The Times unearthed evidence that Mr. Trump enlisted his father as his greenmailing wingman.""  Source NY Times Oct. 2018"

If your family is hospitalized they can't get a few Secret Service agents in HazMat suits to take them for a little joyride so they can stretch their legs. Trump and Crew has done everything they could to kill collective bargaining so people must work multiple full time jobs just to make ends meet. If you really support law enforcement do you really want them to have to stand toe to toe with White Supremist armed better than they are? It is law enforcement that is going to answer the bell if things go sideways in the streets. Regardless if your a Racist or a Flower Child the logic for supporting Trump escapes me. I for one really hate being played for a fool. I always wonder how many Good Ole Boys numbers Trump have on Speed Dial. Trump in private and public comments has shown his disdain for ordinary folks and yet they flock to him. The way Trump mocked Jeff Session's southern accent should have been insulting but it wasn't.

Now I read this article and know for certain this was his agenda. How many died because of this??

If this isn't insider trading--aided and abetted by the White House--nothing is.  All this while Congress debated whether to offer any help to the millions of us losing jobs, homes and futures.  Republicans worried aloud that giving desperate families an extra $600 a week in unemployment benefits might make our lives so cushy we'd feel no rush to return to the grindstone.

They hide under religion, litigate tirelessly because they have the means to do so, often using dark money, and manipulate the unsophisticated,  waving the flag and twisting the Constitution to fit their agenda.  Witness the current mask protests—absurd, if they weren’t so deadly.  It is now an “infringement” of freedom to ask people to take a simple measure to protect themselves and others.

When I look at the comments, I picture many surprised, and shocked faces, this is only ignorance.
Of course, none of this behavior is acceptable.

Yes, wait and see. And we see where that got us. Closing late, and re-opening early, instead of the other way around, like New Zealand. Mr. Biden wrote an article in January, warning we were not prepared.  The 68-page pandemic playbook that the Obama transition team handed over was ignored. The agency that studies pandemics was disbanded entirely. About a dozen warnings from scientists and intelligence were ignored. The ineffective China ban was was not enforced.  

Mr. Kudlow recommended ""tariff tranquility."" I have read often that most economists disagree with Trump's tariff wars, and yet, voters rate Trump over Biden on ability to handle the economy.  Puzzling. 

And now, instead of heeding economists' views that more stimulus is needed, the Senate has done nothing after the House passed their stimulus bill months ago.  Now they are pushing a Supreme Court nominee who seems poised to abolish the ACA, at Trump's behest, even though Trump has never proposed a replacement, as the virus spikes. 

Mr. Trump has lied to and betrayed the citizens he is obligated to protect. At the very least, he has not done his job, and in fact remains unaware and disinterested in what his job is supposed to be. If he was, he wouldn't have time for standup comedy at rallies. How can anyone support this man."

The only reason Koch, Trump, McConnell and the rest aren’t using violence to further their agendas is because they don’t have to. They have already arrayed the institutions of state against you - the people. This is just the latest and perhaps boldest demonstration that they’re happy to directly profit from the deaths of your nearest and dearest.

I wish I had wisdom to share. I wish I knew how you could start to turn things around and build a society that recognises your common dignity and destiny, and your shared responsibility to make the US a welcoming home to all its people.

Instead, my heart breaks from afar. I seethe with blinding rage at the price the whole world pays for what appears to be a proudly anti-intellectual, uneducated, self-obsessed and parochial American electorate.

People would be prosecuted.. The sitting President would probably just step down and have the VP issue a Pardon just in case they ever put him in the room when telling favored investors one thing and the public another came up. 

The Senate would go into damage control and disavow the entire Administration and start hearings immeadiately over a market manipulation of this size and scope.

First, Trump and the sycophants in his administration are not quite as dumb as they appeared to be in public – they did understand the threat.

Second, not only Trump, but all the people working for him truly are compulsive, pathological liars.

Third, they are utterly incompetent. Having known quite early  on of the threat, they did nothing to minimize the epidemic and economic fallout. Indeed, more often that not they have made things worse."

There has been no SEC investigation of the fraudulent activity that must clearly be happening in this fraudulent market.  Can you point to a single enforcement action since Trump has been president?  It was the Bush Administration's hands-off approach to regulating the mortgage market that led to the 2008 collapse, and now it's Trump's spree of corruption that will lead to the inevitable collapse of the stock market once the Fed quits propping up share prices with cheap loans to buy back shares.

The changes will be modest but not fully address the root causes of the problems.  The changes will seem huge compared to the outgoing crime syndicate. The current system of lobbying and the incestuous relationship between Wall Street, large corporations and elected officials will remain largely intact. Biden’s close connection to Obama and long years in the Senate will continue the unconstitutional unilateral decision to use military intervention as a primary option before diplomacy. The Military needs a hard yank on their chains as a reminder they are under civilian control.  There are too many serving on executive committees advising the President.  Remove them.  Biden was molded by the system in place from his long years in the Senate and I have no idea what vision Harris has for the country from her primary bid.  Both are moderates.

Larry Kudlow has never really been an ""economist."" Instead he seemed to be shilling for Wall Street during his time on CNBC. 

Which is why I believe Kudlow and his friends outside the administration are making a lot of highly profitable stock trades with Trump's tweets threatening or encouraging the Street. Why else would we see those fluctuations occurring in such large numbers? We know big investors are making vast fortunes while millions of Americans file for unemployment because employers are shutting their doors.

The big crime here is obviously that the administration is utterly incompetent on a variety of fronts and lies about everything, constantly. 

Any serious person knows not to listen to this administration’s comments on TV.

Further, any serious person knows that even their private comments are highly suspect: these are C and D players who hardly understand the world around them. They are truly dummies. 

The contents of this “memo” were totally unremarkable - the journalist rightly pointed out Tepper had his positions on, and had made public comments about the pandemic, prior to this meeting. You may hate them, but hedge fund guys get paid to be smart and accurate- the very opposite of the modern Republican party.

By the time this meeting started, many hedge funds could already see the writing on the wall. Many of them were forecasting infection rates themselves. Plenty of wall street banks were writing about pandemic scenarios and plenty of news flow was coming out of DC. It didn’t take a genius to see that a pandemic was spreading.

Side note: If you are relying on public statements from the Trump administration to trade your 401k, may I offer some advice: don’t bother. Amidst a global pandemic, your stocks are now up on the year."

2020-10-15 14:48:49,"The one constant of this presidency has been the capriciousness, volatility and inexplicability of his positions on crucial matters of state. He says one thing publicly and the opposite privately - tweets out policy one day only to completely reverse course the next. 

Uncertainty in markets creates shifts of wealth from those who guess wrong to those who guess right. Sometimes there is no guesswork as when those close to the throne have advance knowledge of what is coming. Trump's doublespeak at the outset of the pandemic is one such example. While ordinary investors were being reassured that everything was fine, Trump insiders were given the signal to sell.  

More recently Trump made a series of dizzying u-turns on support for a bail-out. There would be one, there wouldn't, and yet again there would. The markets rose and fell with each new tweet. 

Pundits often ascribe this erratic behaviour to an underlying psychological impairment. The SEC and other investigative agencies will inevitably pick through the ashes of this presidential implosion. Hopefully they will determine whether persons close to the Oval Office received advance notice of these policy reversals. 

When you have a president mired in legal and financial muck including - we're told - an imminent need to find $400 million, such bizarre conduct is bound to raise doubt. When in doubt - as every good investigator knows - you just follow the money."

The same organization that now controls our COVID ""policy"" with garbage about herd immunity, to again bet on the markets as people die, this time that the economy will open in spite of the deaths it causes.

Larry Kudlow, and his ilk among the economists in the WH?

Not hardly. Larry Kudlow couldn't do a vanlla production function in an open book econ exam.

So who?

Connect the dots between Senator Burr, who was playing the canary in the coal mine to a similar group of conservative investors at the same time as Kudlow et al were dog whistlng to their investor buddies - and donors.

Look no further than the CIA, and the other intelligence services, who early on gave a pessimistic briefing to the Gang of 8 from the Intelligence Committees in Congress.

The CIA doesn't stick its finger in the air to see which way the wind is blowing. They have more research resources at their disposal than the WH and the CDC combined.

And they had early on warned what the script was about to be, which then played out because of the malfeasance and incompetence of the WH.

And its task force led by someone who can't even tell when a fly is on his head.

History alone will have access to the Presidential Daily Briefs not read or acted on by the WH.

Which would be true, but he’s also too shady and corrupt not to shamelessly take advantage of every opportunity to enrich himself and his cronies.

There have been far too many instances where he does or says something one day which causes stocks to drop and then after a couple of days when it’s apparent either from him or his administration that he won’t follow through with his threat or plan, the stocks go back to normal...

It’s not an accident.

Imagine the money to be made if you could have access to a device which could cause stocks to fluctuate on demand?

With trump a select few individuals do.
Throw him some dark untraceable cash here and there and the market is yours.

This is the most blatantly Pay-To-Play administration since the gilded age, with its rampant corruption nakedly visible in every action and aspect of its existence.

So was Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) after she was reported selling millions in stock she jointly owned with her husband (who is the chair of the New York Stock Exchange) in January. 

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Jim Inhofe (R-OK)  reported large trades around the same time although they said the sales were unrelated to the coronavirus.

I tell them if they want to play stock market swell, take some relatively small % of their money, and play away, put the rest into funds. 

The stock market is based even more than it once was on perceptions, we are in a recession, the economy is crippled, people are losing jobs, held together with government money and the fed, yet the markets are hitting new highs. Investment firms, especially hedge funds, use sophisticated algo systems to literally trade anything that can be traded, with all kinds of sophisticated triggers in them.

What is INTENT for the many who choose to be complacent about...?

What is INTENT for the all too many who continue to collaborate, actively and passively, aiding and abetting, in the unnecessary covid-19 related deaths of fellow BEings, each with names, families, aspirations, and so much more, who are transmuted, daily,  into lifeless numbers? Infected bodies? Traumatized psyches?

There is no vaccine for the contagion of semantic surrealism!"
2020-10-15 18:28:29,"It is pathetic when Trump supporters claim that they benefited from his economic policies when they got a few bucks from reduced payroll taxes (which damages Social Security and Medicare). They are the rankest, most pitiful chumps. 

The big money is being made by billiionaires through more corruption in the Trump adminiistration where fat-cat oligarchs  profit from insider information while the public languishes. They expect this because they want return on their ""investment"" in Republican campaigns. We should all be roundly sick of this. 

This reminds me of Argentina where well-connected elites always had advance notice of the devaluation of the Argentine peso so they could buy dollars in advance, and repurchase at the devalued rate. Rinse and repeat. That is what is going on with Trump and his cronies. They get advance notice of bad news and sell short. Then they get advance news of good news and buy into the market with the profits. 

No question: big money profits while the rest of us languish. And Trump is the prime driver of the corrupt practices. 

The ordinary investor does not have a chance when Trump and his cronies are manipulating the market."

In the Trump era, even if many of them have not supported him, they are all in on strategies to manipulate the levers of power that ostensibly favor their “beliefs.” The problem is, however, that these “beliefs” are rapidly coming into focus as mostly focused on personal financial gain.

They can make all sorts of lofty claims about their moral and social values, but what they are truly about is improving their own wealth using shady, if not improper, means.

So Trump claimed that he preferred downplaying the significance of the virus because he was concerned about tempering a potential panic amongst the citizenry. Yet clearly what he and his co-conspirators were really after was giving themselves an opportunity to short the market and make money on the human misery to come.

In the same way we can’t trust Trump to honestly project religious and morals he clearly doesn’t possess, we must not trust any Republican who supports the party line. Just as Trump only played a successful businessman on TV, they are now only playing a role that enables their personal aggrandizement.

The path forward, for at least this election cycle, is to vote D at every chance. The only hope for the R’s lies in surviving a massive chastening from the voters and rising from the ashes a better entity."

The virus was blamed for the market decline despite indications of similar market extremes occurring prior to previous major tops.  A contagion of fear added momentum to the plunge.  There are no dark secrets regarding stock market declines.  The usual fear and greed of institutional investors who control 80% of the stock market resulted in a panic for the exits, shedding light on the casino mentality of the stock market and the misconception  accorded the notion of ""securities"".   The stock market is driven by the mood and emotions  of the big players who herd in response to the fear of being left behind and a false comfort in doing no worse than the competition if things fall apart.

I have no direct proof but I am sure the Trump tribe is making millions or billions based on knowing what he will do before everyone else does. And we the taxpayers are letting it happen. The question is whether anyone with the knowhow and financial fortitude will do anything about it or are we just throwing our hands up to this unabashed, unchallenged thievery?

Now, we have over 215,000 dead and officials think this is an underreported number. 
Trump kept quiet to make money. He cared nothing about us or how many of us would sicken and die. 
Trump lacks any decency or empathy and now there is undisputed proof of why he kept quiet about how deadly the virus was and is.

I'm not letting Bob Woodward off the hook, either. I think what he did in the name of ""journalism"" is reprehensible. 
Worse than Trump because he is supposed to know better.

By prolonging the inevitable it's just making everything worse in the long run.  

I wish we had enough responsible people in this country to have a real lockdown in place.  In Turkey walking outside without your mask means a 900 lira fine.  Why can't we have something like that?  We clearly don't have any intrinsic sense of social responsibility; it must be enforced."

Unfortunately, we do not have a world government that could impose a 4-week lock-down all over the planet. If we had, the pandemic would have been over six months ago.

We are deliberately ruining or economies which will pretty soon lead the extinction of the middle-class, mass-unemployment, mass-poverty, spending cuts in health care, welfare programs, education, pensions...

What we are head-diving into is 1929 (and probably even worse).

The same is true of shutting down bars and clubs in a city. First of all, they give a few days warning so people can party all they want beforehand and make things worse and then people just go to a different city with open bars and clubs.

It wasn't that France thought the pandemic had gone away. We all knew that basic measures like social distancing had to continue. But there was no enforcement and it made it look like the government didn't take its own measures seriously.
I do have to wonder. Even now you can see enormous packs of unmasked people convening outside bars. Instead of getting tough with employers, the government has allowed them to set their own WFH policies and rush hour is back. I recently accompanied a friend to the police station where they told us they only wear masks with the public and had just had a Covid case. It's no mystery why we're experiencing a second wave."
2020-10-16 05:46:14,"Many restaurant owners in Paris only have themselves to blame. It was not unusual lately to see people packed into cafes and bars, no masks... a paradise for the Covid virus.

We have a daughter who’s a senior at ASU in Tempe, AZ and when she comes home I’ve told my her that she (and my wife and I) should all be masked and socially distant for safety. If this is American exceptionalism, then America’s best days are in the rear view mirror.

There have been thousands of people who have become infected at their colleges and some have even died. But some students insist on doing things that were, before the Covid-19 crisis  normal activities - going  to parties, congregating in groups, Greek life, going out every weekend (and weeknights, for some) and so on. 

The days are over, for now, when you can just do as you please. This is a terrible time for us as a nation.

As it seems, reading this article, there's no way to hold back young adults' desire to gather and break rules besides snitching. On top of that, the institutions cannot safeguard the whistleblowers from bullies. 

One comforting fact is that not all colleges are having an outbreak. Some schools have significantly less cases than others. It would be interesting to learn about the reasons of the differences."
2020-10-16 03:39:57,"There are more than 70,000 (seventy thousand) U.S. military personnel that have got Covid by now. College students didn't stand a chance! And what about University of Wisconsin Madison handling the crisis effectively? Those kids fleeing in Ubers, surely had nothing to do with the record-breaking covid cases in Wisconsin since then. Though may be the federal administration would praise them for building up the herd immunity?"
2020-10-13 12:57:18,How about being grateful that the lockdown/full cancelation has been lifted? We're all in this together.  These sacrifices seems trivial compared to others that people all over the world are making while we figure out how to put this all behind us.
2020-10-13 13:09:25,"My son is a senior in a public high school in MA.  He is thrilled to be playing and so are his teammates.   As a parent I am thrilled there are no headers, the boys are improving skills with passing and using their chest and shoulder to down the ball.  Adaptation is an important life skill and I am impressed with how they all are doing.   They are 2-0 and having a blast!"
2020-10-13 13:10:31,"As a UK citizen who came to the USA in 1998 and became a proud US citizen in 2018, let me say that the soccer played in the USA is way different from the soccer I played as a Kid.

USA kids soccer is altogether a more genteel game. When watching local USA kids play soccer - with little physical contact, no hard tackles, and over zealous refereeing to limit contact already the US game lack the tough competitive element that one sees in Europe. 

US kids soccer is over coached by adults - in the UK kids ( overwhelmingly boys)  play soccer amongst themselves after watching professional games live and on TV.  It is not a genteel game.  

Soccer played in the USA is a very different game from the soccer played elsewhere."
2020-10-13 13:11:25,"I live in MA and my son plays competitive soccer.  Though this year's game is undoubtedly strange, he's happy to be on the pitch running hard & enjoying the camaraderie with his team.  
It's not hard to remember this past spring when no sports were happening."
2020-10-13 14:21:28,"The lens of this story-HS/College soccer-tinges the perspective on the art of the possible with soccer in the US during COVID. HS/college soccer are best described as “power soccer”-long runs and big kicks with an emphasis on free/corner kicks.  Club and town travel (I coach the latter) has spent years through MA Youth Soccer Association, emphasizing more ball control and individual skills.  Think: Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Liverpool.  These teams show how to blend high quality touches for a more complete game experience. It’s a work in progress, with many errors

The modified rules allows us to emphasize ball control.  The emphasis in the US on physicality permeates player selection and how we cheer on the sidelines.  By focusing on touch and control we widen our children’s soccer horizons.  

If this article were about the new rule’s impact on rising HS seniors using college soccer to get an education, then there might be more to ask of impacts to the collegiate game.  But if you are wondering what has happened to the game in the US, via the lease of youth soccer MA, I think the disquiet in the rules changes is just misplaced.  Look at our national teams: the men are almost exclusively club not college, and women are more likely to jump ship early (fewer pro options limit them though). HS/College are not lenses on modern US soccer, but a throw back to a previous era of the game."
2020-10-13 13:35:19,"As I recall, the only rules sometimes observed by the soccer players at my school were don't kick a kid lying on the ground and no fighting until the game was over."

2020-10-13 16:15:02,"Yes. . . it is better to play this way than not play at all.
That is not the point. The point is that every single other state (and nation) decided soccer was not a setting that is high risk for covid transmission.  . . except MA. I missed the peer reviewed paper that shows throw-ins as being high risk.
This is big government idiocy at its finest.
The articles also misses that soccer is being played as normal with no masks in CT, NY, NJ, and NH."

They're happy, I'm happy.  Doing the best we can.  Not a bad experiment, I'd say."
2020-10-14 03:32:30,Glad they're playing. But soccer with no contact--especially the ability to take the ball away with a legal slide tackle--is not soccer/football.
2020-10-13 21:34:33,"This is frightening! how low have we all gone as a society, playing soccer with a mask-on in an open space!"

2020-10-14 13:58:36,"When I was a  med student between my first and second year, I traveled around the UK and your hummus sandwiches gave me sustenance. Spoting a

Rooting for you, Pret!"
2020-10-14 14:00:21,"These eateries are to London what Dunkin Donuts used to be to Boston - everywhere. Pret’s quality of product is superior though. 

I discovered Pret in the Kensington area of London 23 years ago and loved it. I returned there (and noticed the significant increase in locations) many times since then; the last was over the Christmas and New Year holidays of 2019 - it feels like that was five years ago now! Even then, it seemed like there was an over saturation of stores, one on every other corner of central London it seemed.

They have a winning menu of food offerings. I wish them well (and most especially, their employees) going forward."
2020-10-14 14:02:19,"They are the best fast food in Manhattan, NYC, too. And the pastries were actually great. I hope they find a way to survive."

2020-10-14 14:20:16,"Bliss is sitting in Tavistock Square on a bench under a tree with a Pret Sandwich and the really delicious yoghurt they sell.  The best part about the yoghurt is that in Britain (at least on take-out packaging) they don't have those nasty boxes with the calories and salt and stuff.  

The worst part of Pret is that they charge extra to eat in their relatively modest sit down section and they don't serve milk.  Milk is served from the jugs sitting on the counter for the coffee.  Sometimes it is room temperature."
2020-10-14 14:25:08,The yogurt with the chopped apple in it...the tuna on baguette...the breakfast wraps...Pret was the only good part of working in the awful Penn Station area. Really good food. I hope they survive.
2020-10-14 14:35:57,"They were definitely better than Subway or any other chain sandwich shop in the US, we found last summer"
2020-10-14 14:36:53,"Haven’t been to a London one (or London at all) but they’re scattered around Chicago’s downtown too. Reliable, reasonably healthy compared to other fast food, decently priced, tasty options. I like their various macaroni and cheeses—there’s a seasonal butternut squash one they’ve done for autumn in the past, that I might’ve eaten if my office weren’t closed for covid. 

I’m more concerned about my city’s local lunch spots but I hope there’s a few Prets around when this is over, too (specifically, the one by my office). Chicago at least has had more residential buildings downtown so perhaps there is still some customer base."
2020-10-14 14:43:20,"North America is starved for places as good as Pret: quick, reliable, tasty, good quality, reasonably priced, ubiquitous. Nothing in Canada or the US even comes close."
2020-10-14 14:52:58,"My husband and I fell in love with Pret when we visited the UK in 2018.  Their food is excellent and reasonably priced.  We had hoped they would open some shops here in California.  We're rooting for you, Pret!"
2020-10-14 15:03:26,since returning to work in nyc I have dined exclusively at pret a manger. contactless lunch. pick up a sandwich pay go.  no lingering.  reasonably quality food. sad I only have 4 locations to choose from as opposed to the 18 I had pre pandemic but it works.
2020-10-14 15:09:28,"We took annual one week holidays in November to London  for many  years to enjoy the theatre, museums and food. We loved Pret for breakfast and lunch, everything fresh and tasty. One of their breakfast egg dishes with a latte were a good choice to start the day. Great lunch sandwiches and salads: the Duck with Hoisin Sauce wrap, the Chicken Avocado sandwich; the Spicy Chicken wrap; the Tuna Melt warmed up; and the Veggie Fiesta Salad. Then there are the desserts: the carrot and lemon cakes and the puddings. Fond memories. Hope Pret will survive for our next trip to London after COVID."

2020-10-14 14:35:58,Pret has already closed several locations in the Washington DC area and their outlet in the Biden rest stop on I-95 in Delaware. Their fast food is relatively fresh and healthy so it’s a shame.
2020-10-14 14:32:44,"Peets, Pret, Krispy Kreme, all of these are owned by JAB Holdings. They will survive this crisis because they have the capital and influence to do so. Why aren’t Times readers and journalists covering the many worthy small mom and pops who buy local, hire local, and support our communities?

2020-10-14 15:26:05,I work in midtown Manhattan; the Prets near me have all closed. I miss the salads and the vegetarian sandwiches. There are very few places in midtown where you can reliably get tasty vegan or vegetarian food for less than $15.
2020-10-14 15:29:14,"There is a Pattiserie Valerie near the hotel I use in London, and a Pret right next door.  Valerie has better food, a larger menu, better coffee, fewer customers, and the prices are similar.  Guess where I go.  But 20 quid for a month of coffee?  Even I would switch, at least for my midmorning and midafternoon coffees.  Now, if only I could go to London."
2020-10-14 15:33:44,"I love pret. I have allergies and they consistently label their ingredients so it’s not a guessing game for me during a quick grab and go lunch. They’ve made a commitment to donating food every day to city harvest here in nyc and their cashiers are so friendly. Plus I love that they are working on more veggie options. I hope they survive this, they are way better and more modern than most mass market/fast food options out there."
2020-10-14 15:39:56,"There are so many 2nd and 3rd tier cities with populations above 100k. Perhaps if Pret (and Trader Joe’s for example) realized that there are great opportunities across the nation in cities with 100k-200k population and took a chance on them growth would be quite strong. For example, my mother lives in Springfield, Illinois. Population around 120k but much higher if considering all the surrounding towns around the city. This is just one example. Anyway, just a thought!"
2020-10-14 15:47:55,I love Pret. It's one of my favorite comforts when visiting London and it's possible that i engineered a layover at LHR for the sole purpose of getting a prawn sandwich.
2020-10-14 15:48:41,Does Pret have a good doordash or delivery game? Seems that is a must for any chain that wants to survive covid-19. The workers may not be in offices but they still need lunch from working at home. I still treat myself to lunch every now and then especially when I can't face my own cooking.
2020-10-14 15:54:55,"Pret is very sadly missed here in Boston by my husband and I.  We lost a half-dozen or so (all) of their stores here when they shut down in March and they have not returned.  Their breakfasts, sandwiches, salads and coffee were all fresh, tasty and well made, and the stores clean and well lit.  Such a pity and we truly hope they can survive and thrive again."
2020-10-14 15:58:17,"I was once a devoted fan, but my local Panera has seen a marked drop in the quality of food and service.  Crumbly, squashed sandwiches, thrown-together salads, long lines and poor pickup instructions are not going to keep me as a patron.  We should continue to support our favorite fast-food restaurants as much as we can, but as they adapt, they still need to satisfy customers.

We have found that the local mom-and-pops — the diner or the Italian deli — seem to be handling things much better than the chains and are offering fresher, tastier ingredients at better prices.

Oh, and while I don’t mind tipping on takeout orders during a pandemic, that custom needs to be dropped as soon as things return to normal.  I don’t need to be rewarding someone else when I’m carrying my own food home."
2020-10-14 16:05:42,We have Pret here in Chicago.  I miss it.
2020-10-14 16:07:52,"I’ve eaten at this chain two times. The first, in New York, then in London. The New York sandwich cost about $9. and was worth about half that. I returned it to a surprised employee who gave me the stock reply: “No one else complains “.  I believed him. The place was full of satisfied customers eating flavorless food slathered in condiments and soulless corporate bread. 
London was better, but I cannot imagine going twice. 
The small coffee shops in either city are so much more interesting and fun No robots at the counter, no plastic factory food on the shelves

It’s time to break the chain of bad food for too much money. It takes a little imagination, but it’s worth the effort. 

In Ireland recently Subway was forbidden from referring to their white floury stuff as bread. Too much sugar. It was deemed to be a dessert product.
There’s hope!"
2020-10-14 16:20:27,"I love Pret. One morning during a particularly terrible day I was having, I walked into a Pret in Washington, D.C. to grab something to eat. At the register, the cashier asked how my day was going. ""A bit overwhelming, but I'll get through it!"" I answered honestly. She then asked if I'd like a free chocolate bar to brighten up my day. 

On another occasion at a Pret in London, I rushed in to grab a coffee on my way to work and franticly dug around my bag looking for my wallet at the register. As I looked, the cashier said ""No worries - it's on us!"" I then explained that I had my wallet, it was just lost in my enormous bag, but he insisted that the coffee was free. 

I firmly believe Pret has some of the best prepared quick food in the world, but they have an even better culture around how they train their employees and treat their customers. I'm rooting for them!"
2020-10-14 16:25:38,"The airline industry (whose management has gouged its customers for years on end (one even tried to charge for restrooms)) isn't in any ""hucker down"" mode (as the paper suggests), but rather begging (or blackmailing) congress for even more bail-out money from the same tax payers they gouged?  Do you recall when they all raised their prices when the cost of fuel went up, but sure did not drop them when the fuel prices fell.  No, they just found more ways to charge, and instead of investing in improvements management bought back stock to assure themselves huge payouts. Now they are cutting staff.,and cutting orders to airplane manufacturers (who are also in line for even more bail outs from tax payers).  Or did I miss something?"

2020-10-14 16:41:32,"Pret was a welcome addition when it opened near my office on Church Street in Manhattan.  Always busy, they offered hearty oatmeal for breakfast and quick selection of tasty sandwiches and soups for lunch, set out along a wall, a modern day automat.  Especially for those on a budget (or a bit gluttonous) the baskets of complimentary rolls and individual packets of EVOO stretched out the meal.  I was not aware that Pret was from England but they stood out among chains as one of the nicest and hope that among the strategies they consider for adjusting to the new realities is bringing their shops from newly deserted office downtowns to the residential areas where at-home workers can again find satisfying coffee and nourishment to take back to their desk.  Good luck, Pret!"
2020-10-14 16:49:32,"Starbucks has a similar footprint in urban areas. I recall that very early in the pandemic they started asking landlords for rent concessions and people expressed outrage. A few stores have closed permanently as they were in high-rent areas, did not receive any concessions, and no office workers were in the area any longer. The thing is that Starbucks had already gone through the pandemic in China and knew what was coming. If only we had paid attention as a country!"
2020-10-14 16:57:18,"I worked in central London for 18 years and sometimes I ate at Pret twice a day - breakfast AND lunch. Their cappuccino is consistently the best on the high street, they do good quality breakfast pastries and sandwiches. Lunchtime salads, baguettes and toasted sandwiches are all tasty, freshly made and high quality. They do good vegetarian and vegan options as well. And I always looked forward to the Christmas Lunch sandwich every year. Now that I've moved out of London, I engineer my train trips into London via Birmingham so I can get my ""Pret Fix"". They'll survive - they may not have as many locations, but they'll still be around."
2020-10-14 16:59:09,"Please add my Praises of Pret to all the others who have high opinions of Pret A Manger.  When I used to go to London (sure miss that nowadays) I marveled that ""convenience"" food at Pret was miles (or kilometers) better than any I've experienced in America.  The quality and flavors are massively superior to fast food.  I noticed that only a few sandwiches, salads, soups etc were placed on the shelves at one time - Staff were frequently bringing up trays of freshly prepared items.

Easy and quick food in the USA could benefit from the concept and management culture of this company.  I wish Pret well, along with all worthy and well done food enterprises, businesses of all kinds, during these challenging times. 

A brief comment regarding food and politics - have you noticed that our stomach-turning ""leader"" seems to only eat junk food?  I am hoping to open a bottle of champagne on the eve of November 3rd !"
2020-10-14 17:03:13,"PaM was my go-to place for lunch, whenever I was at my Midtown office.  A great 'system' to pick up and pay...a nice variety of fresh, tasty, offerings.  We all have to help out in whatever ways we can, to help such businesses survive."
2020-10-14 17:14:46,"Just echoing the thoughts of others. We visited London a few years ago and stopped in a Pret for lunch -- a place I'd never heard of. I was impressed just walking in the store. The food was delicious, fresh, and if I recall, about £15 for both of us.

We have comparable places in the US but they are lost in the onslaught of burger-centric fast food stores which I avoid."
2020-10-14 17:24:49,"I would love to see a Pret loyalty program for food in addition to coffee. Go ahead! Collect my data, just as Sweet Green does. You’ll still be my favorite Capitol Hill lunch hangout. And please bring back the chia pudding!"
2020-10-14 19:39:13,"I didn’t anticipate that this article would engender in me such nostalgia but I realize that Pret has had a big role in my life in recent years. My London-based partner and I always stop in a Pret for a tea or lunch while on our days out in London. We, together with my adult children, shared an early morning breakfast at the Pret in St. Pancras International while waiting to board the Eurostar to Brussels for our last adventure in the final days of 2019. And, I have shed a few tears at the Pret in the departures area of Terminal 3 at Heathrow as I bid farewell to my beloved. 

It has been ten months since my last visit to London and to Pret. I long for my partner’s embrace and one of our always fascinating conversations over a tea at Pret. 

Cheering you on, Pret!"
2020-10-14 20:05:27,"Big fan of Pret! Pleased to say that the one in Downtown Brooklyn (MetroTech) is open in a somewhat reduced capacity. Whether you seek breakfast, lunch, or a snack, Pret is the odds-on best bet if you seek real food. Is it flashy? Sometimes; not always. But the quality of the ingredients and the care they put into even their simplest fare is quite impressive. Could be seen as expensive, but real food often is. Hoping, in this one case, that private equity ownership and innovation see them through."
2020-10-14 20:23:57,Used to eat at Pret all the time in Hong Kong. Good cheddar cheese pickle sandwiches. Crayfish sandwich is decent too.
2020-10-14 20:45:34,"I lived in London for 6 months of vacation - 5 years back.

I found Pret as expensive as eating in a pub.

And their sandwiches are not even as big as foot long of Subway.

They are a good welcome in London if you want a quick bite to go.

But Marks and Spencer's offers you much more for much less price.

Also I found - at least London stores - kind of boring."
2020-10-14 21:15:42,Was never that impressed with Pret. in New York. Vending machine sandwiches without the vending machine. Higher quality for sure but still prepackaged. I prefer my high priced sandwiches made to order. Also because they were on a cooling shelf they are cold. I never like cold sandwiches as if it just came out of the refrigerator. When I asked if the sandwich could be heated. They said no. Only ate there once.

Lost Foods of New York City: Date-nut bread sandwiches at Chock Full o' Nuts

Today’s cafés brew boutique beans, utilize precise, time-consuming brewing methods, and offer forth the product of their craft with hushed reverence. 

For all the snobbery, theirs are often some breathtaking cups. But long before today’s artisanal coffee revolution, and even before Starbucks’ plucky mermaid shone like a lighthouse on every Manhattan street corner, there was Chock Full o’ Nuts.

Throughout the 1940s and '50s and on into the '60s, Chock Full o' Nuts’ several dozen coffee shops refilled the mugs of thousands of New York area customers each day, and their Checker Cab-yellow coffee cans graced kitchen cupboards throughout the city.

Like any respectable coffee shop, they also served food along with their drink: a modest menu of dishes like lemon cream pie, whole-wheat donuts, and green pea soup. One of their offerings, however, would become a signature—a dish so deliciously simple and practical that it would nearly eclipse the coffee in nostalgic value: date-nut bread and cream cheese sandwiches.

The sandwich, made of two dense slices of date-nut bread slathered with cream cheese, was once a daily fixture of New York City life

It’s interesting to read that it is so entwined with office lunch culture as we always associate it with vacation!  Over the years on trips to London or grabbing a bite at the airport  in Paris it was the one place that we could all happily get a healthy quick meal.  My favorite is the thick, creamy porridge that they somehow keep heated to the perfect temperature.  Along with a banana and a ginger shot. What a great breakfast before touring in the damp rainy city."

2020-10-12 16:36:31,"We will get a decent, honest man as president after the November election. We, the people, must have a leader we can trust.  We can trust Biden.  We can listen to and we can believe a moral, empathetic, kind, man to help with the real doctors and scientists  promoting an effective viable, believable vaccine.  If Joe says so, I'm in."
2020-10-12 16:41:22,"All of this calls for a coordinated approach from the Federal government... something we used to know how to do, and do well. Public companies can get us there, but we will need to coordinate vaccine distribution. It can’t be left to the markets. Leadership is required, and smart decisions that are not influenced by the private sector, but by what is best for the nation, and the world."
2020-10-12 16:45:33,"We will be suffering from the consequences of zero national leadership in this time of historic crisis for generations.  Families w/out loved ones, survivors suffering from persistent symptoms and uninsurable in a post-ACA world, greater inequality, more children left behind, more previously-professionally employed mothers unable to resume their careers. ALL of this will be worsened by the president's active interference in the vaccine development process.

It seems doubtful that most of us will even get to choose. Who thinks that national drug store chains will stock more than one version of the vaccine? Or local physician groups? Most of us will either take the one questionable vaccine available locally or go unvaccinated. But that latter choice will leave us vulnerable to the virus, with increased exposure in public as the public mask guidelines disappear and work-at-home opportunities are reduced. 

We will pay the price of Trumpism for decades and we must NEVER forget the culpability of the entire GOP."
2020-10-12 16:47:21,"Excellent article, Carl! This should be mandatory reading for all Americans, especially those unaware of the drug development and evaluation process."
2020-10-12 16:47:29,"This article provides zero support for the idea that two effective vaccines can be of differing usefulness. The idea is simply assumed from the start. Kindly go back and provide historical proof of a vaccine that works but not enough to justify its public distribution. 

I’m not talking about the story of a vaccine that actually made people more susceptible to the virus. I mean one that works - but barely. Since when is that a thing?  This article provides no historical support. 

Furthermore, the master protocol is the antithesis of strength via diversity. If the virus can mutate around the winner of a master protocol contest (and how is that done?, see above) then wouldn’t we be better off with two or more effective vaccines out there at the same time. If one fails in the future then the other may still succeed. Right?"
2020-10-12 16:48:25,"I prefer therapeutics to vaccines.

Why would I take a vaccine, without knowing for sure if I will contract the virus, without knowing how effective it will be when it matters, not knowing the side effects, and no knowledge how long the immunity will last?

I can take a therapeutic only if and when I get the virus, and will know soon if it worked or not. 

Bring on the therapeutics!"
2020-10-12 16:48:45,"One thing is certain. With Trump deeply tainting  the vaccine approval process, coupled with the anti-vaxxers existing movement, the rate of vaccinations will be so slow that the needed number to create herd immunity, will not be reached for a relatively long time, making some areas (like the no maskers) a source pool for pandemic transmission, possibly for years. That itself will increase the probability of  an unfriendly virus mutation that could be more lethal, or resistant to current vaccines."
2020-10-12 16:49:50,"It's time to consider vaccines and prescription drugs a national security measure that should be brought under the government's auspices and, no brainer, made in the U.S.  For those who wonder if the same breakthroughs could result, just look at the innovation in the military.  Maybe this way we can defend ourselves against the next Chinese virus, whether intentional or unintentional."

2020-10-12 16:55:44,The question is not going to be which vaccine is the best but rather: Which vaccine actually confers immunity? What is the vaccine's efficacy rate? Which vaccine is more likely to give you the most severe and potentially lethal side effects? There simply hasn't been and won't be enough time to get scientifically accurate answers to these questions by next spring.
2020-10-12 16:58:24,"I live in a household where two of us are in one of the studies. Based on aftereffects of the two injections we think one of us received the experimental vaccine and I got the placebo.

Trying to imagine a household where one of us is protected but not the other makes my head hurt."
2020-10-12 17:00:35,"The Oxford University phase-three trials for their Corona virus vaccine are in progress with results reported to be due before the end of the year. If it turns out to be a safe and viable vaccine I can see the government and medical authorities giving permission to roll out the vaccine as soon as possible, which I would guess will be the start of the New Year.  I would anticipate that front line workers will be first in line followed by vulnerable groups, then a country-wide vaccination of the population at designated centres. It will surely be a huge operation. 

I have total confidence that Oxford’s vaccine will be safe and will look toward to be given the vaccine when my turn comes. Only time will tell which of the many vaccines in development in different parts of the world will turn out to be the standard one world-wide."

2020-10-12 17:09:53,"This is more reason to support reporting of vaccine testing results so that anyone getting a vaccine can compare results.

I'm more concerned about another issue, however.  An earlier NY Times article indicated that vaccines would be approved if they are 50% effective even if they do not have statistically significant effectiveness for moderate and severe cases of Covid-19.  Vaccine trial results should also report on whether they have a significant effect in preventing moderate or severe Covid-19 cases."
2020-10-12 17:13:01,"Thank you to The New York Times for an insightful and educational article on how the vetting process works for every vaccine manufactured.

According to the CDC, ""recent studies show that flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40% and 60%.""

Accordingly, the incoming stable of Coronavirus vaccines is well within acceptable CDC guidelines for a safe and effective vaccine.

Operation Warp Speed has prioritized protocols for vaccine testing and approval and is expediting efficacious vaccines not only to the United States, but to the world.

American scientific knowledge and ingenuity is at the forefront of global innovation for the good of all of its citizens."
2020-10-12 17:13:15,"Thank you Mr. Zimmer for expressing my current concerns so clearly. I'm a 73 year old retired engineer locked-down in Southern California. 

I have resigned myself to the likelihood that a vaccine will not be available to me until sometime 2H21, but I've been concerned about exactly the issue you raise, how will I know which of the multiple vaccines to choose? And, if a better vaccine comes along, is there a problem in getting a second or third vaccine?

For me, there's an added dimension to the problem. I have spent most of my retirement traveling. Thailand will be reopening foreign tourism soon. They have almost no covid and they are developing a vaccine. How can I compare the Thai vaccine to the US vaccines? 

And if I do get covid, will I be able to get Remdesivir? Regeneron?

Where is the guidance from health officials?"
2020-10-12 17:13:41,"The real question in all of this is why so many people have gone along with Trump's insanity. I understand that Dr. Fauci has probably been hanging in there to try to keep the situation from getting even worse than it has gotten, but I think the country might have been better served if early on he had resigned and then started going on air and writing op-ed pieces to let everyone know just how crazy and dangerous Trump is to our health, with specific examples. Now we are many months into this disaster and even if Trump is voted out of office and actually leaves, we will still be stuck with a medical and economic tragedy with no clear end in sight--including the relief that might have come from a less rushed vaccine program. I am 64 years old and I am certainly not against vaccines--I get a flu shot every year. But I'm in no hurry to take a vaccine that has emerged out of a non-transparent process that moved at ""warp speed."" Not so long ago the U.S. would have led the world with a sane and safe vaccine development program. Now we're just a cautionary tale of how not to run a vaccine program...or a nation."

2020-10-12 17:33:16,"The article may imply that there will be confusion among consumers as to which vaccine to choose. That is not the case as consumers, in all likelihood will have no choice. When they go to their preferred provider, clinic, pharmacy, primary care physician or urgicenter, etc. they will not be asked which vaccine do you want, but rather do you want THE VACCINE. Most providers will probably stock only one vaccine depending which supplier they use, cost or other factors. They may stock more than one vaccine if supplies are limited. Hopefully most providers will do the research to determine which vaccine is most efficacious and stock that. But again shortages may lead to the purchase of an alternate vaccine."
2020-10-12 16:44:04,"Stop the presses! The “chaos and confusion” are already here, as no less a health expert than Eric Trump attested over the weekend, in an interview on ABC’s “This Week”. Not only did he say that his father had already taken a vaccine during his stay at Walter Reed, but that he had, and I quote, “literally, on day one, started creating the vaccine”. There are a number of possibilities here: Eric is afflicted with the same word-salad syndrome as confounds Senior or he doesn’t know what the words “vaccine” or “literally” mean. Perhaps this this is why his dad thought twice about exiting the hospital wearing a Superman shirt? Let the “chaos and confusion” continue."
2020-10-12 17:34:24,"My biggest concern is not that the vaccines will be ineffective, but that many will refuse to get them.

Between vaccination, mask wearing, and social distancing, we could bring this disease under control, but we haven't been very successful with the latter, and the numbers for vaccines are worse.

Going unvaccinated is not a victimless crime. All three measures should be mandatory."
2020-10-12 17:36:19,"It is impossible to determine how long the immunity conferred by a vaccine will last in the compressed time scale being considered. A vaccine that provides only a short and variable period of protection, less than six months, would be nearly worthless in the general population. (It might have niche areas of utility, such as vaccinating the families of recently infected patients.) Further, depending on the specific vaccines, having received a poor vaccine may interfere with the effectiveness of later, better vaccine. 

The problems of continuing research after an emergency use authorization has been amply demonstrated in the case of convalescent plasma. Tens of thousands of patients are now receiving an expensive medication which some small, controlled, double-blind studies have shown to be ineffective, but it has become impossible to do large studies. 

These problems could be mitigated by limiting the populations that a vaccine could be given to after an EUA.  If vaccine candidates were limited to specific groups, such as close contacts of the recently infected and front line workers, the remainder of the population could still be recruited for more complete studies. This, however, would require more political will than the current administration has shown."
2020-10-12 17:07:08,"i will know which vaccine to take if it is approved and considered safe and effective by all or most of the following: Dr. Fauci, Dr. David Ho, the AMA, the CDC, the NIH, Johns Hopkins, Harvard Health, Cleveland Clinic and WHO.  Unless that occurs, no one is putting a needle in my arm."
2020-10-12 17:42:49,"Regardless of which vaccines make the FDA cut, for those lucky enough to have health insurance I worry about health care plans short changing us and dictating which ones we will get...largely based on what they will pay for. Short of one vaccine emerging as the clear “winner”, I predict that even family medicine doctors will have a hard time sorting through competing information overload in trying to determine what’s best for a particular patient. Leave it to Trump to run a vaccine beauty contest."
2020-10-12 17:14:59,My current plan is to research the people endorsing a particular vaccine. Appointed by Trump? I’ll skip that vaccine. Approved by Trump? Ditto. Research incomplete or shortened? I’ll wait. Dr. Fauci approved? I’ll get in line.
2020-10-12 16:45:39,"The BEST early place I got my info was from Woo Joo Kim from South Korea (South Korea's equivalent to Dr. Fauci). I thank Asian Boss for making such great information available to US Readers.  

I already knew the efficacy of masks, and I was surprised our US leaders were down playing (we now know due to shortages).  I love Dr. Fauci, but fault him on perpetuating that myth, though I understand why. My mask understanding was solidified, and I learned that the virus could be aerosolized, the expected time frames from vaccine development etc, quarantines etc.  So I felt well-prepared.

It is important for people to carefully vet their sources of information.  

I appreciated, too, the NYT article on the same ole' stuff that happened during the 1918 pandemic:  folks failing to take necessary and commonsensical approaches to protecting themselves and others.  The piece was a reminder that there is nothing new under the sun--and the human condition represents the spectrum of stupid and sublime.  Good leadership helps ensure that the needle does not get stuck on the stupid side."

But under the Trump administration I have absolutely zero faith in the CDC and the FDA,￼ by their actions since the pandemic started, these agencies and the lackeys within them have burn through that trust. 

And I will be completely honest that I also believe that Anthony Fauci was also complicit in undermining that faith. I believe the doctor Fauci long ago￼ Should have resigned in protest, rather than let himself be bullied and used as a “central casting” prop for this corrupt administration.￼ I know that Dr. Fauci is one of our best and brightest, and I have the deepest respect for him along with the majority of Americans. But it saddens me that he has allowed himself to be used and abused.￼"

Knowing that he will not face the voters again, he can smirk on the sidelines and order his (hopelessly compromised) Food and Drug Administration to issue conflicting guidelines as the spreading panic continues.

Who, in his or her right mind, expects this president to do the right thing? And if Joe Biden is elected, he might pay for this president's dilatory and irresponsible actions. He may, President Biden, that is, have to re-make the nation's F.D.A., Centers For Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health to fight continuing ravages of the Covid-19. And who knows what vaccines in the next year may be available and safe? A President Biden will be under enormous pressure to do what a President Trump has refused to do: address the pandemic responsibly and honorably.

And if the Affordable Care Act is overturned, as Republicans and this president seem primed to do, then what will be the cost of these vaccines? They will not be free, and Donald Trump is lying to the American people by telling us that it will be.

The truth has consequences. So do lies."
2020-10-12 17:49:30,"""Even moderately effective vaccines will be a huge help in reducing the cases of Covid-19.""
Indeed. 
Choosing which vaccine doctors will recommend to their patients might be difficult, but it is a whole lot less difficult and painful than the situation we were in during March and April, when doctors had to choose among treatments with no evidence that one was more effective than any other, or, for that matter, that any of them were effective.
I will enthusiastically step up for any vaccine provided it is given the thumbs up by FDA's outside science panel (otherwise not). After that, I might be willing to get on an airplane, but I'll still be wearing my mask."
2020-10-12 17:52:10,"For those over 65, there are 2 different influenza vaccines--Fluad (normal dose, but has an adjuvant) and Fluzone High Dose (quadruple dose, but no adjuvant).  There is no CDC data as to which is better, or which should be avoided given certain medical conditions.  If anyone knows, please say!

At least three vital sectors of our lives as a people simply can't be run like businesses: government, health care, and education. The profit motive is destructive in all three of these essential aspects of functioning society.

It isn't that economic principles don't apply; it's that there's a profound difference between the economy and business, aka capitalism.

I couldn't bear to watch the farce that is the SCOTUS confirmation hearing, so instead I watched the British PM field questions from the House of Commons on SkyNews. It was stunning. I've watched these sessions before, so I know that dissent can be boisterous, but today, on the question of the pandemic, there was focused exchange. No name-calling, no claims of hoax, no juvenile finger-pointing to wiggle out of accountability. Just differences of opinion on the extent of measures to take: what to shut down and why; how much aid to make up for it. Serious questions asked, and serious if not always satisfying answers given.

And this is a country that hasn't done as well as others in combating the virus, led by Boris Johnson, of all people.

How I long to be governed by thinking adults I can trust to at least try to solve problems for the common good."
2020-10-12 17:54:47,"There are several vaccines in the final testing phases, developed by different manufacturers / countries.  Some of these vaccines function using different biological mechanisms (if that is the proper description).

Therefore, would there be an issue having multiple vaccines from different sources with each vaccine functioning differently? 

I suspect by summer there will be several vaccines to choose from, and the market will be over-saturated, like the return of toilet paper / ammo / gas panic buying events of the past.  

Domestically, even flu shots are in a state-wide registry, accessible at any drug store, preventing a second shot.  A 64-year old requires a prescription AND must pay for the double-strength flu shot provided to a 65-year old person.

Everyone that travels SE Asia, Latin America, North Africa, and even Mediterranean Europe is aware that quality medical access / medication is readily available and affordable, on a cash basis.

So why not have two or even three vaccines, if the operating mechanics of each vaccine are different?"

My husband has gotten a flu shot for so long, I don't recall when he first received it.  Even after receiving it  he has gotten the flu although neither the symptoms nor the duration were extreme.

There is no vaccine that has ""defeated"" influenza, it merely helps keep symptoms at bay.  And people still get it very year and people still die from it, pneumonia & other complications from one or the other or both.

To think or assume that a COVID vaccine, created and manufactured in ""warp speed"" time frame will suddenly reset the clock in which life as we have known it will return any time soon, well, I think that's a pipe dream rather than a realistic expectation.

Every year the flu vaccine is tweaked, depending on various components of whatever flu strain has developed.  There is no ""one size fits all"" kind of vaccine.  Even the ""senior"" flu shot my husband and I received last month was not around a year ago.

What scares me about COVID is that people can have it but not have any symptoms.  I don't ever recall someone who had the flu NOT experience symptoms. Anyone can be a COVID spreader and not know it.

Face masks & safe distances will be with us for a long time. The inconsistent & conflicting intel from Trump compounds the problem.  His input adds to the confusion."
2020-10-12 18:02:08,"Thanks for this column that shows how important thorough and competent analyses of data are to science and public health. When so many products for the same indication show up at once we have a real challenge, which gets worse when not all cooperate to maintain transparency. 

The complicated joint method of analysis required for this situation is called ""network meta-analysis"", the long and short of which are given at this link:

Comparing Safety of multiple products is even harder than comparing Efficacy. 
Analysis of safety data versus studies of efficacy
	1. Prespecification of end points is rarely possible for safety analyses
	2. Sample sizes are typically inadequate for many safety issues
	3. The optimal granularity of adverse event definitions is often uncertain
	4. Subset analyses across subpopulations can rarely be prespecified
	5. Pooled analyses of many studies are necessary to compare product safety profiles
	6. Combining safety information from clinical trials and observational data may be necessary
All of the above issues can be thought of as variations on problems of multiple comparisons
Hierarchical Bayesian analysis methods analyze commonalities among the diverse effects 	
Shrinkage techniques help the estimates “borrow strength” from each other

Of course this brings up a political issue....who in their right mind would take a vaccine if Trump is re-elected and trust the data or the information coming from a batch of science deniers and liars who have muzzled groups like the CDC and NIH that I once looked to for guidance?

2020-10-12 18:18:32,"I was informed the other day that when a vaccine becomes available, I will one of the first individuals to receive it because I am considered an ""essential worker"" at my place of employment.

I just looked at my boss and extremely politely stated that there are varying degrees of ""essential"" workers at my company.  I said I will be glad to go to the very back of the line after everyone else has received it because I simply do not trust anything manufactured and distributed in ""warp speed"".

The last time I checked, I was more useful and valuable when healthy and alive then sick, off work, and/or possibly out of the picture permanently.

I recall all too well of the 1976 swine flu vaccine debacle.

Thanks but no thanks when it comes to THIS vaccine nightmare."
2020-10-12 18:14:29,"Why is no one reporting (google it!) that vaccines won’t be available for anyone under 18 for another year?!? There are little-to-no clinical trials for pediatric patients (this is typical for many drugs due to safety) going on right now. 
It won’t be until the 2021 school year or later before kids will have Covid vaccines."

2020-10-12 18:41:47,"Am a layman and don't fully understand vaccine trials.

However, instead of going into the challenge phase which can take a long time, why can't they take a blood sample and find out which vaccine produces the most effective antibodies (in parallel) 

That data could be relevant too, no?"
2020-10-12 18:50:38,"Carl Zimmer writes great articles!

So many are counting on a magical vaccine to lift the lockdowns (or threat thereof), mask mandates and social distancing.  However, it doesn't sound like any upcoming vaccine is going to be the panacea that so many hope for.  

So is there a Plan B?  Or C?  Lockdown threats forever?  

We know the economy can't stand much more.  The ONLY reason the stock market isn't 10k lower is the hope of additional government stimulus.  

But even if the Dems gain the presidency and control of Congress, the government can't conjure free money and grants out of thin air forever."
2020-10-12 18:52:35,"It's not only in the area of high-tech vaccine research and selection that the administration is failing us. For example, while we wait for vaccines to be tested and approved, we are left with slowing the spread of the virus. One of the most important tools for accomplishing that is the use of masks.

Right now, it's possible to go online and find numerous companies selling various kinds of masks for use of the public. Some of them claim to be especially effective because they are made infused with anti-microbial copper or because they create an electrostatic charge that makes them more effective at filtration.

But there is no system for independent testing and certification of masks for the general public. Presumably almost any mask is better than nothing. Except that a poorly made or badly fitted product may create a false sense of security that is worse than nothing.

Of course, the biggest obstacle  on the road to controlling the virus is Donald Trump, who spreads endless confusion about the seriousness of the disease, holds super-spreader events, and tells us that the virus is being brought under control, even as the number of new cases continues to climb. 

And when one or more vaccines are developed and are ready to be distributed, tens of millions of us will hesitate to use them because the President of the United States and his Republican allies have destroyed our trust in our own government. VOTE THEM OUT!"
2020-10-12 18:54:10,"If two different vaccines are each only 50% effective, will taking both give 50% effectiveness, or 75%, or some other number?

Since some of the worst coronavirus effects happen due to the body's overactive immune response, will the immunity from a vaccine also cause immune enhancement when infection attacks?

Will those who take only the first of a two shot series be even a little bit safe?  Or more at risk?  Will a first shot of vaccine A followed by a shot of vaccine B resemble a proper two shot series?  What if A is withdrawn for harmful effects?  Will subsequent attempted vaccination with B be safe?

Every day a small portion of the population develops some sort of medical condition.  Will they attribute the condition to the vaccine if there is a random medical event shortly after a shot?   Worse, what if some of these medical events actually are due to the vaccine?  Phase three trials attempt to decide.  But phase three is being massively abbreviated.  Who will figure this out unless all vaccine recipients are closely followed, phase four, if you will?  Is phase four even being planned?

2020-10-12 19:09:45,"Two questions:
1.  Even if a given vaccine is only partially effective (50 percent or what-have-you), would it serve to reduce the severity of the disease in people who still contract it after receiving the vaccine?

2.  If you get one of the vaccines, would it be safe to also get a second, different vaccine?  Would that provide additional protection?"

When give a person a placebo, you build up their hopes for immunity and possibly encourage risky, possibly fatal, behavior. Why can't you just track the same people you were going to give the placebo to, track them, and use that generated data. In this case you would be comparing prudent behavior (masks, social distancing) with a vaccine.

So how about, better tests, home kits preferably (like he had at ‘his home’), and should you test positive, the magical infusion from Regeneron (to the CEO, please use Amazon prime, they are fantastically fast) to prevent the nasties from entering cells. Followed by Remdesivir, just in case a couple of sneaky viruses manage to get inside cells. Chase all this with Dexamethasone to calm any naughty cytokine storms or allergic reactions to the previous medications. Of course the latter will induce Americans to feel powerful, superior and work ready. Fabulous for our economy. And we can prescribe Zn and antacids to 340 million Americans, to chew daily as a precautionary. To folks researching the two, don’t waste your time and our money, just mail us all happy pills. I’m sure DeJoy will do all he can to deliver the pills first, ballots later. We can absolutely call it the Trump-maneuver, the All American Anti-Covid Insurgency."

The Dems willingness has dropped from 78% to 52%.  Gee...do you think Sen Harris big and ignorant mouth, saying she would not take it if Trump supported it, has anything to do with that drop?    I was in one of the first groups to get the Salk Polio vaccine...I was a young kid in Pittsburgh.  We thank God every day for that vaccine, which came unfortunately a few months after a number of kids in Pittsburgh got the Polio the previous summer.  Sen Harris should be called out for her outrageous statements.  While it's true not everyone will become immune with that vaccine, between 50% and 80% will and that's surely better than 0%.

Let’s hope at a minimum for a vaccine that’s effective enough to only require face-coverings in enclosed public settings (store, hair salon, doctor’s office, mass transit, etc.), and no longer to take a walk in the fresh air outdoors—especially when it’s hot and humid. Or when you want the simple joy of feeling the breeze on your face. A joy I never realized before that I shouldn’t take for granted."

Mr. Trump has proven himself unable to deal straight with the American people. He has lied about the severity of the virus (still does). He has recklessly muzzled the doctors wishing to help us. And he has insulted those of us who have lost family and friends to this incredibly dangerous virus by saying it's nothing to worry about, just like the flu. 

We might not like what we'll hear...but Joe Biden won't mince. He won't play fast and dirty with our lives the way Mr. Trump has by endlessly mocking the use of face masks. Trump's incessant ""gaming"" of every situation he's involved with is not funny when lives are at stake. Biden has integrity. Sadly, Trump has. none."
2020-10-12 18:24:58,"“Chaos and Confusion” vs “We don’t know.” 

The truth is, we don’t know the problems we will have until the Phase 3 trials have been done. Even then, you can’t rule out rare, adverse events from vaccines. But we have 215,000  American reasons (and counting) to try. I’m not sure why framing it as “Chaos and Confusion” is helpful. There is a data and safety monitoring board for all trials. There is a demand for transparency. This is what can be done. Asking for every risk to be elucidated, or pretending a vaccine will work before the data is there (I’m looking at you, Mr President) is foolish. 

There is uncertainty with any new venture in health and science. The first trial “participants” of the first measles vaccine were the scientists who created them. Why? Cause someone had to be first, and they generously took up the cause with their own health because it beat watching kids die of measles every year. The trial participants should be considered heroes—each and every one of them. The scientists working on the vaccines are heroes, too. There are lots of unknowns, but let’s not forget that we are part of the same team—humanity—and can face those unknowns together."
2020-10-12 18:44:52,"I just read a lot of if’s and scary talk but almost no actual data. What if one of the 11 vaccines has 90% effectiveness. There will be data on effectiveness whenever a vaccine is approved. This was just a bunch of worst case scenario scenarios that only make people fear taking a vaccine that’s will pass all the same protocols as every other vaccine. Stating that a vaccine approve should at 50% effectiveness could result in 35% effectiveness is ridiculous. They do statistical analysis of the the data and wouldn’t never have that big of a margin of error. Just cause Trump says something doesn’t mean it’s wrong- a broken clock is right twice a day, we can’t promote fear and act like it’s science."

So why doesn't ANY article ever address what seems to be an obvious question someone may have: 

Will it be safe to take more than one type of vaccine?

After all, say you end up being ""unlucky"" in that you are given one of the less efficacious vaccines out of the gate.  Then a significantly better one becomes available not too long after.  Later that year or whatever.  Are you just stuck and unlucky to have been vaccinated with the poorer vaccine?  Or can you get the better one?   And if so, will there be any concerns about how different vaccines can cross-react in a person, such that taking two different vaccines might be dangerous, or perhaps reduce efficacy of both?

Why the heck don't I ever see this question being asked or even attempted to be answered?

It is time to vote out the con artists running this administration and hope that American society can re-assemble the pieces of this once-great country soon enough to reconstruct something great.   A successful response to covid-19, to climate change, and to much more demands it.  Science is a realm where con artists don't succeed for very long.

With the anti-vax groups on one side and the Trump skeptics (like me) on the other, I fear too few will risk taking even an effective vaccine to significantly bend the curve of infections and death.  

Given that this epidemic has become a political war in the U.S., it might be helpful to get some historical perspective on public health and quarantine measures, as well as health outcomes, in other  community-spreading epidemics beyond the Spanish Flu, e.g., polio and smallpox, Hep-B and seasonal flus.  i.e., What public health measures were taken during the polio epidemics of the 50s? How long did it take to roll out a vaccine?  Was the first one the best?  How did the public react?  And so on.  Understanding the current pandemic in a broader historical context might help more people think rationally and moderate their expectations for and fears of a vaccine for COVID-19.."

I’ve also been more worried about safety, which was not the focus of this article. 

For instance, during the trials, how many women are going to get pregnant and give birth after getting a vaccine?  If the answer is “none”, then how will we know the vaccine doesn’t increase the rate of birth defects?

Where are the scientific studies (not wearing masks vs wearing masks) that demonstrate conclusively that masks work to prevent transmission of the virus?    

The Trump family were criticized for not wearing masks during the presidential debate, despite having being tested negative for the virus.  It is axiomatic that if one does not have the virus then one cannot transmit the virus so that the criticism was not based in science."

I'm referring  to the actual history of vaccines and vaccinations including the old smallpox and polio ones. Leading scientists have indicated numerous times over the decades that all vaccines should have minimum test results periods and even then who knows for sure what can occur in the long run because no individual developer can possibly be expert in all regions of possible body side effects.

It's risky being a guinea pig for new vaccines and I am pretty sure that not too many researchers would want to test them on themselves ?

Covid 19 was likely a  military experimental lab. virus that escaped into the open, even though there is no evidence to support its it is a strong possibility in theory. HUmans are open to mistakes and imperfections and it is after all humans who make the virus's and humans who later try to combat them.

In fact, I will continue to socially distance and wear a mask until the rate of new infections is way less than 1%, and I have been vaccinated recently. 

The other variable here is how long the vaccine is effective for. We cannot know that from any of the current trials, in fact we won't know it until we see lots of people who have been previously vaccinated all of a sudden become infected by the coronavirus after some period of time.

All of this will work itself out over the next several years but it will take time. People who think that once we have a vaccine our troubles are over are probably being unrealistic."
2020-10-12 19:55:13,The biggest mistake of the U.S. has been to abandon the WHO.

2020-10-12 19:58:40,They are still many unknowns. Take the serum antibody tests that most people get. These do not measure neutralizing antibodies but show you were infected. We know that people who were sicker had higher titers. What is unknown is which came first? Did the higher antibody titers occur as a result of severe infection? Or did the higher antibody cause the severe infection? In HIV vaccine trials this is what happened. The higher antibody titers actually made it easier for the virus to enter. Be it may that we have no idea what high routine antibody titers ( against nucleocapsid) do. And even worse we do not know whether they will interfere with vaccine induced antibodies( against spike protein). So how could we just give this vaccine to just everyone? Should we give it to people who recovered from a Covid infection in March? Can we give to someone who had asymptomatic infection? All questions and no answers.

2020-10-12 19:58:51,"Two points regarding vaccine efficacy and vaccination:

1. By next spring, the pandemic may be driven by a new class of Corona virus, mutated from the original one. That could negatively impact those group of vaccines that are designed based on a specific genetic structure (variant) of the virus; and,

2. If we assume that one million individuals could be vaccinated in a single day, after one year only 260 million individuals will be vaccinated, when one accounts for weekends and holidays.  Note that the US population, including guest workers and visitors, is typically around 350 million.

It is noteworthy that, during the first debate, Mr. Trump stated that he intends to deploy the US military to do the vaccination and the plan is to vaccinate 200,000 individuals each day."

We’re likely to have multiple effective vaccines available in the new year - this is a good thing (right?) because there won’t be enough of any one of them for the global population. We used to call this an embarrassment of riches. 

This is due to unprecedented global regulatory and industry cooperation. The majority of vaccines are based on biotech which has been proven to be safe and effective in prior approved vaccines. In response to Trump’s transparent political agenda, the companies behind the leading candidates pledged to adhere to the highest safety, ethical and scientific standards in the clinical trial process. 

Covid-19 will be with us for many years, which will give the opportunity to ruminate over relative advantages and disadvantages of different vaccines. Right now we have pandemic to quench and a global economy to revive."

The battle against the pandemic virus has certainly impacted all aspects of our society, politics, and economy now and for the foreseeable future. More people will die of the virus before vaccines can be certified and administered. Their distribution and use will be chaotic in the land where individualism is prized above common cause and unity.

The dead deserve a monument so that future generations can see how costly this pandemic has been. There is a beautiful monument in New York City to the victims of the 9/11 attacks and an historic monument on the Mall to the fallen of the Vietnam War. The dead of this pandemic far exceed those honored by these monuments. There should be a national monument to all of those among us who have died of this virus – the most devastating sickness to hit us in a century."

For some reason that we can only guess, Trump easily makes false assertions and never cares about whether he risks his own credibility. Intelligent people, even those who eagerly support him unconditionally, do not believe his assertions about fact. In that respect he is never believed to be repeating facts that can be trusted. His supporters see him to be a trustworthy advocate of their best interests who exploits any means to achieve the ends. Everyone else sees a man who is untrustworthy."

Because fewer people are getting screened for cancer. WHY are fewer people getting screened? Some are afraid to go to the doc, but others lost their insurance.

Fewer people getting screened caused a rise in the number of serious instances of cancer. This isn’t rocket science. I found my prostate cancer during a routine test. If I skipped the test, it would have metastasized & maybe killed me.

So, Trump’s failure managing COVID creates another problem. An increase in the number of serious cancer cases.

So it's not clear that even if you have a vaccine, you can get these mortality numbers much lower than they have been for months. Also add the fact that viruses can mutate to become less lethal over time as a selective pressure for their promulgation. I have been asking this for a long time, but what the heck is the goal?

Typical studies like this are +/- 3% or 4%. With 50% efficacy +/- 4%, it is 95% likely that the actual efficacy is between 42% and 58%. The chance of actual efficacy being only 35% would be 1/1000 of 1%. And if a vaccine has 65% efficacy in trial +/- 3%, there is a 95% chance that the actual efficacy is between 59% and 71%. That would not be ""so-so."" And there is almost no chance that the vaccine with 65% efficacy in trial is less efficacious than the one with 50% efficacy.

The author tries to support his slant that the vaccines won't be very good and we won't know which is best, by citing a researcher who expressed concern that people will make decisions based on small efficacy differences. But when researchers say that, they mean, ""inferring a difference between two efficacy rates when those efficacies are within the margin of error of each other (3% or 4%), not when they are separated by 2.5 or 3 times the margin of error.  Given the choice between a vaccine with 50% efficacy and one with 60% efficacy, if the possible side effects are similar and don't pose any extra risk to you with your unique demographic and medical profile, you take the one with 60% efficacy and feel comfortable that you made the objectively better choice."

2020-10-12 20:11:22,"""Demonstrating that a new vaccine was safe and effective in less than a year would shatter the record for speed"".

This statement is often repeated, but is not correct. 

During the 1957 flue pandemic, the microbiologist Maurice Hilleman obtained samples of the virus from a US Navy doctor in Japan (flu in US around May or June). The Public Health Service released the virus cultures to vaccine manufacturers on 12 May 1957, and a vaccine entered trials at Fort Ord on 26 July and Lowry Air Force Base on 29 July. A vaccine, though limited quantity was available by mid October.

During the 1968 flu pandemic, the disease was allowed to spread through the population without restrictions on economic activity, until a vaccine became available four months after it had started.

If a ""novel"" and a ""respiratory"" virus is found, mostly in the past, a vaccine was made available (limited) within four to five months.

It's only for viruses like polio or measles which have been with humans for more than thousand years, that vaccines were are rushed, (it takes more than four to ten years) and it makes sense. But then, they were not ""novel and respiratory"" viruses.

In fact, in 1957, Maurice Hilleman was alarmed by pictures of those affected by the virus in Hong Kong that were published in The New York Times and he rushed to get a vaccine out within four months.

Where is the Maurice Hilleman of our times?

When Trump says that there is a vaccine, I will believe him about as far as I could throw him."
2020-10-12 20:25:01,"Excellent article -- let me add a few points. It is important to understand the different scientific approaches of the various vaccine candidates. The mRNA approach vs. the DNA approach, versus the viral vector approach, etc.
 
Also, one vaccine may be prove to be more effective for older groups, while another vaccine might prove to be more effective for younger persons.

The need for storage at very frigid temperatures before shipping to point of contact/delivery at the various inoculation centers is an important consideration. The various vaccine candidates have different characteristics/requirements in this regard. This is a crucial consideration for effective global distribution and inoculation.   

I am 74 years old and am a participant in one of the Phase 3 trials. I have received my two dosages already and am being monitored through regular blood draws to check for antibodies and T-cells. Being a blind trial, I do not know if I received the vaccine or the placebo. It matters not, however, as I am not changing my behavior in any way -- I continue to observe strict social distancing and I use masks at all times."

Maybe I will wait to get vaccinated until next time I am able to travel overseas, and get a better vaccine at lower cost.

2020-10-12 16:37:35,"The fact of the matter is that when it comes to vaccines, they should not be and historically speaking can not be rushed.  To politicize them is, I believe, immoral.  And when we are speaking of coronaviruses, as Covid-19 is, to date they are known to mutate and even become resistant to what is commonly called the ""flu shot,"" which involves our yearly trek to the clinic for the injection of the season that does not guarantee full immunity.  Couple that with our nation's drug companies.  Let us not fool ourselves: the bottom line is profit.  As unethical as it is, money is more important than our health and is the driving force.  But perhaps, the most worrisome is the FDA - and CDC - under the present spell of a most desperate and himself unethical Donald Trump.  I hope that a vaccine is in the offing, but it is imperative that it is not only effective but also safe and free of debilitating side effects."
2020-10-12 16:56:04,"An important question regarding vaccine efficacy seems to be overlooked in just about every discussion like this. FDA says 50% efficacy, at minimum, will be required for approval. But efficacy against what? Clinical trials may be set up with the endpoint of prevention of death, prevention of hospitalization, prevention of ""serious disease,""  prevention of ""mild disease,"" or even prevention of infection (""sterilizing immunity""). You could end up with an efficacious vaccine that prevents serious illness or death but still results in most people still susceptible to infection and mild illness, leaving open the likelihood of continued widespread infection and transmission. I don't know how all the ongoing trials are set up, but clearly the most valuable vaccine would be one that's efficacious in preventing infection. I hope some reporting will clarify what kind of efficacy will be established by the ongoing trials."

2020-10-12 17:11:50,"As an AIDS advocate, I have long experience with FDA accelerated approval. The key issue is to make sure companies AND the FDA continue to collect data in the form of Adverse Event Reports. An adverse event in the case of a Covid 19 vaccine should be defined by the Agency as both an adverse reaction to the vaccine AND a subsequent Covid 19 infection. That is the only way we the people will have any idea a year from now which vaccine(s) are superior therapeutics. It is essential the FDA insist on reports being filed anytime a person who received a Covid 19 vaccine later tests positive for the virus itself."
2020-10-12 20:27:51,"The key reason why it's almost criminally negligent not to pursue the Master trial approach favored by  Dr. Fauci and many other experts in infectious diseases is that the government, i.e. our tax money, already financed the development of the candidate vaccines, so there is little to no financial risk to the companies involved.  Absent such a true head-to-head comparison, it's basically a guessing game about which vaccine is the one most of us should actually get.  With the Federal government paying for the vaccine development, Trump & Co. caving to the demands of the companies involved is yet another sign of weak and incompetent leadership. Last I looked, the one who pays calls the shots, but apparently not with these guys in charge."
2020-10-12 20:34:39,"Vaccines are a victim of their own success, as some people decreasingly see their need for them.  I still have to educate my clients about the differences between correlation versus causation in regards to their anecdotal evidence of vaccine injury, and the minuscule percentage of getting that.  I guess people are free to ignore and dismiss the too-numerous-to-count professional debunking of flawed and erroneous studies that antivaxxers cling to, religiously.  

I realize that people are free to make poor choices, but it's galling to have them feel no guilt or shame for putting others in harms' way because of their personal choices.  Especially when infection can lead to death, or extended debilitating effects and questionable reimbursement from insurance companies.  I think I'm getting brain fog, and have empathy for the long-haulers...

Those issues need to be addressed before the secondary issue of whether to trust this entirely rushed and political process of producing and distributing a new Covid vaccine, bought by those who seek to enhance their own pocket books.

I am a 72 year old male with pre-existing conditions . Side effects such as stroke or heart attack are deadly as is a vaccine with a success rate of only 50-60%. This would still leave open dying from the disease if contracted. A success rate of 80% or higher would be what senior citizens need. We are going to have parts of the population who make take the initial vaccine and then revaccinate when a better one is out there to increase their chances of protection.

2020-10-12 20:40:12,"Voltaire, the French writer, said, “The best is the enemy of the good.” Confucius said, “Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without.” As discussed in the article, there is clearly a trade-off between getting a good vaccine relatively quickly and the chance for getting a better vaccine in a longer period of time. Too bad that the public health measures here in the US are so weak that 30,000-40,000 are dying from the disease every month. In that sense, this nation pays dearly in blood and treasure for the time awaiting vaccine developments."
2020-10-12 20:47:37,"The fact is this:  If a vaccine that emerges is less that 60-70% real world effective and still requires masks, social distancing, and other guidelines to stay in place, it will be a huge step in further eroding anti-science feelings among many Americans.  The question that will emerge would be ""what's the point of a vaccine if I can't return to a normal life?""   Obviously there are clear scientific explanations for this, but the fact is that nobody has thought about breaking that news to the American people.  It won't be good.  One can hardly disregard those that will take that stance.  They'll have a point....if there is a fix, it should fix.  Otherwise its still the hellscape of a hampered society, culture, and economy that has been with us since March.   This vaccine has to be very effective or else you'll have ruined a generation of American's faith in the power of their country's scientific/medical research establishment and the private enterprises that compliment them.   There is no middle ground on this one.  Its going to be binary, whether the science is binary or not."
2020-10-12 20:52:36,"Apologies.In response to @KR’s question about getting 2 vaccines,I didn't describe how to determine the overall effectiveness of the combo correctly,though the example that I gave did give the correct hypothetical effectiveness of having 2 vaccines,each with 50% effectiveness,with the combination having a theoretical effectiveness of 75%.This is the essence of the original post, corrected:
@KR Short answer:The answer is unknowable.However,making a few assumptions(which actually aren’t valid to make since no one is testing 2 vaccines in the same person),you can get an idea of the likelihood of immunity if you took 2 different vaccines.
Assuming:
1.Both vaccines are harmless
2.Neither vaccine interacts w/the other in a negative way(i.e. decreases effectiveness of the other vaccine)
3.Neither vaccine interacts w/the other in a positive way(i.e. increases the effectiveness other vaccine)
4.Neither vaccine changes YOUR physiology,leading to the other vaccine to cease being harmless,
you can guess at the chance for immunity you would have by getting 2 different vaccinations,mindful that no testing is being done that looks at this scenario.There are lots of assumptions here,and probably more that I haven’t thought of.All that being said,you can guess at the effectiveness of double vaccination by considering the percent of one vaccination’s failure rate that is covered by the 2nd vaccination.Thus,2 vaccines w/effectiveness of 50% would give you a 75% chance of immunity."

2020-10-12 21:08:29,"Presumably, this is what the Biden camp started shouting about in April. Besides the development of a vaccine! other areas need looking at immediately. Who gets the vaccine first and how do they get it. The work for distributing a successful vaccine would require a leader who has a lot of experience moving people, supplies, hardware, accommodation and weapons (such as the military). He was warning in that the “work has to start now” and the admin needs to be coordinating with the different departments whilst their was still time. Bureaucracy is slow even when headed by a competent leader.

Given Trump squandered the time he bought with reducing travel from China and Europe: does it seem likely that the man who also squandered his “heads up” in January/February. He has squandered the time lockdown provided to teach the public about vaccines and their safety, in order to be able to achieve heard immunity cannot be achieved if a large number of AntiVaxxer refused the vaccine. Instead he started a culture war about masks. 

Does this illustrate the type of leader would listen to the advice, even from someone with experience. - sounds to me like the type of man that would declare “MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!”  the moment that vaccine is ready and wash his hands of the bureaucratically difficult work of a vaccines coordination."

We don't live in an ideal world and Pharma is not going to risk money and reputation to please us and we can't force them. I've thought, for quite some time, we'd end up with a ""so-so"" vaccine, maybe 50% effective (meaning 50% failure rate) and mitigation will need to continue for years, especially among us elderly vulnerables.  It should be clear by now that the main enemy is not our political opponents but the corona virus which doesn't distinguish red from blue and is devilishly efficient in infecting and adapting. It took a decade for effective antiviral treatment to be deployed against HIV and still no vaccine. No matter who sits in the White House or 10 Downing Street or Rome we are up against it."

The reality of the situation is that a vaccine approved by FDA after phase 3 trials is going to be reasonably safe and effective, and I for one fully intend to take it once available. I am in the low risk group and won’t be the first but have no problem with it. It may not be the best but so what. This is likely going to be like a flu - you take it every year. So we will get a better one next year. 

The left leaning media should really stop colluding with anti vaxxers. Haven’t they done enough damage yet? Despicable."
2020-10-12 21:05:37,President Trump is right: I refuse to take a vaccine because I am Liberal and agree with the Media when it accuses drug companies of bending to the will of a politicized FDA. Should the vaccine become a cause celibre I have word more viruses are waiting in the wings to torture us. I suggest we wait until Trump is voted out of office to investigate the efficacy of this panacea. Maybe then I can go to CVS and test myself.
2020-10-12 21:19:37,Words can not express how frustrated I am at this administration and the GOP who enabled this mess.
2020-10-12 20:38:47,"@Roberta There is no indication that a ""vaccine"" taken by Ivanka with Fox showing that live can be trusted. How do you know that Ivanka is being given the vaccine and no a little bit of olive oil? I am sure Ivanka will appear live in Fox with some “doctor” giving her the vaccine but… how can we trust that? No way! This administration has lost all credibility."

With this type of attitude we would have never “landed on the moon before this decade is out” what an inspiring statement by President Kennedy. 
Why not give Trump the same inspirational drive for trying to beat the virus. But of course ........."

2020-10-12 21:32:21,"True, but the time to market on this is critical as it allows the start of return to normalcy. This is an unprecedented situation that called for unprecedented actions.

In reality, we should be doing challenge trials with volunteers, but this course has probably been the next best thing.

And yes, could take years to sort out, but in the meantime you WILL get some kind of at least short term immunity for some percentage of the folks that take the vaccine. Every bit helps to flatten the curve."
2020-10-12 21:33:02,"Both my spouse and I are in high risk groups for adverse covid outcomes. Part of my career was educating health care professionals on biohazards and PPE use. We are careful. We have been fortunate.

Vaccines are not my specialty, but if there are several “so-so” vaccines it’s plausible to consider that multiple vaccines could be used to provide the person with overlapping stimuli to antibody production. That would make the difficult logistics of distribution even more daunting. 

However this all turns out, it will not happen soon. Our collective tunnel remains dark and long. Call it a reinvigorated first wave or a second wave. It makes no difference. I sincerely hope winter doesn’t become a perverted parody of a Monty Python movie sketch. In 1348 there really were carts pushed down the roads of Europe to the cry “ bring out your dead.”"
2020-10-12 21:35:01,"First, foremost. The vaccine must be proven safe and ‘highly’ effective in the prevention of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. That is, it must provide clear immunity to the virus. 

Give me the numbers."
2020-10-12 21:36:38,"The race for a Covid vaccine is perhaps not as unprecedented as it might first appear.

Certainly, researchers raced as quick to find means of fighting Ebola and SARs albeit on a more focused, less helter-skelter, basis.

And while the ""normal"" course of vaccine development, testing and approval might be protracted -- it may be that prior procedural requirements can be reasonably shortened as our scientific knowledge and methodologies advance.

My greatest hope is that such a vaccine (or, more likely, vaccines) be initially released under a Biden Administration.

This is simply because we need to rebuild Americans trust in our Federal health agencies.  Trust that has been destroyed by Trump.

I will feel far more confident in trying a vaccine approved by the FDA and CDC under Biden than I will if Trump remains in power."
2020-10-12 20:27:13,"I’m an anti-Trump Democrat, but reading this objectively can’t the NYT ever present something with a reference to our President, including his describing hopes for a working vaccine soon, in a way that doesn’t always portray what he says negatively? —Is it part of your employee hiring processes that it’s forbidden to do so ever? Always doom and gloom—are all your writers and journalists manic-depressives afraid of hinting at positive news or outcomes, or something!?"
2020-10-12 21:38:26,"I am a strong believer in getting vaccinated and Jonas Salk is on my list of some of the greatest Americans ever. I even got a flu shot for the first time in over 30 years because it is critical this year. Previously everyone around me got a flu shot because they knew due to medical treatments I should try to avoid it.

 I took a chance on the flu shot but I will not take a chance on any covid rushed vaccine. I wouldn't encourage anyone to 
get it. On a personal note if it is not done right it could kill me or do severe damage. There is no way I trust this vaccine to be safe for people without underlying conditions and really don't trust it for people like me on immune suppressant therapy for MS.  I'll pass."
2020-10-12 21:40:58,"If your report means that each vaccine is not required to be characterized by its effectiveness (resulting level of immunity and duration of immunity) for each general class of recipient ( children - oh, I forgot, no children will be vaccinated a first, pregnant women - oh, I forgot, no pregnant women will be vaccinated at first), age group, gender group, common co-morbidities, .....), then at least the vaccines will be believed generally to be safe for a few months and that is worth knowing.  But I would like to know more.  Perhaps vaccine vendors should offer a money back guarantee if their vaccines fail to reach specified levels of immunity and duration of immunity."
2020-10-12 21:42:17,"Why explode into little pieces and miniscule detail, all that could go wrong with the new vaccines? How about some praise for the thousands worldwide who have freely volunteered to participate in the research who will take the hit if experimental vaccines do them harm. I have been in healthcare all my worklife and have never seen in those 42 years so many ardent researchers working round the clock, magnificently funded to help humankind in a crisis. I will gladly take an FDA approved vaccine when it is offered. Since I could drink enough water to kill me, I am aware life has its risks. COVID-19 is one I want to avoid."
2020-10-12 21:44:57,"The most significant point of the US government's approach is that vaccines will be approved if they prevent disease, not infection. And prevent disease in at least half of cases, although companies have pledged 80%.

SARS CoV-2 spreads asymptomatically - prior to, or in lieu of, disease formation. A vaccine that dampens disease is great for the vaccinated, but they will still get infected. It does not prevent them transmitting. 

It will take time for people to get vaccinated. That means as vaccinated people move into the world, if they behave as if they are disease free, they'll transmit to others, all of whom can be infected. That will promote infection of people unvaccinated as well, who will suffer disease.

Getting vaccinated must be accompanied by a universal mask mandate"
2020-10-12 21:53:01,"How about the 7   million people who already had COVID-19, will they be getting the vaccine? Could the vaccine have different side effects in these people who were infected before? Is this even being tested in the ongoing vaccine trials? It’s likely that many more people had been infected, perhaps 10-20 million more, will they test everyone for antibodies before giving the vaccine?"
2020-10-12 21:53:37,"Will we be able to have more than 1 vaccine? I found out when I had my flu shot, that if the flu season extended beyond the supposed efficacy of that flu shot, I could get another flu shot. So if I take vaccine A with 50% efficacy, could I later get vaccine B with 90% efficacy? This is all assuming that there will be a lot of vaccines available and accessible over time."

2020-10-12 21:59:05,"Let's assume that a COVID-19 vaccine is considered safe and effective by the FDA and its independent scientific advisory committee and that it is approved late this year or early next. Efficacy is predicted to be similar to the efficacy of our influenza vaccines. That means that 50% of those vaccinated will be protected from infection and 50% will not be protected from infection. We know from polls that only 50% of the population will take the vaccine. That means that 25% of the total population will be protected from infection.  To achieve heard immunity, 60-70% of the population needs to be immune (protected) from infection. With heard immunity, the entire population is at low risk of infection. But, we will not achieve heard immunity. Therefore, masks, hand washing, social distancing, etc. will still be necessary. The vaccine recipients, unless there is a test that is predictive of protection from infection, which currently does not exist will still need to wear masks, hand wash, and social distance, because they will not know whether they are protected. We need realistic expectations for any COVID-19 vaccine."
2020-10-12 21:59:33,"Until total trust and confidence in the FDA, Operation Warp speed and the Federal government has been achieved, just what percentage of the country do you think will take a vaccine?  It could be vaccines that do not appear to be rushed will arouse the most interest."
2020-10-12 22:00:08,"I strongly object to your characterization of a 40% or 50% effective vaccine as so-so.  This is dangerous press in a crisis.  If we lost 220,000 lives to get to 8% immunity (by antibody evidence) then getting to 40% will be a HUGE improvement, maybe we still wear masks and wash hands while the real effectiveness is measured, but yet all businesses could re-open.  It is also dangerous when folks decline a vaccine because of a 1/5000 risk of a side effect, when folks are losing their homes or their health or their lives. Maybe you should put it all into some perspective. Russia and China started vaccinating after phase 2 trials were completed, and maybe they were not so wrong based on risk/benefit considerations. So when the phase 3 trials suggest reasonable efficacy and safety, you better not be lukewarm. Not at 800 deaths per day and huge economic and mental health displacements. See the forest for the trees."
2020-10-12 22:02:23,"At this point, I would consider taking the Indian vaccine (the Oxford one, if it works) before I would consider taking one backed by this administration. 

That’s really saying something. I mean, I love my India & all that but in what seems like another lifetime, it would’ve been unthinkable to take any vaccine over an American one (even one backed by UK/Oxford). 

But since I chose 2020 as the year to finally apply for US Citizenship (after dithering for a decade while being eligible because I couldn’t let go of my “roots”),          I will no longer get any Indian vaccine (as a citizen). 

I’m going to wait to see what the rest of the world comes up with before I take an American one. 

Meanwhile I will mask up, keep my distance & encourage everyone to Vote. Blue."

However, I am livid that due to Trump’s utter incompetence and inability or unwillingness to lead, our country’s pandemic is not just a crisis, it’s a tragedy. Because he has politicized masks and not encouraged personal responsibility as patriotic, people (especially younger ones) are out and about spreading Covid in our community. My life, which has limited years ahead, is on hold due to such self-centeredness and disregard for basic science.  I hope for a safe and highly effective vaccine, not just for me, but especially for all essential workers who are particular risk. We need President Biden to start the hard slog of repairing all the damage done to our nation the last few years, especially since the advent of the pandemic."

I just can’t believe that all the pharmaceutical companies have my best interest in mind when vacuuming billions of dollars, pounds, yen, and yuan from governments across the globe in a headlong rush to produce a now-maybe-yes, now-maybe-sort of, and now-maybe-not vaccine. Research takes time. Rush it, and it will never pan out. All the vaccines on the market go through long, large, well planned trials; what’s not being accounted here is the dead uncertainty of us who will be, seemingly, the test subjects. With so many folks deciding against getting children (and themselves) vaccinated- and often concerned with the ingredients in the vaccine preservatives or carriers rather than the agent itself. I don’t want to have to pick a vaccine (will I get a brochure from Medicare to help?) and then come back later for another brand (how will I find this out? Will Pfizer or Astro-Zeneca keep a contact list for the “oops” doses?). And what happens when the first person becomes sick or God forbid dies from one? When I received a pneumococcal and shingles vaccine I didn’t wonder “if”, I just said, “thank you”."
2020-10-12 21:37:04,"As an academic not shackled by big pharma, this still turns my stomach: talking about why a ""master protocol"" was rejected, the article notes:  ""...these mega-trials pose a business risk for any given vaccine maker because they reveal how a vaccine stacks up against its competitors."" Complete madness! Human collective well-being and survival should not be subject to tests for business risk. Scientists should be working together, without such distractions... perhaps then we could have save the next million from dying. Instead, we have greed driving the agenda. Sickening."
2020-10-12 22:07:22,"The effectiveness of vaccines in these trials is confounded with mask wearing of the subjects. 
A much more effective strategy would be for as many people as possible to wear masks in and social distance in as many situations as possible away from home, both before and after the vaccines are available.
Trump's emphasis on a vaccine and Americans'  laziness have made more Americans forego masks, which is why the virus has been so deadly here."
2020-10-12 22:09:10,"i find it cute that you think we as private citizens will be allowed the courtesy to choose which vaccine we want to take. that’s the way it should be, but that’s not how it works lol. doctors offices, seem to choose to partner with certain manufacturers. corporate doctors offices seem less flexible in that and don’t allow you to request certain brand or manufacturer, even if their is another one available. private practices in my experience seem to have the freedom to be more flexible in that regard. vaccines should be done like pharma meds, where you can choose the one you did your research on."

2020-10-12 22:02:41,"Hilarious. Do most of you understand how little the efficacy of the drugs they hawk on TV have to have vs side effects to pass FDA approval? That’s why all the happy music plays while they recite the side effects!  Most of those drugs pedaled on TV are not for life or death maladies. That’s the difference. Covid can kill you. So, we should allow a vaccine to be administered at a lower efficacy as long as the risk is low from the vaccine itself. Ultimately, we may want to take more than one vaccine. Is that so bad? No. Would our ancestors had that capability. They would have jumped at it. And over time the vaccines will improve! This is the new future, folks. New capabilities that a decade ago would have been impossible. In the meantime, yes, some confusion. But if the tests are done properly, the risk is worth it.

Do we maintain lockdowns in various forms to minimize the risk of COVID, or do we avoid lockdowns as a tool because they are ineffective and cause more harm?
The answer should be non partisan and intellectually honest people should be able to come to a consensus, regardless of political beliefs. But sadly, our opinions seemed to be molded not by reason, but by whichever cable news network we watch."
2020-10-12 22:12:53,There is no good reason not to socialize prescription medications. Make prescription medicine free to all and let the government save medical costs by developing better medicine. We don't need socialized medicine. Rich people can pay for cutting edge advances.
2020-10-12 21:42:40,"First off: the ""Pfizer"" vaccine is not from Pfizer, it's from BioNTech, Mainz, Germany, less than 50 miles from me. They teamed up with Pfizer for mass testing, mass production and mass distribution, that's all.

Secondly: a 35% efficacy will not provide herd immunity in the foreseeable future, especially given the anti-vax movement around the world. So the masks are going to stay, and the climbing rates of infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Oh spiffy!

And then there is the question of immunity. SARS-CoV-2 is - as we all know by now - a relative of the viruses that cause the common cold. There are only four of them, yet we get the cold over and over and over again throughout all of our lives. I am not a doctor or immunologist, but to me that sounds like we're going to have a LOT of immunization shots coming up!

So:

- you'll need a jab every 3-6 month (at what cost?)
- it will not really protect you the way you think
- you will still have to wear masks, social distance etc.
- yet the numbers will rise (because people are stupid)
- the economy will not recover, bars etc. will stay closed
- life will remain miserable until you die (from Covid-19?)

I just wanted you to know...

Oh, and one more thing: Covid-19 will become a political plaything even more, with Fauci being in the middle. He'll probably get sacked soon (after Trump loses the election) and reboot his career as health expert on MSNBC. Good for you, Tony, say ""Hi"" to Rachel from me!"

There is at least as much critical medical reporting and research, all in the public domain, that assert the counterproductive character of these vaccines. They are indeed being rushed, but not for immunization reasons.  When you have both political parties gunning for vaccines; Big Pharma tripping over each other to get to market first; the law academy lobbying for government emergency orders to suppress constitutional rights of objection to these vaccines; and media running a 24/7 public health alarm program, then you should be able to put 2 and 2 together: this is a special interest agenda.

2020-10-12 22:37:24,"I don't understand why injectable i.e., parenterally administered vaccines are still being developed in these modern times. The technology is now available to insert the gene expressing the Covid-19 virus spike protein into a harmless Lactobacilli that, in turn, can be taken orally in the form of a food (yogurt) or as a probiotic pill. As the Lactobacilli take up residence in the intestinal tract, large amounts of the viral spike protein would be produced which then can stimulate the mucosal immune system of the intestinal tract to make virus neutralizing antibody vs the Covid-19 virus. No adjuvant is needed to enhance the antibody response and because the Lactobacilli are likely to take up long term-- if not -- permanent residence in the gut, the resultant antibody response is likely to be long lasting  (no need to reimmunize) and substantial since the mucosal immune system of the gut presents the largest lymphoid immune system in the body. If the vaccine is administered as a probiotic pill, no expensive cold chain or sterilizing apparatus is need. This would greatly reduce manufacturing costs and make such an oral vaccine more available to all."

I agree.

I am teaching a course at a college for seniors whose main goal is helping the students  deal better with the challenges of choosing between a number of new COVID-19 vaccines  and  the decision to vaccinate immediately or whenever.

While preparing this course, I have become aware of both the FDA’s “structured benefit-risk framework” and the ACIP’s “shared clinical decision making” option for specific vaccines.

Both of these projects specifically involve patients in decision making that for the most part has been based on trusting experts.  However, they don’t describe how to train patients to use them.

My major challenge is to get “regular” people who aren’t clinically sophisticated or accomplished in data analysis comfortable in using readily available material from these sources.  The FDA‘s  benefit-risk section in clinical reviews for approved vaccines are posted online and the ACIP recommendations are published in the CDC’s MMWR, also available online.

My course ends on 10 November with a (hopefully) student driven session on vaccine choices that take into account the particular issues of different patient subgroups.

Especially the elderly .

2020-10-12 23:09:40,"Like this entire horrific administration, this sounds like a complete nightmare.   Billions of taxpayer dollars potentially wasted for an vaccine that doesn’t work.   Again, perfect metaphor for Trump.   I will not rush out and get a vaccine, despite usually staying up to date on all my shots.  No trust whatsoever in this process."
2020-10-12 23:23:06,"While every pharma giant is reaching for the brass ring, and every researcher is hoping for a place in the medical history books like Salk or Sabin,  I hope they don't cut too many corners.  I am old enough to remember both Thalidomide and the bad polio vaccine disaster. (40,000 polio cases out of 200,000 children vaccinated.)

As far as early availability: only in a Trump campaign sound bite.  Realistically, I think it will be like Shingrix.  It will be out there all right but it will be hard to get until production meets demand. Particularly, if it is a two-course vaccine.

Just my opinion."
2020-10-12 23:11:18,"Someone at the NYT needs to define the terms of success. Most people are not going to wear masks and walk on glass in perpetuity, and even with vaccines the flu kills up to 50,000 or more per year. What are the terms of success?"
2020-10-12 23:18:02,"The whole theory that a vaccine will be created and we will put this crisis behind us is pure fiction. People want to believe it, politicians want to promote it, but it is so unrealistic and short sighted because we have no actual vaccine that eradicates the common cold, we have no vaccine that eradicates the flu, and we certainly do not have a vaccine that will protect us from HIV.  We will have vaccines like the flu vaccine that may or may not impact the symptoms of CoVid-19.  But it really isn't going anywhere and the belief system that we will create a herd immunity is fairly unlikely since you can become infected, (and I have,) by this virus again within 3 weeks of having it. What they fail to say is that the damage that it does remains, long after you recover. We have read what it does to your brain and organs once they started to be able to do autopsies on the fallen. 
The thing is, we can't have an imbecile in the WH creating a super virus by recommending that his cult ignore the reality of what happens when we provide millions of hosts for an evolving virus. We really have to face this pandemic with rational intelligence and not rely on a quick fix. The biological definition of intelligence is the ability to adapt to ever changing circumstance. We need to create a new normal because this pandemic will pale in comparison to the effects of climate change on our species in the very near future."

2020-10-12 23:28:58,President Trump is – as always – ahead of the curve and is planning to do a massive vaccination via telemedicine.
2020-10-12 23:36:11,"There's a small Swiss biotech company based in Geneva called Relief Therapeutics that has a product called RLF-100 (adviptadil) that has very promising early test results from a 21 critically-ill patient study in a Houston hospital where19 survived,  and is currently in Phase 2/3 study.  Since I am not a Dr. it is difficult for me to explain, but it has something to do with blocking Covid from replicating in the lungs.  They are also working on a inhaler for mild and moderately infected people.  If this therapeutic works as good as the early test showed it could have a great immediate impact compared to a rushed vaccine the public has little confidence, and would take a long time to vaccinate the world.  Just strange not to hear much about this therapeutic?  I only know about it because my friend here told me about it, and I read what little there is about it."
2020-10-12 23:43:08,"The vaccine as a tool for electoral purposes is now defunct. There is not time between now and November 3, 2020 to have any concrete evidence if a vaccine will work or not, even if that vaccine became available tonight in very large quantities. We should all – from all sides of the political spectrum – let science do the work and come up with best solution to this problem."
2020-10-12 23:44:51,"Yes, we could wait for the best possible vaccine, but the article glosses over 1000 people per day in the US and likely 10+ times that many worldwide dyind every day.  I'll take a vaccine 100 days sooner and have about a million fewer deaths while waiting for the best vaccine.   Also the Warp Speed project considered ability to scale up and delivery logistics, which may prove more important than vaccine effectiveness.   Would you rather have a worldwide supply of a billion doses of a 50% effective vaccine, or 20 million doses of an 80% effective vaccine?   Overall shoddy article, and similar doom and gloom vaccine articles appear about once a week...I wonder why."

Personally, I think we may see the wide spread use/emergence of therapeutics. I think we're all going to be wearing masks for a while [greatly improved and more protective masks, I might add]"
2020-10-12 23:50:44,"Do we need an iffy vaccine?  

According to the CDC excess deaths graph the country is below the epidemic level as of Sept 29th.  Some parts of the country are not yet there, but they soon will be.  NYC has been below the epidemic level for months but NY State is now seeing a second wave of deaths due to the decrease in seasonal humidity, which is the primary cyclical driver of viral infections and deaths.  

There's also the Cure Trump got.  It wasn't all that much either, just a few cheap vitamins and minerals (vitamin D, zinc, melatonin), an antacid, and an aspirin (plus two experimentals) and he was good to go.  The dexamethasone was probably not necessary.

Why can't we all have that?  It works well and is cheap and is 100% safe.  essentially he got the best practices C19 treatment protocol developed by the Frontline Critical Care doctors group here: flccc,net.  It was not the full monty but good enough.  Dr. Varon in Houston uses it and has a 99% success rate - regardless of age or comorbidities. This protocol had been shared with the White House on four occasions.

Since the Virus is finally going away per the CDC numbers, and now is far less deadly with 80% of cases asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, and we have the 99% successful treatment protocol, which is no big deal - anyone can do most of it themselves with the ingredients available on Amazon, why are we still thinking about an unnecessary vaccine.  Are we that concerned with Pharma profits?"
2020-10-12 23:32:18,Most people don't even need a vaccine. If you're healthy and under 60 this virus is little danger to you.
2020-10-12 23:52:02,"Mr. Zimmer is blanking on the larger scientific point. First versions of vaccines are seldom the best. But the difference between 40% and 90% ""effective"" does not mean what most people, apparently including Mr. Zimmer, think, because the inverse of effective is not ineffective.

Let's imagine a seasonal flu vaccine is 60% ""effective."" Translated, that means that the 60% are sufficiently protected that they experience few if any clinical signs or symptoms when exposed. But the other 40% are not unprotected. They'll get sick, but not as badly as they might have. This amelioration is well established.

Your mileage may vary, but as a member of a high risk group, I'd rather be partly protected as soon as possible to being perfectly protected in a year or two. Any trained epidemiologist will argue a version of this: Better to gain partial control over attack rate now."
2020-10-12 23:57:42,Masks have definitely no side effects and do have almost the same effect as an early stage of the vaccine. Who would select the vaccine?
2020-10-12 23:56:08,"Fundamentally stupid as both a policy and technical matter. Better, all companies should share knowledge and results, all should be compensated for much of their financial risk, and there should be profit-sharing with the losers -- so that the winners aren't exponentially compensated for their success, and to discourage them from compromising their efforts. Further, healthcare workers should be the last to obtain a half-way proven vaccine; they are the most indispensable personnel until a vaccine is completely proven, and even more indispensable should the initial vaccine fail or induce side-effects or reoccurrences -- which it could in various ways well into the future. Enough time must be taken to test a broad number of subjects, not separated simply by factors like age or pre-existing conditions. An obese American (42%) with a diet largely of sugar, wheat, dairy and grease will likely test differently than someone from Vietnam (one COVID-19 death before July 31, 2020) whose diet is based largely on rice, juice, tea, vegetables  (mostly steamed rather than fried) and fish -- even thought the percentage of those asymptomatic could blur the results. So still more testing time may be required. The multiplicity of test subgroups compounded by the potential for resurgent infections, the virus morphing into something worse, bi-generational side-effects (think: Thalidomide) and other variables warrant a longer testing period and more discipline and abstention -- not the reverse."
2020-10-13 00:00:00,"Why would word your title with doom and gloom like that, we need hope to get thru this long and arduous time. Maybe it’s because all you want is money and you don’t care."

This is not an opinion, this is mathematical probability. The Manhattan Project, directed by Robert Oppenheimer, invited hundreds of scientists to participate. And the most prepared, with the highest I.Q. level discussed in conference rooms the findings, the corrective actions, and the manufacturing processes of the Atomic bomb, and they won the race against the Nazis. As a result of the pandemic, there are many empty square feet in many buildings in the Manhattan island. A fast decision should be made.

Will these vaccines cause different defensive reactions from the novel coronavirus? Will each one cause a DIFFERENT mutation of the original virus? Will our virus fighters all over the world end up developing a geometrically increasing set of new vaccines to combat a geometrically increasing number of virus variants? And then there is Fauci's most recent warning, namely, that if a vaccine is 70% effective and only 60% fo the U.S. public gets vaccinated, we are not going to be getting that close to herd immunity any time soon. Face masks for a decade. Social distancing for a decade. And could the anti-vaxxers so sabotage the world of the immunologists that we NEVER get to herd immunity. We've got to get ourselves ""ridin' with Biden"" for sure. Joe and Kamala have the brains and the courage and the heart to take this scourge on properly. They and the Never Trump GOPers and the Dems with real brains are the only hope we have. The Trump GOPers and the Billionaires Club of cabinet members and influencers aren't worth a darn.

There are going to be more unknown unknowns than there are known knowns until the most effective vaccines with the fewest side effects become apparent.

Further, the US does not have the organization, processes or will to do tracing of positive cases.  It appears the US is in a similar situation in the development of a vaccine with a flawed process that promotes less than optimal solutions.

NZ has a Covid-19 Vaccine Strategy Task Force, who are currently negotiating with other pharmaceutical companies and further announcements are expected in November.
1.5 million vaccines from Pfizer and BioNTech is the first signed contract in a portfolio approach to have sufficient vaccines for the whole population in New Zealand and there's also $67 million in a special fund so all kiwis get the vaccine for free. 
For the flu vaccine this year all elderly and health vulnerable people were given first priority for the flu injection and that's free also. I had the flu injection and a pneumonia injection."
2020-10-13 04:28:55,"We don't have private health insurance in NZ as we have a government run and paid for health system. You do get the option to take out private health insurance if you want another option. In New Zealand, over winter we only had 6 cases of the flu hospitalized over winter. Unknown in NZ to have so few with the flu and it's because our government had a strategy to get rid of the virus, lock down our borders, and make 14 days compulsory quarantine for all inbound travellers. So it just shows you it is international travel that brings all the viruses into your nation. Government had lots of adds on TV about simple, basic hygiene and what to do.  Some good things have come out of this border lockdown as the hospitals aren't overcrowded in winter and it will cost the government less money for sickness."
2020-10-13 04:35:09,"If I were Joe citizen in the USA I'd be keeping an eye on what vaccines our New Zealand government signs contracts for, as they're up with what are the best ones. Our government was the first country in the world, to negotiate a free trade agreement with China, and our government is on the ball even though as a nation we are but a dot on the ocean. Do a web search for the New Zealand Vaccine Strategy Task Force and make sure you get one of those brands. Anything else will be inferior."
2020-10-13 10:11:49,"Thanks for your article. True there is no on/off switch that will make the pandemic go away. However, there are advancements in science and technology that will and can speed up the process of coming up with a safe and effective vaccine compared with the vaccines of the past. Your article presents  several scenarios but there is also the scenario where most of the first vaccines rolling out will be over 70% effective and safe something that is probable. I choose to be cautiously optimistic and await  for a progressive and speedy recovery around the world.

2020-10-13 11:07:22,"Something important to clarify is the definition of ""effectiveness.""  The relevant outcome here is death or serious illness, not a laboratory test for infection.  So a meaningful evaluation of a vaccine would involve a study population large enough to see many COVID hospitalizations in the placebo group. This would likely require a very big study, closer to the Salk polio vaccine trials than to a normal drug trial. A large study also facilitates detection of bad side effects, which could help to avoid the sort of deadly debacle that happened with the rushed Swine Flu vaccine of 1976. Are the planned studies big enough and are they looking at relevant outcomes and delayed side effects?"
2020-10-13 11:40:20,"Not a doctor, epidemiologist or public health official. Maybe someone can explain to me how it is we have over one million deaths worldwide, 6000 yesterday alone, and yet as fast as Operation Warp Speed trials are progressing, it's still a slog compared to human challenge trials, which as I understand could be completed and determinative in a matter of weeks. Are we in a war or aren't we? In war, people are handed a gun and sent out to battle and many don't make it home. It's horrific but it's a sad fact of life. Some lives may be lost in a human challenge trial (although given the level of observation and medical care that would be provided, chances are it would be few) but thousands around the world, young and old and in various states in health, have already volunteered to participate. I've been told that human challenge trials are ""immoral"". Really? What's more immoral, allowing these self-sacrificing volunteers the opportunity to help their fellow man in a truly noble way, or putzing around awaiting for inconclusive results of Phase 3 trials and bringing about the confusion detailed in this NYT article, while thousands more die on each passing day?"
2020-10-13 12:12:35,Very interesting predicament...the kind of thing that is difficult for setting the best course and isn't necessarily helped by the financial self interest of the most prosperous companies nor short term electoral considerations. If find the efficacy target of 50% pretty low. It seems to me it should be set much higher at the start and only lowered after some delay suggesting the higher level is not apt to be achieved in the near term. This seems especially desirable given the adverse impact that the first approved vaccine is apt to have on the development of others.
2020-10-13 12:36:01,"Am I the only one concerned about how decisions are made about which group gets which vaccine?  Sounds like there is room here for racial, economic, and other discrimination....the CDC has already demonstrated that it is not immune to political pressure from this administration. Finally, the fractured nature of our response to this pandemic is also very concerning.  At this point we have a variety of tests which have varying accuracy and now it sounds like we will have a variety of vaccines with varying efficacy.  How does someone navigate what is best for themselves and their family under these circumstances?  It sounds like yet again many Americans will be left vulnerable."
2020-10-13 06:23:12,Patience is a so called virtue. The vaccine will come and as long as the drug companies are honest with us they will let us know it's safe. I trust Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson but therr are others also.

An experimental vaccine already known to have severe and dangerous side effects, given to newborns, pregnant mothers, small children and the elderly does not bode well for the country.

This issue I have with COVID vaccines is that all, and I do mean all, of the approving agencies have demonstrated that they are willing to bend the rules and even the science to please Trump.  That in turn, means we are trusting Trump to tell us if the vaccines are safe and effective.  I am not willing to do that.  I believe I will wait until near the end of 2021 before signing up to get a vaccine.  Things should hopefully be clearer by then, and the unsafe vaccines pulled from the market.  Yes, given the push, I think a dangerous vaccine will get through the system."

But, the FDA has a PMA process for vaccines that must be met.  It requires 3 phases across a broad range of people - different genders, races, ethnicities, etc.  While it is not possible to test all situations and human health conditions during the PMA process, it is incumbent upon the scientists and manufacturers to do the most thorough testing possible.

The reason why a Pell Grant only covers 25% of tuition cost today while it covered 50% during the 1980's is not that the Pell grants were not increased with inflation.  It is that the cost of attending college grew at three times the rate of inflation during that time period.

When college populations grew because of increasing population and increasing proportions of students enrolling, in any rational system, the cost per student would have declined.

Instead, overhead and administrative costs, rather than becoming a smaller share of college budgets, exploded, as the number of administrative employees increased and the compensation rates grew in excess of inflation.  It's not that states are contributing less per capita to public universities, it's that there are no financial controls.

If you think about it, the cost of low tech items like copier and toilet paper are 25% of what they were during the 1980's.  High tech items like computers are 1% of what they cost during the 1980's.  So why does a community college spend twice per capita what it spent 40 years ago?

This is true for dropouts in general, and not necessarily a socio-economic issue, because the mindset has changed. One truly has to strive, persist and reach for it in order to make it happen.

I hear the pain of these young people. I used to work three part time jobs back then in order to pay for my college tuition, room and board. I didn't take on loans or ask my parents for a dime (since I knew they wouldn't have the money for me anyways). I had to defer going to college, work for a few years first to save up before I could even get started. And I didn't have to deal with a pandemics like covid. 

I hope these young people will persevere. Sometimes, life throws us curveballs, and we'll just have to deal with it when it comes. Hang in there."

Promoting reason, facts and the operations of  science should include lots of learning and this viral invasion is the good place to start.

2020-10-12 16:45:38,"In a December 2015 Republican debate, moderator Hugh Hewitt asked Trump about the “nuclear triad” of delivering nuclear weapons (bombers, submarines, and intercontinental ballistic missiles). Trump clearly had no idea what the triad was. This was his reply:

""We have to be extremely vigilant and extremely careful when it comes to nuclear. Nuclear changes the whole ballgame. ... The biggest problem we have is nuclear — nuclear proliferation and having some maniac, having some madman go out and get a nuclear weapon. That's in my opinion, that is the single biggest problem that our country faces right now.""

It is a chilling thought that five years later Trump is that ""madman"" and he doesn't have to go out and get one having the nuclear codes at his dangerous disposal. Without a doubt one has to believe that it is inconceivable to think that the highest levels in the military echelon would give this ignorant, unstable, erratic and desperate autocratic the unilateral power to make the awesome decision of unleashing a nuclear warhead whether by land, air or sea, in his words the ""likes of which the world has never seen."" They are not ""madmen"" and understand there would never be a world as we know it to be after unthinkable destruction and massive annihilation of millions. The bluster of

His very severe personality disorder was a known fact long ago regardless of the fact that he apparently has not been formerly diagnosed by a psychiatrist, that we know of.  Nevertheless medical professionals have sounded the alarm again and again.  What is wrong with a nation that would put itself at risk from a barely functional president?  Yet the Republicans in Congress refused to acknowledge Trump’s serious handicap(s) thereby putting our entire nation at risk.  It’s perfectly clear that he’s more deranged at the present than ever before.  I’d say we’ve just been lucky he hasn’t acted on the nuclear codes, .... so far."

I saw this headline four days ago ""Trump: Bring Troops Home So They’re Fresh to Fight China, Russia, or North Korea.""  Fox News. 10/8/2020.  I became very concerned about the direction of the president's thinking, which I think is exacerbated by the drugs he has taken.

Mr. Trump is said to be the first person to have received the three drugs he did for his Covid-19. To me, that means nobody knows what the side effects are. Nor do they know when they will occur.
Mr. Trump said that he is no longer taking Dexamethasone. This is a drug that cannot be stopped cold. The dose must be tapered down to avoid side effects. If he had tapered down, he would still be taking it. I think he stopped it cold. Medlineplus.gov says, ""Stopping the drug abruptly can cause loss of appetite, upset stomach, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, headache, fever, joint and muscle pain, peeling skin, and weight loss.""

This is clearly a safety step designed to prevent one man from coming to work in the morning in a mood to ""end it all"", and being in any way physically able to do so.

In 2017, at the United Nations, 122 countries agreed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The treaty now has 46 of the 50 ratifications required for entry into force, which is expected by the end of the year. 

The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons won the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize for its role in facilitating the Treaty, which lays out a sensible pathway for multilateral disarmament worldwide. To survive, we must eliminate these militarily obsolete weapons of mass extinction before they eliminate us. 

Trump with the nuclear codes is terrifying. Trump on steroids is worse. But this danger is with us every minute of every day no matter who is president. Accidents happen, miscommunication happens, technology fails.

It's been 75 years of this unthinkable nightmare. The nine nuclear nations must join the rest of the planet and work together to swiftly dismantle every one of the 14,000 nuclear weapons still pointed at you, and me, and our irreplaceable world. See NuclearBan.US or ICANW.org for more.
