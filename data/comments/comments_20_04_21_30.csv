2020-04-30 18:33,"Bottom line, there will be many experimental trials of many different existing drugs as researchers seek effective treatments beyond just using ventilators once the lungs have already been compromised. 

As the reading public.. we need to be patient, and not get hopes up or buy in to early hype from the wild man in the white house. 

It will be months before the trials run enough to actually locate a small handful of drugs that actually consistently help a COVID patient with severe symptoms."
2020-05-01 2:41,"The amazing thing that goes unstated in this article is that they were able to enroll all those patients in a rigorous scientific trial so quickly, given the horrendous conditions in US hospitals reeling from the effects of the virus."
2020-04-30 14:51,Tears streaming as I read this.  Beneath the economic carnage and the political fights are hundreds of thousands of heartrending stories like this one.  Go Jim!  Go Kim!  Thank you health care workers.  Here's to love in the face of death.
2020-04-30 15:07,"Amazing, terrifying, hopeful, miraculous. The video of the caregivers is remarkable in no small part to show how many were involved in saving this one man’s life. They are truly heroes. 
One element that was only briefly touched on is how early in the pandemic this occurred. If he had been stricken as more cases poured in and overwhelmed the hospitals he may not have been able to receive as focused a response from so many. When his wife was able to visit (which would not be permitted these days) when he was at his worst she noted the emptiness of the hospital- this would soon not be the case for many places. I have little doubt her visit was a mitigating factor in his recovery, and tragically so many are now having to do without that support. 
I am very happy for the family- I wish them all joy as they recover together, intact."
2020-04-30 15:19,"I needed this. Love and gratitude to the entire Bello family and all the doctors, nurses, and other caregivers. You are heroes all."
2020-04-30 15:20,I’m floored.  What a journey.  So happy this family made it though.
2020-04-30 15:56,"A heroic story indeed and bravo to MGH's staff for being so dedicated and showing us the very best that our healthcare system is capable of, even under the immense pressure of this pandemic. But as I read of the care and efforts on Mr. Bello's behalf, I can't help but think about the grave economic disparities in our healthcare system where a patient on Medicaid in one of our public hospitals (Boston City, Bellevue, Elmhurst, SUNY Downstate) could not hope to access this kind of sustained care, despite the dedication and everyday heroism of those hospitals' staffs. Mr. Bello was fortunate to be on the privileged side of the economic divide that is devastating so many families in our country. It shouldn't have to be this way and I hope this pandemic will bring about the deep structural healthcare reforms we so desperately need."
2020-04-30 15:57,This was a an amazing and emotional story. I am so glad for this man and his family. But I want to understand how and why he got so sick? Does anyone have a theory? And how and why did he recover? Are they studying his case for future use? Was it for sure coronavirus or something else? How did his family escape contamination?
2020-04-30 17:07,A beautiful and uplifting story - thank you for sharing the journey with all of us.
2020-04-30 15:34,"Emotionally gut wrenching!  Reading this account of the journey of this patient, his wife, family and health care providers left me in tears.  This virus is not to be underestimated on the toll it can take on everyone. 

I was relieved at the end for their success in overcoming this challenge and disheartened with the thought of all those impacted by this illness."
2020-04-30 16:05,"What an excellent piece of writing!! Great job, New York Times!!"
2020-04-30 14:42,Stories like this make me proud to be a NYT subscriber.  Thanks for publishing this.
2020-04-30 16:57,Wow! What an incredible piece. I’m moved by the incredible perseverance of the medical team and staff at Mass General. Here’s to moving forward to the Bello family ♥️and wishing them all well!
2020-04-30 17:06,I am crying as I read this. I am so happy for them.
2020-04-30 18:17,"Two recent op-ed pieces in the Times recommend widespread use of an inexpensive little device that could have caught Mr. Bello's declining lung function over the six crucial days between his acquiring a high fever, and being admitted to hospital with imminent lung failure. Had the decline in his lung efficiency been caught sooner, Mr. Bello could have been treated with less invasive procedures than hooking him up to a ventilator or life-support system.

Available to the public from their local pharmacy and requiring no training to use, a $25 fingertip pulse oximeter measures blood oxygen level, an indicator of the lungs' functionality. Just clip it to a fingertip and in a couple of seconds the number will flash. FDA approved for sport use, inexpensive oximeters are able to track blood oxygen values with sufficient accuracy and consistency to inform the symptom-free patient that they are experiencing early pulmonary failure.

If a COVID sufferer waits until he or she is gasping for breath before going to hospital, emergency staff usually have no choice but to use a ventilator. Even when successful, ventilator treatment can result in damage to the lungs and other organs. When caught earlier, respiratory distress can be treated with an oxygen mask, body positioning, and medications, resulting in restored blood oxygen levels without trauma.

Because COVID can sneak up without symptoms, every person over 50 should, daily, check their temperature and their blood oxygen level."
2020-04-30 18:31,"Wonderful that Mr. Bello survived, but heartbreaking for those souls who died in overwhelmed emergency rooms without eight people to turn them over.  As I read the story, I thought disparity in care was going to be the point. Let's hope Mr. Bello will leverage his million-dollar home, and his family's ski house, to help others who do not have a Mass General in their back yard."
2020-04-30 18:33,This story gives me hope.  Thank you to the amazing medical team at Mass General!  Heros all of them!
2020-04-30 18:41,Congratulations to Mr. Bello and his family and to the team at Mass General that saved his life.  Wonderful story.  So grateful for the happy ending to this case.
2020-04-30 18:45,My heat goes out to all of those who have lost or are losing a loved one. Please keep yourself well and rested. This was an amazing story. Enjoy your new life!
2020-04-30 19:11,"An amazing story with a happy ending.

Wondering why he was initially given a statin (and then taken off it when the statin was affecting his liver)?  Was it because he was already taking a statin and the hospital was continuing a treatment of a pre-existing condition or is there a protocol to give a statin in treating the coronavirus?"
2020-04-30 19:20,"Very emotional story for me, it must have been rollercoaster for them. He looks a very young 49 year old - we've discovered that genetics play a big role in how serious symptoms are. Estimates are as much as 50% is due to genetics. This virus is like Russian roulette."
2020-04-30 20:15,"A beautiful, emotional story. I am so thankful it had a happy ending! Thank you to all the healthcare workers, your tireless support, especially emotional support, is awe inspiring."
2020-04-30 20:21,Just incredible. I am in tears and that applause from the doctors is something he deserves. Thanks for sharing this.
2020-04-30 20:42,"An amazing story about human resilience — on the part of Mr. Bello, his family and the staff of MGH. And this tremendous effort was to save a single life. We should never lose sight that there are hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of such life and death struggles continuing/beginning at this moment. Hopefully the Times, with the permission of the Bello family, can keep us updated on Mr. Bello’s recovery efforts. Best wishes for a swift return to good health. And a large tip of the hat to the staff at MGH for their dedication."
2020-04-30 20:52,What an amazing story. It left me in tears and admiration for the medical staff that allowed him to survive. It is the medical staffs at so many hospitals who are the heroes of this terrible pandemic. So glad that Mr. Bello is now home with his family.
2020-04-30 21:13,"Thank you for this moving story. I hope everyone involved is blessed for the rest of their lives...the hospital staff and the Bellos and all others who helped. 

Amidst all this terrible news, the human spirit amazes."
2020-04-30 20:15,"This moved me to tears. So happy for him and his family.
The important question, though -- something that Pam Belluck and the Times should absolutely address -- would someone with less economic privilege have survived this? Would they have received even a fraction of this attention and care? Would they have access to the same doctors? The same 8-person team flipping them over? Would their spouse have been granted a 3-hour visit?"
2020-04-30 19:48,"And people wonder why they should shelter at home? This is why.  What this man went through - and he is fit, healthy, not old.  And he survived by some miracle? Please stay home people.  Do you want this? Do you want your family to go through this too?"
2020-04-30 15:26,So glad for him and his family. But the great mystery of why seemingly healthy adults can fail against the virus needs immediate investigation and answers why.
2020-04-30 23:19,"So very happy and grateful to the medical staff and Mr. Bello's wife and children for keeping him alive! Wishing him a full and speedy recovery! Looking at the light in his eyes and smile from his soul in the final photo gives us joy. i'm so happy this family will get to stay intact.
For far too many, we haven't been able to achieve the same outcome and i sincerely hope that we can change that..."
2020-05-01 0:00,Best practices and interventions at MGH and a great story.  But what about the stories on patients in hospitals less well  equipped to t provide this level of care?
2020-05-01 0:50,"Amazing story.  As I was reading this, I thought he was going to die.  I am very happy for his family.  

One of the moving parts was how the wife spoke to him for three hours at his bedside."
2020-05-01 0:40,"When you see that guy being wheeled down the hospital corridor--

--a corridor lined with those incredible people, our health professionals--our doctors--our nurses--our lab technician--the janitors and cleaning crews--EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING--

--that puts his or her life on the line to serve and to save Mr. Bello for his family and for us--

--when you see those things and those people--

--your eyes fill with tears.  God bless every one of those people!  Mr. Bello himself.  His wife.  His children. His loved ones.  And oh yes--

--thank YOU, Lord.  Thank you for grace and mercy at such a time as this.  

Bring us through all this, Lord.  I'm on my knees.  Bring us through it.  

Thank You, Lord. 

Thank You."
2020-04-30 21:50,"Cried through the whole article.
Amazing."
2020-04-30 23:00,"Oh, for a Mass General within both geographical and economical reach for everyone. Bless all involved in this case -- medical professionals, family, and the NYT. And dare I say -- faith?"
2020-04-30 23:26,"You can't write these stories anymore.

And, of course, you must.

I can't handle this anymore.

I have no more emotion to give.

My mother is 93 and is about to be tested for Covid-19. 

17 residents in her long-term facility have been isolated, 4 dead and multiple staff have been quarantined. 

None of my family can visit her. 

My Dad passed away 24 years ago.

This is the 2nd worst feeling I can imagine.

The worst should be obvious."
2020-05-01 0:18,"We know what can be done when age, comprehensive insurance is married to a strong will to live if the curve is flattened enough to accommodate people like this. In fact of course there is not general availability of such care. And thus this fairy tale ending is just salt in the wound of the ordinary citizen who may be lucky to get a ventilator let alone ECMO."
2020-05-01 1:24,Articles like this are essentially meaningless.  There is always some 'randomness' about recovery and survival.  One story is just click-bait.
2020-05-01 2:15,And when people ask me why my husband and I stay in eastern Massachusetts and brave the winters I simply say look no further than the quality and availability of healthcare.  Bravo to the caregivers at MGH.
2020-05-01 2:45,"A very well-written, moving story that shows what love and intelligence can accomplish.  So happy for Mr. Bello and his family."
2020-05-01 2:50,"The medical team taking care of Mr. Bello were truly amazing and didn't give up.  It is wonderful to see him back with his family at last.  

This is a must read for those who want to do away with social distancing and listening to the scientists about the severity of this virus."
2020-04-30 19:57,"Lucky, or unlucky, because of his genetic soup depends on your perspective. A bit of both I suppose. Still, he's literally one in several million. The overwhelming majority of people are in no real danger from this virus. The real danger is economic. Reopen now!"
2020-04-27 15:21,"I'm afraid that listing these additional symptoms will only add more stress on the medical system and the public then what already exists as they are symptoms similar to many other less severe illnesses. 
I realize that the CDC is not suggesting that if you have any of these new symptoms that you call your doctor to request Convid-19 testing. but human nature does not always follow logic. What was the purpose of adding these new symptoms? This is just another indication of how disjointed the national response to this pandemic is and this comes on the heals of many states reopening with Trump's blessings. I suggest that the CDC not release any anecdotal data that hasn't gone through significant verification and wait until there has been a full study of this virus and a medical report released."
2020-04-27 15:16,Well that just about covers evening
2020-04-27 15:36,When are they going to add the symptoms of Lysol consumption.
2020-04-27 15:40,"With each mutated form not only the lethality and symptoms of coronavirus have changed but the understanding of disease and the preventive guidelines and treatment protocols too have changed until the vaccine is developed as the ultimate cure. This is how science evolves through various stages of experiments, revisions, and trials. This should be a lesson for Trump who jumps to the instant and magic cures without thinking the fatal consequences on lives. Again, with aggressive human forays inrto the wilds, the humanity will have to live with the zoonotic diseases like the Covid-19 as a new normal."
2020-04-27 15:42,"I have had loss of taste and smell.. No other symptoms.  It did occur after a sinus infection.  Slowly returning.

Did I have Covid19?  Do I have it?

No testing is available because I do not have respiratory issues and have not received to ____________.

The government should have spent some money on wide spread testing kits.. that work.. instead of bailouts for Shake Shack, Ruth Chris Steak House, start up companies, Trump companies, and farmers who have no incentive to harvest crops because they are getting bailout billions.  Food banks and the needy could have used that food they plowed under."
2020-04-27 15:43,"With the exception of loss of sense of taste and/or sense of smell, these are all pretty non-specific symptoms.  I am hearing a number of people saying that they experienced one or more of these in late January and they are wondering if they have been among the ""mild"" cases of COVID 19.  Yet another reason to get the anti-body testing program up and running."
2020-04-27 15:55,My question would be whether there's a symptom or couple of symptoms that ALWAYS indicate that a call to my GP is necessary.   Shortness of breath and/or raised body temperature are on the top of my list.
2020-04-27 16:09,Not to mention some with gastrointestinal symptoms nausea. Has anyone else experienced those symptoms? Early on I heard of more than one case.
2020-04-27 16:26,"CDC is behind the curve on this one. Anyone who reads the news has heard of the ""new"" symptoms over a period of weeks. 

This is the first mention I read about a fever that waxes and wanes, though. I am now nearly convinced that my child had Covid 19 back in December. The on/off toggling fever drove us insane trying to manage. I have never seen anything like it before."
2020-04-27 16:26,Does that mean the virus is changing?
2020-04-27 16:41,"Another symptom is a positive test result.  However, testing is so rare that this symptom almost never presents itself."
2020-04-27 17:02,"A distinction needs to be made between ""symptoms"" and ""signs"" as the latter term is misused in this title. Symptoms are issues perceived by the patient, whereas signs are abnormalities observed by the medical professional."
2020-04-27 17:11,"Accurately describing symptoms is important in its own right. I am sure the CDC is doing its best. The job is all the more difficult because our knowledge of how the virus works is growing.

What concerns me are stories in this paper and elsewhere of 1) people going to the ER with many of these symptoms and being sent home, 2) people going to the ER with shortness of breath, being admitted, but then rapidly deteriorating. Seeking help too early or too late?

Without adequate testing, we’re highly dependent on accurately interpreting symptoms. Health care professionals are good at this skill, but they’re much better when backed by testing. Laymen (like me) are not as good at interpreting symptoms.

Given our situation, the story today, tomorrow, and every day is TESTING."
2020-04-27 17:18,i do believe most have known of these symptoms since the beginning.    what is new here.  have i missed something?
2020-04-27 16:54,"tl;dr version:  You could experience this, that or the other thing, or any of six other things, unless you don't.  If you turn blue, call a doctor."
2020-04-27 17:04,"I am skeptical of COVID 19. I did some research about COVID 19 code classification. Here is the extracts from the WHO website and their guideline: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
An emergency ICD-10 code of ‘U07.2 COVID-19, virus not identified’ is assigned to a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 where laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available.

Both U07.1 and U07.2 may be used for mortality coding as cause of death. See the International guidelines for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death following the link below.

In ICD-11, the code for the confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 is RA01.0 and the code for the clinical diagnosis (suspected or probable) of COVID-19 is RA01.1.”
____________________________________________________

Am I understanding this correctly? Is this science or science fiction?

CV 19 code is assigned when ‘virus not identified?’

CV 19 code assigned to patients when the lab test is 'inconclusive' or 'not available?'

CV 19 code assigned to patients when 'clinical diagnosis suspected or probable'?

How many of our healthcare system classify it based on these guidelines?

2020-04-27 16:27,Add: Atrial fibrillation + fever + a very weird tightness in the chest that is not like angina.
2020-04-27 16:49,"This is exactly why we need rapid, widespread testing capacity that is deployable to medics & homes. 

It’s impossible for every healthcare worker, teacher & parent to know the myriad constellation of symptoms that can present with this disease as they are still becoming known. I just read this morning that in a small number of pediatric cases, it’s believed the disease can present as similar to Kawasaki disease, so again it’s just not reasonable to think that every nurse or doctor can keep up with all these symptoms with an incredibly complex virus. Accurate, fast testing will be the best tool we can put in the war chest. ￼￼￼￼"
2020-04-27 16:56,"Yes, let’s promote even more panic. Now, the question is… Is there a symptom that is not related to COVID-19."
2020-04-27 17:10,"What about GI symptoms? I’ve read numerous stories of people who also had nausea, vomiting and diarrhea...."
2020-04-27 17:26,"As the ""official"" list grows, it becomes less specific and so much broader that virtually anyone feeling ill is a possible COVID sufferer.  It was once reassuring that if you did not have a DRY cough, a significant fever, or shortness of breath, you were OK.  Now, almost every cold, flu, or muscle pain in suspect.  It's enough to make everyone of us psychosomatic."
2020-04-27 17:30,"Interesting how everyone I know has read that Washington Post article reporting significant incidence of stroke and clot among young COVID-positive patients. Stroke as a COVID symptom has headlined the Medscape daily newsletter for most of a week. But the Times has not reported this significant finding, and apparently the CDC also hasn't caught on.

A friend died of what appears to be a sudden stroke following shortness of breath that came on suddenly 2 weeks after he was diagnosed with COVID, treated, and essentially recovered. 

Much of this year's higher death rates that cannot be explained by known COVID patients might be explained by all the cardiac arrests, fatal clots and strokes in undiagnosed COVID patients for whom the is the first [serious] symptom."
2020-04-27 17:49,"The C.D.C seems to be saying if you feel a little ""off"" you might have Covid-19. Given that nearly 90% of the people receiving scarce Covid-19 tests are found to be negative this kind of vague information will further deplete scarce resources while increasing generalized anxiety among a lot people."
2020-04-27 18:01,"I'm a Manhattanite -- I had fever, chills, and cough from Jan 30-Feb 11, with fever/chills being more prominent in the first 3 days and cough being the lasting feature through the end of it.  I had gotten the flu shot  in October. I thought at the time it was a strange cold--strange because I'd never gotten chills with a cold, and also because of the notable lack of the usual nasal congestion and runny nose. I also thought at the time it would be impossible for me to have Coronavirus since at that point, it was only being discussed as an issue for international travelers since no one yet knew it was already with us. Of course now I've been wondering for weeks if I had Covid19.

I'm waiting to see if any of the antibody testing is deemed more sensitive and specific before going out to get tested.  I hope all labs, private or public, that will be conducting the testing are going to be participating in some kind of (anonymized) data submission to public health/epidemiology authorities.  We could get a better model of how early and widely Covid-19 may have spread if these labs are also collecting data on any history of relevant symptoms and tying them to antibody results."
2020-04-27 18:27,"Testing, testing, testing.  Especially with most of the symptoms being so general, we need more testing to tell who has it and who doesn't.  You shouldn't have to be at death's door to get tested.  We could do so much better isolation with enough testing."
2020-04-27 18:31,"My son and I and my husband both had these exact symptoms for about 6 weeks. My mother with dementia, lived with us and had a weird fevers and felt awful with headaches for all of November and December until, yelling at trump on tv she had a massive hemorrhagic stroke and died in my arms. Then we all got sick- all January and February- since both my son and I had organ transplants we got tested for SARS Cov-v2 in mid March. All negative.
Weird."
2020-04-27 18:32,"I had a weird gastrointestinal episode for a week in early January. Self-medicated. I’d had the flu and shingles vaccines at the VA the previous fall. I’d love to get tested and see if I have the antibody because perhaps donating my blood could help in research or even directly to other people. Unfortunately, I’m not a celebrity. Well, maybe to my cats, twice a day,"
2020-04-27 18:15,So ... ummmm ... flu symptoms? This is silly.
2020-04-27 18:38,"So basically the symptoms now resemble every other common type of infection associated with a cold, allergies and the flu.

Another reason we need ready access to testing."
2020-04-27 19:11,"In January 2020 before we fully knew what was happening with this virus, I came down with what I thought was a terrible cold but with symptoms I thought were odd for a cold or even the flu. I was wiped out for 2 to 3 weeks.  Then, I thought I was having a heart attack with trouble breathing and chest compression.  I ended up in the ER and had multiple tests which did not show a heart attack.  At that time, virus testing was not discussed.  I may have had the virus and to think I exposed my family to that possibility makes me angry.  To look back and hear Trump dissing the virus as a hoax and to think of lives that could have been saved is so deeply disturbing."
2020-04-27 18:39,"I am surprised GI problems aren't included. Diarrhea, vomiting, stomach ache seem to crop up frequently in CV-19 diaries."
2020-04-27 19:27,"From the end of February until mid March I had a bizarre sore throat and no other symptoms (except one day I had the worst headache of my life).   I was very concerned that this would progress into something else, but it never did.  I know that in mid March a few co-workers were diagnosed with COVID-19.   I have never had a sore throat that was not a result of having a cold.  Just wondering if this was COVID-19.   My mother, who lives with me, got the same things a few days later and experienced pain in her eyes....we both are better  How does one get the the antibody test???"
2020-04-27 19:59,"This is why comprehensive testing is so important. Covid symptoms are basically all of the same symptoms of seasonal allergies, GI upset, cancer, sinus infection, strep throat, etc.

There’s not a single symptom of Covid that isn’t shared with at least a dozen other conditions or infections. Assuming everyone has Covid isn’t going to work because they can’t quarantine everyone.

We need comprehensive national testing, and we need it yesterday."
2020-04-27 20:36,"Considering that every symptom of COVID-19 is shared by other illnesses, sometimes many, why bother.  Just tell everyone if they feel like they have a bad cold get tested and be prepared to hunker down for several weeks."
2020-04-27 20:47,Covid 19 has the characteristics of multiple viruses with enhanced transmissibility wrapped up in one combo.  Are we sure this is not a Frankenstein?
2020-04-27 20:56,"I recall that a couple weeks ago, I woke up with a terrible sore throat, accompanied by a malaise, unusual for me. The sore throat lasted days & the first couple  of days, I felt bad enough to stay in bed. 

After about a week the sore throat went away, & I've had no more problems.  But I do recall that in Dec when I was hospitalized for an illness, I agreed to a flu shot, which I ordinarilly skip.  I wonder if this has helped me fight off a nasty virus?"
2020-04-27 21:33,"Part of trump's strategy in making testing difficult is to get people to resign themselves to the inevitability of getting sick, and just carrying on.  Trump does not want us to have clarity, to have the ability to experience a handful of the symptom, get a test, and take action based on the results. Trump wants us to feel disarmed and drift into this scary new world with a sense of  ""Who can say?""  In reality, science-based responses to symptoms would allow us to manage this new world we live in that harbors a new disease. 
If trump can get everyone to say, ""I don't test. It's God's hands if I get covid or not,"" then we are less likely to fire him in November."
2020-04-27 21:39,"I'm a physician. My wife came home after exposure to her parents with confirmed covid-19 (not known at the time of her return). 5 days after exposure, I developed fever, chest tightness, significant shortness of breath going up stairs, loss of taste and smell. My wife tested positive and my result came back negative (obviously a false negative). It took 12 days to get results. I'm not considered an actual case despite what I told the providers in charge of the testing and reporting. Despite our best plans, we are at the mercy of a mediocre health system to say the least. Thank god for the heroes in our ICU's! They have done the heavy lifting while others whine about having to stay home for a while for everyone's safety."
2020-04-27 21:42,"The CDC has not fared well against the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Is it possible for the CDC to consider that the CDC website for testing Influenza encourages gathering nasal discharges, and discourages a quick nasal swab.

Since many Universities and clinics lack the nasal swab,

could the CDC chief test the improved accuracy of testing nasal secretions gathered on a glove or drawn up in a pipet?"
2020-04-27 21:53,"Given the expanding range of symptoms it seems to be impossible to diagnose C19 on the basis of a patient history.

And many persons infected are asymptomatic anyway.

Which makes population wide testing essential."
2020-04-27 22:08,"It is high time that CDC caught up with other European countries in their list of symptoms. The range of symptoms is greater but this is an improvement. Doctors who simply go down a checklist are not intelligent doctors. Not every COVID patient has a cough and not every COVID patient has much of a fever. 

I would add that heaviness/constriction of the lungs is a very common symptom as well."
2020-04-27 22:09,"SInce recent studies show that there is significant transmission of the coronavirus by people who are not displaying any symptoms, not having any symptoms should be added to the list of possible symptoms of coronavirus.

The bottom line:  EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE TESTED"
2020-04-27 22:26,"I lost a dear friend last week to Covid-19. Her only symptoms were a moderate fever and extreme fatigue. No coughing, shortness of breath, chills, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, nothing. She was gone in a week. 

We absolutely must have testing widely available along with regular routine screening in place for everyone or else we will continue to cycle through this disease - and its effects on our/world’s economy. While I am hopeful for a vaccine, I am pessimistic we can develop one. We have never been able to develop a vaccine for other corona viruses such as Ebola, MERS or SARS. Further, there is currently no evidence that people develop resistance or immunity to the virus even if they have recovered from an infection. 

We are not going back to the way life was before January 2020.  By most measures, we have failed to contain the virus and it is now firmly entrenched in human populations around the world. This pandemic has revealed deep flaws in our government, our health care system and in ourselves. As grim as it seems now, this pandemic is offering us an opportunity to examine our culture and economy and to re-envision our future. We should take it."
2020-04-27 22:30,"This reminds me of that old ad for a Tequila that says ""Anything can happen.""  You might have no symptoms, you might have one or more of symptoms that go with other infections as well, and you might suffer respiratory failure and die. Or you might just endure your symptoms for a week and get better.

Meanwhile, you can give it to everyone else before you even know you have it.

This thing is either going to run rampant and infect the entire population, or the medical/science industry is going to develop a hard stop. Given its stealth nature, social distancing can only slow it down."
2020-04-27 22:42,"Seems a little late in the game for the CDC to put this out. Anyone who has experienced Covid-19 knows about these very common symptoms. 

My husband and I started with these symptoms at the end of February. It has been a slow, horrific ride that only now (8 weeks later) can we say that we are mostly better. Our doctor has been great and fought to get us tested. It was surreal to have Trump and his minions going on about how anybody who wanted to get tested could when the reality was far from that. As for the rest of the American health care system, we lost all faith in it. And the blame goes to the top, not the workers who had no leadership or guidance on how to keep themselves or us patients safe. It took a long time for safety measures to be put in place. By then, a lot of people had been exposed by that carelessness, ignorance and lack of leadership. We have friends and family in other countries who got better, safer and faster care  with their Covid-19 experience so we know that there were better ways to handle this. 

Now, when will the CDC also acknowledge that full recovery often takes a bit longer than 2-6 weeks?"
2020-04-27 19:46,what about blood in sputum?
2020-04-27 22:29,Why is the CDC always weeks behind the common knowledge of the populace.  None of these new symptoms ring as breaking news to anyone (and who isn't) paying attention.  The CDC should be showing us the way not following the NY POST.
2020-04-27 21:00,"For a week at Christmas, I had a constant fever of 101.5, major headache and the worst sore throat ever - like a blow torch was pointed at the back of my throat pain - only ice cold frozen drinks brought any relief. I'd cry if I had to swallow - awful! It went away but I'd like to test if it was the phantom Covid-19. God bless all  health workers!"
2020-04-27 23:19,"I have had a fever on and off for two weeks. I run extremely low, I'm usually a 97.5 or so, and my fevers have been between 99.1-99.6. Too low for a doctor to consider it a fever, but it's a fever for me. I've had muscle aches, headaches, and shortness of breath here and there, but I also have anxiety, so the shortness of breath could maybe be explained that way. I don't know. It feels like the asthma attacks I had when I was a kid, though, it feels different than panic attacks. 

Still, after a week and a half and a few days of random periods of feeling like I couldn't breathe, I got a rapid test done. It was self-administered, didn't go to the back of my nose. It came up negative, but now I wonder. I've never had a virus with a fever that comes and goes like this, and it's been two weeks of this now. I'm worried I was a false negative, but I also don't want to take up any more resources if it's nothing. It's a weird line to walk."
2020-04-28 0:18,"I had it a few weeks ago. Thought it was a cold at first, because it was just a sore throat and cough. Then after a couple of days, just when I thought it was improving, I lost my sense of smell completely and started getting evening chills and fever. These lasted for nine days, prompting me to communicate with my doctor. The weird thing was that it would vacillate between feeling fine and then feeling like complete garbage, day by day. And I never really had any of these other symptoms; it seemed to be entirely upper respiratory. And now about three weeks later my sense of smell is finally nearing 100% again. I was worried about my live-in girlfriend getting it, since she has asthma and would be more at-risk, but her only symptom was about two weeks of anosmia! It never developed into anything else. 

We are healthy and in our 30s, but still...it’s odd how differently it seems to affect people."
2020-04-28 0:29,"Why is the CDC only adding these symptoms now, six weeks after they had been reported.  

Why is the CDC again so late to the fight?"
2020-04-28 1:39,"The world, but particularly the USA, is drawn to prediction- obsessed, if you will, with anticipating outcomes.  Incorrect predictions are not incredible or astounding.  Polls for politics, the stock market and pandemics."
2020-04-28 2:02,"On March 8th, I had nausea, sore throat, muscle pain. I also felt real bad, “fatigued” if you will, for about 24 hours. The sore throat and muscle pain lasted about 48 hours. After that, all was well. My 6 year old son, wife, and both my parents also had cough, nausea, sore throat, felt bad within a week on both sides of me (my son was first). I would love an antibody test for all of us to know if this was covid19. Here’s the thing: When i get sick, i always get a sore throat, but this is the first time i can remember when i got a sore throat and it didnt turn into a cold. Also, i can count the number of times i have had muscle pain on one hand, and those times were associated with Flu or something that hit me harder and longer."
2020-04-28 2:16,"Such a widespread range of possible ""symptoms"".

All this simply points out again that the only way we'll know is with widespread testing.

Not the measly 2% that the Trumpets claim is now their goal.  Particularly since half of that will be ""used up"" catering to the GOP's usual 1 percenters.

Half of the symptoms almost mimic hay fever.  And with Springtime upon us now many folk will wonder: ""What if?""

We need widespread, readily available testing."
2020-04-28 3:24,"There needs to be some kind of random sample testing. All the testing done so far is severely skewed due to sample selection bias, since scarcity of tests leads providers to test only the most obvious cases. We therefore have no idea what the general virus prevalence is, nor do we know the incidence rates of any of the symptoms. 

So far, my local medical personnel have been using fever as a necessary condition to even refer individuals for testing, which leads them to test only feverish individuals, which leads them to conclude that all Covid patients have fever in a self-fulfilling testing loop."
2020-04-28 3:43,"I’d had chills, fever and headaches, most severely in Feb/March, but since it was still flu season and I had no throat or respiratory issues I assumed it wasn’t Covid-19. Symptoms also returned briefly at times, coinciding with grocery deliveries.

Now, with antibody tests (however unreliable) suggesting that many more people have been exposed to the virus than previously thought, I wonder whether I am among them.

Testing, whether for infection or antibodies, needs to be reliable and widely available. Even though I work for a major hospital, supplies remain limited and thus restricted to patients and personnel who care for them.

And it should be obvious by now that all precautions, such as face masks (and face shields for those who can and need them most), should be taken, even though they do not guarantee full safety either.  Nor do antibodies necessarily confer short or long-term immunity.

If the virus can survive on air particles, as some studies suggest but haven’t proven, it may explain some of the community transmission with no traceable contacts back to Italy or China. 6 ft distancing wouldn’t suffice; how, I wonder, did Mr Bello, who finally came out of his near-death ordeal after hiking in the White Mts, get infected ?

A vaccine can’t come soon enough, and this assumes it would be effective vs various mutations of the virus."
2020-04-27 23:48,This is the information the public needs to make a decision for itself. Only a free and vigorous press will supply it. Every US county should report death stats to the public.
2020-04-27 23:54,"Why would the CDV publish additional possible symptoms without providing specificity? What kinds of muscle pain? Sharp pain, dull pain, shooting pain, intermittent pain ...? It's like reading a Trump campaign speech: Terrific pain, perfect pain, winning pain ..."
2020-04-28 1:49,"I collect Department of Public Health statistics for CV 19. I have a checklist that I go over with patients recovering from CV-19. The list asks for Fever, muscle pain, sore throat, headaches, diarrhea, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste and smell. 

Data can only reflect the questions you ask, though patients will report additional symptoms if I ask them, anything else? For example, dizziness gets mentioned quite a bit. And nausea. They aren't on the list, YET."
2020-04-28 2:00,"It sure would be helpful if there were tests readily available to determine whether one has, or has had, Covid-19. Such a basic requirement for dealing with this pandemic, and being able to make informed decisions that affect millions of people's lives and livelihoods, you would think a competent government would have this in hand.

Ahhh, but there's the rub! What we have is an incompetent government led by the Incompetent-In-Chief. No wonder we're suffering far greater than countries with less resources. 

Not knowing if you've been infected is part of the ceaseless stress of this crisis. We shouldn't have to read a list of possible symptoms and try to diagnose ourselves! Is this best that the ""best medical system in the world"" can do? I hope people are finally waking up to the great fraud that's been perpetrated on them with the for-profit healthcare model we've been saddled with. We sure aren't getting our money's worth!"
2020-04-28 3:01,"I saw this same headline last night in a local paper and read to see the ""new"" symptoms.  I had to check the date of the article a few times because I thought we all already knew these almost 2 months ago."
2020-04-27 23:24,"We must all start wearing mask in public because asymptomatic carriers are among us; you or I might be one of them. Several countries have been wearing mask from the beginning, like the Czech Republic. They are keeping the virus count low along with social distancing. We must start thinking outside the box."
2020-04-27 22:27,"That the CDC is just updating its website to include these symptoms reveals the agency's sclerotic and outdated nature.  It would be wonderful if our federal health agencies stopped being revovlving doors for pharmaceutical executives and pass throughs for new drugs and medical devices.  When will we catch up with countries like Japan who take side effects seriously and check with each other - posting the latest agreed-upon advice, symptoms, side effects, and warnings?"
2020-04-27 22:44,"It appears then, that every symptom in their original list is no longer considered to be a symptom and that every symptom now included in the list was not in the original list.  We have all been monitoring the wrong things for over a month.  Add this to the problems with the performance of the original testing kits they issued that were recalled.  It seems that the CDC has gotten pretty sloppy under the Trump presidency.  People are dying because of this bumbling."
2020-04-27 19:27,"From the end of February until mid March I had a bizarre sore throat and no other symptoms (except one day I had the worst headache of my life).   I was very concerned that this would progress into something else, but it never did.  I know that in mid March a few co-workers were diagnosed with COVID-19.   I have never had a sore throat that was not a result of having a cold.  Just wondering if this was COVID-19.   My mother, who lives with me, got the same things a few days later and experienced pain in her eyes....we both are better  How does one get the the antibody test???"
2020-04-27 21:10,"About a month ago I had a week of headache, diarrhea,  fatigue and loss of smell/taste. Is there any way to tell if I had covid then? 

One of my housemates had the same symptoms.  The other two seem fine. They're curious as well"
2020-04-28 7:04,"Since I would like this info if I were feeling ill, here is my experience (untested in NJ bc symptoms not severe enough and until a few days ago when I began to feel better I wasn't really sure that I had the virus but now I think I did or still do, recovering) ...

Never had a cough or sore throat but it began 3 wks ago with an uncomfortable burning sensation high up in my nasal passages that lasted for several hours after which I went to sleep. The next day I was extremely weak and nauseated and constantly warm, becoming hot and flushed if I moved or talked too much, and then cold, taking my clothes off and on constantly for several days. My symptoms waxed and waned the next two weeks with the heat and chills being a constant, not much eating. The scariest thing for me which finally lifted a few days ago was the effect on my brain if you will (brain fog or whatever one wants to call it). I did not feel like myself at all after awhile and sort of lost my desire to keep going, as terrible as that sounds. My normal thought processes seemed to change. I was truly despairing. I know it had this effect on me because a few days ago this dreadful malaise or whatever lifted as I began to feel better - I no longer felt weak - and I became myself again. I was overjoyed and grateful. I'm still a bit warm but that's nothing. I dread becoming reinfected.

This is so much more than a cold or the flu. I think it's true that what we don't know is greater than what we do.

Be safe."
2020-04-28 8:02,"This list of symptoms could be applied to the seasonal flu as well as other ""common"" illnesses. This adds to the confusion over this virus. With the lack of adequate, readily available testing, reading these articles only makes people question whether they have or had the virus but we will be unable to know for sure unless they get very sick, or if they come from a privileged class--like professional athletes--who are able to get tested. 
We really need widespread, accurate testing to determine what the actual death rate is; it is possible that millions of people have ""had"" this virus and even developed antibodies while being asymptomatic or having only mild symptoms. If we hope to end this unsustainable ""Lockdown"" we need to fix this testing mess. Fixing the mess starts with the mess in the White House."
2020-04-28 10:25,"More available testing would clear this up
and we would not have to guess.
We need more available testing."
2020-04-28 13:21,I would add severe fatigue and weakness.
2020-04-28 13:35,"Finally, I see some mention of making clinical diagnoses.

I get the need for widespread testing to track and contain the disease - totally on board with that.

But, the practice of waiting for full-blown symptoms to appear to justify testing, and withholding diagnosis and treatment is insanity. People with clear cases of COVID are getting waved off because they're still upright and speaking. By the time COVID is undeniably obvious, a person is 2-3 days away from a ventilator. Why burn a test at that point?

At the very least, people with suspected cases should be given pulse oximeters to monitor their oxygen and told to quarantine."
2020-04-28 12:58,"They should add pulse ox readings consistently below a certain level.  Other developed countries recognize this harbinger of Covid 19, just feeling as if you can breathe means nothing if your body is compensating; you need to know your bodies real oxygen level. 

I guess the White House the FDA and HHS are infighting over this also.  What a cluster, protect yourself."
2020-04-27 23:16,"Today Trump added another worthy quote with which history will recount how he dealt with the COVID-19 crisis:

2013 Trump: ""Leadership: Whatever happens, you're responsible. If it doesn't happen, you're responsible.""
2016 Trump: ""I alone can fix it.""
March 13, 2020 Trump: ""No, I don't accept any responsibility at all.""
April 27, 2020 Trump: “There has been so much unnecessary death in this country. It could have been stopped and it could have been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems, decided not to do it that way.”

And from January 2017: ""Fauci: ‘No doubt’ Trump will face surprise infectious disease outbreak""

2020-04-28 12:37,All information that Europe was telling us from the get go.
2020-04-28 2:01,"I find interesting the accounts of people commenting here who really felt they may have have COVID long before the first ""diagnosed"" case in the U.S. And my brother related an interesting account to me; in November, he and his wife were departing Ft. Lauderdale. They noticed an unusually large number of Chinese at the airport that day and they were ALL wearing facemasks. He recalled saying something to his wife along the lines of ""Do all these people know something we don't?"""
2020-04-28 3:39,"Also red blotchy toes or feet.

By the time you turn blue it's a little late to begin seeking help."
2020-04-28 3:17,Amazing that after two million people have been infected that they have just noticed these symptoms.
2020-04-28 13:06,"Weird that conjunctivitis is not included. 

Evidence suggests that average people should be wearing clear plastic goggles in addition to masks.

So many people who have covid have conjunctivitis. Also scientists finds that covid 19 is still lurking for weeks in the eyes of patients who have seemingly otherwise fully recovered. 

People need to also know about the silent pneumonia from covid. It's a killer. Everyone should have an oximeter.

We are still learning about covid and it is also seemingly morphing. Symptoms are changing from the cases in Wuhan.

According to my sister, a doctor working in the ICU in a Long Island hospital, the CDC is incredibly slow to act. They do not give complete or accurate information. 

For example, the CDC could have saved  thousands of lives if they had told citizens to wear masks earlier in the outbreak. By the time they suggested masks, the outbreak was far wider than it would have been.

Most importantly, in order to open, in order to move forward, we need massive TESTING for the virus and for the anti-bodies. 

Testing, testing, testing. And in many cases re-testing after false negatives, which are very common.

Trump is responsible for the lack of testing. He has the states in competition for funds and testing. The numbers are far higher than reported. 

It's absolutely outrageous and tragic that we have a man in the white house who is killing us with his poor leadership and mismanagement of this crisis. He must not be re-elected!"
2020-04-28 14:49,"Last week in the Times there was an Op-ed piece about silent hypoxia--low oxygen levels in Covid19 patients. The article recommended that ""All patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus should have pulse oximetry monitoring for two weeks, the period during which Covid pneumonia typically develops."" Why is this not mentioned by the CDC? As the Trump administration destroyed the CDC like he has so many departments under the guise of ""draining the swamp?"""
2020-04-28 14:50,"Three weeks ago I had unexplained fatigue, like the one you get when you're going to come down with a bad cold. Then then next day I completely lost my sense of smell (full on anosmia). And that was it. No cold, no fever or cough, no nasal congestion or any nasal symptoms whatsoever, no allergies, no sinus infection. Nothing that could explain it, even though it lasted 2 weeks. To this day ny sense of smell is at 40% of what it was but slowly improving.

According to several studies <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200413132809.htm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200413132809.htm</a>, losing ones sense of smell without an explanation and without any other symptoms, is a clear indication of COVID-19.

Good news is that most of the cases that start with anosmia are very mild."
2020-04-28 15:11,"The addition of chills to the list gave me pause. About a month ago, I developed a sudden onset of crushing headache and violent chills that lasted through the night. It's not an unknown experience for me. I routinely develop rigors when experiencing an infection, but who knows? No loss of taste or smell, though, so maybe it was just a bug. Still, it made me think."
2020-04-28 16:22,"Did anyone have a rash?  All of February I was exhausted. I teach art PT and I did not have the strength to take the art supplies out of my cabinet. Fatigue, muscle weakness,  strange mushy stool texture for a month, but  no temperature, no chills, no changes taste or smell. I slept almost upright in the recliner to alleviate the sinus/ head/ eye  pressure. The  mild, vey itchy rash was mid February and lasted about 3 weeks. By the time we hit lock down, I was feeling ecstatically  well  and energetic again.  I have close friends that tested positive. Two were well again in 2 weeks. One is at 5 weeks and still has breathing distress. No one that I know had a rash. Did I have  COVID?"
2020-04-28 16:51,"So many of these symptoms are just sequelae of a fever., headache, body ache, chills even rigors. The loss of taste and smell maybe not but who really has any taste buds with congestion and cough. Diarrhea, no clue, except our GI system is often in a state of flux."
2020-04-28 17:40,"Along with the common symptoms, Covid-19 produced one uncommon symptom in me—the feeling that my body had been sunburned all over. It felt as if my skin had been removed and then replaced wrong, making movement very painful. I know of three other occurrences of this symptom in confirmed cases of C19. 

Other symptoms I experienced included dry cough, shortness of breath, fever, body aches, headaches, nausea with dry heaves, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, diminished sense of smell, vivid and unusual dreams, the feeling that my ears were stuffed with cotton. The cough and low-grade fevers persisted a couple of weeks after other symptoms subsided. Also, these symptoms came in waves, not all at once. It was like having a series of different diseases one after the other."
2020-04-28 15:16,"My sister who lives in Turin Italy has lost her sense of taste and smell after some weeks of sore throats and fever and a cough. She would have been laughed at if she asked for a test with those symptoms, and anyway she could not have gone to a hospital since they were so overwhelmed with “really sick” people. 
Who knows how many people she infected before the stay home order! 
I think the lack of testing is and was a real problem early on. It would have prevented the spread!
And who knows how many of us have been exposed by people who had no symptoms but were carriers. TESTING, TESTING, TESTING is a must  from now on! Isn’t prevention half the battle?"

That aside, it appears to me that we need a better method of classifying the stages or degrees of illness so we can communicate better than saying, ""Really sick"" or ""Terribly ill"", or ""early stages"".  Since the day of progression in the illness may have an impact on the efficacy of the drug, a common language seems necessary."
2020-04-22 12:07,"The VA study, retrospective design, suggests that  meddling in therapeutics by Trump can be dangerous.  He has fallen into the alluring trap of anecdote, a sin we as physicians are trained to avoid.  Properly conducted prospective, randomized trials are the gold standard which inform us that a drug is:  not effective, not inferior or clearly superior in managing illness.  The important caveat is that a harmful drug should be abandoned out of hand. This is one of the cornerstones of contemporary evidence based medicine.  Let's remember that every drug can have devastating complications.  Acetaminophen (Tylenol brand name), for example is the most common cause of acute liver failure in our country.  Best to leave the therapeutic recommendations to the real professionals."
2020-04-22 12:13,"I have read that the VA study was indeed controlled.  The death rate for the control group was 11%; that for the hydroxychloroquine alone group was 30%; for the hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin was 22%. That last figure is not statistically significant because of the size of the group.
The study has not been peer-reviewed yet because it was released early."
2020-04-22 12:44,"I have QT Interval Prolongation. This means that azithromycin is one of many antibiotics that should not be prescribed or administered to me. Yet it was administered three time by IV infusion during hospitalization for bilateral bacterial pneumonia, Sept. 12-14, 2017, in Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, ER and medical floor 9 West. This was my second bout of pneumonia in 15 months. (I'm immune-compromised because of asplenia, age, and hematological conditions.)

From what I read afterwards in a non-medically authored article, the MDs and RNs were betting the odds that I would survive. In effect, they were gaming the percentages of a possible harm - a fatal arrhythmia - against a possible benefit - my survival. The benefit won the throw of the dice  ... both times. I don't want a 3d try.

I keep a list of drugs, including antibiotics, that shouldn't be taken by patients with QT Interval Prolongation. I use a publicly available database called ""Credible Meds"" to check each new drug I'm prescribed.

The Internet has made me a smarter patient. And, I don't believe a word that ""Dr."" Trump says. He always has some financial or political interest - or both - in anything he touts. Let's take his license away in November for politico-medical malpractice."
2020-04-22 12:54,"Because there now exists no proven therapeutic drug that works directly on SARS2-COV19(the virus), physicians have desperately tried to experiment in clinical settings on treatment, including off label use of drugs) to try to ameliorate COVID-19 ( the disease). Clinical results are uncontrolled and difficult to interpret. Bu it has been clear for years that Hydroxychloroquinone and its analogues exacerbate and or case dangerous heart problems leading to death. It should not be used cavalierly and the actions of President Trump may have however inadvertently resulted in the needless death of many."
2020-04-22 12:57,"It is unforgivable for a layperson, be it a president or anyone else, to foist his or her personal feelings or beliefs about a medical treatment. Trump should have been heavily criticized by physicians everywhere for this blatant over-reach. And to think that the taxpayers paid for 28 million doses of hydroxychloroquine is unfathomable when healthcare frontline people are without PPE.  This is negligence, malpractice on the part of Trump & his administration.  
As to hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, the studies I have reviewed have all been sloppily done. But with that said, there is no obvious conclusion as to efficacy that can be made.  In contrast, drugs like Remdesivir, either alone or in combination with tocilizumab (Actemra®)  or sarilumab (Kevzara) look promising. And favipiravir (Avigan®) also alone or in combination with the above IL-6 antagonists look favorable.  Convalescent plasma should also be included as looking promising.  These should all be fast-tracked regarding coordination of clinical trials.  Answers should have been obtained by now if physicians were in global communication & working together."
2020-04-22 12:14,"I’d start packing Dr. Fauci. With the exception of those who think he is the return of Jesus, most of us have learned that wisdom and experience don’t last long on Pennsylvania Avenue (or Mar A Lago, or wherever his impulsive thoughts originate). You are a hero, sir, and I’m a 36 year asymptomatic HIV positive man thanks to you and the thousands of scientists who, over time, found many effective treatments that turned it from a death sentence to a chronic illness. It wasn’t easy with arguments, drug trial failures and even activists fighting the scientists. But it got done. I would highly doubt that you have ever come up against the degree of incompetence in government you are faced with now. I will always listen to you, and I trust your word.

The data from the CDC shows that almost zero fatalities for ages  under 24, and close to zero fatalities for people under 55 with now underlying conditions.

The models are being revised down,  the Florida Governor is Vilified,  the  California Governor is ignored, even though they have managed the virus.   Yet the Governor of NY, Michigan - with carnage in their cities  - are extolled as they closed the parks (Taiwan study - 0 transmission) and kept the public transit open (2nd highest for transmission). 

Up is down, right is left. I have no belief in anything that is being reported by NY media - these are infected people, but still allowed to go for walks with no masks (nee Cuomo, Stephanopolis).  

The media has sunk to Trump s level of hypocrisy and irrelevance."

The better to bolster his chances in November.  The death of one who experimented following his cue didn‘t seem to matter.  It was all fake news.  Trump doesn‘t hide his hand.  The ones truly responsible are the sycophants who surround  him.  The Senate Republicans who ignored the evidence to remove him from office and who continue to follow his lead are as much to blame for the crisis we are in.  Even Pence, with perhaps his eye on the Presidency,  shows some signs that he would have handled the crisis differently.  So we all suffer, some the ultimate suffering of lost loved ones.  The GOP Senate continues to try to control who gets the  most of vast sums of taxpayer money approved for the crisis.  And it isn‘t the little guy they are thinking of.

But Dr. Fauci's report are sure to infuriate the president, who always pushes false hope over  the slow, sober investigative trials run by the medical community. 

 And I don't think caveats about serious heart problems will stop the president from pushing the anti-malaria-Z-pak following reports he and some associates have invested in a company seeking to gear up production of this drug cocktail.

If this is the way he is ""undercutting"" the Reality Show Con Artist we are doomed.   

Why did Dr. Fauci and the CDC wait till March 15th to tell people to avoid crowds?  

Was it because they didn't know crowds were a problem?  - No.

Was it because they were cowed by a fraud so Mardi Gras went on and infected thousands?  - BINGO.  

Dr. Fauci is a DOCTOR who has taken a ""do no harm"" oath, not a politician and till he really speaks truth to power and calls the fraud a fraud on Live TV, the only memory most people will have is of his praise for a person he knows is spouting lies and magic potions for political gain.  

Fifty percent of ""independents"" think the Grifter in Chief is doing a ""good job"" and Dr. Fauci's comment would impact that group like Joseph Welsh's ""decency"" comment did during the McCarthy hearings.  

Dr. Fauci could end this charade with one comment too.    

And let's stop it with the ""he will get fired"".   So?   He will have a bigger platform than ever and every TV camera from around the world will be at his doorstep.

Please stop with the “everything Trump does is bad” obsession."

We should stop making this a Fauci vs. Trump issue because that politicizes it. Instead, since we have 10's of thousands dying while following Fauci's treatment protocols, why aren't we spending time listening to others in the medical community who can't do much worse. I've seen other medical expertise indicating the virus is preventing our red blood cells to carry oxygen and that is the cause of the pneumonia. And treating the pneumonia isn't treating the problem.

2020-04-22 13:30,"If any vested interest Trump has in vigorously promoting some particular drugs like the anti-malarial Hydroxichloroquine, the same effort needs to be withdrawn immediately in larger public interest specially after strong rebuttal by Dr. Anthony Fauci and several doctors specifically dealing with the task of fighting coronavirus and find no proven evidence to suggest such anti-malaria drugs as a cure for coronavirus as being campaigned by Trump. If even after this Trump continues denying science and silences Dr. Anthony Fauci or the doctors treating coronavirus patients he will be jeopardising many lives under the virus threat, and putting spanner in the work of the health workers."
2020-04-22 13:31,"Trump also wondered aloud if a flu vaccine would be effective against coronavirus.  Part of Trump’s sickness is that he believes that if he just says something, it is true.  If he says it multiple times, then it is very true."

A proper response to the pandemic REQUIRES buy-in from all sides and parties: setting up any sort of adversarial back-and-forth is just going to harm everyone in the US and elsewhere. Good on him trying to calmly reason with President Trump et al and bring them on-side, and on-message: that is real leadership. So what if President Trump then goes off and says he’d done the right thing all along? Only thing that matters right now is bringing the pandemic under control."

The pitcher may look dejected and the batter may think he hit the ball on the sweet spot of the bat, but the outfielder will know if there’s enough wind to keep the ball in the park."

Trumps daily narcissistic , jingoistic productions are turning this into a bizarre Covid 19 Olympics . Witness his claim we test more than anyone else collectively, on a per capita business we are far from a podium place. Then look at the horrendous Deaths per capita . 
The number that counts with me is the loss of some 43000 Americans in 5 short weeks. This in such a short period of time is the greatest tragedy we have ever experienced."
2020-04-22 13:51,"My doctor of over 30 years told me a month ago that Weill Cornell had distributed a video to its doctors and staff, instructing them not to use hydroxychloroquine except in exigent circumstances - i.e., patient is about to die and you throw whatever you have at him or her.

He also told me that preliminary information out Harvard, MIT and Johns Hopkins had suggested that the drug would be ineffective against COVID-19.

I assume that Dr. Fauci was drawing on the same information when he tried to discourage people from putting their faith in this unproven, alleged cure. He had to blunt the message to appease Trump. 

I understand Dr. Fauci’s predicament – he needed to get information out to the American public, because that is his job and mission, but Trump would have shut him down if he had not softened the message. Now he has data to back up that message, and so can be clear.

The fact remains that Donald Trump has been a hindrance and roadblock in addressing this national crisis. He is a menace to the public health. He has encouraged policies, and demonstrators, who will, if they get their way, cause thousands of deaths.

We cannot wait until November to remove him. If we can’t remove him now, then he must be circumvented. The governors are trying to do that. How can we help them? Trump is endangering our lives."
2020-04-22 13:36,"So will Trump, Fox News and other ""experts"" correct their misleading and dangerous claims and clarify that hydroxychloroquine is not effective?

Without making this too political. I just hope that if my own doctor gave the best possible advice from the most current and reliable evidence, I wouldn't go shopping around for one who'd say whatever I want to hear most.

Did you notice how short-term many of his pronouncements and orders are?  Constantly his tweets are trimmed, walked back and changed.

Independent analysis a year later indicated that the success rate was no better than 10% and possibly even 0%.

The importance of controlled, clinical testing is not new, nor are the dangers of relying on anecdotes. The scientific method is not some new invention by “the liberal media” to make Glorious Leader look bad. Without scientifically administered clinical trials, confirmation bias might cause us to invest in a treatment that doesn’t actually work at the cost of other options, or cause us to misattribute beneficial effects to the medication when it’s some other incidental factor. In other words, by adopting treatment based on anecdotes, we could lose sight of the real cure."

We do not have a way to accelerate the pipeline and the simple reason is that there is a long arc connecting the efficacy in stylized setting to efficacy in real patients. Further, one cannot simply subject hundreds of thousands of individuals to trials to gain the statistical power one needs to make prognostications of efficacy. If the scientific method is allowed to progress minus the political and corporate pressures, we will arrive at a decent number of useable antivirals that will work among a subset of the population. There won't be a one size fits all cure. And likewise, with vaccine development.

Each member receives frequent and regular reports including specifics on individual patients, hospitalizations, patient adverse reactions, etc. It is a time-consuming and laborious task, but well worth it in order to insure not only patient safety and drug effectiveness but also unusual conditions. 

The Committee can stop a study, which must be done in an orderly manner but also it can recommend that if a therapy is particularly effective that the treatment  move into practice sooner than expected.

This procedure is why properly run studies are so important: they are an important contributor to what is termed evidence-based medicine."

Inactivation of the virus is one test. Reduction in inflammatory response of infected pulmonary tissue is another. Moderation of symptoms that lead to secondary infections is another. Enhancement of oxygen uptake is another.

Anecdotal evidence from doctors here in the US suggests that there are cases where demonstrable beneficiaal impact has been realized from hydroxychloroquine.

That's obviously different from a clinical trial but it is justification for more than one test in more  than one clinical trial.

The media seem to enjoy taking a very narrow judgement by science and turning it into an unjustifiably broad determination of efficacy.

Maybe the journalists should stick to reporting the facts and stay out of the interpretation business.

Readers can do that without any heavily biased and inaccurate assistance from journalists."

His press conferences are staged campaign events where people like Dr. Birx appear to help support Trump's campaign and further confuse the American people.

Dr. Fauci on the otherhand is a real expert and tells the truth even when Trump doesn't like his answers.  But we can tell that he has to choose his words carefully or Trump will fire him.  He is walking on egg shells.  

For me the best guidance comes from governors like Cuomo, Hogan and Newsom.  They respect the science and are truthful.  What they have been saying is that testing is the key and they have not been getting the support they need from the feds.  For now that is all we have until November when we will have a chance to elect a new president that really cares about the nation and will put in place effective plans and processes to deal with the virus."

He constantly spreads lies and misinformation about this pandemic.  President Trump is a clear and present danger to the USA - and that is not hyperbole.  He ignored experts for weeks on the outset of this pandemic because he didn't care if Americans died.  He. Still. Doesn't. Care.   Dr. Fauci, at the next briefing where you are present and you are given the microphone, please step up and say ""Mr. President, stop killing Americans"".

If people staying at home and governors collectively delaying re-starting economies until we can tame the virus were ingredients that would lead to Trump's re-election, he would be spouting that daily from the lectern.

Is his promotion of a deadly snake-oil cure, the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, also an act of reckless endangerment to those gullible enough to try it? The pattern is clear and so, it seems, is the intent to blame others for his criminal neglect and rush to reopen the economy to save himself this November. Trump seems to have reversed the motto that Dr. Fauci and all health-care providers live by into a deadly ""First do harm"" by his actions and now by his encouragement of his followers to violate his own guidelines by massing, often with guns but no masks, at state capitals and threatening legitimate state authority to do even more harm by prematurely reopening their state's businesses and public places.

Trump had initially wanted to open up America on April 12 for Easter.  It was Birx and Fauci who talked him into extending the lockdown to the end of April.  So he does listen to them.

Also, Fauci has not said that Trump is wrong, only that his suggestions are unproven.  And Trump has not said that these drugs definitely work but only that it might be a good idea to try them when someone is terminal.

So the difference between Fauci and Trump is smaller than you claim."

Does the GOP really want that level of incompetence on their hands?  We need nation-wide, large-scale testing now.

""Essentially reinforces Dr. Fauchi's ""dissent""? Nope - this is false.

These guidelines follow exactly what both our President and Dr. Fauchi have always claimed...that while there have been some limited positive results from treatment of specific drugs for this virus  - more testing was needed.

When asked on April 5th, our President responded:
""What do you have to lose?""  - I’m not looking at it one way or another. But we want to get out of this. If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn’t do it early."" But what do I know? I'm not a doctor""

Has our President claimed these drugs are a cure? No.
Did our President demand the use of these drugs as a treatment? No.
Has the press reported (multiple times) that Fauchi was claiming something, and then Fauchi had to set them straight and clarify his statements? Yes

We rely on Dr. Fauchi's expertise. We believe him. But, when he says he has a good working relationship with our President - all of a sudden- that's not believable!. Fauchi is being strong armed by our President to make him bend to his will. Nonsense.

But yet, this ""publication"" believes it's more important to weaponize the narrative against or President.

It's not going to work. And they know this."

Meantime, I understand how emotionally satisfying it is to bash and lambaste our President -- he is certainly worthy of opprobrium.  But it would be wise to recall what one critical care doctor told the NYT (link is below) just a couple of weeks ago about Mr. Trump's advocacy of the malaria drug cited in this article:

“I certainly understand why the president is pushing it,” said Dr. Joshua Rosenberg, a critical care doctor at Brooklyn Hospital Center. “He’s the president of the United States. He has to project hope. And when you are in a situation without hope, things go very badly. So I’m not faulting him for pushing it even if there isn’t a lot of science behind it, because it is, at this point, the best, most available option for use.”

Trump was advocating investigations into Hydroxychloroquine, what is known as ""off label"" use, meaning a treatment for which it did not go through FDA approval. Of course, the Trump opponents, which includes 90% of this readership, screamed ""anti-science"", ""Trump is an idiot"", and ""Trump is at war with Fauci"".

Well, Trump and Fauci were both right.

In 2018, the FDA allowed ""right to try"" use of drugs with proven safety records and unproven, specific efficacy. The purpose was for terminally ill patients to try a drug out of Phase 1 trial, because the odds of survival warranted such an emergency. That allowed patients to use drugs not yet cleared to treat conditions like ALS.

Let's level-set, since NYT readers are all Nobel Laureates in Science.

The typical person who goes on a ventilator (80%) will never come off that ventilator. When you consider that an intubated Covid patient is placed into a medically-induced coma, it is not exactly something you try casually.

There was not a single Covid patient who went on an off-label drug without a doctor writing a script, so go howl at the medical profession if you have a grievance. In a crisis, with not a single post-trial drug in sight, it is perfectly reasonable to run down any path to cure of Covid.

That is what Trump was doing.

And Fauci was also correct in his stance.

Get over yourselves."

Remember: There is NO vaccine for HIV-AIDS (after thirty five plus years),nor is their one for the common cold.

2020-04-22 15:35,"Dr. Fauci spoke the truth. There are no drugs to treat coronavirus. Dr. Fauci went up against Trump. Now you don’t see Dr. Fauci at the Coronavirus Task Force meetings anymore. 

Trump is on full campaign mode. Talking about everything but the coronavirus. 

It is our loss that Dr. Fauci is not at the briefings anymore. He was the voice of reason and hope.

Now we are stuck with a self important, narcissistic liar who is looking for your vote in November. 

Sad."
2020-04-22 15:36,"Dr. Fauci has served as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).  Fauci is widely recognized as one of the world's leading experts on infectious diseases.  He attended Cornell University Medical College where he graduated first in his class with an MD.

Mr. Trump is a trust baby who is known as a Reality Show host.  He is known as being a clown.  He has faced 6  bankruptcies and run scam businesses (i.e, Trump University).  It is said that he has a bachelor's degree, although that is unconfirmed.

So who do I trust, on almost anything, Dr. Fauci or Mr. Trump?"
2020-04-22 15:28,"Dr. T-rump vs. Dr. Fauci? The first is a con-man, plain and simple. That Dr. T-rump can con more people into taking snake oil than Dr. Fauci can cure after they get sick trying it... Sad."

They are using it because they have seen that it works.  The exact extent or the exact mechanism of working isn't all known yet, but that will come out later, when there's more time."
2020-04-22 15:45,"Illogical hacks like Trump who ""rely on their gut"" and throw out misleading and misguided information are typically exposed far earlier in life by bankruptcies, jail, or worse.

At least my cat has a good heart and loves snuggling with me at night."
2020-04-22 15:50,"Trump is so sure that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine will be ""a game changer"" just like he said in February the number of cases of the virus in the U.S. would soon be near ""zero.""

Seriously.

His words are anything but comforting, supportive or truthful."

It's so irritating to let him hog  valuable time when we'd much rather hear from Dr Fauci  and Scientists who do know what they are talking about.  Thank goodness for the mute button so we don't have to hear his blabbering gibberish and self-congratulatory remarks on how wonderful  this delusional person thinks he is ( not )."

2020-04-22 15:53,"""The federal agency led by Dr. Anthony Fauci issued guidelines on Tuesday that stated there is no proven drug for treating coronavirus patients.""

Our president and his sycophants and his Dunning-Kruger family must stop playing any role in the virus response effort. His comments about drugs and other medical or scientific topics are dangerously nutty. For one thing, the anti-science, anti-expert Trump supporters are remarkably susceptible to such claptrap. Clearly Trump is thinking only about his own reelection. Clearly it doesn't much bother him if he is putting the lives of others in jeopardy. There are red flags everywhere. Does he really own stock in a maker of the malaria drug, as has been reported?"
2020-04-22 15:30,"I don't understand why Fauci cannot leave the Trump team and be free to speak more truth. He's been stifled too long, and forget Dr. Birx who seems to have less trouble in defending the Trump logic on this. Let's not liberate Michigan, et al. Let's liberate Fauci so the media can ask (and receive) the unvarnished truth on this pandemic. C'mon!"
2020-04-22 15:33,"I love how instead of plugging a drug that could actually help people, that the President is plugging a drug that he has invested in so that he can make a ton of money (which is also against the law, since a normal President has to give up everything rule that he can benefit from personally and financially - of course Trump is exempt from this because no one can tell him otherwise.) Its amazing that he is able to still get away with this, at this time of crisis in this country (and world)….And I haven't seen Jared in a long time either - I seem to remember that he and his family have invested in this drug as well. What a great person to have leading the investigation of the coronavirus in this country! It boggles the mind....I hope the Southern District of NY is taking notes for the future about this, along with everything else, so that many members of this selfish, and dishonorable family can go from the White House to the Big House...."
2020-04-22 15:41,"Trump should never have pontificated an opinion on any specific drug our course of treatment other than to say...we're working on many different treatment protocols at this time and are hopeful that they'll produce results.

Unfortunately we have a President who prefers spreading false hoods, rumors and when if all else fails, outright lies."
2020-04-22 15:43,"I am surprised that Trump has not promoted the benefits of bloodletting. After all, what have you got to lose?"
2020-04-22 15:30,"It is a sign of desparation when the health care system trys to re-purpose drugs without credible data, worse when the drug has a completely different intended use and worse still when the drug is backed by politicians. 

Not only does the drug show little or no efficacy, not only does re-purposing deny use of the drug by those who really need it but worst of all, there is the profit motive that in a capitalist system, often trumps ethics and common sense."
2020-04-22 16:02,"There's a large trial just starting up in the UK (5000 subjects) with government funding including plans to upscale production capacity for any successful candidates, but such trials are not guaranteed to produce the results we would all like to see. Expect distancing, and protection measures to be prevalent for the time being, I would guess a year at least"
2020-04-22 16:05,"As a clinical researcher, I have to say that science has largely failed in these desperate times. With ten's of thousands of patients and a 2 months to prepare, we should have been ready to conduct real phase 3 trials that answer questions. The fact that it's end of April and we have nothing but uncontrolled observations of small cohorts is unacceptable. 

Proper clinical trial design does take time and effort. It should always be designed to actually answer a question. The circumstances are actually ripe to get answers quickly 1) many patients to randomize, 2) endpoints are short and arrived within 1 month. Unfortunately, just like the rest of the COVID-19 response, clinical research was not preparing when it should have been."
2020-04-22 15:40,"Tragically, Trump still thinks he can wing it when it comes to complex medical uncertainty. As he declared during his 2016 to black citizens: ""Whadya have to lose?"" voting for him.
Now we know: the why not, nothing to lose sloppy unfocused reasoning is naive & ignorant. He doesn't have any 'intuitive' (gut?) authority over managing coronavirus. He should know this already.
Hydroxychloroquine is not safe & effective. Trump is not a snake oil salesman- he is supposed to be a smart, clear-minded disciplined leader in service to the nation. When in doubt- he should say LESS.
trying to hype himself and markets with frothy nonsense is ok for charity golf tournament award dinners. It is grotesquely inappropriate during a deadly pandemic."
2020-04-22 16:09,"Why did Dr. Trump advocate Malaria and Lupus drugs for sufferers of Covid19? So what medical school did our brilliant and manifestly unstable president graduate from? Donald Trump has been leading us by gosh and by golly, by his gut and his hunches, claiming total authority.

Isn't it funny to watch the glowing president, radiant orange as a clementine, frowning at Dr. Fauci, his scientific nemesis at his White House Task Force Coronavirus rallies?  Why hasn't a reporter in the White House Briefing Room shouted out ""Mr. Trump, you're full of baloney!""?

Brilliant Dr. Fauci, small and Brooklyn-accented, stands up at the podium to president Trump as well as he can. His role during this 2020 pandemic, that's changed all our lives, is to play the Devil's Advocate in Trump's catch as catch can chaos for the coming weeks and months."
2020-04-22 15:57,"This will reinforce the ""common sense"" of most people. Unfortunately for them, however, and ultimately for everyone, one fact remains: the creationists, climate-change deniers, conspiracy theorists, manufacturers of the useless or dangerous drugs, stockholders of those companies, Pollyannas, advertisers on certain media outlets, talking heads on those networks, snake-oil salesmen, politicians representing districts or states with large numbers of Know-Nothings, Fauci-Is-a-Deep-State-Operative proponents, Trump Party loyalists who can't abide that even one of his claims might be wrong, and others, will dominate the discussion."
2020-04-22 16:11,"I understand the many critical comments directed at Trump for promoting use of hydroxychloroquine but what's really sad in all this is how many doctors are using it. There are many claims that they have ""seen it work"" in patients they use it on. But how would you know without a control group? What they've seen is that they give the patient the drug, and the patient survives. But the majority of patients, even sick and old ones, survive COVID with nothing but good supportive care. So the hydroxychloroquine probably had nothing to do with it. It's the old saw about correlation, not causation. Even doctors are susceptible to the human bias that sees cause effect everywhere."
2020-04-22 16:15,"“What do you have to lose? Just take it,” was the advice given to millions by Trump. Turns out, you could lose your life. Those same millions should commence the lawsuits against Trump personally for illegally dispensing harmful medical advice."
2020-04-22 16:23,"There is a consistent theme that runs through the many cautionary articles that have reported on the state of the human species, its beliefs, behaviors and its impact on the wider world at large. 

It was famously reported years ago by a cartoon 'possum named  Pogo; 
""We have met the enemy and he is us.""

That summarizes the cultural incoherence that permits leadership committed to self-serving denials of reality.

That is the unacknowledged mental/spiritual health epidemic   that is enabling an opportunistic microbe to feed and prosper. 

But even without an effective vaccine or antibiotic covid-19  will likely recede  as it kills off or immunizes the susceptible host population upon which it depends. Will we learn from that?  Or will we resume ignoring  and contributing to the threats and hazards that await our children?"
2020-04-22 16:35,"This is a moment for science, the scientific method and clinical research.  Let's hope the respect for data in all aspects of society continues.  That, along with compassion for other people will help get us through this terrible moment in history."
2020-04-22 16:36,"Any drug has to be calibrated for effectiveness. Dosage amount? Frequency? Oral or IV? Age and weight of subject? Just try  it, when you don't know these parameters is not likely to be helpful. Clinical trials answer these and other questions."
2020-04-22 16:42,Trump is essentially recommending drugs made by companies in which he has a financial interest. No surprise there. He also knows Fauci is highly respected by the general public and Trump does not want to seem more pig headed than he is.
2020-04-22 17:04,"As suggested several times, talk to a few doctors on the front line, for whom the advice, ""nothing works"" and ""wait for a clinical trial"" leaves them with no treatments and no help for their patients."

2020-04-22 17:30,"It's the job of journalists to question and hold Trump accountable, especially during the daily briefings.  Hopefully they will do their job today."
2020-04-22 17:46,"The claim that  the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is untested against COVID-19 is simply false.  It has been used extensively in Italy, where it is approved for COVID-19 by the Italian equivalent of the FDA. Italian doctors have found that to work, it must be given early -- when fever reaches 37-5 degrees centigrade, even before breathing problems develop.following a certain drop in oxygen saturation and indications from ultra-sound tests that lung problems will develop --so BEFORE actual outset of pneumonia. When used in this way it almost always prevents death."

The Rabbis of the Old Testament issued laws, rules and guidelines pertaining to all of these matters 5000 years ago --- and amazingly Dr. Fauci is today showing no hesitancy in borrowing plans and ideas from them.

It make me wonder whether the Old Rabbis benefited from some sort of divine guidance."
2020-04-22 18:05,Fauci is a dedicated doctor with genuine curiosity. Trump is grasping for attention.
2020-04-22 17:58,"Thought I'd share this with Times readers.
Fox News and Judicial Watch are interesting points. Ha, Judicial Watch who promoted the fake theory about the Clinton's murdering Vince Foster among other Twilight Zone
theories.
Dr. Fauci to me has become a frustration for me as far as his reluctance to call out the fake and misleading diversions of blame by the president towards the pandemic response.
Especially the fact of his HHS departments failure to follow
protocol regulations with the oversight of the CDC SNS. Trump saying 'we're not in the shipping business' is a complete lie and he knows he failed as far as the availability of PPE's from the SNS. Regulations specify the SNS is to be checked and inventoried on a quarterly basis and obviously it was not done
or it would have been mentioned answering the PPE availability question. Fauci and Redfield should be aware of this HHS/CDC failure.
People have died and Trump and Pence are lying to cover this fact up and I can't believe that any major news media hasn't investigated this and brought it to the public's attention.
Come on Times do your job of investigative reporting on this
important matter.

2020-04-22 18:09,There also was a study published on the same site from investigators in France that failed to demonstrate effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine among 181 patients who either did (n=84) or did not (n=97) received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of hospitalization. They reported no significant differences in the proportion of patients transferred to ICU or died within 7 days. ECG abnormalities requiring discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine occured in almost 10% of those receiving hydroxychloroquine. These two studies taken together do not support the routine use of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 patients.
2020-04-22 18:09,"DrAnthony Fauci is a World renowned authority on infectious diseases and their treatment and should be listened to carefully when he discusses Covid 19 and it’s treatment options. Donald Trump is an authority on ..... wait, I’ll come up with something. So, whose counsel would you seek relative to dealing with the pandemic?"
2020-04-22 18:14,So are taxpayers still on the hook for the 29 million hydroxychloroquine pills Trump supposedly bought? What did that cost us?
2020-04-22 18:21,"As regard hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin there has been a big polemical fights here in France on this topic. The point is that the main proponent of this treatment, Pr Raoult,  is one of the highest quoted virologists in the world, before the corinavirus (he has several viruses named after him). He is certainly not a mad doctor with bad science. Raoult has now  treated now more than 3000 symptomatic individuals, with a result of 12 deaths. He has always advocated the use of hydroxycloroquine with azitriomicine for early stage disease, and has written that it should not be used for severely ill patients (and ones with cardiac problems). Within this limited range it seems to be working very well. So, and although I hate trumpian stupidity as deeply as anybody here, it seens that this new study of HC+Z drugs provided to terminaly ill patients, is certainly not relevant to Raoult studies or practices.  Coupled with the use of an oxymeter (as proposed in an article of the NYT yesterday) it would be very efficient for early stage non-cardiac patients."
2020-04-22 18:26,Dr Fauci is correct. Having seen numerous Covid patients and tried many treatments we are sadly using knives in a gunfight.
2020-04-22 19:16,"Seeing wealthy and famous people who had Covid walk out of the hospital in a few days after taking hydroxychloroquine is proof enough.

The drug has been around for over 50 years, is cheap and among the safest drugs on the market, side effects are rare, few and mild.

For the past 50 years when people took it for malaria, before Covid, no one tried to discourage them from taking it  by calling it ""unproven."" You'd rather they died?"
2020-04-22 18:32,"Dr. Anthony Fauci is a dedicated scientist with nearly four decades of public service. Donald Trump has zero respect for science, and perhaps less for scientists, particularly those who, like Fauci, enjoy approval ratings more than double Trump's own.

If ever there was a person who deserves the Presidential Medal of Freedom, our highest civilian honor, it's Fauci. Fat chance, though, that Donald Trump will recognize him. After all is said and done, Fauci will be the person people remember for ""being there"" when Covid-19 ravaged the globe. Perhaps Congress will award Fauci the Congressional Gold Medal - he deserves recognition and our thanks."

This was done in haphazard fashion, and none of it worked.  What it probably did, however, was create antigenic drift, causing viral mutations that made the drug more virulent--much like antibiotic resistance for bacteria.  Another item that Americans have thus acquired that was 'Made in China.'"

2020-04-22 16:00,"In Marseille, France, Prof. Raoult has had a 91% recovery rate using hidroxicloroquine with azitriomicine. This drug has been widely used againt malaria for almost 70 years. There are lots of studies on its toxicity and we know it is quite low. Even pregnant women have been taken it. Treatment with this protocol is effective if administed early enough. Stop getting distracted with string puppets and look for the science. One family member tested positive and was put on this protocol. He spent 2 days at hospital and continued his treatment at home. End of the story."
2020-04-22 18:55,"This study is to be taken with extreme caution!
The French professor Raoult, one of the most eminent specialists worldwide, is getting remarkable results in Marseilles with that drug, associated with others. Marseilles is now the least infected city in France. An improbable result, but blatant. 
Before dismissing the drug upfront, one should look at the protocol. 
One clear thing is that a global success of this very cheap treatment would not be in the best interest of the large pharmaceutical companies exercising an excessive domination over the health systems worldwide. So, nothing is final there..."

What have you got to lose.""  

Besides spouting bogus medical advice, what I find interesting is that Trump claims the U.S. has already purchased thousands of these pills, without proof that they work, yet we can't buy swaps for test kits that we know we  need.  How can that happen?  Oh wait, I remember.  The states need to buy swabs. Trump buys only what HE thinks is important (for his reelection)."

That anyone, never mind a U.S. president would be so irresponsible as to recommend them adding ""What have you got to lose?"" when it turns out they can be fatal is engaging in criminal behavior called ""reckless endangerment."" For the very safety of the nation, the media must stop the live coverage of Trump's harmful disinformation aka ""daily briefings"" and only replay the sound medical advice from qualified and trustworthy physicians like Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx."

It’s high time that we begin to ignore Donald Trump’s ridiculous press briefings and instead pay attention to people who know quite a bit more than he does. Besides,  in this unprecedented crisis are we going to trust a habitual liar who can’t control himself? Are we going to trust a man who has proven himself consistently to be interested only in himself and in his own political survival?
You make the choice ...."
2020-04-22 19:58,"I've been extremely critical of Trump for getting ahead of the science and talking up chloroquines, but I'd also caution against reading too far into the new VA study, which (as its authors note) was retrospective.  We won't really know whether such drugs help or hurt (or neither) until there's a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study of sufficient size.  Several of those are currently underway around the world, but they take time.

Until then, there's only one correct answer: science doesn't know yet, and it remains irresponsible to promote OR disparage candidate treatments at this time."

Those of us who do (privileged enough to have a time's membership 95 % of us likely are able to be working from home and have not felt our wallets tighten much yet while we mock those who are suffering) are the only one's who do.

Doctors prescribe medications. Clearly doctors know enough to know when and when not to prescribe a medication. 

The risk of harm from this medication is very low. The benefit is also non-existent but just because Trump said how wonderful it is doesn't mean it caused a huge catastrophe. Doctors by and large do not take medical advice from Donald Trump.

I am amazed that the US issued common-sense guidelines for citizens and state governments to follow, only to have those same measures openly undercut by the very same president of the US.  How does that make any sense?  It’s as if he wanted to issue two sets of guidelines; one for people that have the ability to understand what is going on with COVID and the need to social-distance and stay home, and then another set of instructions for the presidents supporters to say it’s okay to go out, don’t worry about COVID, it’s okay if some of you get it and give it to others, you don’t really care.  Am I missing something here or is this just as stupid as I think it is? 

Someone please explain to me how getting a tattoo or a manicure or a massage meets the need to social-distance.  Someone please explain to me how these sorts of things are important to society.  Go get groceries for your family if you want to do something of value.  The demonstrations in Michigan are prime opportunities for COVID to spread rapidly; do those demonstrating understand that?

Many journals publish the ENTIRE dataset online, as well.

A really significant discovery - like a treatment for Covid-19 - can be published almost immediately with the whole review process being expedited. Journals like JAMA, The Lancet or Nature (Medicine) would have such a paper published online within a few days. Any author, regardless of affiliation, credentials or academic status will get published. IF their data is good.

Any 'evidence' shown through YouTube videos, newspaper articles or 'paid for by author' science journal can, and should, be dismissed. With contempt."

My joint pain goes away after 3 months of taking it every day and I continue to feel better even as it gets toward 6-8 months. So in my mind there was way that this would work in an acute care situation &  it seemed ridiculous, unless it was targeting a completely different pathway. However, I think there is still a possibility that it may work as a prophylaxis in healthy people who have take it for months and if taken for months beforehand it may also prevent these kind of cataclysmic cytokine storms that happen in the 2nd phase of C19 if/when people get really sick. Then it really becomes an immune system issue and H is a good immune system modulator, again, IFF taken for months and months at high doses. The people who are getting very sick also are having serious & weird (rarely seen) coagulation issues, including antiphospholipid antibodies of the kind that are found in.. you guessed it..Lupus. H lowers the risk of blood clots and reduces inflammation in Lupus patients, &  is recommended for AA syndrome, in conjuction with other therapies. But you can't put everyone on it for months & months. & You can't use Lupus patients in an experiment bc of other medications. I am hopeful that it will help me, though because I have been on it for months & I have mild Lupus ( I don't take other drugs).But then again, I have Lupus."

I was lucky as a neurologist, I dealt with a death and dying in smaller numbers over years.  But my job wasn't to think I could save them, just allow them to die when it was time and not keep treating futility.  Back when I practiced, palliative care didn't exist and hospice was new.

Many of my physician colleagues didn't want to spend much time with the dying, but the nurses always have to. Dealing with so much death changed me. In some ways I became more human, in other ways, I hid in a shell. The negative effects certainly stayed with me for years until I was able to allow my parents to die, mixing the love of a son with the skills of a physician. I can now see that allowing people to die and standing in the face of death and saying, ""I can and should do no more. We did everything we could"" was my small gift to medicine. As a neurologist,  it sure wasn't curing people.  

May all of you on the front line recover and find contentment and peace in your huge gift to medicine and humanity. It will never be forgotten."

Like they are expendable for the sake of the economy !! These workers should be salututed and congratulated...not forced to continue to work in such difficult situations. Our Federal Government has let these fine Americans from all walks of life down. The Chaotic and Dysfunctional Trump Administration is directly responsible ...as are their allies in the GOP and at Fox! Medical staff having to reuse masks and facing shortages of all kinds is an abberation. Not providing proper protection for those at meat plants...leaving workers vulnerable is a travesty. The meat plants should have thought of better  protecting workers so they wouldn't have had to shut down.  Jared Kushner has a lot of nerve to say the administration's handling of this tragedy is a ...Success Story..??? The US has nearly a third of the virus cases globally...that's  his idea of success?  What planet are these priveliged people living on?? God help us all if virus cases spike in States that open up.

Frankly, the word ""hero"" is grossly overused in our culture.  But it's the only word that fits those who suit up to go onto a Covid ward knowing very well that it could be the time they're fatally exposed. 

Like the one nurse interviewed, my great fear is what happens when the healthcare workers start in overwhelming numbers to get sick, die, and, suffer from exhaustion, PTSD, and overwork. This is not, as she noted, sustainable for the long haul. I cannot imagine how some of these workers even have the energy to show up anymore. And yet they do just that.

I was moved to tears by the nurse sharing how the doctor, aid and she cried when confronted by a patient dying alone. I would hope anyone would want that...healers who are not automatons, ones who cry the tears we would spill were we allowed to be with our loved ones. 

Of the many tentacles of this ghastly pandemic, it's the image of those dying alone that most haunts me. A close second is the faces of the nurses and doctors bending near...near enough to catch the disease themselves...near enough to catch the dying patient's last words or to offer comfort. What a strange and terrible dance of the desperate and the healers this is. 

To every healthcare worker...thank you. You are our heroes."

We have willingly, eagerly enmeshed most of our manufacturing and supply chain with a hostile, human-rights defying, totatitarian regime who has suppressed its own and aggressively peddled in misinformation for its entire existence.

Western CEO's and shareholders (and consultancies like McKinsey, who champion offshoring above all else) have been the driver of this, more than GOP politicians or anyone else.  The greed is our achilles heel.  

Even after the Hainan island incident in 2001 (reaffirming for all that our two states are in fact, enemies), the tainted milk and baby formula a few years later (reaffirming the atrocities committed in that unregulated business environment we can't resist taking advantage of), US businesses, Apple and thousands of others, gleefully went on to do all, or the vast majority of their work there.  

We in the West have done more for the CCP than its own leadership could have dreamt, because we can't see past the next quarterly earnings result, and patriotism is merely a word.

Weighing the path to all of this, we can blame ourselves in some ways for the pandemic itself, though not for the reasons the CCP propaganda machine is trumpeting."

I hope the Democrats get on board, and exceed the president in their willingness to uncouple. If there is one thing we have learned from this crisis is that their cheap products are not worth it, and we don't need 21 pairs of socks in the drawer when a dozen will do.

In the financial crisis it was happy to throw Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal etc under the bus. It's principal role is to set trade with other countries and blocks. The EU has long sold it's soul to the Chinese,  Much easier to get cheap goods and finance from China than have a level playing field with the USA, who the bureaucrats view as the bigger threat.   So it suits the Brussels organisation to, oddly enough, ""kowtow"" to pressure from Beijing and its Belt Roads Initiative than assist the people of Europe.  One hopes than when we are past this crisis, China is investigated for it's conduct in this pandemic but also the economic ""beggar thy neighbour"" strategy they have been pursuing. That means supply chains for multinational agencies, national governments and companies must be diversified. It's absurd that the supply of PPE to the UK and Europe in this pandemic is largely dependent on China. Boards of Directors of many companies, including Apple, should face penalties if they don't diversify the supply chains.

For three years I lived in India (2009-12).  I remember going to the border of India and Pakistan to see the taking down of the flags.  There was a woman from China there and I asked her what she thought about the Dalai Lama?  She said he is a bad man!  

Our realities are  molded by our governments, but fortunately in the US we still seem to have free press.  One wonders when this will change.

China is smart and can wield pressure because of its ability to ""help"" other countries.  This is unlike the US at this point in time.  We all know that there are always ulterior motives for countries to do what they do.  It's all about natural resources and controlling narratives, whether they are fact based or made up.

We are in a moment to make tremendous change in the world.  The question is will we take advantage?"
2020-04-24 23:08,"European politicians think it is in their best interest to be muffled by China. It is not even the end of 1st round of the coronavirus, and these politicians think they can get a better outcome by changing their wording.
In Italy and Spain, I heard people were afraid to even open packages from China. You can change the wording once or twice, but if people feel that they are being manipulated, they’ll find an alternative solution. Brexit is a good example (or reminder) of what could be the future for the so-called ‘European Union.’
I think the world is going to change a lot, and I doubt that ‘putting patches’ to a document is going to save some jobs in Brussels in the aftermath. I wonder what they’ll say if (or once) they find themselves in a economic crisis."
2020-04-25 1:19,"No surprise. The EU is looking at the route to recovery and China is the biggest trading partner. China is allergic to criticism from both inside and outside the country on nearly everything. With China pushing their version of the truth on the outbreak CoVid-19, the opinion of the EU matters. Donations of face masks and other medial supplies to influence opinion are part of the plan."
2020-04-24 22:05,"China spreads propaganda and the EU is their accomplice and apologist at the same time. Parsing the truth is the same as lying. For their export market. No continent has suffered greater than Europe yet their leaders in Brussels have decided that rather than press China for the whole truth, their business exports are more important. The thousands that have died in Europe will have died in vain if we can not uncover the definitive origin story. It is not about blame or punishment. It is about the science for future generations. We owe the future our best evidence. China lies. Europe enables."
2020-04-24 23:23,"Let’s do some thought experiments. 

If Europe put our a report that heavily criticised Donald Trump (such as for misinformation), do you not think there would be push-back from the US, and is it not possible that the report would be softened?

In another case, let us consider if the report contained opinions of the US that were actually unfair, do you not think that the US would not push back?

So, no matter what your opinion on the push/back, do you not see that China’s reactions are always placed in a negative light, but that it would be possible to place them in a good light - e.g. “resisting mischaracterisation”? Why is it only seen as bullying when China does it?

In fact, the CIA has stated that any errors in information from China about the impact of the coronavirus is not deliberate. If this is the case, then why should China not push back and ask for changes? Who has the “agenda” in this case?

For those who think I am pro-China, please reconsider - on other topics I have criticism or reserve judgement. But I want us all to be aware of biases and prejudices. Mine on China have been shaken by previous events."
2020-04-24 23:56,"Xi is the perfect counterpoint to Trump, but 10X more clever and 100X more ruthless.  Casualties mean nothing to him, he faces no accountability, and he desperately desires a position that he would be completely incapable of filling.  Trump, with brains and guts.

I support whatever the Europeans feel they have to do to abide with China.  I would like to see them take a principled stand based on human rights and free trade standards.  But I understand that if the US, Japan, and South Korea don't stand with them, they need to do what they need to do."
2020-04-24 23:57,"The New World Order"", the Global Economy""  so highly touted by most media outlets and politicians , journalists, business interests.  This is what we got.  We were warned repeatedly about doing business with China about 28 years ago  but no one listened except most progressives.  Bill Clinton said it was good for our country good for our economy.  Oh yeah?  Which country has a huge cash surplus? Which country has a $4 trillion deficit for this year alone? Greed blinds people and this blindness is threatening all of our lives,  not to mention the economy, our country.  The EU still doesn't get it.  Will we?"
2020-04-24 22:23,"Countless government officials around the world bungled their responses to COVID-19 in their respective countries, but the Chinese government’s initial reaction to the virus facilitated its spread. That is indisputable. It kept countries in the dark and therefore deserves blame for some of the turmoil arising in the virus’s wake. Cravenly acquiescing to Chinese demands continues the sordid tradition of Western governments and corporations emboldening and kowtowing to a totalitarian regime. Honestly accounting for the myriad factors and shortcomings that led to the position we find ourselves in is a prerequisite for ensuring that we are in a better position to handle a future global calamity. We cannot allow the Chinese government’s aversion to acknowledging uncomfortable truths override our commitment to facing them openly and head on. It’s imperative we weaken our economic dependence on China so that our leaders are no longer driven to defend or downplay the actions of an oftentimes brutal actor on the international stage."
2020-04-25 0:04,"So the material changes in the report are: ""The sentence about China’s “global disinformation” campaign was removed, as was any mention of the dispute between China and France. Other language was toned down."" Judging by the robust reactions from many commenters, it certainly sounds as if China had just said COVID19 is a hoax, will miraculously disappear in no time, can be treated by injecting disinfectant or strong uv, while secretly hijacking medical supplies destined for other countries."
2020-04-25 1:11,"Europe is becoming weaker and weaker, both politically and economically. The British were not naive and extricated themselves out of European Union luckily on time. It is a matter of years before other countries follow and the European Union falls apart. Similar to what has happened in the US, the elites, in the pursuit of profits, became morally bankrupt, looking the other way while China and other countries devastated the planet and their people with authoritarian doctrines, all while being duplicitous and advocating programs to ""save the planet"" and improve people's lives around the globe. Their supposedly ""free thinking"" is nothing more than self interest. The EU is going to be eaten alive economically by the US and China. The EU is now even more desperate and will sell it's soul to the highest bidder."
2020-04-24 23:22,In what alternative universe does China have any negotiating and retaliation power?  They can cut off their export and invest in their own failing economy?

2020-04-24 22:09,"It's rather ironic that China is criticized for mounting a disinformation campaign around their initial response to the local epidemic in Wuhan when they had no idea at the time what they were dealing with. It's the West that has been distorting the record, not China. China had to deal with an unknown disease. They had no ideas about its mode of transmission, how contagious it was, or its lethality. They were flying blind, it was only through bitter experience that Chinee doctors learned what the disease characteristics of COVID-19 were. Still today, I read accounts by doctors in NYC that they don't fully understand the disease. Yet, China is expected to have known all there was to know about it and be held responsible for initially not fully appreciating its severity. Meanwhile, the West had two months' lead time when they adamantly refused to learn any lessons from China's experience and blithely went on whistling a happy tune, until it was too late. There are ideologues in the EU, UK and US who will distort the record to suit their political agenda, regardless of the factS. They accuse China of spreading disinformation when they themselves are guilty of it. As US Secretary of State admitted, they lie, cheat and steal and then project their own behavior onto their chosen targets."
2020-04-25 0:29,"Looks like the cat is out of the bag. The official EU report may have been expurgated, but the facts and the truth that were redacted and struggled over are out in the open and available to all to read in numerous articles, like this one, posted by news agencies across the globe. This isn't a disinformation campaign being waged by the CCP - it is a war conducted not with guns but with words."

2020-04-24 22:49,"Of course China is responsible for the virus. It came from a market in Wuhan that stocked bats, civets, snakes and pangolins. One of the principles of Chinese medicine is that patients have to consume animals when they are at the height of their energy, I.e., alive. The Covid19 virus is zoonotic. It jumped from an animal to a human being. Western scientists still do not know what animal originally harbored the virus because the Chinese scrubbed the wet market where the virus originated. 

The thing about bullies, whether people or countries, is that you have stand up to them. I hope The EU doesn’t water down its report.,"

Yet, I know it doesn't feel like it, but there might be a silver lining to this whole thing. 

Without this virus, many people, including myself, were ignorant about the CCP. I always thought that their actions never really affected me. I, being, a Chinese American, and growing up here, just thought it was China being China.

However, I know now that the government will eventually impact my everyday life. This might be increasing censorship of the press, economic damage as China gains more leverage in the global market, and even physical harm in some instances as different ideas and beliefs do not sit well with them (i.e their extermination of the people of Tibet, Uyghurs, Falun Gong belief, and Christians belief).  

It is not hard to see that the CCP is slowly gaining control of the global economy and plan to squeeze the world for all it is worth once they are there. 

I do think that the government is ruthless in their approach and that the world must play tit for tat in order to effectively limit their approach."

2020-04-25 1:34,"This is why there will never be a country called Europe, because if there ever was it’s capitals would be Paris and Berlin and it would be run from Paris and Berlin.  It means other capitals like Warsaw or Budapest would become colonies, much like how they were when the Soviet Union was in charge.  Today the Eu is run from Berlin, and Berlin’s biggest trading partner is China.  Trump threatened German exports they turned to China.  I personally see China “ploughing through” Germany in only a few years, they are run by a single person and by a single party so are much better organised.  The German lands (states) have never in their 1000 year history done well, except a brief period following the rule of a certain Austrian with a moustache."

2020-04-25 0:01,I am at a complete loss to understand this irrational fear of pushback by China (or trump) when their so-called “facts” are challenged or disproven.  This era will be defined by the death of truth. Sad.

Either we move away from that economic dependence on China, or that regime will soon be our masters. That's just a fact. 
.
So, do we have what it takes to go through the short-term pain to get away from that economic dependence on China -- and it will be painful -- or do we not do the necessary and either find ourselves in a war or subjects of the world's biggest dictatorship.

So long as our leaders are too cowardly to stand up and speak the truth to Beijing, we're going to continue heading to the bad place."

Given the freedom is not the right to use brutally but to use wisely as human beings should do as always. China is not helping the world under the scientific evidence and medical facts but keep trying to detour the public on the fact of how they cover up the bloody truth since last December. 

It's important to us to beef up ourselves and fight this pandemic. Leave the China to play their own one-man show."
2020-04-24 23:59,"If the US goes back to having a sane president after Trump is gone, the US and the other NATO members should set up a trading block linked to NATO. Neither Russia nor China have good intentions when they deal with any NATO member. To pretend otherwise at this point is beyond naive. It would be equally naive to think pursuing a policy of appeasement would change the attitude of either country.

If a country cheats or plays games for Chinese or Russian cash, the US should announce it won't come to its defense until it cleans up its act."
2020-04-25 3:40,"Funny how anyone who was taking the virus seriously had enough information since late January.  It certain governments claim they did not have enough information until mid March. Any accusation China “hid it all until it was too late” is meaningless since the data was there since January. Too many governments, and the media, didn’t take exponential growth of a highly infectious and harmful virus seriously enough until it was too late. China hid things in December on a local level. By early January I was reading reports from China of how dangerous this was. The mistakes were made across the board, but not because of 1-2 wasted weeks in December. The mistakes were made by people hoping the virus wouldn’t touch them if they downplayed it."

No Constitution guarantees their free speech.
Remember Tiananmen Square? Thirty years later we still don't know how many lost their life. Never forget the Hong Kong leaders recently arrested in the fog of the pandemic. Investigate not only the origins of Covid-19, but the persecution of Christians and Muslims, and journalists.
Don't count on any help from Europe. They will continue averting their eyes from the evils of the CCP and ignoring the risks in the hope of strong economic cooperation and financial reward."

The European Union needs to gut check its own character."
2020-04-25 3:57,"US is also spreading disinformation from Trump administration officials to mainstream media like Washington post, when they disregarded scientific opinions and promoted the conspiracy theory that the virus leaked from the Wuhan virology lab. They never bothered to check that within the scientific circles, this theory is very unlikely. Did the E.U. report point this out? If not, then it’s clearly biased, and they should be called out. The problem is that bias is so deeply ingrained that many people don’t even see it because they never bothered to see how others view the world."

Sure look at what it cost us to push that ideology. Along with Capitalism we go in and throw out leaders and disrupt countries and create conflict for people that last for generations. Look at the past 40-60 years from the Korean War, Vietnam War, Cuba, Nicaragua, Panama, Afghanistan, Libya, Africa, Iran, Syria, Lebanon... should I continue? It’s our arrogance that might is right for sake of Democracy that got the Twin Towers blown to smithereens.  At the beginning of any pandemic there are confusions and uncertainty.  The level of clarity and uncertainty is never certain at early stages of any pandemic. It was the provincial government in China that were ill prepared to realize what was happening until it reached the federal level at Beijing where the CCP swiftly took action to contain this and brought the world time. Take a look at our Federal government- do you see any effective action to take of the people for the time it had? Then ask yourself should we be criticizing others or ourselves first?"
2020-04-25 4:00,"Like it or not, Trump and Pompeo's strategy in calling out China for their cover up is right on spot.
EU needs to wake up and recognize the clear and present danger that China poses. Like a black hole where even light cannot escape, there is little to no credible information coming out of China as to how the virus originated and why they chose to keep silent about it, in the crucial first few weeks.

But then EU is too deep inside the Chinese pockets to put up even a semblance of a protest."
2020-04-25 3:37,"This report shows the frustration of USA and its media with China, as their battle is moving to another front: Europe.

USA is not China's friend. Never was. China is just a place with cheap labor to make affordable stuff for American consumers. Everyone plays by the rules of capitalism, more or less. To USA it would be so much easier in the long run to manage China if it adopt ""democracy"" and fall into the orbit of American Democratic satellites, like Japan and South Korea with periodic elections and multiple parties. It's must be maddening that China never budged. The wishful thinking of China pundits dashed.

It appears China has outlived its usefulness to USA because China wants to move up the value chain and stop doing the low pay jobs. USA cannot be happy about that. The gloves are off. The ferocious attacks on ZTE & Huawei is just the beginning. Will the Europeans follow Australia and play according to USA's stop China plan?  This report seems to flag a setback."
2020-04-25 6:08,"The current administration's policy with respect to China is reckless and dangerous beyond belief. I'm old enough to remember Reagan's late Cold War saber-rattling. This time feels more dangerous, because the government of China is in a stronger position than the old leadership of the USSR, and enjoys more popular support.

Anyway, hopefully the lack of fruitful results from this policy -- characterized by what is being described here -- will play some small part in convincing the electorate that the Trump administration is in over its head, and change is needed.

This isn't a call for coddling our Chinese counterparts -- we have profound differences with them. And we shouldn't leave any doubt as to our view that liberal democratic governance is the optimal way for human societies to organize themselves .

But it is a call for competence.

The Trump administration cannot provide that.

Trump will never do that because he desperatly wants his electorate to watch Fox News and hear leaders around the world use the words ""Chinese virus"". And he wants nothing else. That's the good point with your president : he rarely wishes complicated stuff. Mostly because he could not figure it out I guess."
2020-04-25 11:43,"Seriously, does anyone think that China has reported anything near correct estimations of the destruction from this virus in that region?  The whole of China is built on lies.  What is real about China? Does China even know?

Because. I believe, trust is not reasonably assumed we must bring our supply chains back.  This will create manufacturing jobs and income taxes, educe use of the safety net, assure supply of critical items, and reduce intellectual property loss.

There are countries we can trust, but in my opinion, China is not one of them.  As with Charlie Brown and his sister Lucy we end up flat on our backs with the football we trusted to be planted firmly having been pulled away in our dealings with many non-democratic countries.

Maybe this is China and covid. China made decisions that paid off and big sacrifices were made, the Wuhan lockdown being one. Wuhan was the first, unheard of then; a major deal. It was painful for China and the Chinese.

If the US or to extend the analogy a fellow classmate, likes good results too, instead of making unsubstantiated accusations, time would be better spent cooperating and finding out what it takes to achieve good outcomes.

Kennedy traveled to Europe and, in front of the Berlin wall, shouted ""Ich bin ein Berliner"", making it clear for the USSR which country was the champion of democrcy and world freedom.

2020-04-25 6:05,"Political economy for dummies. When a country exports its manufactures, foodstuffs or raw materials it is an immediate loss. With honest government the account is squared by the receipt of valuable goods or services from the receiving country, or valuable exchange that can be converted to merchandise elsewhere in the world. 

European Union commissioners want trade with China for the simple reason of making their wealthy patrons richer. This is the ken the Chinese Communist Party, informed by Marxist economic theory, understands plainly. Ultimately all costs fall on labour, so by drinking deep of cheap Chinese labour profits are increased, and given paper money growth in Europe always increasing, a superfluity of assets ultimately ends up in the hands of Europe’s wealthy elite. 

The financial mechanism for this transfer of wealth is by the EU running a trade deficit with China, just like America runs a trade deficit with them also, both elites operating on the same principle of getting rich at the expense of their national interest by willingly drinking from a poisoned chalice."

The reality is that violence, warfare and decadence have characterized American life for the past fifty years.  The United States has been in a state of constant warfare and has consistently ignored international law.  In the meantime, China has been increasing its strength and influence without going to war."

It seems to be a cultural and wealth  difference. Poorer countries have the “know how” to control infections cheaply and rapidly.  They’ve managed very well.  Wealthy nations have relied on expensive medical models to improve outcomes. They’ve fared badly. The real story is that we’ve become reliant on medication and vaccines to control viruses and bacteria’s ; we’ve forgotten how to use basic hygiene and quarantine to stop the spread.

2020-04-24 20:47,"A timely article - as a retort to  what a NYT article from Europe reported how America is not leading the world. 

 Readers will recall I strongly disagreed with the premise and conclusions of that article.

If EU can cave in on to such a routine report to keep good with China - I say folks in glass houses etc.----

Readers will recall that I have been urging our Congress to start setting up a 9/11 style commission - to understand and explore China complicity in this Wuhan virus and it's deadly consequences.

Just in my life - China has unleashed 3 viruses on the world - H1N1, SARS and now Wuhan.  Of course, we cannot forget Hing Kong flu of 1960's that also originated in China before China became what it is today.

I have said before, Saddam and Osama would be jealous of China's audacity with bio terrorism.

For life of me - I don't understand why the Security Council does not hold emergency meetings.  UN, WHO - keep issuing warnings, reports but there is no debate.

Luckily, our Congress can rectify it.

This is nothing racial - nothing against Chinese in China who have also suffered or Chinese in America or around the world.

But the Communist Party - intending to remain in power -is not only harming its own citizens but a global population is at risk.

To paraphrase Sen Baker - the simple question Congress needs to answer:

 ”what did China know and when?”"
2020-04-24 22:24,"This sort of thing makes me furious.
The biggest culprit in this situation is China. Period Fact.
They tried to cover up the disease and when that failed knowingly let it spread, no doubt making the cold calculation that being honest would cost only their economy, but letting the virus spread would level the playing ground, maybe even giving them the advantage.
The Western countries must reconsider their relationship with a country whose ethical and ecological record is as disastrous as China’s. 
Do we really want to make them even more powerful????
Enough."
2020-04-25 1:44,"But let's not forget that China was largely able to bring Covid-19 under control in about two months.  While here in the US, even some elected officials are protesting lock downs.  

And the misinformation China propagated wasn't the virus was a hoax.  Instead it was along the line the virus is so bad that President was contemplating a national lock down.

How ironic that if China's misinformation of a forceful federal response in the US were real, we probably wouldn't see over 50K dead."
2020-04-24 20:31,"Thank you for publishing this article. The world needs to know that the virus got out of control precisely because the CCP tried to silence its doctors at the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan. The need for the CCP to save face at the cost of lives is appalling. That they continue to try to save face by spreading disinformation and lying to the international community is, in my opinion, disgusting.

What disgusts me further is that this uptick in anti-Asian sentiment, in the USA and maybe even abroad, is unfounded. These events are the result of missteps by a corrupt government--the CCP. I would urge anybody and everybody to refrain from tying the virus to an ethnic group or location. I think that the name ""CCP virus"" is more fitting."
2020-04-24 21:19,"Why is the thrust of this story any different from what the US govt. does? It throws its weight around to influence others just as much, if not more than China. Frankly, from where I sit (in Australia) this read as racist or, at the very least, naive, reporting. I mean, really, of course China strong arms others to get themselves in a better light.

In fact, the EU stance is one of critical neutrality toward US attempts to blame China for corona virus outbreak.  The text that emerged was not caving to China but a sign of European resistance to heavy lobbying from the US to join in the childish scapegoating (""Wuhan virus"") of China.   
Good for Europe for attempting to preserve international cooperative efforts to curb the virus, efforts that will only work if China is part of them.  Shame on the NYT for implicitly applauding US abdication of global leadership and stiffing the WHO."

2020-04-25 8:52,"Thanks to the NYT for this. For now, I haven't found anything about this in the European media. As I have traveled several times for an extended period in China, since the 1980's, I am well aware of the - frankly - totalitarian nature of the CP.  You have to give it to them, they have done a nice job by alleviating the grinding poverty of many millions of people. But I never believed the mantra that 'capitalism will bring democracy'. The destruction brought upon Tibet during the Mao-period was too horrific to contemplate such a possibility, even remotely. In my mind, from then on, there was no doubt that the rest of the world would, one day, have to deal with a asservive, totalitarian China. 'Totalitarian', meaning that the CP wants 'total control' over, well, ... everything. And certainly about the 'narrative' and perception on, well, ... anything. So, I was not so surprised reading this article. It was good that the writer included a link to the summary of the report on the EU-website. I've read that. It is not so bad as it looks. One is still pointed multiple times to the devious ways of Russian, Chinese and other propaganda and twisted information. This article confirms, once more, the need for a free press, such as the NYT, and total transparant governement, as is practised to a rather great extent in Europe. I will contact my EU-congress(wo)man on this. And I am sure I wil get an answer. That's the way our democracy works. I would not want to live anywhere else."

People are scared to acknowledge that the Chinese government deliberately infected the world.  People were also scared, about 80 years ago, to confront Hitler.  I think the comparison is justified.  Communist China infected the world, deliberately, and knowing full well what it was doing.  How are their intentions unclear?  It's time for the world to respond, before it all gets much worse."

And as always, imagine if HRC or Obama was massively indebted to a hostile foreign government."
2020-04-24 21:21,"The responsibility of China begins long before the current outbreak. The Chinese government understood that incredibly dangerous eating habits were taking place in its country and refused to regulate those practices responsibly after the SARS outbreak that also likely originated in a Chinese wet market in 2002. The National Institutes of Health in the US noted in 2017 that China has historically been a “cradle of zoonoses” because of its unhygienic animal consumption traditions. Many scientific journals have come to the same (or similar conclusions). 

Once the very foreseeable COVID-19 breakout did occur, Chinese authorities punished and censored physicians, scientists and local journalists who tried to sound the alarm, repeatedly denied that the virus could be transmitted between humans, and then held a public banquet in Wuhan for tens of thousands of families. Similar to China’s response to SARS, after a brief period of closure, the Chinese wet markets are now gradually reopening after causing thousands of deaths and trillions of dollars in economic damage globally. In terms of those primarily responsible, the analysis begins there and these facts can't simply be papered over or wordsmithed away."
2020-04-24 22:23,"Unconscionable! China IS the culprit here and a very flagrant, duplicitous one at that!

1. It didn't close down its barbaric, medieval wet markets after SARS. 2. It has been unwilling to outlaw the consumption of wild animals known to be corona virus carriers. 3. It lied about Covid's seriousness. 4. It continues to lie today.

China, the state, can probably get away with the lies. But its people will be persecuted and shunned the world over and collateral damage will be done to anyone who looks vaguely East Asian. In other words, China may win the battle but lose the war.

The damage is done and, if China pushes too far, a show of force by the powerful West is not out of the question."

In January, Europe refused to join the US travel ban on travelers who had been to China during the prior 14 days.  They thus welcomed China travelers and the disease that came with some of them.  Europeans paid the price for their service of China in the form of many thousands of dead Europeans and hundreds of thousands of sickened Europeans.

Now, in order to maintain some financial benefit, the Europeans won't submit to China's demands that the truth must not be spoken about the origin and the cause of this virus.  Europe will keep silent that the virus arose in humans because of the cruel and inhumane China practice of capturing wild animals, keeping them live in inhumane conditions, then bringing them live into the midst of the population where they are butchered and eaten.

Americans who fancy themselves as humanitarians and progressives also refuse to speak the truth about China being the cause of this virus.  Their false progressiveness, like the Europeans, would welcome the disease to America rather than offend their politically correct faux humanitarianism."

Please interview some public health officials in China. They have had far fewer cases and deaths. The virus is under control there. How did they test it and everything else. We don't want an authoritarian government. But we can certainly learn a thing or two from their playbook."
2020-04-28 19:32,"When the coronavirus ""first hit"" the US in Washington state, 'The Daily' did an episode about a research lab in Seattle that was fully equipped to test, but ran into the bureaucracy of approval by the FDA, losing valuable time that could have been used to conduct widespread testing. I remember thinking, 'I know bureaucracy can be annoying and even seemingly counterproductive at times, but not having a vetting process could have other adverse consequences - just because this lab has it under control and can be trusted, does not mean that all others will.' Now, to ""overcorrect"" for the FDA approval debacle that took place w/ diagnostic testing, antibody tests are being produced en masse by the private sector, apparently with no need for government approval. Now, we have all types of tests on the market with varying degrees of accuracy. This is why the bureaucratic approval process is necessary.. because we again are in a situation of not being able to trust the results of the tests being conducted.. which again hinders our ability to confidently reopen the economy."
2020-04-29 0:38,"Before we have a vaccine for COVID-19, we can contain the epidemic by identifying people who have been infected through antibody tests such as the french one distributed by AlephTest (accuracy > 98,85% and 100% of IgG sensitivity). It is the best way to assess the spread of the virus and save as many lives as possible!! I dearly hope that governements will follow that path. However, Oxford's Institute's efforts to find a vaccine are very promising though."
2020-04-29 5:01,"It has not been proven that having COVID results in the development of a memory immune response and therefore a recovered patient may not test positive for having the memory Antibodies that would show up in an antibody test (this is one reason people can get reinfected). In addition, there is no proof, unlike with flu, that having the memory Ab’s make you immune to reinfection.

Also, development of an Ab test is not ‘as easy’ as developing a diagnostic test which Katie states in the episode. To develop a PCR diagnostic you need the genomic sequence, this is ‘easy’ with today’s technology. To develop a surveillance test, which allows you to test for an antibody response (active infection) and a memory antibody response (formerly infected and now recovered) requires knowing who has recovered and what antibodies fight the virus.

I appreciate Katie is knowledgeable about the business of science, but how about having a well spoken scientist who can share reality of testing?"
2020-04-28 15:28,"Terrific episode. Thank you, Michael and Katie.

Michael, is there a way that the Times could get hold of the Obama playbook for controlling pandemics -- the one that was put together after either the Ebola outbreak or the N1-H1 virus and then passed on to the Trump people?

It would surely would be in the interests of transparency to have that information made public. We could then have an open debate as to the best practices and whether or not this administration (in particular) ... or any future one ... was doing it's job."

Bureaucracies are necessary for confirming best scientific practices and equal protection of health and safety but inherently slow, expensive and inefficient, such as the bungled FDA response to COVID-19 testing early on. Free market solutions are much faster and efficient but are inherently profit driven and siloed such as the tests subsequently developed by private labs that required unique machines, supplies & supply chains (many from our economic foe China?!?!!) If we had no private labs our testing would have been even slower to roll out. If we relied solely on private labs the public is at risk of bad quality control and exclusion from low income or uninsured people such as we are seeing with the many non-FDA verified serum antibody tests that have exploded onto the scene.
What to do for future preparedness? What’s the lesson??"

2020-04-30 13:38,"I think this episode was very short on important information and it's a shame because testing is CRUCIAL to getting ahead of the virus. Katie Thomas did not have nearly enough scientific information about ""immunity"", it is still not clear if there is in fact immunity from those who have been infected with and recover from the virus, nor how long immunity lasts. Michael very dangerously keeps referring to immunity as a sure thing once you have been infected. Second major issue, the diagnostic swab test is discussed in detail, but there is not discussion of other faster tests out there that don't require PPE for health care workers, a salive test is being used by Rutgers in Edison, New Jersey for example. Definitely should have addressed this. Also, an infrastructure for how to administer nationwide testing needed to be part of this discussion. How do we get disenfranchised, homeless, poor, and at risk workers workers tests easily. This was a very important topic to dedicate an episode to and unfortunately fell far short of what was needed in terms of information and scope of the issue.

2020-04-30 6:41,"The guest today closes the podcast by laying the blame for the testing issues at the feet of the healthcare system in the US. There is no doubt that the US system has many flaws, but connecting the lack of comprehensive testing to the lack of a overarching healthcare system is an easy assumption that does not stack up. The UK has a comprehensive healthcare system that many reference as a model for the US. Despite the government led NHS, the testing is even worse here than it is in the US. I currently work in a leadership role in healthcare in London and I have seen first hand the massive gaps in testing. Currently, NHS hospital workers do not have direct access to testing and attempts to provide are clumsy and ineffective. The failure of comprehensive testing lays at the feet of both the US and UK governments. Despite healthcare systems at different ends of the spectrum, neither has proven capable of providing this critical weapon in the battle against COVID."

What I find more interesting is whether there is legal malpractice here. Davis Polk was well aware, as were the general public that Covid19 could represent a serious health problem for the US. I would think that Kirkland should also have been aware of that issue and guard against. Did Kirkland advise Sycamore? Did Sycamore execute the contract with knowledge of the potential problem? Did Kirkland have Sycamore sign off on a letter with respect to that provision and advise against signing the contract?
It will be interesting to see how this plays out."

2020-04-29 20:04,"This is an incomplete analysis of the issue.

First, ""pandemic"" is not novel in material adverse effect clauses and was even in the merger agreement that was the subject of the Akorn v. Fresenius--a 2018 case where the Delaware courts for the first time found a material adverse effect to have occurred (though pandemic was not at issue).  

Second, you should look at the case between Cooper Tire and Apollo from a few years back in Delaware where Apollo was permitted to terminate the merger agreement due to a breach of a pre-closing covenant to operate the seller's business in the ordinary course. The court expressly rejected the argument that a carve-out in the material adverse effect definition would preclude the termination because the carve-out (in this case labor disputes and effects arising from the merger), as drafted, only qualified the effects on the seller's business/operations and not the ability of the seller to close the merger (the same construct as the L Brands agreement).  The agreement was structured this way because the buyer was getting financing to complete the transaction and therefore needed assurance that there would be no effect (or breach) that would hinder buyer's access to the financing.  

It is unknown how the Delaware courts will approach the pandemic-related litigation generally, but to say that ""luck may have run out"" ignores the reality of how Delaware courts analyze this type of agreements and adjudicate this type of dispute."

2020-04-29 20:44,"This article does not accurately describe the contract clause that is subject of the dispute.  Mr. Stewart writes that ""In the acquisition agreement, the lawyers carved out specific exceptions to those acts of God, including a pandemic. That meant that even if a pandemic struck, Sycamore would be legally obligated to complete the deal.""  This is incorrect.

The clause here, in relevant part, defines a MAC as:

""...any state of facts, circumstance, condition, event, change,
development, occurrence, result or effect (i) that would
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
performance by Parent of its obligations under this
Agreement or Parent’s consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; or (ii) that has a material
adverse effect on the financial condition, business, assets, or
results of operations of the Business, EXCLUDING, in the case of clause (ii), any state of facts, circumstance, condition, event, change, development, occurrence, result or effect to the extent directly or indirectly resulting from … (H) pandemics…""

So, while there is an exclusion for pandemics, that exclusion applies only to the type of MAC described in clause (ii).  The type of MAC described in clause (i) has no exclusion for pandemic.  Sycamore's argument is that what happened here is a ""clause (i) MAC,"" as to which there is no pandemic exclusion, and thus it is not obligated to close."

The Trump reality show went on on a daily base. I expected Biden to speak up daily as well. I wanted to see him fired up, correcting Trump and pointing out his lies and misinformation, yet there was silence.

Joe Biden may be well known among his constituents and in dem circles, but has remained a rather unknown quantity to voters at large, unnoticed by many before his vice-presidency and as vice-president, more than anything, remaining in the shadows. 

If his campaign wants to sway uncommitted voters, he and his ideas need more publicity. As this show demonstrates, this may be difficult in the times of the virus."

2020-04-29 16:20,"Why would we trust any report out of China? How were the tests conducted? What independent body had full access to the testing throughout? We would not just trust Gilead's results either. 

China has shown time and time again their actions are from motives that are self serving. I am not into conspiracy theories but I see no benefit to China if this drug works. Much of its production appears that it would not have much dependence on China."
2020-04-29 16:23,"It is a scandal that Gilead is coaching a message of success when the message should be of cautiousness and rational setting of expectations. 

We have enough studies to indicate that the drug, if effective, is only of limited benefit. That the positive effect is nuanced enough to warrant further study. But that’s it. 

Touting silver bullets when they are not any, outside of prevention and epidemiological control, only erodes trust and sets the stage for further despair."
2020-04-29 16:36,"It is not that surprising that the drug offers no benefit to severely ill patients, where the lungs are already irreversibly damaged and inflammation is driven by secondary infections and tissue decay rather than the virus.

This is like hoping to save a gangrenous leg in a diabetic patient by lowering the blood sugar:  Too little, too late!

Remdesivir as an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase - an enzyme that is required for virus replication - and thus reduces viral propagation, is far more likely to be beneficial earlier in the disease where virus replication is driving the disease, not at a late stage where secondary infections or destroyed lungs make it ineffective."
2020-04-29 16:42,"As an oncologist, I find this encouraging.   Early studies will have the sickest of the sick.
The next question is when to use it.   Most likely before the most severe lung damage.  And maybe in combination with an
IL-6 inhibitor.   Childhood cancer cure rates soared when clinical trials of drug combinations took place, with strict eligibility criteria and strict rules about timing,"
2020-04-29 16:43,"Nothing is perfect
Nothing works for everybody 

But a treatment that saves a percentage of covid-19 patients is excellent news

Hopefully it’s a large percentage 

And it sounds like there is positive news from the UK on a vaccine

Our government has made a lot of mistakes that unnecessarily resulted in rapid spread of the coronavirus 

If something can reduce the inevitable second wave that will come from opening for business too soon, many of us will be fortunate"
2020-04-29 16:44,"Remdesivir is an antiviral drug.  Therefore it should be given during early stages of infection, when viral replication rates are high, not in late stage critical patients who are largely suffering from immune overactivation, including clotting, cytokine storms, that take on a life of their own, independent of the virus."
2020-04-29 16:51,"Well, Dr Fouci is giving the results now (so that is better than Trump) and it seems good for remdesivir, so that is good news, but then he said something like ""not statistically significant,"" so now I am very confused. 30% difference sounds significant, so maybe it was another metric.

It is not surprising that a antiviral might work earlier in the disease, but not later on in severe patents due to the issue with the overreaction of the immune system that is seen in a lot of severe cases.

Now he says they may start trials to combine the antiviral with an anti inflammatory - which makes sense - let's hope for the best."
2020-04-29 16:57,"These are encouraging results.  It certainly appears the drug has some effect, but it is far from a silver bullet.  The drug needs to be adminstered intravenously, so it's probably only applicable for hospitalized patients.  What we need is an effective vaccine to prevent disease.  The next best would be a treatment that is orally administered that can be used early on to prevent a person from becoming very sick.  Remdesivir is neither of these.  Better than nothing, but not a game changer."
2020-04-29 16:59,Not shaping up as a game changer. Bret Stephens probably is undeterred in his belief that this drug is a reason we should all be very grateful to Big Pharma.
2020-04-29 17:08,"Perhaps I am unacquainted with how to interpret medical studies. I do notice from the Lancet article that 12% of patients had to have the drug stopped because of ""adverse effects."" What these adverse effects are are not mentioned in the study nor in your reporting. That is a fairly high percentage of patients who might be effected by these ""adverse effects"" enough to have the drug stopped. 
Hydroxychloroquine was a miracle hope for a while, until its adverse effects became apparent. Please, let us get rid of out hope for a pill to replace onerous masking, distancing, cleaning, etc."
2020-04-29 17:08,Results should not surprise.  Many antiviral drugs have to be started early on to be effective.
2020-04-29 17:11,"Could be a game changer if the drug is effective if prescribed earlier in the disease progression. Safety profile indicates a well tolerated drug.

Srory to all those who are hoping nothing works."
2020-04-29 17:16,"And the media present at Dr. Fauci's announcement were all ""is it a vaccine? Is it a vaccine?"" No, sorry, not the sexy vaccine -- only a hopeful development in TREATMENT for making sick people better. As an antiviral, it makes sense that it will be most effective on patients early in the course of the disease before their bodies are totally ravaged. Hopefully, the appropriate application will be developed more quickly than it took for HIV, which took about 30 years before antivirals were given at the outset of infection."
2020-04-29 17:19,"Infectious disease experts are shaking their heads.  Information is getting misunderstood by general readers and headlines don't help.  We are still uncertain about it.  At this point, from a science standpoint, other studies, better ones,  would be done; determination would be made about if and in what kinds of patients it may help.  The point is that it is premature for conclusions.  That's why science is unpopular with many.  It can be slow.  It may not give immediate answers. It needs repetition.  Results need confirmation follow-up studies.  It is not accurate for headlines to read the it doesn't work, in fact quite misleading."
2020-04-29 17:27,"Dr. Fauci's announcement this morning at the White House was informative, science-based, and hopeful. The severe phase of infection was shortened by a matter of days, with a p value, he said, of 0.001. The death rate was not significantly different. But the positive effect on the disease now warrants, he said, that patients in the placebo wings of trials receive Remdesivir... which for now becomes the new standard of care. New trials will compare Rem + Other agents against Rem alone. Anyone who recalls the early announcements on AZT and HIV decades ago will understand what the ""end of the beginning"" means in finding therapeutic mixes."
2020-04-29 17:36,"While I along with countless others would desperately like for this drug to work, upon reading the studies, the evidence just isn't there. There have been multiple studies in multiple countries on remdesivir and the evidence thus far is inconclusive--it may at best be helpful for a small subset of patients, but until we know that it's too hazardous for wide use due to the potential for side effects that may actually be harmful. That is, it's not a matter of ""giving it early"", it's a matter of seeing whether it actually helps a subset of patients at all without causing undue toxicity. That hasn't been shown yet, so it's way too early to give it as a general treatment. 

On reflection this shouldn't be surprising, Gilead developed the drug for a very different virus (Ebola) and SARS-CoV-2 is so different, structurally and otherwise, that it would be surprising if remdesivir did not much at all for it. And even against Ebola results were mixed at best. I know we're all desperate for even modest good news but this overhyping of drugs with at best modest effects backfires spectacularly, reducing public trust and potentially diverting resources from other interventions that may be more worth pursuing and using."
2020-04-29 16:00,"This seems more like a stock price manipulation and exciting new 'snake oil' distraction than actual coronavirus progress.

Trump is expected to discuss the findings at a White House briefing later today....where he will replace his previous 'miracle cures' with remdesivir.....by proclaiming it as ""the most incredible drug in the history of modern medicine....which by the way, I've been working on with scientists for a very long time""

(FROM Reuters today) - ""Gilead Sciences Inc’s experimental drug remdesivir does NOT speed up recovery from COVID-19 compared with placebo in critically-ill, hospitalized patients, according to data from a trial in China published in the Lancet.

The authors of the study warned that interpreting the trial finding is limited as it was stopped early after they were unable to recruit enough patients due to the steep decline in cases in China.

The authors conclude that more evidence from ongoing clinical trials is needed to better understand if remdesivir can provide meaningful clinical benefit."""

It makes me wonder if we are only trying out drugs that would make our own pharma richer. If so, what a shame. I've ordered some boxes of LianHua QingWen to have on hand in case someone in my extended family gets sick. It's better than what I got from my medical provider, which was ""Come in if you are coughing up more than a tablespoon of bright red frothy blood."" Not that helpful."

If this one drug can replace tens of Anton medicine - I say - more power to this drug."

While there is the urge to use anything that might lessen its effects, it seems side effects are revealed only after the drug is used enough to find them. We had high hopes for hydroxychloroquine until we found it could be harmful to some patients with heart or eye conditions. What was skipped over in the study in Lancet was that 12% of patients experienced adverse reactions serious for the drug to be discontinued. Until further studies on the drug and its adverse effects, I advise Wall Street to wait a little on popping open the champagne bottles."

2020-04-30 2:58,Dr. Nissen’s comments are out of place and without foundation. They appear to be provided so as to have a counter weight to Dr. Fauci’s cautiously optimistic view. Calling Dr. Fauci “silly” may reveal where Dr. Nissen is coming from.
2020-04-30 0:08,"The Gilead phase 3 trial data should be interesting. At the end of May they are scheduled to release results of a trial of remdesivir in moderately ill COVID-19 patients. Preliminary data from their other trial suggests that remdesivir is more effective if given early in the course of illness. 

The NIAID study was separate from the Gilead studies, and specifically involved people with advanced COVID-19. 

So, there may in fact be better news coming at the end of May. The problem will be a practical one: it's an IV drug, so it isn't likely to be given to people with moderate COVID-19 in the real world, since testing is so sparse and it's the people with advanced disease who get admitted to the hospital, and tested. 

If only they had remdesivir in a pill form, as there is with Fujifilm's at-least-equally-promising anti-COVID-19 antiviral, favipiravir, (which costs $3-5 a pill and is being mass produced by the Japanese government for low-cost or free-of-charge distribution around the world, a-hem).

And one other thing, NYT. Now that there is encouraging data on remdesivir, you need to say ""Remdesivir, brought to you by Donald J. Trump"". They're already changing the labeling."
2020-04-30 5:14,"I don't understand Fauci's joy regarding this drug.  It seems to have a very small effect and we don't know the side effects.  There are physician organizations that recommend hydrochloroquine, yet Fauci doesn't appear to like that treatment.  I have to say I'm not altogether a fan of Fauci.  I heard that Gilead, the pharma that developed this drug, is a big financial contributor to the NIH.  I had no idea this is permitted...and I think it's dangerous.  A definite conflict-of-interest.  Is this why Fauci likes this drug so much?"

There is real science in play here but if it doesn't fit your narrative you jump to early conclusions about it.  Look in the mirror my friends.  We do not yet know if this drug is effective or not.  Let the research and scientific inquiry run its course.  Either this drug will work or it won't.  That's the thing about employing the scientific method.  It is neutral.
2020-04-30 10:06,"We are in a difficult spot. As with all meds, true double blind studies (the gold standard) are needed. That said, if it as least does no harm, then it can, in the mean time be given to some patients in the hope that it will help them. Still, we must work the control the hype. We seem not to be looking at a magic bullet, but rather something which may help some patients recover quicker and may prevent a few deaths. That's all good. 

Where Fauci gets to ""standard of care"" when what it really is is ""all we have, though results are modest at best"" is beyond me."
2020-04-30 10:11,"Maybe it is time to have a better look at the medicine that are actually used against Covod-19.

The article does its readers a disservice by once again citing the discredited Veteran trial of hydrochloroquine. In fact it is used in many places and there are studies showing positive effects too. 

There are also other medicine being used. A recent SCMP article mentioned doctors in Hong Kong prescribing a ""cocktail of lopinavir and ritonavir along with interferon beta"" with the latter being the ""backbone""."
2020-04-30 11:18,"Everyone wishes this will be the magic bullet but in fact this is magical thinking, the type Trump engages in. In reality, not the world of politically  motivated  action, Remdesivir awaits the scrutiny of clinical trials which require rigor, replication and different types of validation before any medication can appropriately and safely be advocated for use. Let's pray the diligent scientists continue to do their work and unlock the key to containing this virus but in the meantime social distance, masks and patience need to continue"
2020-04-30 11:55,"Cuts duration of illness and mortality by 30%. What math are the writers using to say that is ‘modest’? If instituted from the beginning we are talking about tens of thousands of lives saved and a much lower infection rate. This is why the markets responded, wall street is much better at math."
2020-04-30 12:12,"If you don't have anything - don't get me started with hydroxychloroquine - getting some efficacy from Remdesivir is indeed the standard of care. Clinically, 8 instead of 11 deaths may not be significant, but 3 people saved is 3 people saved. 

But Dr Fauci's argument is really the best. Reducing hospital stay by 4 days is huge. Not only it frees up needed beds and equipments, but only from the infectious perspective. Nosocomial infection, aka hospital acquired infection, has been a vexing problem for decades even without the presence of the coronavirus. SARSCoV2 is a highly contagious disease. If HCWs like doctors and nurses can themselves go under, imagine the longer stay with a weakened immune system.

Saying Remdesivir is a cure is a straw man. No one with any gravitas would say that. But for a demoralized healthcare professional, it is a shot in the arm.

Here is a simple challenge: if Dr Nissen is assigned to COVID19 ER, does he ignore Remdesivir - if available - and do nothing for the incoming?"
2020-04-30 12:37,"This is a tragedy in the making.
This was not a controlled study. Claiming effectiveness based on what happened to prior patients  is fraught with probable errors.
The claim was released by the drug company. Everyone should wait until the study is published in a respected medical journal.
Very often statistical results are not clinical benefits.
One objective piece of data would be if the drug reduced the viral load. We do not know that.
Now that theFDA has released the drug for every physician to use the likelihood of a trail with controls is gone.
We are living in a scientific mad house and the inmates are running the place."
2020-04-30 13:22,"It's nice for prominent physicians to demand the protocols used in normal times: peer review, presentation of results in a medical setting or convention. These are not normal times. Over 60,000 Americans have died of Covid in a short time, the nation's economy is crashing ""at warp speed"". When Germany was thought to be developing a nuclear weapon FDR, at Einstein's behest, listened and the Manhattan Project succeeded, in secret, and saved 1 million American casualties. Few are suggesting that treatments be used that are unproven; anecdotal studies do not become the standard of care; the studies in progress (one already announced yesterday) are randomized, controlled studies: the gold standard in Medicine. Time is of the essence; people are dying."
2020-04-30 14:29,"As much as I respect Dr. Fauci, to deem remdesivir the standard of care prior to obtaining results from a larger study is irresponsible. While there was a reduction of length of symptoms the number of deaths in the remdesivir group was approximately 40, while that in the placebo group was about 58 - given the size of the study this is not statistically significant difference. What was not discussed is the side effects caused by remdesivir - in one small study ""25% of patients receiving it have severe side effects, including multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome, septic shock, acute kidney injury and low blood pressure. Another 23% demonstrated evidence of liver damage on lab tests."""
2020-04-30 14:39,"As an MD researcher, this is a well-balanced piece, and what seems clear is that the results are not “conclusive,”  as indicated by less promising, through weaker, data from other sources.  What is clear is that multiple underlying factors may impact the disease, and that there is not one type of patient, hence a need for more data.  However, they do indicate that this anti-viral approach has activity, and thus an approach with promise.  Waiting for publication makes little sense in the current situation.  Anyone who has submitted a paper for publication in the last decade is likely to agree that “peer review” is not the same in terms of quality assurance, even for major journals, as it was in the past.  That said, Nissen is correct in saying we need to see the actual data - and not only the efficacy and safety, but baseline demographics so the type of patients studied can be considered.   Hopefully all research will continue, and not narrow down on this particular approach if these data are over-promoted."
2020-04-30 12:09,What is wrong with our system that the White House corona task force announced a drug is the new standard of care?   This should be accepted for what it is - a sign of desperation from a White House that is looking for any slither of good news.  Very disappointed in Fauci.

1. That it has not been possible to develop either a vaccine or a monoclonal antibody against coronaviruses in the last 17 years.
2. It has never been possible to develop a vaccination against any coronavirus.
3. We still do not have a recognized and broadly applicable, defined therapy; we have never been able to present such a therapy for influenza either. ""

In his update (in German) of April, 20 2020 he added:

""The fact that a corona virus may contain an HIV/Ebola genome - e.g. by cross-breeding when COVID-19 infects an HIV/Ebola-positive patient and then spreads - should be warning enough. Should one day a super-bug emerge that combines the ""corona genome of rapid spread"" with the ""Ebola genome of the 90% mortality rate"", we should have an advanced, interdisciplinary pandemic concept that really works."""

Pull a failed drug off the shelf, have a small clinical trial, put the drug out to the masses since people are dying like flies. Problem: the drug didn't prolong life and in fact did more harm than good with the dosage prescribed at its introduction. More people survived HIV by treating (and preventing) opportunistic disease associated with HIV infection; PCP (pneumocystis pneumonia) was then the cause of the majority of deaths. PCP prevention (using Bactrim/Septra) as prophylaxis saved thousands of lives. Dr. Fauci played a role in developing guidelines to treat/prevent opportunistic disease then. We need guidelines today to recognize/treat/prevent ""silent hypoxia"" and the ""cytokine storm"" related to COVID19 infection from dying. Maybe Ms Kolata can tell us what might be in the loop concerning my topic; she was important in getting info out during the worst of times in the HIV epidemic. Thank you for this article Gina."

2020-04-30 11:22,"Another big Pharma scam.  Sick for 11 days instead of 14, but still sick.  Another scam to boost a big Pharma company's stock prices and income.  Like many of the touted ""miracle"" cancer drugs that help prolong suffering for 6 or 7 months instead of 4 or 5."
2020-04-30 12:54,"Interesting. When Trump first mentioned about hydroxychloroquine, I've told those Trumpets around me it won't work at all. They argued that their POTUS is correct. I just simply told them that logically, if it works well, then every countries would have already use hydroxychloroquine a lot to cure the patients and save so many lives. There will be no need to lock down anymore. But we're still under lock down, so that means the hydroxychloroquine is not working. 

We can use the same logic here as well. If remdesivir turns out to be a great medicine against coronavirus, then why the Europeans didn't use it. There has been a clinical trial for remdesivir in China, and it was stopped because there are not enough patients to support the trial further. However, what they find out is that remdesivir is not doing any better than the control group. If you compare the results between the trials in China and the USA, actually they are about the same. The reason why the 'experts' in the USA claimed remdesivir shows some benefits is because they lower the requirement for the drug.

The POTUS needs an efficient drug for the coronvirus to claim his complete victory and get this chaos under his control. That's why he is so desperately saying all kinds of misleading or even fake news about the curement of coronvirus, which even killed many Americans. Right now, vaccine is still the best choice and scientists from Oxford has already developed some vaccine successfully."
2020-04-30 15:09,"What encourages people like Fauci about this drug is not that it's a panacea but that its mechanism against the virus yields a path forward to the development of other, perhaps even better drugs. That's exactly what happened, as Fauci mentioned, with HIV. AZT didn't provide a cure or even remission for very long on its own, but it did lead to the development of many other drugs in that class. And it's still used today, very effectively, along with a cocktail of other drugs to control the virus and hold patients at an undetectable level. Because Covid-19 doesn't have the lifetime effects of HIV, prospects for the development of other drugs with this action are cause for optimism."

Two young black men today were in a zero distancing discussion with a woman (also black). They were helping her unload a truck. She was the only one masked. The trio stood in the doorway and didn't catch on that they left no room for others to pass. The woman, older, had to offer some guidance to her crew: they didn't see the situation they were creating.

I had to handle the situations diplomatically because I can't play the role of the scold.

I was at Whole Foods yesterday and dutifully read the instructions on the front door before entering, but completely missed the fact that the shopping aisles were all labeled ""one way."" It wasn't mentioned in the printed lobby instructions. It only became apparent to me as I stood at checkout.

I felt safer a week ago. I'll be cutting back on my errands, even to the isolated storage rental where these two groups of people were not looking out for themselves and were inattentive to the coming and going of others.

While middle and upper class (predominantly white) citizens are holed up at home regardless of their personal risk profile, we have thrown our more economically vulnerable (disproportionately people of color) citizens to the wolves as essential workers regardless of their personal risk profile. I have so much guilt being a healthy woman in her 30s who is working at home, when I go to my local grocery and see it staffed by many older people, some of whom I know have underlying health conditions. The ease with which so many of my fellow Democrats have declared that lockdowns need continue indefinitely while not addressing the inherent inequality of who has the luxury of social-distancing is so upsetting to me. Who, precisely, is delivering your instacart? Who is making that takeout food?"
2020-04-30 16:17,The clear message is if you are an essential worker regardless of race you fall into the high risk profile. Statistically if you are young (<60) and have no serious underlying health issues the probability of dying from COVID is very low or about the same as from the common flu.

Indeed, no citizen's life is a trade-off for the economy. That certainly must include front-line essential workers -- from meat-processing employees, bus drivers, grocery store clerks and more. This CDC report is a first step to calling out the problem. Now, may the response of public health officials,  both state and federal, not become too simplistic, too indifferent and, for too many people, much too late."

Maybe not at the high levels that it is affecting African Americans (yet), but in Hall County and other “poultry country” counties, the poultry plants have seen 400+ cases in the past week alone, the majority of which are Hispanic workers. One poultry worker in Georgia, Hispanic man in his 60’s, is known to have died. And yet these plants remain open. 

I implore people to please stop buying chicken right now. Hardworking people in Georgia are risking their lives in these plants so that you can stock your deep freeze. Is it really worth it to you? I’ve struggled to get my own mother to understand the gravity of this situation because she is a Southern cook who can’t bear the idea of not having chicken stocked in the freezer. Well, it’s time to change our way of thinking about chicken, and all meat that comes through a processing plant for that matter.

Everyone please take a moment to google what a poultry processing plant looks like inside. The nature of the work environment makes it impossible to maintain social distancing and adequate hygiene practices.  I’m just not willing to sacrifice lives for a freezer full of chicken. Are you?"

At least this article quotes Dr. Frederick (cancer surgeon, head of Howard University, African American) as saying the number of patients studied (309) is very small and may not be a representative sample.

Out of curiosity I looked at various online coronavirus databases and in a few minutes found several US counties where the black and Hispanic populations have coronavirus cases and death rates LOWER than those among whites in the same counties. I haven’t seen any NYT stories and headlines about that.

The NYT has a special unit that gathers and graphically presents US and world-wide data on coronavirus. If the NYT is devoted to presenting fair and unbiased reporting, perhaps it should task its coronavirus data-crunching team to do random samples, or better yet 100%, analysis of county-by-county US data on coronavirus cases and deaths differentiated by race, income level, pre-existing conditions, etc.

I suspect such a thorough analysis would show some differences in urban vs suburban vs rural groups, but that a common factor would be poverty level, probably more so than race.

That is, when data for hundreds of thousands of patients are analyzed, affluent blacks will probably show coronavirus rates similar to those of affluent whites, and poor blacks will probably show rates similar to those of poor whites."

Let me be clear:  Black bodies and lives are (yet again) being put on the front lines by this crisis.    Black neighborhoods in Chicago have historically borne the brunt of polluting heavy industry and have also suffered from serious underinvestment.    We already had a public health crisis in the Black community here in Chicago, and this virus is only making it worse.    When people say that we should “reopen”, they are essentially saying that Black lives don’t matter."

2020-04-30 16:17,"“As Georgia reopens many businesses over objections from President Trump”. This is a dishonest deviation from truth since Trump urged early opening of business in an ‘open, don’t open’ exchange with Georgia’s governor last week. The Georgia governor was an easy mark for Trump because he did not even admit the seriousness of the virus until late in it’s National rampage through US citizens. His attitude of ‘what me worry’ was roundly mocked. Now he is opening his State for another bum’s rush by the virus."

2020-04-30 16:39,"Blacks are at more risk for infection due to multiple factors, vocations, neighborhoods, crowded housing and possibly attitudes too.  Where I live, I see blacks, not whites, walking shoulder to shoulder while wearing masks.  Blacks are at risk too for complications due to higher rates of obesity among them.  Obesity is a major risk factor once one is infected."
2020-04-30 16:49,"Unless there is supplementary evidence showing that the vast majority of the black infection rate is tied to essential jobs, the assumption has to be that the guidelines were not taken seriously in higher density black communities... unless someone is positing that there is genetic racial component to the virus, I don’t really see what else is to be gathered... additionally, the sample size of infections the data, and consequently these attention grabbing headlines use, is so, so small and likely inaccurate. When someone says “4 of 5”, the difference in scale in a recorded infection rate couple be a couple dozen people.

They all proclaim, it would make government too big!  Oh!No! It would make us a “nanny state”!  Oh! No! It costs too much!  When in reality it is the attitude like that of my ex-husband’s “I’m ok, so why worry about all those other people?”  
You don’t think that a national system of health care delivery would not be helping right now in this time of pandemic?  That the testing and measuring could have not been rolled out more quickly?  It is becoming clear that those underlying untreated health conditions are faring worse outcomes when sickened with the virus.  How many of these deaths would have been prevented if there had better access to health care?  
Well, never mind, I guess,it like yelling into the wind. Those with the attitude of only looking out only for one’s self won’t hear.  As long as they get to stay at home and order their steaks and wine, there’s little thought to packs and delivers it. Who cares?  It’s not their problem.  
The experience of this pandemic should lead to a national health care solution for all Americans. It is everybody’s problem now."

This is certainly not the case in the UK where (BAME) non Anglo-Saxons are also being worst hit by COVID-19.

BAME as do Anglo-Saxons have free access to the NHS with no discrimination. There are a high proportion of BAME working in the NHS hospitals and just to day it has been suggested they should be withdrawn from nursing COVID-19 patents as BAME are catching COVID-19 more than Anglo-Saxons.
I am an avid reader of the New york times, Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph and noted from the start BAME were being most affected by COVID-19 irrespective to class or access to health care as in Europe the population pay for their healthcare in are taxes and there is no charge for attending  the Doctors or Hospital. 

Main difference is BAME seem to congregate in the cities and use the public transport. Still does not account for the number of deaths."

2020-04-30 17:14,"Why is this a surprise.  This data explains why someone like Gov. Kemp or a President like Trump would see little or no harm in reopening before we are ready.

The Republicans literally do not care about black Americans.  If they did, they would not propose laws designed to disenfranchise them at every turn and appoint judges and justices willing to play along.

Republicans fight health care reforms more likely to help black Americans and fight education reforms that do the same.

My guess-deep down, when Kemp heard that he would not harm the white population of his state by re-opening early, he viewed it as not harming anyone that mattered."
2020-04-30 17:14,"Broadly, the message of extra caution is well taken.   However, to say a particular racial group, or any other sorting, such as by income, geography, or occupation, makes the sorted cohort more fundamentally vulnerable from a biological POV requires that all other potentially contributing factors, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension be carefully controlled for, before making claims about race or ethnicity per se.   

You know this, and should say so, readily and steadily.  

At the very least, in order to both further thoughtful, scientific integrity in reporting, and to avoid raising, unnecessarily and unhelpfully, divisive attitudes, your article and headlines should consistently make this clear, right up front.   Why do otherwise?  To stoke division?  Towards what positive end?

Bottom line:   We have no idea yet whether race or skin color per se is a significant and unique risk factor for increased morbidity or mortality from this Coronavirus.    

Please, get it right, and say all the important truth."

2020-04-30 17:30,"A new Mt. Sinai study suggests the reason for disproportionate impact of the virus on the black population is vitamin D deficiency.

Per the study, vitamin D deficiencies present more frequently in darker-skinned individuals because increased melanin pigmentation absorbs more sunlight and reduces the available ultraviolet-B radiation needed to generate vitamin D production in the skin.

This study suggests that having darker skin, by itself, increases C-19 risks."
2020-04-30 17:26,It appears that Georgia has not reached its peak in daily new infections.  On 4/28 the 5 day average of new cases was 582 up from 472 on 4/24. Daily deaths are increasing as well.  But the big problem with Georgia is that it has tested only 1.3% of its population so there is no doubt whatsoever that it is under-counting the true case load.  To say that it is safe to open up Georgia is ludicrous.  First time I have every agreed with President Trump.

IMHO, this man is not fit to operate a broom, but my state of Georgia is burdened with him. When you think how close Stacey Abrams came to winning, it irritates me to no end that we have to suffer such incompetence when true leadership was just a hacked ballot box away.

2020-04-30 18:03,"Any examination of Georgia's racial disparity in infections, hospitalizations and deaths related to the virus requires a close look at the state's abysmal public health care system, Medicaid reductions and SNAP (food stamp) shrinkage. The Republican party led by Governor Kemp and his GOP predecessors systematically undermined these safety nets, motivated by sheer meanness.
They are clever. Applying for these benefits is a daunting task, even for those who have a good education. The applications were designed with trickery in mind. The online versions work poorly if at all. Local agencies are grossly understaffed or dormant.
The consequences of such mindless government policies are in plain sight at ICU units, empty schools, vacant sports facilities and the obituary pages each day."

2020-04-30 17:47,"Sitting in my apartment in the Bronx I have some advice to the good citizens of Georgia : wear a mask. The very minute , the very second they made wearing a mask mandatory here in NYC, the numbers starting going down , the last metric to go down is the fatalities, which always lag behind but even they are coming down. Masks only work with 100 percent compliance, and we could be doing better , we really could, but there remains a stubborn 15 to 20 percent of the population that can’t be bothered with wearing a mask. 
  The mayor of NYC is a convert, he waited a long time to embrace the mask, but the numbers don’t lie, and like any convert he is a zealot , making all kinds of rules that will keep the maskless out of stores , out of banks , out of any confined space where people breathe the save air. 
  Open up Georgia and lead the way , but wear your mask , your mask is your new best friend . Here is my strategy , when I am out for a walk I wear a mask , but when I go into battle , into a grocery store , I put on two masks, I put on glasses, and I stay frosty.
  Georgia you can lead the way but my advice is to learn from New York . Many people died here in New York to teach the lesson , learn from them , learn from our mistakes and learn from what we learned . Masks save lives. 
  Respect the virus , it has many tricks including asymptotic spreaders , but one trick it hasn’t learned , what to do when every face is covered up by a mask."

Especially obesity. That's it. If Georgian Stacey Abrams -- a potential vice-president of the United States -- wants to do something truly significant for her community and state, it would be to lead a weight-loss program aimed not at life, but to get weights down for the duration of the outbreak.

This story gives an extremely favorable view of the poor community, designating them as working in essential businesses. That I will agree with to an extent, but clearly you're missing something pretty critical. 

This community is not set up well to survive a crisis like this largely due to the way of life we see. Many people living within a single home, lack of respect towards social distancing measures, etc. Painting this issue as the government's fault is kind of ridiculous.

No one should be held responsible for becoming sick or dying from a virus that you cannot see. Anyone could be a potential victim. But there are clear ways to prevent exposing yourself. Don't go to the beach or be around crowds. 

Constantly painting the issue as if they are dying because they're black and the govt doesn't care is disingenuous. There isn't anything a govt can do if people don't respect the calls, no matter their race. Of course the poor community is going to be more at risk, but what are we to do about it? Be responsible in any way you can and stop blaming everything on other people."
2020-04-30 18:07,"I am struck by the mainstream media’s intense focus on and echoing of stories that black people and other people of color are over-represented among coronavirus cases and deaths.

Yes, these cases and deaths are associated with obesity, hypertension,  coronary disease and a number of other underlying conditions. However, these cases and deaths are also associated with—poverty.

There are more poor white citizens than there are black Americans, and than Hispanic citizens.

As we fight the coronavirus pandemic in the US, let us make sure that ALL poor segments of our communities are offered assistance."

Doug Collins, one of Trump's water boys, is the GA 9th District House rep. When then Senator Johnny Isakson stepped down for health reasons, Collins wanted that seat badly - felt he deserved it. But Kemp appointed Kelly Loefler, wife of Jeffrey Sprecher who just happens to be CEO and founder of Intercontinental Exchange - the holding company for the NYSE. 

So Doug and Don are mad at Kemp because he didn't appoint Doug as interim Senator, and possibly because they felt left out from good stock tips and lost money - but that is just speculation. 

As an aside: Ms. Loefler was recently under fire for the ""coincidental"" selling off of her stocks just days before the corona virus was about to tank the economy.  

Kemp's motivation for opening the state now rather than later has to do with eliminating more voters as well as trying to save the GA economy for his big investors. He oversaw his own and Stacey Abrams' gubernatorial campaigns, which is unprecedented since all other Secretarys of State step down for ethical reasons. But not our Kemp.

He immediately scrubbed voter roles, closed polling places in racially and politically strategic areas, and enacted the ""Exact Match"" policy. Even with all that, Kemp won by a (to him) frighteningly small margin. 

Here's another chance to widen that margin for his next run."

There are two groups that domesticated animals more than others - Chinese and Europeans.  We have to ask ourselves, have there been some historic natural selection, whereby these groups have already been selected to be able to withstand coronaviruses more than races that have not had that 10,000 year exposure?  Of course there is no scientific evidence - but I suspect none has been looked for either.

While it's certainly true that minorities are at higher risk due to their occupations, the most obvious reason for the disproportionately high number of black COVID patients is that they have higher numbers of the co-morbities that make people especially vulnerable to COVID as seen in the figures below (report linked below that.)

The question we should be asking is why are health outcomes so much worse in minority populations (my answer is poverty) and then figure what to do about that, as well as concentrate COVID resources in these communities.

The NYT and CDC (which also professed ignorance on this issue) ought to be ashamed of themselves for glossing over this problem.

Most will complain, but do nothing.
Theoretically, the masses could boycott these giants. They could pool resources, and fund/maintain their own locally and cooperatively owned and operated alternatives. But let's face it, that's not going to happen. 

Ask those who complain about their lack of action, and see if you get anything but stammered, poor excuses."

Gutted by Trump appointees at Treasury and Labor, by corporate greed, by ethically-challenged start-ups, by a lack of watchdog overseers...and also a media far too caught up in the daily Trump behaviors. 

The big story now is not just public health failure, but how the job of government serving its people is an unfolding, economic disaster—for the poor, for the hardworking, diverse class of self-employed and contract laborers, for immigrant labor that drive so many crucial industries."

And of course small, low margin businesses based on personal contact won't. Tax policy, antitrust, and other tools might mitigate the situation somewhat later, after the pandemic is over. Meanwhile, this is a clear demonstration that the economy is what it is, not what some prefer it to be."
2020-04-29 1:16,"I believe the sharp drop on the left side of the graph (circa 1982/83) represents the anti-trust spilt of AT&T, which until then had been battling IBM for the top spot.  I don't believe there has been any comparable government action during the past 38 years.  The rise of oil and decline of manufacturing companies accounted for the remaining dilution during the early 1980's.  By 2000, a variety of companies were among the largest, but Microsoft was the dominant software company.  Now, the revenue of all of the largest companies is dependent upon their software capabilities."
2020-04-29 1:37,"The President of the United States recently attempted to broker a deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia (on behalf of the oil cartel), in order to stabilize and then raise the price of oil. That move (which failed) would increase the price of gasoline at the pump and of other consumer goods. At the same time, the oil industry continues to enjoy various tax benefits and other perks, subsidies, and promised access to untapped government-owned lands. This collusion with ""industry behemoths"", baldly carried out in broad daylight at the expense of ""ordinary people"", has been going on for decades. As complaints about the big tech companies grow louder in the US (and among the sourpusses in uncompetitive Europe), some of us might wonder if there is a bit of orchestration among the monopolists and other special interests right under our noses. 

We saw similar crocodile tears when the big box stores decimated grocery and hardware stores; when malls killed a thousand main streets; and when industries created the Rust Belt by moving production to the right-to-work South or abroad. In the end, isn't it better to have Mothra take on Godzilla than have the government protect American buggy-whip makers and state-supported Chinese competitors?."
2020-04-29 1:41,"Who doesn't love and oligopoly ?!

If we don't do that, there will be increasingly insufficient tax revenues to fund basic government services.

The current manipulation will just make the situation worse once the realization will sink in that until a vaccine,  the collapse of all sectors of retail, the catastrophic unemployment, collapse of energy prices and the second wave of Flu+covid-19 in the fall will converge to bring the market down.  Short term speculators will wiggle and twist until their backs are against the wall, but then it will be too late to jump out and be saved from the current dead cat bounce and total collapse of the Market. The most sensible thing would be to freeze speculation for a while use Federal money to cure the economy and provide for unemployed instead of stabilizing this insane market  which is illogical and does not make any sense."

There are two long tables inside, a counter by the windows, and three tiny tables on the sidewalk.

Without legislation like this, we can expect that the crisis will further concentrate our economy into fewer hands.   Those companies sitting on cash, or access to borrowing, will simply devour the others.

The legislation would define large companies as businesses with over $100 million in revenue or market capitalization; private equity companies, hedge funds, or companies majority-owned by them; businesses that have a patent on coronavirus-related products, like personal protective equipment; or transactions otherwise required to be reported to the FTC.

2020-04-29 20:28,"It's almost deceiving, and rather misleading, to say Amazon can keep going during the pandemics because it can keep processing orders online. What's the point of processing the orders when you can't fulfill them? Herein lies the uniqueness and ingenuity of Amazon, because it straddles both the online and offline worlds. Most people (prefer to) overlook Amazon's the very unsexy side of the business in logistics, warehousing, and inventory management. During this pandemics, many a customers have had their orders of medical and cleaning supplies (from face masks to hand sanitizers to gloves and more) canceled even after the orders were processed and paid. Why? Because those orders are fulfilled by sellers directly, rather than by Amazon's warehouse. But, those orders that come straight from Amazon warehouse continue to be delivered (and still in record time). And THIS is what's so amazing about the capability of Amazon. Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft don't even come close.

And this is also the reason why Amazon will continue to grow and grow, and gobble up all those in its path, because it has indeed mastered both the online and offline world. Those online-only outfits (like Google, Facebook, and Zoom) will strive to provide a means of connectedness for people stuck in their homes. But I would argue that Amazon is truly the one colossus that people can't do without."

Strategic benefit to the companies aside the additional collapse of small businesses and hollowing out of US main street is not reflected in this bubble.  The inequality already apparent in the Covid-19 statistics will continue to expand.  And if China and Europe get going faster and build strong links to each other's economies, the power of the dollar leveraged here may be threatened.

Man-Kind ?..."
2020-04-28 16:23,Sweden has disproportionately higher deaths than Denmark or Norway where mandatory lockdown is in vogue. Also fatality rate is  higher.  So did it work better ? No.
2020-04-28 16:24,"Well... this is interesting. I am personally very divided. The Swedish death toll is now around 3,400, so per capita it's ten times more than in its Nordic neighbours. So the human cost is heavy, especially concerning the old people dying in care homes. 

On the other hand, we know now that this virus will stick around for a long time and come in various waves. One cannot resume the lockdown forever, it might be better to save resources for the long game. It might prove in the end that all the countries face the same mortalities – just that the Swedish economy isn't €20 billion in debt like the Finnish one.

What is strange is why Sweden (or rather Tegnell) believes so strongly in herd immunity. Most other sources don't see any evidence about its existence."
2020-04-28 16:26,There absolutely is evidence that herd immunity can be achieved and should be.
2020-04-28 16:43,"This is a case of correlation not relating to causation; yes, Sweden’s death rate is better than Britain’s, but direct neighbors of Sweden - Denmark and Norway - who did issue lockdown orders, had death rates one seventh that of Sweden. The death rate in Sweden is not ‘better’ than Britain when you control for factors such as overall health and demographics of the two very different societies."
2020-04-28 16:53,"As of right now, there is no saying whether Sweden is doing better or worse in terms of mortality rate. Flattening the curve does not mean that the number of deaths decreases-- it means that the total number of deaths is spread out over time to prevent stressing the health care system. Only once this crisis is over will we know who took the best measurements. 

However, Sweden is the clear winner economically. While the US will have a $4 trillion budget deficit, 26 million unemployed and counting, and thousands of failed businesses -- Sweden will not have any of this. If we say that the total number of deaths cannot be prevented. For example, the same number of people will die regardless of whether there is a lockdown or not and shutting down the economy only prolongs the inevitable, then Sweden is the clear winner. Since they did not destroy their economy."
2020-04-28 16:56,"Surfacely this sounds like a workable method as long as the old and vulnerable are protected. However, without the statistics of those who have recovered from the virus with serious after effects, I can’t come to an understanding of how it would work. The possibility of high medical costs for the recovered is a concern. It’s a point that I hear very little about."
2020-04-28 16:59,"As a resident of the country in question, I think it is wise to wait and see how this will play out in the longer run. There has been too little regulations, perhaps, when it comes to cafés and restaurants for example. The pictures of youths out in parks, however, are actually a small minority in society, I would say the overwhelming majority keeps the distance and abide the rules. The million dollar question is really how long this will go on. If in the end this virus will become a seasonal thing and a vaccine only will produced in 1-2 years, then the curve in some other countries will be flatter but the number of infected will be the same in the end."
2020-04-28 17:01,"As a virologist, I would comment that, in the absence of a good antiviral drug or an effective vaccine, the social distancing we are practicing in the USA merely delays the inevitable. This can be a good thing, if it prevents the health system from being overwhelmed but that is all that is achieved. Once we resume normal life, the virus will come back and keep spreading till herd immunity is achieved. If we could be confident that people under, say, 50 are very unlikely to become seriously ill, it would make sense to open everything up, including schools and sporting events, theaters etc, but restrict access to people under 50 for a two month period. By then, we might be able to achieve herd immunity by infecting only the young with minimal deaths."
2020-04-28 17:04,"The ""light touch"" Swedish response has probably led to the much higher mortality (225/Mn) than reported by its similar neighbours Denmark (74/Mn), Norway (36/Mn) and Finland (35/Mn). What's even worse, this mortality is still very much on the rise as of Apr 28 (OurWorldInData) while the other countries are plateauing. So this is rather a cautionary tale than a positive example!

Btw, even here in Switzerland with a direct border to Northern Italy we've had many more cases than Sweden but fewer deaths with a mortality of  156/Mn."
2020-04-28 17:05,"Sweden's is an interesting experiment, notably on the basis that policy makers anticipate the ""curve"" of ramping up its public health services will stay ahead of the more famous infection rate ""curve"" - it's the failure of institutitonal preparation and organization that derailed (for example) the UK's original plan to use a similar approach.  Much still seems to depend on unknowns:  mainly whether the virus produces a dependable herd immunity and whether science produces dependable herd testing for that."
2020-04-28 17:07,"Many commentators have noted the high death toll in Sweden for elderly people living in nursing homes. But would a lockdown have prevented these deaths? 

We are also seeing high death rates for the elderly in the United States and other countries in which lockdowns have been implemented. 

Closing schools, restaurants, and non-essential businesses does not necessarily have a direct impact on the transmission of the coronavirus to vulnerable populations."
2020-04-28 17:08,"A recent and important Chinese genomic study using ultradeep sequencing identified 33 strains of SARS-COV-2, with variations in viral load shedding of up to 270 times, with obviously increased virulence and lethality. This is why NYC has been so catastrophic. The more lethal strain there came from Europe, likely Italy. This contrasts with the strain in Washington state, and likely California, which is less lethal. It seems likely the strain in Sweden is simply less virulent, and they got lucky rather than smart."

2020-04-28 16:50,"The citizenry of the US of A is not mature enough to follow a ‘trust’ approach. And I have a friend who is Swedish and a nurse in Sweden and she is, as of now, scared to death of Covid19. The stories have yet to be written on this folks."

2020-04-28 16:57,"Although Sweden has one of the lowest population densities of Europe, it has a coronavirus per capita death rate that is the seventh highest in the world, according to Worldometer. At 25 people/square km, it has a population density slightly higher than Finland and Norway, but much lower than Denmark at 137 people/square km. Yet Sweden has mortality rate of 233/1 million versus 75 for Denmark, 38 for Norway, and 36 for Finland. Sweden traded death for a better economy. Sweden's state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, says the victims would have died anyway. The rest of the world is thankfully not so callous."
2020-04-28 16:38,"Considering the mortality of Sweden to other Scandinavian countries one wonders if all the death and carnage of the elderly populations is not only callous but cruel as well.  In my mind that is very high cost for herd immunity in those 45 and younger who are not likely to die.   

Sweden is playing with fire as they do not know what the outcome will be for the long term effect of infection on their youth.  It make not be as “mysigt” as being purported."
2020-04-28 16:59,"It is suggested by what is happening in Sweden that except for the elderly, the current lockdowns are excessive in the US and elsewhere. We may fall victim to our lockdown philosophy, never finding an ideal time to open up and constantly fearful of what happens when we do since the virus is not going to disappear."
2020-04-28 16:21,I am sure that our own government will take nothing from this.  We consistently refuse to learn from the experience of other countries.
2020-04-28 16:24,"This just shows that where you have a disciplined population, draconian measures are not necessary. It also shows that the virus has a lower mortality rate than the terrible numbers in NYC seem to indicate. The same is true about the numbers in other countries, such as Israel (which did implement a stringent lockdown). I suspect that this has something to do with underlying health conditions. Perhaps the simple, if sad, truth is that Americans are just sicker, fatter, and of course, less disciplined than other nations."
2020-04-28 16:30,"Awesome.  So it would seem that we blew up our economy and plunged millions into poverty for . . . nothing.  I'm a lifelong Democrat, but we have failed the common sense test.  Time to open up in a major way."
2020-04-28 16:49,"Wondering why Swedes have a lower Covid mortality rate? Look at the photo of a Swedish street scene. People biking, walking not driving, every one looking fit and trim. That is a long term personal investment in health that's paying off handsomely for them now. That's the key. The human body needs to keep moving to keep moving and living."
2020-04-28 16:51,"I love this story because it might force an American Republican to agree with Sweden, a conservative's socialist nightmare, on something; to admit that Sweden may have done something right.  ""Swedes, they said, could be trusted to stay home, follow social distancing protocols and wash their hands to slow the spread of the virus — without any mandatory orders.""   This scenario is unimaginable in America where we like to imagine we're all cowboys and ""rugged"" individualists and like to abandon one another in order to buy a nicer car or a bigger house."
2020-04-28 16:32,"No kudos to Sweden.They have sacrificed their elderly so the economy will run.Eighty six per cent of the 2200 deaths are those over 70- Sweden also does not have a large number of people incarcerated who can infect each other.The largest city,Stockholm,has 950,000 residents-they do not have a large compact population.There is no miracle there-they have a small,homogeneous population and have not protected the elderly- why should they be congratulated?"
2020-04-28 17:00,"No one has any idea of the magnitude of long term casualties in Sweden. The only thing we can measure is the situation as we see it now. Sweden has a much higher population death rate than any other Scandanavian country. If no effective treatment were to be found, and if the race for a vaccine is not successful, then Sweden, over the long term, might not have a higher death rate than other countries in Scandanavia. Otherwise, Sweden has made a very risky gamble with the lives of its citizens. 

Someone else mentioned that it's extremely optimistic to expect herd immunity when 30% of the population has been infected.Based on the estimated contagion rate, of the coronavirus (R0=3) it would require that 70% of the population be immune to achieve herd immunity. 

At the moment, less than 1% of the population of Sweden has been been infected, and there have already been 2274 deaths (as of yesterday). At that rate, herd immunity would be at the cost of 1.5 million deaths."
2020-04-28 17:15,"Heard immunity is not and has never been a goal of FHS and the swedish government. The difference between Sweden and other countries are probably not as big as it seems. I live here and of course you’ll find some places with more people but most people are more careful and respectful. Everywhere we are reminded to wash hands, keep distance, not go out if you feel slightest sick, not unnecessary travel and not visit elderly. Most people are responsible. I’ve seen a lot more of photographers though recently out looking for places where to find crowds. We are all in the same boat and remember this it is not a competition!"
2020-04-28 17:17,"Great article, and nice to see some evenhanded discussion of the policies and their effects in Sweden, which are quite different than those in most western nations. It’s time to start lifting lockdowns in every country that is currently suffering from￼ The devastating impact of these policies￼."
2020-04-28 17:02,"This is a terribly misleading article (as Shaun Narine points out.) 
There is NO evidence that recovery from COVID-19 produces immunity.  There are many diseases for which recovery does produce immunity - and many for which it DOES NOT.  And there are some diseases for which recovery produces immunity for only a few months."
2020-04-28 17:03,"Sweden has the eighth highest coronavirus death rate in the world, and the worst is still to come. Their strategy is clearly not working."
2020-04-28 17:03,"Not to be cynical but...it seems to me that Sweden is sacrificing its “expensive” population (the elderly in care homes and its refugee population) for the sake of the economy. How much is a human life worth?

And the idea of herd immunity for coronaviruses is yet unproven."
2020-04-28 17:04,"While the elderly population are not considered valued consumers by the Swedish government their contribution to “hygge” is immeasurable to me.

I have a elderly cousin in an assisted living situation with COPD that is being absolutely terrified by CNN.  I beg her to just turn it off.  The last thing she needs is to watch news about callous Sweden."
2020-04-28 17:07,"How about Taiwan's experience? As soon as the existence of a new virus was announced at the end of Dec., on the same day, health screening and appropriate quarantining of travellers arriving from Wuhan began, before the pathogen itself had been identified. Contact tracing was vigorously pursued. When the pathogen was identified and tests developed, screening expanded to include all travellers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau before the Lunar New Year at the end of January. By that time nearly 400,000 travellers from China had entered the US, mostly unscreened. In Taiwan all large gatherings, such as sports events, concerts, and conferences were cancelled or postponed but stores and businesses remained open and public transportation continued to operate. Social distancing and mask wearing protocols have been observed. Schools and universities reopened at the end of February after an extended winter vacation to allow protective preparations for the return of students. So far, Taiwan has had 429 confirmed cases and 6 deaths, with no new local transmission cases over the past 14 days. It can be done, but you have to have the planning, infrastructure, and personnel in place to act very fast as soon as a new illness appears. SARS in 2003 was Taiwan's 9/11. We have benefited from learning our lessons well."

Actually Sweden is pretty much middle of the range in that regard for developed, Western countries. It seems that many people are threatened by a more open approach for some reason. I suggest that people take a look at the by-country listings on worldmeters.info coronavirus page and decide for yourselves."
2020-04-28 17:27,"Sweden was/is playing with fire and by all indications, they have not emerged unscathed. However, an important point that cannot be ignored in analyzing Sweden and other Nordic countries is the extremely strong safety nets in these countries. 
Self-isolation and skipping work due to illness is not an issue because of paid leave. People are not afraid to seek hospitalization or medical care because of economics. These are but two of the strongest requirements for successful control of infection. 
Unfortunately, in our country, there is a strong chance that an infected person may be at work because its that or being left hungry and penniless. People who argue about the homogeneity of these countries are deliberately ignoring the key factors."
2020-04-28 17:34,"Glad that Sweden is considering the health and wellbeing of the full population, and realizes that there are real tradeoffs to a broad shutdown. The vitriol against Sweden in the press over the past month has been enlightening, and I see that many NYT readers repeat the same arguments in the comments. Sad how the validity of lockdowns has become a political point, and people have retreated further into their own convictions, regardless of new findings."
2020-04-28 17:54,"I live between California and Sweden, and so I see first hand the stark difference between the severe restrictions in place in California and the strategic decisions that Sweden has made. What is missing in both this article and the comments is that Sweden had the luxury of making the decision to keep their economy alive because they have a vastly superior health care system that can absorb the consequences of COVID, and California does not. Sweden has invested for decades into their infrastructure and California has effectively ignored theirs. That’s why Sweden will come out of this in good condition and California will lose hundreds of billions from a forced shut down."
2020-04-28 18:02,"Sweden is recognizing the very long-term nature of the infection.  It is not realistic to remain in lockdown on months on end, without plunging millions into poverty.  The nations that currently have the lower per capita death rates may be closer to Sweden 12 months from now."
2020-04-28 18:06,"Beyond all the subjective arguments, here are the numbers:

On April 3, 2020: Per capita deaths were Italy 240/million, Sweden 35.8/million, U.S. 22.2/million, Germany 15.3/million, South Korea 3.4/million, China 2.39/million, Taiwan 0.21/million. NYC 99.2/million.

On April 27, 2020: Per capita deaths were Italy 442.3/million, Sweden 227.4/million, U.S. 169.7/million, Germany 72.1/million, South Korea 4.8/million, China 3.22/million, Taiwan 0.25/million. NYC 2135/million.

Sweden is a very sparsely populated country, so that physical distancing is built in:  Population/km2 Italy 200.6, Sweden 22.6, U.S. 33.7, Germany 234.4, South Korea 511.3, China 150.5, Taiwan 650. NYC 4027.

Given its population density, if Sweden had practiced any type of restraint, its death rate certainly could have been as low as Germany (with 10 times the population density) and possibly as low as Korea (with 20 times the population density).  The U.S. has also done much better than Sweden, but its numbers are skewed by NYC which has accounted for about 1/4 of the U.S. deaths, but has an population density almost 200 times more.

Sweden has at this point basically baked in a death rate like Italy's, and should catch up over the next 2-3 weeks.

You can make a subjective judgment about whether having an extra 200-400/million die is worth it, but it should be based on numbers, not philosophy."
2020-04-28 17:38,"According to Worldometers, Sweden has a death per million population value of 233 while the value for neighbor Norway is 38, six times lower.

2020-04-28 17:43,"Sweden did ok so far, but not great. For example they have 3 times as many deaths per million people than Germany. And more than half than those of Italy. So their social distancing mitigated some of the effects but not as much as Germany. Social distancing is a continuum not a discrete."
2020-04-28 17:45,"A generation’s worth of doctoral dissertations will be written on the Covid 19 crisis, response, aftermath, etc. And, there will be plenty of data to go around. Who did it better? What did we learn? How do we prepare for next time? There is a lot of trial and error both in the international community and here at home. Uncomfortable conversations about “how many deaths are too many” and yes, I know, one is too many. Interestingly, folks tend to not want to talk about our propensity to warehouse the elderly, until something like this comes along and really raises the curtain on their living conditions and the lack of care they receive. 

Our Governor yesterday took the first steps to reopen the Texas economy. In his comments, he said, “people are free to open their businesses or not” and also stressed “people are also free to not leave their homes.” Now, that doesn’t apply to everyone, of course. A business might open and an employee doesn’t want to leave their home, leaving them unemployed. Life is all choice. It looks like the “European standard” didn’t apply to Sweden, just like the “New York standard” shouldn’t apply to Texas."

2020-04-28 17:17,"Only history will show if this was a workable tactic. Hopefully so, but who knows. It reminds me of the weeks leading up to the shut down in NYC when I was still riding the subway to work, no mask, just using hand sanitizer frequently and trying not to touch my face. I met with friends, went to a museum, etc... In hindsight, it's possible I may have infected others during that time. I'm sure Sweden is much better off than the US in many ways.

2020-04-28 17:53,"Let’s address the elephant in the room: every country that has been devastated and hard hit, has been a country with a dictator or authoritarian government that tries to deny reality.

In the United States, our president denied the danger of Covid, disregarded expert advice, and waited until after it was already ravaging communities before taking action.

In Brazil, Bolsonaro continues to deny his country is even experiencing a problem, while the caskets pile up.

In Russia/China/Iran, we know that areas hard hit were/are under restriction but we have no reliable idea about how many cases/deaths there really are. The only thing we know for sure is it’s more than they are reporting.

In every country with a stronger democracy, and a population that values scientific fact above political beliefs, the curve was smaller and flatter from the very beginning and it’s not due to any factor.

In every country where the political/religious/community leadership put their petty personal beliefs aside and let medical experts and non-partisan strategic organizations coordinate the response and educate the public, the curves and overall number of cases is lower.

In Sweden, the public gets messages from medical experts about facts surrounding COVID-19. In the United States, the political leader tells people to drink bleach and inject Lysol into the lungs."
2020-04-28 17:10,"“the minister of health and social affairs, Lena Hallengren, said in an interview, referring to the disease caused by the virus. “We have 250 empty beds right now.””

The reason Sweden has 250 empty ICU beds is because people who would benefit from being in those beds are denied them due to being too old.  I believe the age cutoff is 70.  If you are over 70 no ICU bed or ventilator for you.  

Add to that the fact that Sweden is only testing those admitted into hospital, you’ve got a very seriously skewed set of numbers.  If you die and have not had a confirmed test, you died of pneumonia, or heart attack, or old age.  

This is a cold and hard calculus.  Let’s keep the economy running despite the costs to marginalized demographic groups (immigrants and the elderly).  The purpose is to ensure that Sweden’s industry can fill the vacuum left by the shutdown to industry elsewhere.  This is the same calculus used by Sweden during the 20 century."

Their scientists drive the bus and they continue to trust the government and each other, mostly because they don't have a completely broken democracy dominated by corporate interests and a leader that spends more time talking about his ratings and quack cures than actually leading.  In other words, their government works for and protects the population as opposed to working for monied interests and letting the population suffer.  Socialism looks like it's protecting the economy, and the people, more effectively than our corrupt system."
2020-04-28 17:58,"All one has to do to measure the so-called success of Sweden's single Medical Director's ""guidance"" or orders, is to examine the successes of Sweden's neighbors, Finland and Norway.  

Sweden's illogical and misguided medical policy has cost the lives of 2355 people to date.  Conversely, Finland and Norway who sheltered at home and closed businesses, have only 199 and 206 deaths, though Norway has nearly twice the number of Covid-19 cases.  

There is something abnormal about the medical director's attitude - ""We have to have our children at school."" and absolutely no compassion for any of the people who died of the infection. 

Sweden is a socialist country - I did not see any socialism in action to protect human life over some invisible national goal to educate ""their children"". 

Sweden is as inclement, cold and snow bound as Canada, yet Canada has long provided long distance tele-computer education to its entire nation for decades. 

No excuse Sweden.  Some Saga.  A real ax job Medical director."
2020-04-28 18:20,"Your analysis needs to take into account what is different in Sweden, and what is the same. Senior citizens are more vulnerable, and so a greater use of PPE would have and is appropriate. However, people there ride bicycles to work, and are generally fit, compared to other countries. Perhaps this is part of the key. Already, 25% of the population has antibodies. This may have to do with viral load, and general health.
So they have done better with the general population, and no worse with the seniors. Sounds like something that we should study and emulate, and improve upon with knowledge of the fragility of the elderly."

2011 - 874,000 deaths in the US attributed to poverty

Lockdowns work for socialism and communism, not for capitalism. Capitalism is not geared for a full STOP, the whole chain of commerce breaks down. It will take years to recover from this.

Now, we've chosen more poverty and destitution. The 2011 figures are going to go way up.
Where's outrage? Where are the fund raising telethons?
That will come later, when hear more about being in this together, I suppose.

Save the flames. Your indignation is trivial compared to the damage that will occur to hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years due to poverty from this economic fall out.

But, you're reading the NYT. It is just the nameless poor, after all. Not in your back yard."

Like D Day in wartime - there will be casualties. We are merely buying time for the health care system to get up to snuff to try to care for those who become sick. To Try to""eradicate"" the virus is impossible. Frankly, we appear to be ready. Ventilators,  home confinement, (like a prison sentence), and tying every power grab as tied to the Virus( draconian) is not curing the Virus. Just buying time and giving an excuse to power grabs."

This combined with the past 30 years of neo-liberal governance has produced a widespread attitude that times are good and shall always remain so.  Beyond sacrificing their elderly, it remains to be seen whether or not this experiment will result in a more widespread massacre.  We shall see."
2020-04-28 18:26,It comes down to whether or not a government believes it is ok to lose people. NY governor Cuomo mentioned that even one death was too many - which lead to the policies enacted in the state. Sweden on the other hand is ok with having people die in order to protect the economy. These are not so much decisions based on public health but rather on morals and beliefs.
2020-04-28 18:27,"What I love about these responses is the number of people who think so narrowly about the idea of the economy, the whole ""sacrificing peoples' lives to keep the economy running"" cop out. The economy also represents people's lives. A healthy economy entails countless individuals, for the most part, making enough money to provide for themselves and their families. The economy=the millions of people who just filed for unemployment and all the lives that are spiraling into ruin while their places of work and the businesses they own are shut down. The economy=people too. It's not just septuagenarians or the abstraction of the economy, we're talking about which lives to expose to vulnerability and in which ways: if your 75 you have a 92% chance of surviving COVID. If you're a 35 year old small business owner, your chances of still having a business when this is over is minimal."
2020-04-28 18:27,"This assumes there is only one way for ‘life to go on’. It’s very interesting and most assuredly different, but my life keeps going right on in isloation. It will, I assume, continue when I am able to circulate freely, or with some
modest adjustments."
2020-04-28 18:28,"No system is perfect in an imperfect and inherently dangerous world but Sweden's approach is far more sensible than the draconian measures taken in most other countries.  Their approach might need some fine tuning, but keeping society functioning while practicing social distancing for  high-risk individuals is a rational approach supported by many leading medical professionals in the U.S.  We all mourn the loss of anyone, I have older family members in high-risk categories and want them as protected as possible, but a shutdown of society is not the answer for many reasons. It's not just about the economy; once Government takes liberties away, even for good and well-intended reasons, history shows it frequently turns into something very different. I wonder how people on the left will feel if Trump uses the excuse of 'safety' to try to prevent voting this November."
2020-04-28 18:29,"So Sweden has done less testing, has higher confirmed case volume, is increasing at a faster rate than their peer countries, has a higher ratio of confirmed deaths to confirmed cases, has a higher rate of deaths per 1 million people and we're holding them up as a model?"
2020-04-28 18:30,"The proper statistic to look at is the number of deaths per million people, which gives a sense of the spread regardless of the degree of testing. Sweden's death rate is 233 per million. Contrast that with the US at 175 and Italy at 450. So Sweden is definitely struggling with the virus like everyone else.

But looking at these figures at this point is just a snapshot in time and does not really say whether Sweden's policy is a failure because we are in early stages of this pandemic. If Covid-19 is going to cycle through the population repeatedly as the CDC is warning us, the real statistic that matters is the total number of people who have died after two or three years. Countries that build herd immunity now by paying a high price in early deaths will have much lower death rates in future years. So let's revisit this in a couple of years and we will know much more about what worked and what didn't."
2020-04-28 18:32,"When comparing death numbers, keep in mind that Sweden has a long history of having very efficient and reliable public stastistics. For many countries, there is a huge gap between excess deaths (compared to an average year) and deaths attributed to Covid 19, suggesting that there are many Covid 19 deaths that has not been counted. Not so in Sweden, the figures match very closely."
2020-04-28 18:33,"One thing to consider is that Swedes have far greater convictions about day to day social responsibility and respect for privacy of others than do Americans. They will take efforts to conform with behaviors that are socially expected without special circumstances to motivate them, and they are unlikely to just drop in on others without checking first. It makes a difference under these circumstances."

At least their economy is thriving and after this we struggle badly and who knows for how long."
2020-04-28 18:40,"What has been forgotten US public discourse is that the intent of shutdowns was to flatten the curve so as not to overwhelm the health care system. There was never an intent for COVID-19 to be eradicated (at least not among anyone who had any appreciation of communicable diseases). What Sweden did is simply flatten the curve in a different way than most other countries. Denser urban areas with an initial high level of spread likely needed more extreme methods to balance health care availability and severe COVID-19 cases. The current debate in the US has lost its way, with a focus on goals that are poorly articulated and tinged with a good bit of residual panic. Our public servants in leadership positions (both Red and Blue) have shirked their responsibility to state clearly what the goals of their actions are - sometimes it is clear that they have no explicit goals."
2020-04-28 17:25,"The Swedish infection and death rate are both rising: in the past few days there have been 80 deaths per day.  The US population is 35 times that of Sweden; in the same proportion that would mean 2,800 deaths per day in the US.  That is not ""doing well.""
And Tegnell may say that they are not attempting to achieve herd immunity, but the Swedish ambassador said precisely that."
2020-04-28 18:22,"Balance.  I love it.  They probably had more infections and more deaths than if they went the U.S. route and locked everything down, but they also don't have the economic disaster we have in this country."
2020-04-28 18:41,"This was our approach in the late 50s with the Asian flu, not that anyone in the US much remembers anything, except we didn't bother even with social distancing, kept schools and businesses open, and had well over one hundred thousand deaths when we had about half the current population. I don't recall these events taking up much space in Eisenhower's biography either, by the way, although of course he had distinguished himself previously rather more than is typical of our current politicians. I thought at the beginning we should take this approach again, adding in advisory social distancing, closing schools, curtailing large gatherings, going with a kind of Swedish style honor system, but then I changed my mind when I remembered that we can't be trusted about much of anything."
2020-04-28 18:42,"I'm not sure I support Sweden's strategy here, but the general mindset that we cannot stay locked down for 18 months waiting for a vaccine is something I definitely can support. Schools should remain open, they are right about that."
2020-04-28 18:44,"Sweden is a highly evolved social democracy where it's citizens understand and fully believe in the collective good and sacrifice that enables a functioning society.

The also have very high taxes, but no bloated military and yet little corporate welfare like America certainly does.

Let's wait until all the data comes in before we pass judgement on their approach in this pandemic."
2020-04-28 18:47,"I respect Sweden and pray for the best outcome possible for them.

Any country that wishes to survive as a developed economy is going to have to face the question that Sweden faced immediately: how do you get out of lock down?  In general, medical doctors are concerned with saving lives and preventing death in the present.  With all respect, gratitude, and credit to them for what they do, but we are now locked in a cage waiting a therapy and/or vaccine that is 18 months away.  If we strictly follow the advice of medical doctors, there is going to be absolutely staggering social and economic wreckage.  This is what Sweden has faced from Day 1.  They have maintained a functional nation while much of the rest of the world has been put into hibernation.

It also seems that Sweden has an entirely different culture, certainly from the US but also from most of the rest of the world.  Virtually all of the resistance to a Swedish-type approach here is based on politics.  Trump said testing was available when it wasn't, so his political opponents continue to bang the ""testing"" drum really without a clue what they are talking about.  To the extent that any ""expert"" contradicts Trump, that person becomes a hero of the Left.  And vice versa.  Witness the attacks on Dr. Birx here in the NYTimes any time she has declined to publicly fight Trump."
2020-04-28 18:51,"If a person dies from a heart attack consequent to COVID-19, some places will record the cause as COVID-19 and some as a heart attack. While true with foreign stats, it's also true here.

Statistics for confirmed cases of COVID-19 are highly dependent on the very varying numbers of tests in different states and communities. Consequently, one would think the most relevant statistic available for comparison purposes would be the deaths per number of residents. However, if you look at the state by state comparisons, some seem to make no sense, inasmuch as states with significant numbers of cases and/or deaths have very different fatality rates.

Different states and different localities use different criteria for attributing cause of death. I expect politics as much as medical protocols play a significant role. Responsibility, accountability, and image undoubtedly are factored in to states' reporting of deaths. Is it coincidence that, even pulling out the sparsely populated high plans and mountain states, you still pretty much see the states with Democratic governors reporting higher death rates than states with Republican governors?

For instance, Florida with 1088 deaths has a fatality rate of 5/100,00 while Louisiana with 1740 deaths has a fatality rate of 37/100,000. Texas with 666 deaths reports a fatality rate of 2/100,000 while Connecticut with 2012 deaths has a fatality rate of 56/100,000. These differences cannot simply be attributed to a difference in medical care."
2020-04-28 18:55,"So their health minister ordered the ""no visitors"" signs removed?    So you can't be more careful than the government deems appropriate?  I'm curious how this will play out.  At that senior facility they lost 11."
2020-04-28 18:59,"This article is catnip for the conspiracy theorists who are convinced this pandemic has been a hoax to get Trump out of office. It’s unfortunate that as we approach retirement our productive lives are limited to just the people in our immediate family as the only ones affected when we pass on. Sweden took a big gamble and Sweden is hardly a populated country compared to USA or other major urban areas. The science says we are just at the beginning of this, that there might not ever be a vaccine. Time will tell I guess but in the mean time I will follow what science says."
2020-04-28 19:02,"I have great confidence in Swedes' social awareness - however - the comparative stats are not glowing, and I would be reluctant to hold Sweden up as an ideal model.  Their COVID-19 death rate per capita is only exceeded by seven other countries with significant populations: Belgium, Spain, Italy, France, UK, Netherlands, Ireland. Furthermore, Sweden's death rate is 40% greater than the US where social distancing has not been that rigorously observed."
2020-04-28 19:03,"The Swedish people’s total disregard for social safety distance and their refusal to enact precautions other than no crowds greater than 50 is an extraordinary gamble. So far, only their elderly have paid a big price. We shall see how well this works in the long term. It didn’t work so well in other counties."
2020-04-28 19:05,"I've been wondering how Sweden is faring in all of this. I'd heard an interview with their health minister a few weeks back and I've thought quite a bit about something he said. It was, in effect, that we would need to live with this disease for a very long time and the response would have to be sustainable. He seemed to imply that what many other countries were doing was not sustainable. I agree. We can't do what we've been doing for years. You can feel the civil unrest boiling beneath the surface, imagine what this looks like when unemployment keeps going up and people can't feed their families either because they can't afford to or there's food shortages because we've decided to lockdown our young, healthy, low-risk workers along with our at-higher-risk retirees. We need something sustainable. A vaccine might very well never happen. What then?"
2020-04-28 19:07,"Is it possible that Sweden just has fewer unhealthy people with underlying conditions? Less obesity, diabetes, heart disease, etc.? Much of this could be explained by their fairer public health system, but some of this results from lifestyle choices, no?"
2020-04-28 19:08,"They have definitely been helped by the fact that every country around them has been locked down, so they have been in a bit of a self contained bubble.

Plus, they have a really good health service to begin with, and therefore could take a greater chance than many other countries, with less risk of crashing the system."
2020-04-28 19:10,"I very much hope to be wrong but, perhaps, voluntary social distancing makes the curve rise slowly and, once a certain threshold is exceeded, it will grow rapidly and, then, only a lockdown can bring it back under control."
2020-04-28 19:14,"I think that Sweden is just a healthier,  cleaner and better housed country.  Combine that with a robust health care system and it is no surprise that they have lower rates of the virus. 

Healthcare is a continuum. Sweden starts taking care of its population from the moment a woman knows she is pregnant. Compare that with the United States where we have near third-world levels of infant mortality and medical intervention that takes place only when it becomes expensive and difficult to treat.  How else do you explain the disparity in patient outcomes in the U.S. that result from incomes and race?

In short, the U.S. cannot approach Covid-19 the way Sweden does because we are simply not up to the task."
2020-04-28 19:17,"Now the virus is hitting the other regions of the country where there has been a total disregard for the social distancing protocol. The health officials agree that they have been observing societal spread of the disease. However, there is not much of an awareness among the members of the public to follow simple rules. This gamble is going to be costly, I hope I am wrong."
2020-04-28 17:30,All these interesting experiments around the globe with human lab rats.￼ Only time will tell.
2020-04-28 18:10,"Deaths per million, the ultimate metric, keep rising in Sweden. They surpassed Ireland yesterday, according to worldometers. Soon Sweden will pass even the UK. How high do the deaths have to rise before the Swedes, a stubbornly proud people, admit that their government was wrong and that Anders Tegnell is an idiot?"
2020-04-28 19:22,"I believe that the soft lockdown Swedish way has definitively hurt them, or at least their older population.

The death rate compared to the other Nordic countries:
Sweden 2355 dead, 23 per 100,000
Denmark 434 dead, 8 per 100,000
Norway 206 dead, 4 per 100,000
Finland 199 dead, 4 per 100,000
Iceland 10 dead, 3 per 100,000

Compared to the other Nordic countries the Swedish numbers are catastrophic."
2020-04-28 19:25,"Lockdown or no lockdown, Sweden's economy is already taking huge hits, with SAS laying off 5,000 employees today (mostly Sweden), or 50 percent of their staff. Both SAS and Norwegian in Norway are hanging by a thread, and bankruptcy is possible if major carriers don't pick them up. Europe will lose 80 percent or more of its tourism this summer? Massive unemployment, anyone? Sure, it's absolutely tragic that so many people have died, but a lot more will die because of the recession/depression the next few years. If Sweden was right to go for herd immunity, good for them, but they still will have to deal with a broken Europe."
2020-04-28 19:26,"Not enough is made of Sweden's deaths. Should be higher in the piece. A lot more have died. Compare apples to apples and look at neighboring countries with deaths in the low hundreds compared with Sweden's which is above 2,300 (as of today).  Its government admits to allowing many more deaths because of this approach and states this just factually. You should also include deaths/M: Sweden (233 today)  Norway (38 today) and Finland (36 today) and add in  Spain (510 per million today) if you want to add a Euro comparison with a country that's had a horrific time of it. (Source Worldometers).

On the economic side, unemployment has crept up. There have been impacts beyond economic growth-- just not as severe as in other places with more comprehensive lock downs.    This is not to say the approach is wrong, but your reporting on the death rate issue is superficial and underplayed in the piece. 

Thank you for analyzing the nursing home issue. The Swedes and their government have admitted huge shortcomings here. We will all have much to learn after this, and hopefully we all will learn and apply our individual lessons robustly as we continue the fight."
2020-04-28 19:27,"I don't understand the gushing about how Sweden has handled the pandemic. On a per capita basis, Sweden has had nearly 50% MORE reported coronavirus deaths than the US.

This is basic math. A simple table comparing per capital death rates would have made this glaringly clear.

Given this basic fact, is Sweden a model to replicate?"
2020-04-28 19:27,"The difference between Stockholm and the US lies in the competence of Sweden's leadership. We also have much better methods to select our managers.

The US election process is a popularity contest to determine which elected officials get to represent the special interest groups which funds their campaign. 

In Sweden, we require experience and competence before we hire our elected officials. We also have a better system of fixing mistakes, IE, the present example is Trump."
2020-04-28 19:27,"In fact, Sweden's policy has been an abject failure. You cannot identify this simply by comparing their numbers to any other country. You should compare them to their physical and cultural neighbors in Scandinavia. Physical and cultural proximity are excellent markers for likelihood of the spread of the virus. Italy, Spain, France, and the UK, for instance, have all been hit hard, with deaths per million between 319 and 510 and converging, as they still rise at roughly 40-50% of the peak. In Scandinavia, the situation is far better in every country but Sweden, which at 233 deaths per million (81 today) has a death rate six times that of Finland (36 deaths per million) and Norway (38 deaths per million), and three times that of Denmark (75 deaths per million). Sweden has essentially sacrificed its elderly for two months of extra socializing. You wouldn't know it from the pictures but 32% of Swedes are 55 or older. It's highly objectionable that they would seed the virus in old age homes so thoroughly by maintaining visitation, limiting PPE, and creating widespread transmission of the virus, a 23% infection rate, so that health care workers would be likely to spread the virus to the aged. Fine for the immortal youth. What of the elderly?"
2020-04-28 19:32,Many comments identify Sweden's higher COVID mortality rate and how it has been largely borne by the elderly. I prefer to wait and withhold any support for Swedish models until excess mortality rates catch up to events globally.
2020-04-28 19:33,"Living in Sweden I would say that the amount of freedom we have here is somewhat exaggerated compared to other countries. The are a lot less people moving around. Usually I travel by plane once a week. Have been working from home for more then five weeks now and it looks like it will continue for the over see able future. Haven’t seen my parents in two month and probably won’t for a long time. We will have another baby this summer and if I have the slightest cold symptoms I will not be allowed to into the hospital to help my fiancée. Countries with look downs face other issues then Sweden. Like our neighbors Denmark and Norway. They have lower numbers then Sweden but are now starting to lift their lock downs. What will they do if their numbers starts to climb again? Lock down again? The approach Sweden has with limiting the spread so that the healthcare system doesn’t collapse seems like the only why forward until there are a vaccine, at least to me and many Swedes."
2020-04-28 19:33,"The argument rests on comparing Sweden to Ireland, but the authors do not explain why. To control for the many, as of yet, unknown factors impacting the virus' transmissibility and deadliness. Sweden should be compared to countries that are most similar to it, except for containment policies. <br><br>.
The best comparison is thus the three other Nordic countries – Denmark, Norway, & Finland. An article on CNN (by Emma Reynolds) does the comparison and Sweden is by far the worse in deaths per 100,000. Further, part of the logic given by Swedish officials for their limited containment strategy is that they have a lower population density, which limits transmissibility. Yet Denmark, which is about 5.5 times denser than Sweden, has only 7 deaths per 100,000 (Sweden has 22). <br><br>
Finally, Ireland is receiving credit because it is most similar to United Kingdom and is also next to it. This is because, the high transmissibility of the virus means that a country’s vulnerability to the virus depends on the spread in neighboring countries. So if the authors insists on comparing Sweden to Ireland they should note that the Ireland has done as well as Sweden despite the fact that Ireland is next to the United Kingdom while Sweden is next to three countries (Denmark, Norway, & Finland) that collectively have done about 4.5 times better than Sweden. Anything else is disrespectful to the Irish people for sacrificing their economic well-being by adopting a strict containment strategy."
2020-04-28 19:34,"The big difference that struck me is that Swede trust their government AND they trust one another.  Still, their number of cases and deaths are considerably higher than the rest of the Scandinavian countries.  On the other hand, their caseload of critically ill patients never reached a point where it would overwhelm the hospitals' ability to care for them.  

There is no reason why any American should trust President Trump.  His messaging on the pandemic and the economy is contradictory from one day to the next.  Moreover, Trump's presidency DEPENDS upon polarizing Americans.  And so do his media outlets.  Divide and conquer is their motto. 

Americans are also almost afraid of healthcare because it is so expensive.  Over half of our citizens avoid doctors because they're afraid of being in debt forever.  
But we are also a huge country with dozens of very large, densely populated cities.  And we have that obsession with putting individual rights over the common good at all times - even during a pandemic."
2020-04-28 19:34,"""It doesn't seem to have hurt them?"" That's a pretty callous statement, given the twin facts that their deaths/million population are much higher than elsewhere in Scandinavia, and their rate of deaths and case rates are both rising now. It's conceivable that a voluntary and only partially adopted set of restrictions slowed the spread, but Sweden may now be crossing a tipping point where the spread is accelerating. Time will tell, but this article may well have been too quick with the optimistic headline."
2020-04-28 19:41,"Swedes prize their individual autonomy, like Americans.

Their government came up with a plan that best suits their national priorities.  The people of Sweden support their government.

There's not one right answer to this crisis, only a series of answers that are wrong in different ways."
2020-04-28 19:46,"It’s interesting to see the vitriolic response here to good news. I guess “data” and “science” should be the basis of everything we do unless those data contradict our fixed beliefs?

Sweden has had a solid middle of the pack performance despite no draconian lockdowns. They never saw the much-hyped ""exponential rise"" in patients, and the rate of increase in cases is now declining on its own. No one argues that hospitals were never overwhelmed, calling into question a central tenet of social distancing policy. And the vast majority of their deaths were confined to the very elderly.

Those seeking to defend lockdowns against any implication that they’re an overreaction love to cite the situation in other Nordic countries. But the this comparison is tougher than it looks. Sweden has much higher population density than Finland and Norway and more age 75  folks than all three other Nordic countries. These factors alone could explain the differences we're seeing. I think this comparison is more nuanced and far less ideal than it’s made out to be."
2020-04-28 19:46,"No mention of how widespread testing was. Did they test? Are they testing?

Aside from that, it's much easier to rely on people ""doing the right thing"" when the people have dependable safety nets for their income and health, which Swedes to, whereas in the U.S. this is not the case. 

But the one central fact of this catastrophe is that our government made broad, life-altering and life-threatening decisions without any hard facts to base them on. And that is a failure of the Trump administration and Republicans who slashed spending at the CDC, and failed to invest in disaster preparedness when they were specifically warned that a pandemic would lead to this outcome if they did not act. Discussions and articles about how other countries handled this simply take the attention away from this central, massive failure.

Had testing been made available, many parts of the country could've avoided the draconian lockdown that the more urban centers required. And testing would've been able to show if and when such measures needed to be implemented elsewhere. Now we have the whole country in ""lockdown fatigue"", and champing at the bit to re-open, perhaps too soon for some areas. How many people have lost their jobs and even their homes unnecessarily because these blanket decisions made in a vacuum? That's a clear failure of government, charged with being responsible to lead in a crisis.

Trump and Congress have failed epicly."
2020-04-28 19:11,"So, it seems like their model of pandemic control is to sacrifice their older population???"
2020-04-28 19:15,"Infected people emit tiny droplets which carry virus.  The droplets quickly become dust which travel on the air currents.  Inside, these can build up to a high enough level that the viral load is sufficient to make it likely that you can get infected.  Outside, the viral load is dispersed very quickly by any air movement (and there's always some air movement).  Unless you're talking to a stranger, breathing in their air as they breath it out, it is highly unlikely that you will be infected outdoors.  That's not an unsupported opinion.  There's good mathematical models to demonstrate this.

Closing parks and beaches is just foolish.  What the governor should be doing is telling everyone to open their windows, and make sure there's good air movement in their apartments and elder centers.  It's your HVAC system that will kill you, not going outside."

2020-04-28 17:58,"It is too early to praise the Swedish approach to the pandemic. Looking at worldometer.com, we see that Sweden has a higher covid-19 death rate than the US, and there is no sign of a flattening of the curve yet. Time will tell."
2020-04-28 18:26,"Note the differences between early reports of Sweden’s approach (NYT March 28) and this article and yesterday’s “missing deaths” article, all NYT.  Those favoring early opening pointed to Sweden as evidence that we did not have to institute and maintain severe measures to minimize the loss of life and overwhelm of the healthcare system. Now the numbers are showing the folly of not enforcing protective measures. Sadly, I suspect it will get a lot worse before it gets better.

Knowing of Sweden’s more socialist, eg, communal, community-oriented, culture, I suspected that the government would not have to order lockdowns formally because Swedes and other Scands would naturally culturally be more inclined to respect suggestions to protect each other. Wrong. What a difference a month makes!"

2020-04-28 18:31,"Sweden has been successful because they do not have our high risk population! Swedes are healthier. They don't gulp down junk unprocessed foods like we do.  Most of the deaths in the US have been among minorities, obese or overweight, and end-of-life nursing home residents. That population is almost nonexistent in Sweden.  Of course they can let herd immunity take over."

The two countries have comparable number of confirmed cases 19,621 (Sweden) and 19,877 (Ireland), but the total number of deaths is twice as bad for Sweden: 2,355 vs. 1,159. Any explanations?"

After weeks of panic coverage, including a story that was practically rooting for Sweden to fail in its more relaxed strategy toward the virus, the paper is now portraying the country's approach realistically.

The scientific data now proves that the vast majority of the population is not at risk of death or even serious illness from Covid-19. The death statistics are after all, as so many were saying, comparable to the flu. So all you commenters who were fervently and unquestioningly on board with the drastic, unnecessary and unconstitutional restrictions and curtailment of precious civil liberties, take heed.

America has been sick for years, outbreaks like this just highlight the irony of relying on doctors to keep you healthy.

Its all about money and pushing drugs.  No doctors talk about preventive care, as less sick people means less profit.  Not calling out doctors, but its all part of the system down to the way they are taught.  

Just look at the death stats.  If your already sick your chances of dying skyrocket.  If you take care of yourself, eat healthy, exercise, ect, you will be fine(don't bring up the outliers, there are 7B ppl on this planet).  

Probably why china got through this so quickly.  Say want you want about falsifying information, but China has much healthier people than the US.  Their culture is all about preventive medicine.

However, as I am 71, I see that I was wrong.  I wouldn't want to live somewhere that considers it's elderly and vulnerable as expendable as the Swedish folks do.  That's one of the complaints I have about the USA.

The main thing I get from this, however, is that because they do have a social safety net, they can trust people to stay home when they are sick.  In the USA, if you are an essential worker, you have to show up sick or not.  If you do not show up, and you cannot get tested for the virus (which most of us still cannot) then you do not get paid in most instances.  You may have small balances of vacation you might use if you have accumulated enough, but most had not by the time this outbreak started here."

Sweden has about the same population as North Carolina and Georgia, each about 10.5 million people. Sweden is the least urban of the three, at 62 people per square mile; North Carolina is the most urban at 213 people per square mile.  The average age is also similar: 38-ish in NC and GA and 41 in Sweden.  

What's different?  

Sweden has had 2,355 deaths from Covid and has 19,990 cases.  Georgia has had 1,000 deaths and 24,225 cases.  North Carolina? 306 deaths and 9,142 cases.  

Sweden and Georgia resisting shutting down, North Carolina did not, and is the most urban by the way, of the three.

Well - no - we can achieve equally good results in the short term [maybe in May] by having an accurate antibody test [yes - they exist] and an understanding of how antibody immunity works.

You get tested - you have antibodies - you won't get re-infected - you can go on as normal with similar groups.

You get tested - you don't have antibodies - you continue to social distance and act cautiously.

I am sure Sweden understands this so it makes their chosen strategy questionable."

2020-04-28 18:43,"There was recently a lengthy article in the main Finnish newspaper by a Finnish journalist, long resident in Stockholm.

His main argument is, that the famous ""consensus"" spirit Sweden is particularly well known for, is working through this pandemic, too. Swedes hate disagreeing and make great efforts to avoid it. Especially the approach of the government should not be criticised, as it's considered ""rocking the boat"".

This ""consensus"" feature is of course common in all Nordic countries (perhaps slightly excluding Denmark?). But when Finland and Denmark took hard measures to restrict movement, in Sweden this we're seen as shocking. Many Sweden's neighbours see signs of ""Swedish exceptionalism"" in their approach."

It is also not about placing profits above lives.

We need to face the reality that whether you flatten the curve or not, we will get roughly the same number of people infected with Covid-19.  The only question is whether or not those infections will overwhelm the healthcare system.

For those who think that keeping the economy closed is the right approach, ask yourselves this: 

--What happens when your food supply fails because meat, eggs, milk, and veg cannot get to market?  
--What happens to your retirement account that is invested in the market?  
--What happens to the mentally ill who suffer breakdowns and higher suicide rates because of isolation?  
--What happens when all your favorite mom n' pop shops go bankrupt and close?
--What happens when the lack of payroll and sales taxes empties your state and municipal coffers and they are required to drastically cut services? 

You will still have the same number of people infected, even if the curve is flattened.  Are you willing to accept the collateral damage to society for delayed infections?"

They're a practical bunch.  They know that the virus is not going to ""go away"".  It's with us for ever.  Or at least until there's a functional vaccine, which is far from guaranteed.  After all MERS, SARS, and the common cold are all from the same family and there's no functional vaccine for any of them.

In the end their stance that the ""shut the country down completely"" does much more harm than good makes sense. They have a well developed medical ecosystem so chances of it being overwhelmed will be very small.  Businesses continue to operate so there's none of the non-reversable effects shutting down commerce."

2. Few fat people. Obesity at any age is a major risk factor for a bad outcome, and tends to come coupled with metabolic syndrome or Type 2 Diabetes, both risk factors and in of themselves. 

Plus....

The ratio of deaths per capita for Sweden versus Denmark was 1.8 on April 8 and 3.1 on April 27.  The same ratio for Sweden versus Norway was 3.9 and 6.0 on the same two dates. 

Obviously, a detailed study would be needed to nail down the real causes of these observed differences, but it seems likely to me that differences in social distancing practices will be found to be important."

By comparison, Canada has a similar number of deaths and our population is 3.7 times higher.  Unfortunately Canada’s geographic proximity to American hotspots worsened our numbers ( especially in Quebec), which contrasts with Sweden which was quite isolated from European hotspots.

The real stars are in Asia.
S Korea ranks 13th in population density and over 100th in deaths per capita. Taiwan, Japan, and Vietnam are similar to S Korea with a low death rate in population dense countries.
We should look to Asia to see what works rather than Sweden."
2020-04-28 19:22,"Please perform better analysis in the future.  This recurring media attraction with Sweden lies on poor examination of the data. 

First, comparison with Ireland - which should not have been lauded either - is not appropriate.  Sweden shares borders, genes and political approaches most closely with Norway and Denmark.  

Denmark has suffered 75 deaths per million from Covid-19, per the World-O-Meter source that feeds Johns Hopkins.  Sweden has experienced 233 deaths per million.  This difference, 158 deaths per million, taken across Sweden's population of 10.33 million, accounts for 1,632 lives.  Moreover, Denmark is unlikely to face much greater economic repercussions than Sweden.  

That many lives is quite a price to pay for being able to go to restaurants.  And when will the Swedish infection rate stop - they surely will not be able to assume herd immunity anytime soon?  Are they counting on the long summer, with UV light, to help them through?

But please, enough with the Swedish model and miracle.  It is not true and it misleads people in the US to think that we should just open it up, which would be a tragic mistake."
2020-04-28 18:53,"For those of you fervently defending the validity of quarantining the entire population - versus just the vulnerable - do you realize that we have in effect weakened the immune systems of healthy people and thus decreased our ability to fight Covid-19 and other diseases when we are finally ""permitted"" to emerge from lock-down? Let's follow the science right? Placing healthy people in bubbles for two months with everything disinfected is a recipe for immune disaster."

2020-04-28 19:28,"They have opted for herd immunity. The truth is that older people are advised to stay home. In a country with roughly 9 m inhabitants, being Stockholm it’s most populated city with 1m inhabitants including suburbs, social distancing is relatively easy and it has always been in the culture. Many  homes are 1 person homes. Sweden has roughly the same sq kilometres as, for example, Spain. Spain has nearly 50m inhabitants and a culture of socialising with the extended family and friends. Kissing and hugging everyday is part of the culture. In both countries the Covid-19 has hit much harder on over 70 year old citizens."
2020-04-28 19:32,"Lets compare Sweden to Los Angeles County. Both have populations of about 10 million. Confirmed cases of Covid are also similar- Sweden 19,621 California 20,460. Death rates are very different however: Sweden has 2355 and LA county 948.

On this data it seems like the California lockdown has saved about 1400 lives to date. On top of that, LA county has much higher density, and all things being equal the disease would likely spread in LA faster than in Sweden. Time will tell where we go from here."
2020-04-28 19:47,"This article is very selective and misleading I live in Sweden and see how people living their lives seems like they never heard of COVID-19. 
Comparing neighboring  counties, which have similar cultural and economic systems, Sweden has extremely higher rate of death from Covid-19. Mostly elderly and immigrants are over represented in this death statistics. It seems like the decision makers have chosen  death of elderly and immigrants before economic suffering although economy is still hurt. It makes me so sad to see how a country let so many thousands people die to save the economy but still can’t save the economy. So we are losing our elderly and economy at the same time. Such a fail policy and sad situation. I envy citizens of my neighboring countries who are living in countries where governments have a clear moral compass to save valuable human lives."
2020-04-28 19:48,"I have family in Sweden that I am in contact with frequently and read Dagens Nyheter daily (major Swedish newspaper). As of April 1 visitors have been banned from all nursing homes. Not just the one mentioned in the article. All people over 70 have been advised to stay home and not see visitors, which has been difficult for my sister who has 5 grandchildren. Her children avoid public transportation, ridership has fallen 60%. They also avoid restaurants and crowds, although photos make it appear that the restaurants are full, they tell me they are not and owners are suffering. Although the students are allowed to gather in small groups, they are not allowed to be driven around packed into the bed of a truck or have large parties in their homes. The truck bed excursions, gaily decorated packed with celebrating, beer drinking newly graduated is a tradition that appeared some years after I graduated and considering safety aspects I was rather surprised to see this! SAS wants to furlough 5000 employees. Pride parade is canceled as are most public events. The virus is moving out from Stockholm to other larger cities and the death rate is fairly steady. Compared to where I live in Oregon, 4.1 M population with 90 deaths, Sweden with 10.3 M has now about 2,300 deaths. Swedes by nature tend to keep more of a social distance than many cultures and they don't have deep poverty or malnutrition and there is good health care for all, their entire lives. I hope this goes well for them."
2020-04-28 19:50,"If I'm reading this correctly, Sweden decided that the virus is nature doing its thing: old and immunocompromised don't survive so that young and healthy aren't impacted in any substantial way.  It's certainly scientific (and something many in the US would support).  I'm wondering if the people experiencing the ""life goes on"" approach are looking in the faces of those being sacrificed."
2020-04-28 19:51,"When profit rules, the quality of health care suffers.  Even in Sweden.  We see this in their nursing homes which have gone private.  

Patient care in a health-for-profit system obviously puts profit before health outcomes.  Bottom line outcomes rule. 

The private nursing homes are a stain in Sweden's otherwise brilliant and generous  Scandinavian model of welfare, which is imitated around the world by the best among the advanced rich countries,

A health care system that focuses on public health first, has better outcomes. This is clear in the rest of Sweden's welfare state, relative to which the brutal statistics from the private nursing homes stand out.  

Federal governments which everyone pays for with their taxes do have the biggest pool of resources. They can provide for the three most vital needs of any civilized society:  health, education, and housing.

The US is alone among the richest nations where health education and housing are all for profit. 

Big Pharma, the private medical insurance giants, and the multinationals connected to hospital services spend fortunes ""educating"" the public that anything coming from ""the state"" is socialism or worse.

That is simply not true.

2020-04-28 19:57,"Based on what other nations have suffered with lockdowns, Sweden's method is a success that starts with a robust, free and efficient universal healthcare and the knowledge from the beginning of the crisis that the state would help those who lost income or revenue.  Each country seemed to have its own unique requirements to deal with the pandemic, and Sweden's was manageable from the start."
2020-04-28 19:59,"COVID 19's fatality rate may end up being around .2% (2 out of 1000) when we account for all of the people who were sick and not tested.    Many of those who died were already old or sick. Not everyone, but many.  

Let's say this were instead a non-infectious, new type of cancer that had just popped up and suddenly infected and could kill .2% of the world's population, with most of them being older and not in good health

You are given the option of saving those .2% at the cost of throwing 25% of the population onto unemployment, causing massive personal and business bankruptcies, and potentially igniting a depression. 

Would you choose to pull that lever? 

Or, would the cost of saving those people not be worth it?"
2020-04-28 20:01,"Arguments for Sweden: There is no exponential growth in either daily transmissions or deaths. And the curve is flat. Yes, their numbers are higher than in other countries (aside from England, France Italy, Spain) BUT it is likely that when the lock down countries start loosening up, their levels will rise to Sweden’s and will stay there unless lock downs are reinstated or herd immunity is reached. IF herd immunity ends up being the solution, then Sweden would have reached that level sooner and the economic and psychological experiences by its people during the pandemic would be much better than of residents of other countries. 
We will see how this approach works in the US. The change in the number of deaths between now and in 2-3 weeks in states that are opening up (like Georgia), will tell us."
2020-04-28 16:35,"Israel is about the same size in population as Sweden, more crowded, and has about 1/10 the number of deaths. So please don't tell me about how great the Swedish approach is. What are they really doing -- sacrificing seniors so people can go to restaurants?"
2020-04-28 20:05,"As others have pointed out, by all available measures, the Swedish experiment is a failure.  They have the highest per capita death rate in Scandinavia, and their cases and deaths continue to increase daily.  Keep in mind that Boris Johnson was following the Swedish model of attempting herd immunity, and look where that got THEM: the UK has the third highest continual case and death rate in the world.

As others have also noted, the only reason Sweden isn't in even more trouble than it is has to do with its health care system and other factors that ""built in"" at least a modicum of potential safety.   It has come to light that Mr. Trump toyed with the idea as well.  Given the wholly inadequate state of our health care system, that would almost certainly have doubled, even tripled our death rate at this point: we are already at 58,000 - a many people dead in less than 10 weeks than died in Vietnam in 10 YEARS - and that number would probably be closer to 200,000 by ow, if not more.

Attempting herd immunity with a novel coronavirus was always a fool's game.  And Sweden has not won that game."
2020-04-28 20:09,"Isn't it possible that one answer to the mystery of Sweden's success is that some people are actually developing immunity (after having the virus, of course, however mildly) and therefore slowing the over rate of transmission? It is certainly true that we scientists do not yet know how long this immunity might last or if everyone exposed to the virus develops it, but nonetheless it seems like a question worth asking, especially considering that many governors in the US (including Cuomo) are beginning to rely on antibody testing."
2020-04-28 20:10,"If you compare death rates with similar nations in terms of weather, working and leisure culture, urban density, demographics and degree of intergenerational cohabitation (Norway, Denmark and Finland), then it's clear that this strategy wasn't good at protecting people's lives. Comparing death rates with France or the UK is a pretty low bar, as these are denser nations at the heart of touristic and commercial exchange in Europe. The pandemic hit Sweden at the same time as Denmark, yet Denmark far less casualties with a relatively mild lockdown, which by the away is already being relaxed."
2020-04-28 20:11,"It's too early to be assessing this approach, let alone celebrating it.  We don't know enough about this virus yet.  There are worrying reports about the virus mutating.  It may yet affect younger and healthier people in unpredictable ways.  Hopefully it won't happen.  But I don't think we know for sure yet."
2020-04-28 20:12,"Of course the problem here is we are flying blind.  We don't know what would have happened if we had taken a different path.  Sweden might have almost eliminated the disease if they had locked down, there is just no way to ever know.  I didn't think the lockdown's in the US would be very effective, but they have turned out to be much more effective than I thought.  I thought we were going into a step curve due to noncompliance which would have overwhelmed our health care systems everywhere.  But that is just what I thought."
2020-04-28 20:15,"I have family in Sweden

In response to BK MD  who cites 22 deaths per 100K residents vs 4-7 in other Nordic countries: We do NOT know
what the final death toll we be.

The Swedish model is herd immunity concentrated in the least vulnerable.

If there should be a second wave.  it will claim very much less dead in Sweden than in other countries. 

Sweden's government follows the best advice of its scientists and  regularly polls if  people approve of the policy.     70%  do."
2020-04-28 20:21,"There are different techniques to address issues such as this. No one approach is correct.  Sweden decided to favor the economic interests of the country over the few who might die or be severely impacted health wise. Sweden is more homogeneous than most other countries, although there are fairly large immigrant poor groups in parts of the country such as in Malmo and parts of Stockholm.  It will be interesting to see how these groups have weathered the storm. Many of them are young, so they will probably do alright if their young handle the virus like the young in other parts of the world.  A very interesting real time natural experiment, although I don't believe we will be able to generalize the data to all other countries that have taken a more conservative approach."
2020-04-28 20:22,I am totally confused now. Both scientists and political leaders don't seem to know what to do or can't agree on what to do or don't have the will or the courage to do what needs to be done. I don't care so much for myself but for my adult children who have to somehow make a living. They have to decide on their own what risks to take absent clear laws and law enforcement. I guess risk assessment is just a part of life.
2020-04-28 20:24,"While Sweden, like most countries, has failed to protect elderly people in care homes, they seem to have gotten the rest right.  The general goal has been to minimize the stress on healthcare and on the population generally.  Very few children have gotten sick despite the fact that they go to school, go swimming together, play sports, etc.  Compare that to the trauma for Spanish children who just were allowed out of their homes after  6 weeks.  Two more points - the real results will not be in for at least one year.  Only after a second or third wave of infections and deaths will we know whose strategy worked the best.  Also, I heard that some immigrant populations, like Somali-born Swedes, were heavily over-represented among the deaths.  If indeed that is the case, it could explain part of why Sweden is seeing higher death rates than say Finland, Denmark or Norway, which has had far less immigration than Sweden.

For sure mistakes have been made and maybe things could have been done better, but I think judgment on the success of Sweden's strategy needs to wait about a year."
2020-04-28 20:28,"""Bubbly young Swedes,"" sounds idyllic in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, except of course for the consequences. What is equally a concern is the second wave of infections that will surely strike at some point in the future. The swarm is simply mutating and will again be on the hunt for new hosts, probably finding bubbly young socially active Swedes a great host to infect. The 1918 pandemic gives us a well-documented case study on how viruses can mutate and return with even more lethality, especially among a young, healthy population. Sweden may soon regret their choices as this contagion is far from over."
2020-04-28 20:32,"Why when Sweden's policies are criticized are they only compared to other Nordic countries?  Is there something unique about the way this virus impacts Nordic countries vs all others?  Sweden's results are in the middle of the pack in Europe.

It is impossible to say today whether Sweden's chosen path was better than anyone else's.  This thing is far from over in Sweden and in countries with more extreme lock down policies. It's not over until until we have a vaccine.  

Sweden has taken the position that it isn't possible to maintain a lock down long enough to wait for a vaccine.  They believe that  those that locked down early will have to face the consequences from the virus when they inevitably have to ease their restrictions and that in the end the differences will be more about when and less about how many are killed.  Time will tell."
2020-04-28 20:34,"Some points.

There are many more people dying in Sweden than in the comparable Nordic countries. The death rate is triple that of Denmark, 6 times that of Norway and Finland and 8 times that of Iceland.
Furthermore the infection and death rates have slowed in the other Nordic countries, not so in Sweden.

The health authorities in Sweden say, they are not trying for herd immunity.
If they are in reality trying for herd immunity their are two caveats.
1. It is not sure yet if people can get covid again.
2. Herd immunity needs an immunity rate above 70 %. A number that even Sweden is not likely to reach."
2020-04-28 20:35,"I don't understand why the U.S. is constantly comparing infections and deaths of our population and Sweden's, or anyone else's for that matter. The U.S. has a generally obese population and a high rate of diabetics which does not compare to the populations of the other first world countries."
2020-04-28 20:38,"That is a big gamble that Sweden took. I am not sure they should claim victory quite yet or that other countries should point the finger at them until the crisis is truly over. 

The US is likely to have big problem re-opening with insufficient testing and tracing, so lock down in the US in the end may not have been that effective. 

In other places lock down worked a lot better. Again lock down is only one piece of the puzzle."
2020-04-28 20:42,"The main question is: will Sweden's approach engender herd immunity (their goal). If it does, then perhaps they have accomplished something, because reopening the US will entail risks that cannot be avoided for a year or more and will look something like Sweden. In the US, though, especially in places hit hard, caution will govern much of the population about restaurants and the like. To be sure, Sweden has much better figures than many New England states.

The one important caveat has to do with health care: it's universal in Sweden; it's broken here, especially for marginal workers and the working poor."
2020-04-28 20:43,"If 26% of a Stockholm's population of 2 million will have been infected within a few days, that means over 500,00 people will be infected.  That was presented as good news, since it increases immunity.  If the mortality rate remains low, that means that the residents who are positive are in a lower risk category - young, healthy and with access to quality health care.  (The photos showed crowds of young people gathered.)

Extrapolating that to the US is difficult, since most Americans are at higher risk due to age, obesity, heart disease, diabetes and, often, a lack of health insurance or the risk of losing health insurance if they away from work to quarantine."
2020-04-28 20:46,"We are all lab rats now. And looking forward, that is not a bad thing.

Plagues of this magnitude are unprecedented in these times of advanced technology, increased population density, ecological disruptions and humanitarian crisis associated with global warming, wealth disparities, and chronic warfare. All at once.

Transparency by governors such as Cuomo, Whitmer, and Kelly give some sense of the enormities of understanding the science and translating it into ethical policy and procedures. On the other hand, Trump trashed our pandemic preparedness programs and is compromising any effective response. 

Our environmental and economic activities drive viral transfer. Our government policies drive outbreak trajectory. Our political choices change facts on the ground. For better or worse. We have a lot to learn from this pandemic.

It's a safe bet that a Biden administration is best prepared to chart a better course to recovery."
2020-04-28 20:48,"A lot of people here claim that the Swedish approach is a failure compared to Norway or Denmark. 

But the thing is that according to most experts models without a lockdown Sweden (or any other place) would have been not a failure but a total disaster. But it’s not. 

Sweden might not be doing very well but its hospitals are not overwhelmed and death rate is high but not as high as in Belgium or UK. 

Neither the number of cases nor the number of victims in Sweden have skyrocketed so far like it was predicted. In theory it should have been worse than Italy or Spain already, even few days or a week delay of measures was said to fatal experts said, and so on - nothing like that happened."
2020-04-28 20:48,"Ontario has 15 million people compared to Sweden's 10 million. Ontario has 15,300 cases and 951 deaths. Sweden has over 19,000 cases and over 2300 deaths. In other words Ontario has 50% more people and less than half the deaths that Sweden has. This is not looking great for Sweden at this point. However, over time things may look different. I don't really trust any of the numbers completely."
2020-04-28 20:49,"That must be why they have one of the highest infection rates these days and are reconsidering their whole approach right now... a bit outdated, the article, it seems...

Sweden was an interesting model. One that failed, though."
2020-04-28 20:49,"""Trust is high in Sweden — in government, institutions and fellow Swedes.""

That's the difference. Never been true in America, which has given us some strengths and some weaknesses."
2020-04-28 20:49,"Kinda feels like Sweden was prepared to sacrifice the Old so the Young could spend their time being young.  The suggestion is that they didn't over react and that as a result, the deaths are the same as they would be otherwise, but without the economic costs experienced in other countries.  The only reasonable take away is that if Sweden's deaths are at similar levels of other countries, it simply means they got lucky.  Just imagine the consequences if New York had taken the same approach."
2020-04-28 20:50,"Many commenters are comparing death rates, total deaths, and infections.

Remember that the purpose of our lockdowns was to avoid overwhelming the hospitals, not to prevent epidemic deaths. It was triage we were told to fear. Remember also that policy makers are not responsible for deaths just because they do not order people inside.

If their hospitals have not been overwhelmed, and their lives have not been disrupted, then I would call that a form of success."
2020-04-28 20:51,It’s actually debated how well Sweden has done—or if it would work here.  But it does cast doubt on the need for extreme measures.
2020-04-28 20:54,"I have to think that Sweden's success (which is, to a degree, TBD) is due in part to the rest of Europe having been locked down and serving as something of a firewall. 

To date, what they've pulled off is encouraging to the rest of us looking forward to opening up. But 26 percent of the population having been infected was devastating to NYC. Hopefully Stockholm will have eased into it slowly enough, and with a healthier populace, to avoid the same fate."
2020-04-28 20:55,"The Guardian has reported that cases are high among the immigrant population, which now constitutes 20% of Sweden's residents.  This sounds similar to what we are experiencing in our minority communities.  It may be fine to be young and to be of heritage Swedish extraction, but it isn't so good to be an immigrant or elderly.   Sweden shouldn't be proud of failing it's most vulnerable populations."
2020-04-28 19:43,the amount of comments here about per capita rates alone reveal why this story should be taken down by now but no matter theres a new narrative to nurture. is liberty worth (someone elses) life? we always have to cultivate at least two opposing viewpoints for the sake of objectivity so that nothing can ever be solved and all we do is constantly argue with contrarians acting in bad faith. this is utopia for the liberal centrist. yet the question is never asked if the liberty of endless consumption and self-indulgence has made the west particularly weak to this virus
2020-04-28 20:00,"I don't think I'll be ever able to forgive the politicians responsible, the Trump's, and the Coumo's and the Murphy's for destroying this country.

While Sweden had a sober and rational Mr. Tegnell, we had the drama prone publicity chaser Dr. Fauci demanding to lockdown the entire nation when some states had barely any cases- as they still do.

And the wrecking ball driven by some governors continue while the yellow press applauds them.

Yes, how do we put Humpty Dumpty together again?"
2020-04-28 20:36,"CDC guidelines for contact tracing call for contacting only people who've been with a known infected person in a closed room for 2 hours or more.  Presumably there's a reason for that, you know, like, its been proven?

Where is the science that shows that closing beaches and parks, or restaurants and schools for that matter, prevents virus transmission on a meaningful scale? I have read about zero.  

Its ironic that public transportation and airports remain open - people abandoned them without being ordered to do so.  The fact that they spread sickness is a no-brainer, backed by reams of science. Perhaps Americans aren't so dumb, we just have terrible leaders, and we are a little too willing to believe them."
2020-04-28 20:37,"This was the first time I see a picture of the beach I live by in the New York Times :) Nice!

However I do hope that people will want to read and immerse themselves more about what the Swedish approach is before they make pre-decided thoughts. I wrote down here what I see as common misconceptions:

*Sweden has a “wait and see policy” and is doing nothing to fight Corona

I live here and everywhere in media, stores, internet, buses we are reminded to: wash hands, not go out if you feel slightest sick, keep distance, no unnecessary travel, not to visit the elderly. We are urged to work from home if possible (I do) Only people in need should use public transport to avoid crowds (I bicycle). I can sometimes see small crowds but almost all people are respectful and following the guidelines. But life changed a lot here too. So I would say the difference between Sweden and other countries is smaller then it is pictured.

*Sweden is not shutting down because it wants to save the economy.

Not true. Economy was only one out of many factors considered from a health perspective. In fact the decision to not close down society was purely made because the health agency believed citizen health would suffer more by a shut down. I do not believe that it is wrong that other countries did shut down though. But in Sweden I believe right decision was made.

There is always a balance and everything is not just black or white. We in the world are in the same boat, and it is not a competition!"
2020-04-28 20:37,Think about how low the infection rate would have been if Sweden had “locked down.” Think about how many of those people who died might not have.
2020-04-28 20:11,"Sweden has made a very sound choice and I applaud them.

The point is that having a higher death rate now will lead to earlier herd immunity and an end to Covid without devastating the economy or bankrupting the country.

Other countries will have the same deaths but spread over a longer period of time before herd immunity is achieved, but their economies will be staggered and governments financially destabilized."
2020-04-28 19:56,Until now all of Sweden has about 20.000 confirmed cases and still I keep reading that by May about 25 to 30% of Stockholms inhabitants will have reached immunity. Could somebody please explain to me how this should add up?
2020-04-28 19:49,"Sweden is fundamentally correct and the data bears it out. Their mistake was not safeguarding the elderly. The death rate from this disease is less than 0.5%. Face masks, some social distancing, ending handshakes are all in order. Runs on the hospitals by and large did not occur outside of very select areas in the US. The lockdowns have hurt and killed more people than Covid 19 ever would. Florida is doing exceptionally well. Lockdowns only hurt. Targeted efforts to protect the most vulnerable work best, and yes, like with any disease, a few will die who aren't in those groups. Tragic, but more will die from continued lockdowns."
2020-04-28 20:22,"What I took away from this is that the idea that Sweden ""hasn't locked down and they're doing fine"" is simplistic at best. An economy fully ""open"" like usual would still be having sporting events, concerts, public festivals, etc. Just because they kept restaurants and schools open doesn't mean that their approach is a 180-degree contrast to the stricter lockdowns elsewhere. Even under the ""life goes on"" Swedish approach, for example, Las Vegas (whose dimwit mayor is eager to throw open the doors to everything) wouldn't be able to operate its casinos."
2020-04-28 20:06,"Impossible to say whether Sweden’s approach is better or worse. Maybe death rates will end up about the same everywhere. But yeah, it’s easier to restart when you haven’t locked down."
2020-04-28 20:11,"The answer is obvious- the government can trust specifically *older and at risk* people to self isolate while the younger ones build up herd immunity. But in 21st century America we always sacrifice the young to save the old. So young people are not getting any aid while we crater their future to cater to entitled boomers who consider any talk that maybe they should have to isolate but not their children discrimination. To put it simply, American adults 60 and older simply cannot be trusted."
2020-04-28 19:41,"""The [Swedish Public Health] authority announced last week that more than 26 percent of the 2 million inhabitants of Stockholm will have been infected by May 1.

This article doesn't indicate the scope of testing performed in Sweden. Announcing that roughly 1 in 4 Swedes who live in Stockholm are infected, could be a harbinger of things to come. As has been reported elsewhere, a person could be infected, but not exhibit symptoms, yet still be contagious to others. 

Sweden's immediate neighbors imposed isolation, and kept the rate of deaths down (compared to Sweden). That's an accomplishment. Having 1 in 4 people who live in Stockholm carry the infection? That is a ticking time bomb."
2020-04-28 20:23,"The article says that the government doesn't impose tight restrictions because it trusts the people, but at the end it also says that people were hugging and kissing in crowded bars on a Friday night.

Many of us in the USA will eventually get Covid, the same as the people in Sweden, but we're locked down so that we don't overwhelm our weak health system by getting it all at the same time."
2020-04-28 20:03,The Guardian ran a story today that people in Sweden are starting to worry about the herd immunity approach taken by the Government. The next few weeks might tell a different tale.
2020-04-28 19:54,"It didn't work!

They've got one of the higher death rates in the world. So, yeah, they traded keeping the economy and society open for some additional dead people. It's a choice that we all have to make to some degree, but to say it worked isn't really accurate. What was predicted happened - more deaths."
2020-04-28 19:59,"Eventually in the US we'll have to open up and people are going to get it. People don't understand flattening the curve doesn't get rid of the disease, it just means you'll get medical care. 

For the  people calling for extended lockdowns, what is the endgame you want? 

-A vaccine? (might not even be able to be developed and is at least a year away)

-This to be eradicated? (there are a million confirmed cases and probably 20x unconfirmed...Unless you believe the CCP there isn't a reset button)

-Contact tracing? (how is that going to work in large cities like New York where you go on the train and pass a thousand people on your way to work... to get this to be effective, we'd need to run probably 100M tests a day in the US).

There isn't really a safe option that is good outside of helping the most vulnerable 10% while maintaining a normal life for everyone else."
2020-04-28 20:10,The comparison is not fair between Sweden and it's neighbors.Yes more people died but now 26 % of the population has immunity their neighbors just postponed the deaths.In the end the death percentage might be the same.They should have however saved more lives in nursing homes.
2020-04-28 20:57,Sweden and Norway are countries with national health systems and similar populations.  Sweden has twice the number of people as Norway and 10 times the number of COVID19 deaths.  This is supposed to be a success?
2020-04-28 20:59,"The article fails to even address population density. We know that the spread of Covid-19, and the death rate, increases dramatically based on how tightly packed people are, as the disease is incredibly contagious if you are in proximity to someone who is infected. The more you can social distance the better. It means countries with substantially lower population density should always have much lower infection and death rates even without active social distancing, and those with higher population density will have higher infection and death rates even with aggressive social distancing. 

It is precisely why there are massive outbreaks in tightly packed areas in otherwise open areas, like cruise and military ships on the sea, meatpacking plants and factories in rural areas, and most dramatically in heavily populated urban centers, like Manhattan, with a population density of 67,000 people per square mile. 

Sweden has only 64 people per square mile, by contrast Denmark has 347 people per square mile, yet Denmark has a substantially lower death rate. 

Why not laud Covid-19 death rates in Mongolia with 1 person per square mile? There was great fear of a massive outbreak in Mongolia as the disease moved directly from China. However, due to a lack of population density the idea of ""social distancing"" is meaningless as it exists on a massive scale naturally. As such, despite direct transmission from China, Mongolia has had only 38 infections, no community spread, and 0 deaths."
2020-04-28 21:00,"This article misses some very key aspects of the Swedish strategy. For one, if we are ill we are being asked to stay at home even if it’s just a tiny cold, and for the first time we get paid to from day one. All old people are being asked to stay away from all social contacts for an indefinite period of time (that’s a very big sacrifice.) We have been asked not to travel unnecessarily. Those who can are working from home. Finally, restaurants and other venues get fined if they don’t have enough space between tables. All these things may seem “small” compared to a total lockdown but it adds up."
2020-04-28 21:01,"Very interesting to note how many people here see recorded number of deaths as the sole criterion to determine success. In Sweden, we do not, we focus on life years lost. Plus, we factor in how quickly the virus moves through society (a lot is still unknown about immunity but if it is not a unique virus, we will either have antibodies or get light Covid-19 symptoms).

We move this through society at the right pace - below capacity and with a stable ICU utilization.

So yes, weak patients die quicker here than elsewhere but that is because we move the virus faster, not because those lives could have been spared.

All countries will have to find the right level once they open up. By chance (I doubt even the epidemiologists are that skilled), we hit something very close to the optimum level (75 percent ICU capacity utilization, R(t) of around 0.95).

We are a lot healthier than Americans, which means we can get through this quicker. Our health care can take about 5 percent active infections per week. The US average equivalent is 1-2 percent with big variations between states. That means that while we work through it in about 4-6 months, it will take 12-18 months in the U.S and with a higher toll because of the health differences.

Furthermore, our discipline in maintaining the right level of restrictions is likely higher than in the, politically, more heterogeneous USA. Hence, we can probably keep R at 1 with fewer “hard” restrictions.

My two cents. Time will tell"
2020-04-28 21:10,"How can you write this article without offering appropriate comparisons? Norway, Denmark, and Finland all have much lower fatality rates. You can't assess the lower key distancing strategy without looking at the consequences of alternatives."
2020-04-28 21:11,"I live in Stockholm, Sweden. Let me add some facts. In Stockholm, the subway is virtually empty, the restaurants and bars have lost 90% of their customers. Of course, it is possible to find examples of otherwise, but the main situation is that we are in a voluntary and responsible minimization of contact with others, to decrease the spread of the virus. Shops are open but the amount of customers is much less than normal. I see it when I go shopping for food."
2020-04-28 21:13,"as of this writing, sweden has the fifth HIGHEST mortality rate from Covid19 in the ENTIRE WORLD - two to four times higher than nearby denmark, norway, finland and germany (which, besides geography, all share cities of comparable urban lay-out, density and demographics).

how can anyone deem sweden’s approach a success? 

furthermore, any reader who has kept up with news media reports from sweden, norway and denmark over the last few weeks would surely understand that serious questions have already been raised about the data generated by the swedish ministry of health, leading to analysis that is at best incomplete and more likely than that, seriously flawed - even by the ministry of health’s own admission.

it’s far too soon to say that sweden’s approach has been successful. it might even be reckless to call it that."
2020-04-28 21:14,"Many commenters here seem to believe that the only two choices are either 1) sacrifice the economy or 2) go for herd immunity and accept up to 2 million deaths. But this is a false choice. Social distancing not only serves to ensure our medical resources aren't overwhelmed, but to reduce transmission to a level such that testing, contact tracing and quarantining can suppress any local outbreaks quickly. This was the strategy used in Taiwan and Korea. Had we not dithered and delayed for over a month, and had we stockpiled PPE and accepted WHO test kits, we could have had far fewer deaths AND re-opened our economy sooner."
2020-04-28 16:30,"""Sweden’s death rate of 22 per 100,000 people is the same as that of Ireland, which has earned accolades for its handling of the pandemic, and far better than in Britain or France.""
To compare with the worst failures gives a misleading picture. Sweden fares worse than the US (17), and much worse than Denmark and Germany (7), Norway and Finland (less than 4), and South Korea, Singapore and China (less than 1). In the ranking of Corona deaths per 100,000 people, Sweden is at #11 among all global nations. That's in no way a good result and it's totally wrong that this story presents that deadly screw up as a positive example."
2020-04-28 18:46,"Mm, this is how we talk ourselves down from our damn panic- er, I mean ‘pandemic.’"
2020-04-28 19:03,"The Swedes are playing the long game: they are accepting a modest number of deaths now in order to save more deaths later (given higher exposure rates they will be less susceptible to future spikes) and to preserve the strength of their economy (which will yield favorable health benefits/outcomes in the future). 

We are playing the short game: draconian measures (strict shutdown) to save as many lives as possible now, economy and long-term (COVID and non COVID- related) health consequences be damned."

Right from the mean stewardess on the plane who offered food to all but our family, geez, I had to stop her and do an Oliver Twist and ask for something for my kids, to some rather rude people in shops. We will revisit Norway, Denmark and Finland but never Sweden. Especially with their present callous attitude.

If it is true that millions have been infected in Sweden, then the real infection fatality rate of the coronavirus is far lower than we initially thought. That's just the simple math of a simple fact. 

We are forgetting what ""flatten the curve"" means - the point was to manage the infection rate such that hospitals didn't get overwhelmed. The point wasn't to lock us all down for a year to minimize COVID-19 deaths at the expense of all other things.

Focusing on just one metric is a very bad idea. If we optimize for merely minimizing deaths from one single virus, the coronavirus, we will succeed at that and wind up failing at preventing other kinds of deaths. Here in the Times' own pages they have written about lack of children's immunizations for other diseases, 400k more deaths from malaria, and 150m more people at risk of starvation.

People think doing a cost-benefit analysis is morbid or inhuman, but watching the knock-on effects pop up, it is increasingly clear that it is inhuman not to."
2020-04-28 21:27,"Denmark and Sweden are demographically very alike, but they went about dealing with Covid-19 in very different ways. Denmark reacted like most other nations while Sweden placed the trust in their people to do the right thing. Sweden has roughly twice to population of Denmark and while they have twice as many infected people, they have 5.3 times the number of dead. Sweden is paying a very high price for their convenience and trust."
2020-04-28 21:27,"As I remember it, the rationale behind lock-downs, social distancing and other actions taken by public officials was to prevent overwhelming the health care system - so called ""flattening the curve"".  No medical official expects there to be a miracle cure or a game-changer and are painfully aware that a vaccine is over a year away.  Until there is a vaccine, all countries will experience the more or less the same death rate with those areas where the health care system is inadequate experiencing higher rates.  Sweden, obviously, had faith in their health care system, enough so that they could take the path they did."
2020-04-28 21:27,"The Czech Republic is the same size as Sweden but we have had 1/10th the deaths. And we can even picnic in the parks. But overall we took a more conservative approach, and we took it early. So maybe Sweden is not really such a good example."
2020-04-28 21:27,"I'm an American living in Norway for more than a decade. I see Sweden and Norway as nearly twin countries when it comes to their feeling of collective responsibility and respect for their governments. It will be an interesting comparison. So far, according to Worldometers (which I admit is not perfect), Sweden has 233 deaths per million people and Norway has 38, even though many Norwegians travelled home with CV from spring vacations, driving the infection rate up early on.  But maybe Sweden's approach is a worthwhile sacrifice and their economy will fare better than Norway's (and therefore fewer people will suffer or die from the despair of depression, economic or otherwise). Norway has not closed restaurants, though it has closed bars, hair salons and many other places and been generally far more strict than Sweden. I am actually curious and torn about what is the best response, and I don't feel a political response to it. I vote left, but sympathize with Bret's arguments in the weekly debates between him and Gail. I think SE and NO give an interesting test case, even if global consequences might make it hard to interpret the results."
2020-04-28 21:29,"I see that many comments focus on the number of deaths and while that number certainly is relevant, it is not a good indicator for the ""success rate"" of the Swedish model. 

Lockdown is not in place to prevent people from dying, it is there to prevent people from spreading, and catching, the virus.

Therefore, the number that should be looked at is the number of people infected.  The death rate in itself is not depending on how you caught the virus.

Sweden acted slowly to protect the people at the retirement/elderly homes and that shows in the death-statistics, but when it comes to the actual spread of COVID-19, the numbers compare rather favorably with countries that opted for a full lockdown."
2020-04-28 21:32,Italy was initially going with  life as usual until deaths started mounting up. The mortality rate in Germany was below 1% for a while until it did not. Things change. I wish the best for the Swedes but it's too early to make any conclusions.
2020-04-28 21:39,"We cannot sum up this pandemic yet, we are in the beginning. Let's go back in a couple of years and see how did the right thing. 
One thing that is not mentioned in the article is that the government are not allowed to close down the country in peace time. Sweden needs to change the constitution to do so. We trust the Swedish CDC and the scientists and some popolistic politicians are not allowed to make faulty mistakes. We are a true democracy based on evidence not populism."
2020-04-28 21:40,"yet one more way in which Sweden manages to do things better than the United States. In addition to top-notch healthcare system, persion systems, and a great social safety net, they protected their citizens' prosperity in this crisis and didn't join the hysteria.

To those who say ""but look, their mortality rate is higher than the other Nordic countries"": yes, but it's lower than many countries who had lockdowns, and the other Nordic countries will have a protracted Pandemic. Sweden will likely be out of the Coronavirus crisis by the end of the summer, and have herd immunity by then. Without a shutdown. The other countries will have herd immunity by 2021, so ultimately, although the deaths are spread out, as many or even more people will die. Not to menton the economic damage and deaths of despair resulting from a protracted shutdown.
So it's fair to say that they could have done things a bit better and a few more lives could have been saved -- but all in all it looks like putting scientists in charge (as opposed to politicians or doctors) might have a good outcome."
2020-04-28 21:40,"A very misleading article, as others have noted. Comparing Sweden to Ireland, with similar total cases and similar deaths per million, the number of new infections in Sweden is about 700, whereas those in Ireland is about 230. Further, Total deaths are far higher than Ireland (although fewer cases per million), serious/critical cases are 3 times higher, and active cases are 80% higher. Although these two countries may be in different phases of the growth cycle, one may reasonably expect Sweden's numbers to look far worse in a week to 10 days. As others have noted too, the comparison to Norway looks even worse. (Source: Worldometers)"
2020-04-28 21:44,"We all knew this virus had a high death rate amongst the unhealthy and elderly populations, but we ignored it because we wanted to convince ourselves the virus was the great equalizer.  Hence why the outbreak has killed so many in nursing homes and public housing.   

But hey, wealthy New Yorkers get to feel like they saved people from the virus, while millions of middle class and lower class folks get decimated by the economy if they haven't already been hit by the virus.  

Focus on the at-risk populations!"
2020-04-28 21:44,"Not counting countries like Andorra or San Marino, Sweden is #8 in deaths per 1 million population. Higher than in US despite people are much healthier and more fit than in US. Not exactly an indicator of success. They don't obey social distancing in a town where I live (pop. 30 thousand). They are literally on the top of each other in lines to check out at grocery stores. No PPE for bus drivers, teachers (schools below 9th grade are open)or care givers. Zero chance to buy masks or hand disinfectants in pharmacies. Out of stock and no one cares when stock will be replenished (don't irritate the pharmacist by asking a question - just wash your hands ). Minimal testing is done despite promises. Affected people are discouraged from seeking care and often die at home. The decision was made here to sacrifice elderly and keep watching when to adjust the ""restrictions gauge"". Tegnell chose one path only and does not seem to be willing to change it.  Young people enjoy their lives. Biking, jogging and in city restaurants. Elderly, locked up in nursing homes infested with virus and families of dead love ones not so much. Unemployment is very high with mass layoffs and furloughs. Not sure where the win is, except satisfying demand of young people to have fun."
2020-04-28 21:46,My grandparents emigrated 150 years ago. I wish they had stayed.
2020-04-28 21:47,"What I am having trouble understanding is how the people in these pictures  seem so  unafraid. With all these stories  of people in their 30's and 40's on ventilators, this disease really scares me. And I can't even imagine how people with diabetes or other comorbidities feel. How are they able to just go out and eat in restaurants? Even if I were allowed, I wouldn't feel comfortable. 

And what is the explanation for their rate of infection not being so much higher than places on lockdown?"
2020-04-28 21:49,"Given time and no vaccine most countries will come to about the same level of death as every other country, possibly with some differences based on general health and age. It's likely that some countries will suppress the real totals, such as Russia, Saudi Arabia and others. The best that can be accomplished at this point is to keep the medical system of a given country from being overwhelmed. Sweden may not have the best approach, but until a vaccine that actually works is found and produced in massive numbers all will eventually see that same level of death. Again, that is if they never overwhelm their medical system, or as we should call it in this country, our medical industry, because here, it is an industry for profit.

I don't see anyone doing very well, and I expect that a lot of denial of the real consequences will be undertaken by many an authoritarian dictatorship, including the US."
2020-04-28 21:52,"To complement the analysis here is how Sweden will not have the collateral damage (i.e. deaths) that are associated with increases in unemployment and loss of businesses (by small business owners.) In the U.S., where there is very little of a social safety net (i.e. unemployment benefits), economic studies based on extensive historical data have found that extended unemployment and loss of income lead to substantial loss of life (where each +1% unemployment correlates with up to 50K deaths.) It is caused by the feeling of hopelessness, despair, and immense stress which leads to mental and emotional illnesses, physical illnesses, and, sometimes, death (from illness or suicide.) So it is not so simple as to simply compare the # deaths caused by infections between states or countries."
2020-04-28 21:54,"The current population of Sweden is 10,088,249.  The New York metropolitan area is 20.1 Million.  I will also assume a lot smaller geographically that Sweden.  

""In several bars on Medborgarplatsen Square in Stockholm. They crowded around the bar, hugging and kissing, and generally flouting the rules.""  Let's hope that it doesn't backfire like the collage students who went on spring break and returned with a 60% positive rate when tested for the virus."
2020-04-28 21:54,The true success of the Swedish model will be seen with the lower post-Covid suicide rates and less devastating personal bankruptcies with the resultant deterioration in general mental health. The medical experts have no idea what demons the lockdown in other countries may have unleashed. What value will Sweden’s naysayers attach to those numbers?
2020-04-28 21:57,"I understand all sides of this (well, sort of).  I guess I struggle with the fact that death/loss of life (and the suffering before that) is so final.  To place that burden on one segment of the population (and random others of us, even young and healthy) seems wrong.  (With folks living longer lives, many folks even in their 70s could have decades more of life, if not for something like this.)  I know there are very real worries  about health and economic effects from shutdowns, but there's at least a chance those are recoverable.  No such chance with death."
2020-04-28 22:10,"I wonder if Sweden will get hit hard at some point. All those parts of the US who thought it was a Coastal and urban problem are seeing rising cases even as they are starting to lower in New York. It worked it's way from the two coasts and the big cities to the middle of the country, smaller communities and even rural areas. It was not surprising then that W. Virginia was the last state to record a case. They actually thought they were safe and got it anyway."
2020-04-28 22:10,"I’m far from convinced, but time will tell. I suppose one benefit for the greater good is that when the scientists are eventually able to compare the various approaches taken, this version will have been real rather than hypothetical, which can help inform governments when the next pandemic strikes. Having said that, I think the really successful outlier is New Zealand, with Australia a close second. They have gone for elimination by taking full advantage of their island status (OK, I know OZ is technically a continent) and closed borders to all incomers except for repatriations, and even they had to be self-isolated in approved accommodation. If only we’d done that in UK. My farmer neighbours knew that was the way to go. They practice strict isolation. With animal movement."
2020-04-28 22:11,"I agree with the Swedish approach to the virus but valid comparisons between countries can only be done when this is over. We need to see the serology data to see what the incidence of infection was and we need to see histopathology data to see what percent of those whose deaths have been coded to Covid19 actually were infected by evidence such as the presence of viral particles in tissue slides.  I have been told by medical professionals that many deaths in urban hospitals are automatically being attributed to the virus if there is any respiratory distress which could mean than flu pneumonia cases are coded to CV-19. Bottom line, let’s apply the rigorous standards of scientific peer review on all the infection and death data before any conclusions are drawn."
2020-04-28 22:12,"As of Friday last week - Sweden; Population 10 mil. No lock down. 16,755 Covid cases/2,021 deaths. Meanwhile Australia; Pop 22 mil. Locked down. 6661 cases/75 deaths. Australia has lots more elbow room but only emphasizes the value of social distancing. What happens during the long winter in a few months? Sweden isn’t immune to the global economic downturn so there’s limited value to keeping it’s domestic economy comparatively open."
2020-04-28 22:14,"The key figure here is the excess deaths. The coronavirus has a disproportionate impact on the elderly and those who are already gravely ill. That is why there is such a large delta between the number of people who have officially died from the virus (~2,000) and the number of excess deaths reported relative to the average (~400). It suggests many of those who have died from the virus are part of a population of individuals who were already most at risk of dying from reasons other than the coronavirus. The most extreme interpretation is that the virus is killing people who were already likely to do. I am starting to think countries with strict lockdowns have made grave mistakes in which younger generations who have many years to live with the consequences are paying a steep price to help people who may otherwise have died from other causes die from those other causes instead of the virus."
2020-04-28 22:16,"Sweden has definitely higher mortality in Covid 19 compared to our neighboring countries. But how many percent have or have had the virus in Sweden in relation to our neighboring countries?

how long can you keep large parts of a community closed and at what cost?

It seems virtually impossible to stop this virus without a vaccine that can take a long time, maybe years?

what difference will the different strategies have on the death toll when we have achieved herd immunity in the different countries?

The final answer we get later when several countries are at the end of the pandemic and it is only then that the countries can be compared with each other. what action was taken? what were the economic effects? how did mortality differ depending on the different strategies?"
2020-04-28 22:17,"Well, not quite. I prefer to compare pickled herring to pickled herring, not pickled herring to bangers. Sweden’s contiguous twin, Norway, went the California route with early, strict mitigations. Sweden’s per capita death rate is 6 times that of Norway. Over the past week Sweden’s deaths have been going up an average of well over a 100 a day. Norway’s, under 5 a day. Norway is planning to start to open up next week. Sweden has passed regulations indicating they may do much stricter enforcement next week. But maybe Norway is a fluke of a herring. Well, to Sweden’s East is another contiguous Nordic neighbor, Finland. It also went the California route. And it looks pretty  much the same as Norway with a death rate a small fraction of Sweden’s"
2020-04-28 22:17,It is a matter of what is valued - economic security or those most at risk.  This is one data point to compare with those that took the lock-down approach.
2020-04-28 22:25,"Sweden is definitely trading off more deaths now and less later, while not closing down their economy. I've turned this over repeatedly in my head and I can't truly say that I find them right or wrong about this. The paranoia and severity of the lockdown in the U.S. is having life and death ramifications in all sorts of ways separate from the virus itself, so I do think there's an argument to be made for Sweden's methods.

But what I find really unacceptable is the way the headline is framed - it doesn't seem to have hurt them?  That simply is not true.  As many have pointed out it comes at the cost of its most vulnerable population.  If someone wants to make a comparative argument for the disparate methods consisting of quantatative and moral factors I'm ready to listen, but please don't put out such blatently misleading and almost glib statements."
2020-04-28 22:28,"A good immune system is probably the best defense and Sweden seems likely to encourage that with low levels of poverty, a good economy, good healthcare, and being one of the happiest places on the planet."
2020-04-28 22:29,"The article says that most of the deaths were among seniors . But perhaps Swedes have a different view of life after 75 - that if its your time to go, then its your time.  Versus the approach in other countries - particularly the US - where it seems to be your ""duty"" to wring every possible day out of your life, no matter what the cost, with your last struggle finallly ending in death.  I think I like the Swedish way better."
2020-04-28 22:33,"When I watch the Swedish television news programs each day, I notice that the health experts regularly convey to their interviewers the notion that Covid-19 isn't very dangerous to young people and that its spread among the youth is okay as long as the broader spread throughout the wider population doesn't exceed the capacities of the health care system.  Swedes seemed shocked when younger people die from Covid-19, as one media celebrity did recently.  The authorities including Mr. Tegnell adamantly dismiss the reality of asymptomatic transmission as well as the WHO's concern that exposure may or may not offer much protection from reinfection.  Swedish experts who disagree with current policy are rarely included in radio and television programs nor are reporters willing to risk asking tough questions during press conferences.  Now many Swedes are wondering why other Nordic countries are carefully reopening their societies while Sweden is left with a very high transmission rate and serious spread of the virus to areas of Sweden outside of Stockholm.  It will come as a great shock to Swedes when the damaging effects of the virus on various parts of the human body, including the risk of blood clots, stroke and lung damage, are finally discussed in Swedish media."
2020-04-28 22:32,Don't they have socialized medicine? Maybe the people of Sweden are healthier overall with less underlying conditions? Many of the people dying from Covid have other medical issues. Could this be a difference for the Swedes?
2020-04-28 22:38,"The mandatory universal lockdown is an extremely blunt instrument that might be appropriate for short periods of time while we are still assessing the problem and who is most at risk, but it is unsustainable as a long-term approach.

Sweden's approach, on the other hand, strikes a different balance between the COVID-associated health risks to its population on the one hand and the economic, psychological and societal costs on the other.

Before anyone condemns Sweden's approach because it resulted in more deaths than Norway's or Denmark's or some other country in total lockdown, consider that no modern society assigns an unlimited value to a human life.  If it did, we would be practicing ""safer at home"" 365 days per year, cars would cost millions of dollars each, smoking would be banned everywhere, and individual freedoms would be a fraction of what they are today in western democracies.  

In reality, governments, insurance companies and juries assign values to human lives every day, usually somewhere in the six figures in the United States.  That number usually goes down as a person ages on the theory that they have ""consumed"" more of the value of their life.  It's a cruel calculus, but there it is.

Back to Sweden, it seems to me that their approach is consistent with the long-held belief that societies will not in fact do ""whatever it takes"" to save a life, or ten lives, or a hundred lives, and anyone who thinks that will change because of COVID is fooling themselves."
2020-04-28 20:49,"Sweden's death rate is 22 per 100,000. Those of countries with similar cultures and health care accessibility but that dealt more conventionally with the virus are Denmark: death rate of 7.5 per 100,000 and Norway: death rate of 3.8 per 100,000. They are 3 and 5.5x lower. Why is this not addressed in the piece?"
2020-04-28 21:04,"It looks like Sweden did not care about protecting the elderly. While it did not save the lives of many of them but  it must have saved a lot of many that the government spends for their care and for their pensions. In many countries the poor are expendable, in Sweden it must be the elderly."
2020-04-28 21:39,"Some in my household have been talking about moving to Sweden.

Sweden has accepted the truth that the U.S. and the U.K. are refusing to admit - COVID is going to have to make its way through the population. Shutting us all inside is only postponing the inevitable. We will have to live with COVID as we live with all other viruses.

The NYT, the Post, CNN, etc. seem so heavily invested in lockdown that I despair of them ever letting us out. They keep beating that one panic-inducing drum in the face of increasing evidence that COVID is hardly deadly at all to healthy under 65s and to most over, that the whole point of locking down (ICU capacity, remember?) was achieved in most of the country weeks ago (in most cases ICUs were never in danger), that we've all been forced to give up our freedom of movement and right to self-determination for WEEKS NOW, and that this shutdown is inflicting massive harm on the entire population.

What do we have to wait for now? We could be like Sweden!"

2020-04-28 22:08,"It is attractive to look at an area - Sweden, or any city in the US with a relatively low number of cases - and try to argue that they don't need to distance. 

We don't have facts on what would have been, only on what is. And ""what is"" is this - some places, because of factors we really don't understand in light of the novelty of the disease have huge infection rates and catastrophic levels of illness and death, and some don't seem to be as affected. 

We don't know why - we hypothesize density, UV light, temperature, weather, season, timing, blood type, you name it - but we don't know.

We don't know why some truly healthy young people drop dead of strokes and embolisms, why some have lungs that seem to turn to mush, and why some waltz along, passing viral particles and droplets unaware of being infected.

We don't know if an area would have fared as well without a lockdown. All we know is that NY is a clear example of an actual outcome of a very, very short time of unchecked spread. 

That is what we know: we are gambling with a disease that kills young people dead for no reason, can infect maybe 25% of a large city in less than the time between Christmas and Easter, and cannot be put back in the box in anything close to the time it took to come out."
2020-04-28 22:32,"it seems to me that the Health Ministry in Sweden made a determination that in order to avoid the inconvenience that a shut down would cause the population in general. They could  live with the collateral  damage of fatalities among their aged population.

 The health department's attempt to force the Jewish nursing home to rescind its ban on visitors is unsettling -- at best.  Health authorities knew what would happen, and that indicates something else afoot, say, the herd immunity expriment its officials have denied.  Living in an epicenter state, I cannot imagine the human toll absent a lockdown. It will be a long time before human beings deemed vulnerable  -- and not just those on in years, are once again a visible part of society."
2020-04-28 21:24,"According to the latest Johns Hopkins data, which is the benchmark utilized worldwide, Sweden's death rate for confirmed  cases is 200% greater than that of the U.S. and almost 400% greater that that of Germany and just slightly less than Italy.  I suspect when Sweden's freedom loving folks begin to confront epidemic numbers of Covid-19 up close and personal a few weeks from now with not enough I.C.U. beds, they may just wish they had followed their neighbor Germany's  generally accepted protocols."
2020-04-28 21:32,"Well, more importantly, Sweden does not have either the mad leadership or the mad media that make anything impossible here.  Flattening the curve does not mean that people are free from disaster, it is just that it is postponed to another date, as vaccine is a long way away.  Flattening the curve has definitely helped the medical community.  So, I would like to see if the medical community in Sweden are under higher stress."
2020-04-28 21:47,"Different countries and different situations. We still don’t understand this virus or the long-term effects on the body. There are reports of some young people with mild cases of the virus dying of strokes. Sweden’s approach is assuming lasting immunity — that’s a big assumption, given the number of deaths. Also, as others have pointed out, Sweden has better infrastructure in place (universal access to medical care and higher living wages) than does the US. The pandemic has revealed the shameful state of low-wage workers making $7.50-12 an hour in some cases in the US. No one can live on that. And now, these are the people having to “go back to work.”"

Totally irresponsible.
2020-04-28 22:17,"""Many haven’t, but it does not seem to have hurt them.""

That's right. The dead Swedes aren't bothered the least by this SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 disease.

Scandinavia:
Denmark Pop . 5,822,700 Deaths 434 = 74.5 per million
Norway .. Pop . 5,367,580 Deaths 206 = 38.4 per million
Sweden .. Pop 10,333,400 Deaths 2,355 = 227.9 per million

Note! in Sweden - as opposed to the two other Scandinavian  countries, only people who died in a hospital are counted.

If the USA (Pop 328,239,500) had the same number of deaths as Sweden, it would be 74,806 people short by now.

If the US instead was like Norway: only 12.604 people in deficit."

lightly."
2020-04-28 22:32,"As a citizen of Sweden, I feel obliged to post a comment. 

First of all, it is seductive but dangerous to compare death figures between countries. It is easy to be fooled because of differences in how you count the cases. To my knowledge Sweden counts everyone who dies who also had a diagnosis of Covid-19, even if covid was not the immediate cause of death. We probably err on the side of overcounting covid deaths.
Secondly, you can only prove causality by conducting prospective randomised trials or long-term cohort studies. All we have at this point are associations in a sea of confounding factors. 
That said, comparisons with our neigbours are unflattering for sure.

The Swedish strategy on covid 19 has been to slow down infection rate so that the health care system can keep up with patient inflow, and to protect our elderly population. We've been successful with the first part of the strategy, but clearly failed with the second. 
Some speculations on my part as to why we failed to protect the elderly with home care or in nursing homes:
• Lack of testing. By the time it was generally accepted that covid-19 can spread asymptomatically it was too late and the disease had already taken hold in many nursing homes, most likely spread by care professionals.
• Care for the elderly sadly has low status in Sweden. Low paying jobs with a relative abundance of  low-skilled workers. High turn over of personnel and lack of continuity of care.
• Lack of personal protective gear."
2020-04-28 21:51,A lockdown of a nation's school children is not going to stop the spread of Covid to nursing homes (50%+ of deaths). Sweden has zero pediatric deaths due to Covid. It's time to end the school lockdown in the U.S.
2020-04-28 21:42,"Frankly, I don't care how Sweden is responding to the pandemic. I care about how the United States is responding: initially disastrously ill-prepared and now engaging in a nightmarish effort at catch-up. Sweden has a much smaller population than the United States and the narrative – as has been pointed out by other commentators here is misleading. A higher death rate is not a plus any way you look at it. No one is immune to this virus. And the biggest danger to citizens the world over is complacency toward W.H.O. warnings about a deadlier second wave – especially coupled to a typical flu season. The 1918 Flu Pandemic lasted two years and killed 20 - 50 million people. Experts believe it was the second wave, as the virus mutated, that made the disease so lethal. Covid19 is already mutating and scientists are warning we are probably a year away from any vaccine.

And as far as the U.S. response is concerned – this sort of misleading narrative doesn't help a thing. There are already too many people disregarding CDC guidelines here. The right wing sponsored protests( which the press should not elevate) and a person's own complicity – encouraged by an utter lack of responsible presidential leadership."

Democracies around the world, and nominal democracies like ours, have responded to covid-19 with quite disparate measures. But it seems that the best predictors of success are a healthy, educated population, a fairly equitable distribution of  wealth and respect for scientists, whatever their favored solutions. I hope this disaster convinces Americans that on all of these measures we have failed miserably."

So you will have to pardon me if I read this article with a ""so what""? For all I care, Swedes could tell me they have learned how to grow wings and fly and it would have the same relevance to me. MY reality is that people are sick and dying. MY reality is that a friend of a friend committed suicide this week because it was too hard to be an ER doc these days. My reality is I am afraid for all the doctors and nurses I know. My reality is it's in my street, in my town, in my state in droves.

And while that is happening, don't you dare ask me to leave my house. I won't.  Nor will my kids and husband and thank God we even have the option to be cavalier about it. I know others don't.

When actual formerly living people that you know, broke bread with, cried with, visited etc DIE it changes your perspective. If I count up the acquaintances, parents of friends etc, the number is staggering so I won't. Let's just say that this feels like 9/11.

2020-04-28 22:50,"People seem to want to throw a whole lot of shade on Sweden’s approach. It’s not perfect obviously but we really need to factor in the harm of an extended lockdown. It has consequences too. It’s easy to say we saved 100 lives but how many lives are affected by a prolonged lockdown. How many kids will fall off the school track and never get back on? They have their whole life ahead of them. And our deficit is going to make hard choices we were facing much harder. We’ve got a real danger on the horizon that makes Covid look like the time of your life. And we are going to need to invest heavily to avoid the worst of it. If a feedback loop starts happening, the danger becomes biblical. So let’s choose wisely. Perfection even if it’s possible probably isn’t the best option."
2020-04-28 22:50,"Whenever I see someone say that we have to learn to live with the virus, I think it is important to note that they are also saying that some of us will have to learn to die with the virus. To put this in some perspective, so far, at least 0.1% of the population of Lombardy and New York have died just since the beginning of March, even with lock down procedures in place, albeit later than they should have. And the disproportionate cost has been laid upon our elders, who are our parents, our heritage, our collective memory, and history. Yes, we will need to figure out how to move forward, but we need to do it smartly, and not throw away lives needlessly."

However, the linked page (also NYT) actually says that there were 1900 excess deaths. The number 400 is the number above the deaths reported as being due to covid-19.

Basic facts... 

The death rate in Sweden has reached more than 22 per 100,000 people, this true as far as it goes. However...

By contrast, Denmark has recorded just over seven deaths per 100,000 people, and both Norway and Finland less than four."
2020-04-28 19:32,"Why do so many serious news outlets keep writing pieces that basically glorify the ""Swedish experiment"" and ignore some basic facts? Here is the big one: vastly more Swedes are dying than Danes, Norwegians or Finns. Sweden has not quite 2x the population of each of its neighbors, but here are the COVID deaths as of today: 2355 in Sweden, 434 in Denmark, 206 in Norway and 199 in Finland. If you are a Swede, you are more than 5x more likely to die of COVID so far than a Norwegian or  a Finn. And that trend line has gotten worse - a week ago, it was ""only"" 3.5x.  Given the similarities in culture, diet, climate, etc there can be only one conclusion: social isolation and distancing, started early and aggressively, works!

Also, the Swedes can actually trust what their authorities tell them - here, our so-called President is suggesting we inject ourselves with disinfectants like Lysol to kill the virus. 

Lastly, Swedes aren't known for eating too much junk food, drinking like fishes, being lazy and spouting the sort of ""wisdom"" epoused by our Commander in Chief. I'm not surprised Sweden has fewer deaths - it is a well organized, intelligent and sensible country."
2020-04-28 20:45,"Wow, what is this writer smoking?  Compare Sweden to Norway, not Spain and France.  Norway, which is culturally similar, has one tenth the deaths of Sweden (with half Sweden's population), and through massive testing has halted the spread.

Sweden has an incredibly low population density, compared to Portugal their population is considerably younger (27% over 60 compared to 41% over 60 in Portugal) and those are important factors to take into account.
With proper containment measures in place, I believe they would be a lot better. But again, in a situation like this, it's not like we can make some city/territory a control group, to compare others against them, and for that purpose, Sweden does not fill in the requisites."

The economy (and any economy for that matter) cannot sustain this kind of shut-down for 18 or 24 months. And those timelines are assuming that a vaccine is found. There will come a point — perhaps when millions of lives are completely destroyed financially — that we will realize another solution is needed. We should to at least discuss a slow and strategic reopening of the economy.

Viewed from Australia (mortality 3/million) the situation seems even more depressing. Yesterday Sweden with less than half of our population recorded as many deaths as Australia has reported during the entire pandemic. This is not to be complacent - we have great advantages by being a relatively remote continent with less dense population distribution. But the comments in the article from Swedes seem to indicate convergence of two rather worrying motivations. First, young people just not wanting to be inconvenienced and epidemiologists wanting to prove a theory. Both seem to be prepared to sacrifice the lives of others to achieve these aims.  I sincerely hope I am wrong."

2020-04-28 23:02,"The relative success the Swedish strategy will show itself over time.  Keep more of the economy open, allow people to run their lives with “light touch” social distancing, avoid some of the negative externalities that come with shutting down the economy.  Let’s compare cumulative death rates a year from now and see who does better.  I am hoping for humanity that their approach proves the prudent one."
2020-04-28 23:03,"It’s way too early to declare the best strategy as this pandemic is far from over anywhere. Also, all current international comparisons are based on national statistics that have been reported with very different methods and by far from a common independent 3rd party. To my understanding there needs to be a lot of adjustments to make numbers comparable. Who are being tested, and under what circumstances, how are deaths being accounted for etc. Unraveling this post pandemic will task researchers around the world for years to come. And even when we eventually get comparable raw data, it will be very difficult to determine the winning strategy as the subjects, i.e the populations around the world, would react very differently on a single strategy due to cultural, social and demographical ideosyncrasies. In the end, when all this is over, any conclusion will anyway have a hard time getting acceptance due to national pride and politics."
2020-04-28 23:04,"I am neither an epidemiologist, nor a statistician.

Hence, in contrast to many commenters here, I do not consider myself fit to make national comparisons concerning better and worse approaches for combatting coronavirus.

To say anything substantial about the subject, I think at minimum the following factors need to be considered:

You need to be able to calculate the national mortality rates on a foundation of equal scopes of testing and reporting - a data type which obviously do not exist. 

I think already that does in principle invalidate much of this commentary section. 

Secondly, I would assume that you need the competence and knowledge it requires to distinguish and separate effects from approaches vs effects from implementations (NYT, you can close this thread now...).

Then:

You probably need to take variations in social mores into account - naturally, including, to what extent people, for various reasons, generally use to congregate and under what forms. Even, you probably need to take population density into account - including the extent of urbanization.

You probably need to take the average use of public vs private transportation into account.

You probably need to take into account when and how long school breaks are, or other periods of vacation, as well as when and to what extent populations travel generally - both domestically and internationally.

And this is just for starters. 

Hence, in contrast to many commenters here... (okay, I believe you got it)."
2020-04-28 23:05,"In my experience, the culture in Sweden has a lot less touching between friends and acquaintances than in many other nations. People distance more as a rule. In this situation, that is advantageous."
2020-04-28 23:07,"Sweden's new-cases trajectory is not much different from that of the US, per capita.  Both have flattened the increase but not reduced it to very low numbers, and that is the problem.  Once you relax restrictions and the next wave arrives, you're starting from a much higher new-cases rate than countries who have brought that number close to zero.  Starting a new wave close to zero gives you a chance to react and limit the peak you will reach about 2-4 weeks later.  Politicians need to listen to those who understand the mathematics."
2020-04-28 23:10,"As we open things up over the next thirty days or so it will be very interesting to see if we have a second/significant wave of infections/deaths. If not, it seems as though the governors, mostly Democrats, who appear as though they take great pride in implementing the most draconian lock-down measures will be disappointed if opening up is relatively successful. It appears that way to me, the next 45-days are going to be very interesting. My hunch is that easing the draconian measures is going to be mostly successful, the economy will improve, resulting in increased likelihood Trump is re-elected--what the Democrats fear far more than the virus."
2020-04-28 23:11,"Sweden's approach seems a bit casual and they are actually paying for it with their mortality rate. They are fortunate that they have enough medical capacity to care for the sick, but it doesn't seem to be saving as many lives as we'd hope.

I'd like to know if there is a setting where the interventions are an abundance of testing combined by 100% coverage of surgical-style face masks 100% of the time, available for free for all who need them at all shops, libraries, etc. Could we keep things open and keep CoVID down under those circumstances? In other words, how much does wearing a mask reduce the requirement of the 6-foot social distance?"
2020-04-28 23:13,"Sounds like Sweden has decided that seniors are more or less expendable:

""The Swedish Public Health Authority has admitted that the country’s seniors have been hit hard""

""Sweden will have to face its broad failing with people over the age of 70, who have accounted for a staggering 86 percent of the country’s 2,194 fatalities to date"""
2020-04-28 23:13,"I have read elsewhere that Sweden has not included deaths in nursing home or care facilities in it's statistics. You article does not mention this which means they may have considerably more deaths than reported. Compare Australia, 2.5 times higher in poulation with less than a 100 deaths vs Sweden with over 2,000. I know which country I would rather be in right now."
2020-04-28 23:16,"Of course the irony is that Sweden has always been the bete noire of the right in the US -- and vice versa. 

But Sweden has gone only further to the extreme in its deference to economic concerns than any US state. 

One would like to think that this might defuse the politics of decisions about how to weigh economic concerns against those of health. And that would be a very good thing, because we can't avoid that tradeoff. It will be important to decide that tradeoff with minimum political hysteria. 

Perhaps Sweden is not a good model. But at least the rest of the world will have a chance to see how it fares, in terms of health, in terms of economy, and in terms of the moral character of the nation."
2020-04-28 23:19,"We need to closely watch what is happening in Sweden, Denmark (where elementary students are back in school), and other developed countries with less stringent stay at home orders.  One must remember that the goal of  “flattening the curve” is to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed as was seen in Italy in Spain.  We will prevent excess deaths from overwhelmed hospitals but flattening the curve will not reduce the overall deaths in a situation where hospitals are not overwhelmed.  It will only delay the time to reach the same number of deaths as if the curves weren’t flattened.  Everyone is counting on a vaccine being developed but that is far from guaranteed.  The vaccines in clinical trials right now are based on a technology that has never be used before to develop a vaccine.  As a result, there is a good chance that it will fail.  It will take at least 18 months to develop a vaccine using conventional techniques and there is no guarantee that those vaccines will work.  Keep in mind there are no effective vaccines for any other coronavirises including those human vaccines that cause the common cold.  Despite ample research and money, we have never been able to develop vaccines for HIV or hepatitis C.  We need to consider strategies that begin opening schools and businesses in a well thought out strategy, recognizing that there will be an increase death rate that we will have you accept.  Without the development of herd immunity, I don’t see us getting out of this crisis."
2020-04-28 23:25,"Sweden and Norway make for a sound real-world experiment.  As of 4/27/2020 Sweden was testing at less than one third the rate of Norway (9 vs 30 per thousand) while experiencing more than six times the death rate (225 vs 38 per million).  Elsie from Chelsea is likely headed for Stockholm; me, I'll social distance in Vigeland Park."
2020-04-28 23:26,"This article is at odds with the data which today shows that Covid-19 deaths in Sweden were significantly higher, 22 per 100,000 people compared to its Scandinavian neighbor Denmark, which has much tighter restrictions, of 7 per 100k, Denmark's population is 5 times the density of Sweden which as we see in new York should make its death rate higher than Sweden. An even stronger comparison is between Sweden and the Czech Republic which has imposed very strict controls and as a result has a death rate of only 2 per 100k.  This article makes it sound like Sweden's experiment with people's lives is a major success. It is quite the opposite."
2020-04-28 23:37,"We have bus drivers, subway workers, medical professionals, teachers, dying. Why?  There needs to be more research on Swedish eating, health, DNA. That couldn't have worked here. We have too much death of ordinary people.  I hope people don't read this and think it would have worked in NYC or NOLA, for instance."
2020-04-28 23:39,"Sweden is higher than the USA in terms of deaths/1m, 233 vs. 179 and the US response has been not the best - Canada, Germany, etc. are doing better. The median is far away. I believe that the US could've achieved the median with the right policies and smarter people at the helm at a time like this and the steps to do this needed to have begun in 2010 (as I was advocating and received grants for but then they forgot about it after those funds were used, and if that happened to my team, a relatively small player, it probably happened to a lot of others doing similar things).

It will take a long time before the data is sorted out and the value of what Sweden or anyone else did matter. It doesn't seem to matter what people do: the disease runs it course and people pay one way or the other."
2020-04-28 23:45,"There is much we still don't know about this virus, but it's pretty clear at this point that a healthier population, both physically and financially, will fare better against it. I'm sure Sweden doesn't have nearly our levels of obesity and all of the other comorbidities that come with it, as well as less people dealing with cancer and autoimmune issues. Sweden and its Nordic neighbors also have very few people living in poverty. If we took the same 'balanced' approach in Chicago or NYC as Stockholm, the results would have looked much different."
2020-04-28 23:48,"In the long run, I think that the Swedish approach is the only way to go. Prior to this outbreak, there was the 1957 pandemic and the 1968 pandemic, and in those pandemics, there weren't the large scale lockdowns that had occurred with this outbreak. It just won't be feasible to close down entire national economies every couple of decades. There may be more deaths, and for hard hit cities like New York City, there won't be much of a choice besides a lockdown. Otherwise, however, on a more national and global level, I think the Swedish approach is the only feasible option should there be another pandemic in another decade or two."
2020-04-28 23:55,"I'd say the pictures say it all - it will be very difficult to keep all the young people in line with current recommendations with all that life flowing through their veins. The article is focusing on Stockholm that has taken the biggest toll, more than half of the numbers of infected and dead in the country. Imagine how hard it will be in the rest of the country to keep people adhering to the virus rules as spring proceeds and turns into summer.
I guess all countries will face this problem now when they start opening up.
Our leaders made their choice and we followed, most of us anyway. I think they made the right choice - keeping the infection rate down to a level that the healthcare system can handle while waiting for possible immunity and a working vaccine seems sound to me.  So far we're coping. With recommendations rather than regulations.
Vehicle manufacturers and travel industry are having hard times now, so also restaurants, gyms, artists and other businesses that rely on people crowding and moving around.
Parts of our industry are actually thriving - for instance contractors within renovations, roads and constructions. The fairly large numbers of long haulers on the roads do indicate a lot of businesses are not down and out.
We have a relatively high death rate as it seems right now but only when this virus ordeal is over we'll be able to assess the true numbers, compare between countries and  pass judgement on our choice of path."
2020-04-28 23:56,"When I grew up in the 60`s in NYC, food was not usually wrapped up away in plastic but was something you could touch.  Things were less sanitary, with more exposure to germs.  And I have always wondered if that exposure resulted in a stronger immune system.  A single example: I don`t remember widespread peanut allergies.  Most of us seemed immune to this.  So I now wonder if Sweden today is replicating what we were then de facto doing, allowing small exposures to the virus in multiple settings, thus building up the immune systems.  The answer to that question might lie in finding out what percentage of those who test positive develop major symptoms in Sweden, and how that compares to the percentage elsewhere.  I do not know the answer, just asking."
2020-04-28 23:58,"I would venture to say that Sweden also has a healthier population overall, with less obesity, diabetes, etc.  A recent report in LA Times noted that 92% of deaths in LA County were people who had underlying conditions, many of which are preventable.  

This also begs the question of whether it's moral to shut down the economy and livelihoods of people who take good care of themselves to save the lives of those who don't. 

It also argues for higher taxation and insurance premiums for those who are unhealthy due to preventable conditions.  To be effective, it would need to be much more sweeping than Bloomberg's soda tax.  To achieve better health outcomes like Sweden's it would be helpful to start from a more healthful population overall."
2020-04-29 0:03,"Sweden has one of the lowest population densities in Europe. Stockholm has 12,000 per sq. mile, NYC 26,000. I am guessing it has a high rate of single person and single family households in contrast to the US and certainly to Italy. Combine that with the excellent public health system and the limited but still substantial social distancing measures they are taking, then is it really so surprising that they aren't worse hit than other countries taking more stringent measures? Sweden is being used as an example by the right to suggest the US overreacted, but these critics of our response never mention the social and geographical factors that make Sweden less susceptible and make its example irrelevant for many crowded urban areas in the US."
2020-04-29 0:04,"So, it's not that Sweden decided to flaunt a covid-19 lockdown
because they are more resistant to that virus, but because they have taken minimal measures to curb its spread and decided that it is better to expose their elders to a higher risk of death than to affect so adversely the lives of the younger 90% of the population with a very low mortality probability. It's not magic, it's just a let the dice roll strategy."
2020-04-29 0:04,Sweden's approach has been to let the virus wash over their population and willingly sacrifice the elderly and compromised in the process. It will be interesting to see the raw data pertaining to that approach when the smoke clears.

2020-04-28 23:02,"Sweden has nationalized medicine. One of the positive results is that they have excess emergency hospital capacity. In Sweden there is no need to lock the country down to get the curve to peak lower than health care capacity- they are already there. So they can go right to step 2: open, but with rules. The really good thing Sweden has? A complete lack of belligerent, AK47-toting rule-breakers who confuse endangering their neighbors with personal liberty. Step 2 will work fine. Way to go, Sweden."
2020-04-28 23:20,"It is worth responding to the criticism articulated in this article that Sweden has not done more to protect it’s vulnerable elderly population with some facts about the Coronavirus. It is a novel virus. What does this tragically mean? Everyone — regardless of race, class, sex, gender, gender identity, nationality, ethnicities, religious background, or sports team they support — is going to get the Coronavirus at least once. Governments are not talking about this because most in WEIRD nations currently follow an infantilizing approach to governance. This is not helpful. We are at least 18 months away from a vaccine. So the question is not “can we halt the spread?” It is “can we reduce the rate of the spread?” Not so that you may not get it, but so hospitals are not overwhelmed. 

To remain in our present state of lockdown is already resulting in hunger for hundreds of millions around the globe. What happens when that hits a billion? What violence might unfold if rich nations and rich people decide to simply ride it out on their backlog of cash? What increases in crime might we see in the US if people cannot be employed? 

We are obsessed with the health consequences of this virus because they are a new phenomenon. But we need to face the facts that people will die. It’s a matter of if and not when. If Sweden is any example, modest precautions can go a long way."
2020-04-28 22:42,"International media loves to write about Stockholmers out and about neglecting social distancing. Truth is that almost everyone is respecting it. People work from home, restaurants are half empty etc. But that’s no story in that. Part of the strategy here is that lockdown hurts in the end and that you must also consider the increase of domestic violence and a lot of other social effects of a lockdown. Guess no strategy is really great here, drinking disinfectant might be the worst, other than that we won’t know for a long time."
2020-04-29 0:08,"A person who died of coronavirus isn't worth more than a person who died for another reason. 
If you want to evaluate the strategy of Sweden correctly, you must also consider people who have died (or will die) because of the lockdown. 
How many cancer patients have had to delay treatment?  
How many early diagnostic tests have not been made?
How many people will remain disabled due to the inability to have surgery at an early stage?  
How many people will lose their jobs and will no longer be able to afford medical treatment?"
2020-04-28 23:20,"The death rate in Sweden is not so clear. The numbers are very high compared to other Northern European countries (235 per 100'000 in Sweden, 550 per 100'000 in Stockholm ) and the backlog in reporting makes it impossible to know the actual extent of the situation. ICU are not saturated because there is a strict selection of the accepted patients (even triage at Karolinska Hospital). Every day around 50 persons enter ICU beds since the end of March, independently of the number of new cases. Other countries have shown a dependence between ICU occupation and new cases. The 26% of infection (in Stockholm not in Sweden) have been calculated after a very small survey with PCR testing in the beginning of April, where the Health Agency has calculated that each reported case corresponded to 75 actual cases. This number is at best a good guess. It was first estimated at 1 reported case for 1000 by the same agency before a journalist noticed that there weren't 6 millions inhabitants in Stockholm.  Similar number of deaths in other countries would give percentage of infection of less than 10% for Stockholm and less than 5% for the rest of the country (0.6% IFR for Covid-19). The Swedish model is not working so well and the situation there is far more dramatic than in all the other North European countries with similar level of care. Do not get fooled by the optimism of the people. Many are dying for a marginal economical gain"

Something valuable may be learned."

They claim they have minimised the risk of second and third waves, but at what cost? 2300 deaths at 23 per 100,000—six times Norway's death rate and three times Denmark's. In Australia, where we have had a high rate of testing and a fairly tough lockdown, we're getting well under one death per 100,000. It's hard to argue that the pleasures of picnics in the park, cinemas and restaurant dinners are worth the extra deaths Sweden has endured, especially as most of the victims have been in the nursing homes."

Every week I get groceries. Every week the majority are not wearing masks and buying a small number of non essentials.  This is not science, but I assume they get out most days, including the elderly.
This is nowhere near a lock down in the US. We are still out being exposed to germs at WalMart. Most of us, a couple days a week.
Sweden did the right thing. Yeah, some elderly in homes died, but then, people, a nursing home is not a daycare. It is actually where you go when you are nearing death and can no longer survive without assistance.  Your time when you check into a facility like that is short because your body has become weak. We can not prevent death. Trying to prevent death of people in nursing homes by shutting down society is fruitless."

2020-04-29 0:20,Sweden is claiming that they may be approaching herd immunity in a few weeks.Maybe ..but this does not really pass the smell test! Herd immunity does not even start to kick in until 50% to 70% of your population is infected. That would be about 5 M Swedes at minimum.Even if you assume a total mortality rate of .5% ( about 5 times the flu) that would mean 25000 deaths. The current # of dead is around 2300. I seriously doubt 22000 are going to die from this in the next 2 weeks+ . Even if you assume a mortality rate in line with the common flu (.1%) its daily new death rate would have to jump from the current 81 per day to close to 200 per day to get to 5000 deaths in the next month or so.

The reason seems clear, ""Trust is high in Sweden — in government, institutions and fellow Swedes.""  There is that, and then there is the fact that from 1890-1910 every Swede who was unhappy, and/or unsuccessful left Sweden and came to America.  That left all the happy, well-adjusted Swedes in Sweden and added a whole new generation of itchy-footed immigrants to the American pot.  With the exception of Native Americans and enslaved Africans, we are those whose unhappiness or dissatisfaction in their home country led them to self-select  to become Americans.

Texas has 29M people and 666 deaths. Sweden had 10M people and 2355 deaths. Almost four times the death rate is not a success. I'm not sure if another 200,000 or more deaths in the US would be worth opening everything up. It would certainly overwhelm the already stretched emergency services, which would equate to a higher death rate. In the long run it would not help our economy."
2020-04-28 20:33,"I’m always surprised that no one in the US or EU media has given kudos or accolades to Greece. It has the lowest cases for infections and deaths due to an early lockdown and strict measures as well as a compliant honor bound population who values its elderly and vulnerable. This, I can only attribute to a kind of northern EU Protestant/Non Roman Catholic racism who view the southern Mediterranean who are not Protestant nor Roman Catholic, but rather Orthodox Christians, as inferior. Therefore they don’t pay any mind to them, unless of course they are in financial crisis due to their southern Greek “irresponsible” ways that the same northern EU rich Protestants don’t want to bail out. But we all know in reality they were simply sacrificed to keep the Euro afloat. 
I also noticed that the EU Central Bank suddenly has a lot of money to throw at country members in distress because of poor planning for this pandemic."
2020-04-28 21:58,"There is nothing more wrong than claiming that we are doing nothing in Sweden to flatten the curve and minimize deaths. All people I know and see have changed the way of life to follow the health service guidelines of social distance, washing hands, minimizing social contacts, not meeting elderly and so on. 

At the moment we hear a lot like this here:
*Swedens death toll is higher than other Nordic countries.

That is true as of today. But does that really prove that totally shutting down Swedish society would give a better result? ...and does this prove that the Swedish long term strategy is wrong? Science suggests many other factors come in to play here.
Why wouldn’t Sweden have a higher death toll than ANY other country if shutting down was the only answer? 

Also, I don’t really see the big need from some to pick on the Swedish path? No one, neither politicians or the Swedish health authorities, claim that what works for Sweden, works anywhere else.

Swedish path is based health authority’s evidence and science. The more you study about the approach and logic behind it, it becomes clear that it has all the reasons to work. If anyone is interested I would suggest listening to Johan Giesecke, WHO advisor & former Swedish state epidemiologist."
2020-04-29 0:06,"Are we really saying Sweden doesn't care about their elderly, so they are living with a 'life has to go on' philosophy? I believe quite the opposite is true. The elderly lady in the second paragraph said: ""But I trust them to be careful."" She trusts them. If she dies she won't being blaming the young or the government. 

I see the point the article. The statistics are higher than other Scandinavian countries, and some European ones, and Australia, but I don't believe they are willfully giving their old the death sentence. Neither does the older Swedish woman mentioned in the article.

The Swedes are a healthy bunch, and they can face this virus with the cautions they have in place. I move to let them be. 

It is also commendable that they don't have their citizens yelling at health care workers whilst hanging out a car window, and yelling about a state's lockdown to flatten the curve. 

Truth is we do get old and die. Swedes accept that. We have a hard time with this reality, and we have a hard time with grieving. 

No doubt, this virus is taking lives, mostly the elderly and the obese, and those with underlying conditions. It is sad. It is tragic, but I wouldn't blame the Swedes."
2020-04-28 23:14,"I reminded of the movie Midsommar where it was the seniors who were sacrificed. Perhaps this is a nordic tradition to let your elderly citizens die in order for younger members of society to be able to shop in stores and drink in bars.

2020-04-28 22:47,"If the only deaths that are worth preventing are deaths from COVID-19, then just wrap everyone's face in plastic wrap. Sure, everyone will die by asphyxiation, but no we'll have reduced COVID-19 deaths to zero. 

Proponents of lockdowns imagine a false choice between money and deaths.

They don't seem to understand that economic disaster, mass unemployment, disruptions to food supplies, bankrupt municipalities that can't pay for police and other essential services, results in deaths too.

And some point, you have to balance the number of deaths caused by the disease with the number of deaths your lockdowns are going to cause.

The fact that lockdown proponents won't even acknowledge the harm their precious lockdowns are causing shows they are arguing in bad faith."
2020-04-28 23:43,"I know people hate when you compare this to the flu, but we would never consider shutting the economy down for the flu, because we know we simply can't.  Even if this is worse than a typical flu, we cannot simply stop working and earning money, we just can't. If the logic is ""We can't go back to work because some people will die"" we might as well get in food lines now...assuming there will be food."
2020-04-29 0:30,"There's no mystery in why Sweden has been able to escape any extreme negative consequences for not shutting down society. It's because the ""experts"" are wrong, as they often are (remember the CDC backtracking on their face mask stance), and the media didn't have the nerve or critical thinking skills, or backbone for that matter, to feature other experts who's opinions contradicted the status quo (Michael Burry comes to mind as an ignored expert, someone who's both an MD and a financial genius and should have been listened to). 

The fact is, this virus is so contagious that if you walk into a room where someone with it was passing through three hours ago, you can get it. As recent studies have shown, it travels on air pollution particles, so if you're breathing, anywhere, you can get it. Shutting down the economy is pointless. 

The CDC should be sued for destroying the economy. And the media needs a lesson in critical thinking and the duty to represent opinions of a broad range of experts, not just repeating one oppressive ideology over and over like propaganda."
2020-04-28 23:02,"I think that, for reducing deaths, the number  of test per positive Covid case is more important that confinement.   Sweden with 2355 deaths, has a ratio of 6 tests per positive infected case, Norway has a ratio of 20 and only 206 deaths.  Going to the east,  Corea has a ratio of 60 and only 244 deaths and Taiwan has a ratio of 140 and only 6 deaths. I understand the last two countries did not implemented a complete lock-down.
My country has a ratio of about 2.5 and I think that is the reason the pandemia is out of control here. 
This virus is uncovering those societies that are respectful for the life of their people and which are not so."
2020-04-28 23:49,"Here is my takeaway from this article: Covid-19 is highly contagious. It is going to spread no matter what. A country can require its entire population to stay at home, but once people go outside (which is inevitable since you can't deliver food and medicine to people in their homes forever; people eventually will have to go out to obtain nutrition and medical care), the virus will spread.

So the question is, do you lock everyone down and the virus spreads, or do you let people responsibly live their lives in public and the virus spreads? Most of the world has followed the former strategy while Sweden has followed the latter. The results in terms of Covid-19 spread, illness, and deaths is about the same.

So, again, the virus spreads no matter what. It has found a receptive host in human beings, total lock-down or not. As long as the results are the same, what exactly are the benefits of a total lock-down?"

So far only Taiwan seems to have the ""correct"" approach."

In those countries the virus spread massively and uncovered, specially in some of their cities, repeating the same pattern as globally. Probably, the hot spots are a combination of latitude-weather with tourism-travelling bussines initially driven from china (tourists and bussiness man in both directions) and afertwards among the countries mentioned.

C19 Deaths per 100,000
Sweden 22
Denmark 7
Norway   4
Finland    4
Czech Republic   2

The Czech Republic, which has a similar-sized population -- 10.7 million -- to Sweden, has recorded 7,449 cases and 223 deaths -- around two deaths per 100,000 people. It took a markedly different approach to the pandemic by shutting schools, closing restaurants and bars and most stores, restricting travel and ordering mandatory quarantines for travelers from at-risk regions in early March. It has also made it compulsory for people to wear face masks in public.

Sweden has not had as many deaths as Italy or Spain, which have recorded around 45 and 51 deaths per 100,000 people respectively, or even the UK, where there have been about 32 deaths per 100,000 of the population. But there are various complex differences between Sweden and these countries that make direct comparisons harder, such as Italy having an older population, more smokers, and a larger number of close-knit multigenerational households."
2020-04-28 23:15,"The Sweedes have taken a calm big picture approach to pubic health and our politicians panicked, believing health technocrats who have zippo understanding of the direct links between public health and economic health. Its horrible what the press has done to create fear in our populace. CNN's death meter is really just a fearmongering meter which blows this coronavirus out of proportion, but it increases their ratings so they don't care.

Maybe the outbreak is not as bad as Italy or Spain but demographic variable such as density of population and exposure to population flux (including the potential beneficial effects of neighboring countries lock-down) put the Sweden model in a rough position and by all mean not an example to follow. 
As often, the lack of context gives out of context conclusions. When it will be time to evaluate national policies, I am not sure Sweden will fare that well."

The question for Swedes is whether they find the numbers of deaths and the death rate acceptable.  If they largeley do, then fine.  I wouldn't want such a rate of death for my own dysfunctional country.  Seniors' lives matter.

Look what happened to Dan Patrick in Texas when he suggested that sacrificing old people was an acceptable price to pay. Even the brain dead politicians who support him went running for cover. Make no mistake, opening up the economy to more normal activity will have a cost and the cost is mortality in older people. Lets be honest about this.

Look at it this way (as I’m sure many Swedish, and other, politicians do): the old folks cost a country a whole BUNCH to house and feed and coddle.
If they are allowed to quietly expire in their homes and nursing homes, the country will have removed a big drain on its treasury, especially a country with an extensive, and expensive, social safety net. Like Sweden’s.

By the time the next elections roll around, the economy will be booming, especially compared with places that have not only shut down to protect their vulnerable, but still have those vulnerable to deal with.

With a booming economy, a country’s citizens can have very short memories. Thank you, morfar and mormor, for going quietly and not slowing us down. And for leaving us all that expensive housing stock.

The most telling metric appears to me to be the per capita COVID death rate in any given country.
Sweden’s (reported — which is likely much lower than the actual rate) is today higher than that (reported) in the US, and 3 times that of Germany.

Given the number of people in the U.S. who are defying the recommendation to wear a mask and social distance, and given the (still) small number of protesters who think this is the flu and this is just an overreaction, the idea that the U.S. could rely on people to have common sense is ridiculous.  I've been running the errands and until people were told they could not enter the grocery store without a mask (in MD they are mandatory), the number of people who were walking around without protection was simply dumbfounding.

The actual evidence suggests that lockdowns are a crude and relatively ineffective tool for stopping the virus - probably because it's impossible to do a total lockdown where no one leaves home at all. We'd all starve and there'd be no one to care for the sick. The emphasis should be on masks, hand washing, avoiding close proximity with strangers when in public and some measured social distancing like canceling any events that could draw large crowds and limiting capacity in stores and public venues."

The average life expectancy in a nursing home before Covid was 6 months. Over half the deaths are in nursing homes. The demoninator of this virus keeps growing = lower and lower death rate.

More data and research out of institutions like Stanford is showing Covid 19 to be far less lethal than originally thought (not so different from the flu), and a strategy of letting it spread through the population while taking common sense steps to protect the known vulnerable is the only viable solution...unless we want to live through an economic depression that will ultimately cause pain and suffering to be felt for generations.  The objective needs to be to control the rate of spread so our health care system is available to those who need it.  Waiting 18 months for a vaccine, that may not even work, is not an option."

Perhaps the more sparsely populated rural areas can make a case for avoiding this, but not Stockholm or other dense urban centers..

2020-04-29 1:43,"As an ex-pat Swede, I'm of two minds about this. First, Sweden has definitely done worse than its neighbors. Not so much because the total number of deaths, but because how they way they are trending. Denmark and Sweden had almost the same per capita death rate until April 1. Then the Danish number starting going down while Swedish deaths kept rising, and have only recently reached a plateau. So even though Swedish politicians like to argue otherwise, it clear that the Swedish approach has lead to hundreds or even thousands of seemingly avoidable deaths. Having elderly parents in Sweden, I'm quite upset about that.

The rejoinder is that it is clear that the Swedish health care system will not be overwhelmed in the way it was in Italy or New York. The Swedish approach is also sustainable in a way that the strict lockdowns elsewhere just isn't. History is quite clear here--you cannot lock down society for very long. The economic damage quickly becomes too great or else people simply stop following the rules. 

This as much as anything is why lockdowns in Europe and the US are now slowly being put in reverse. So soon, the only defense against a resurgence in most places will be testing and contact tracing on a scale far beyond anything that has been attempted before. Sweden will have the luxury of knowing they can control the outbreak without this that, only using it if proves useful elsewhere. But personally, I rather wish they had taken the same path as Norway or Denmark."

2020-04-29 1:46,"The deaths in North America will likely be more or the same, WITH a depressed economy.  The Swedes are just fast-tracking them...
I'm sure many will look back and realize they had it right all along.
Many lost jobs are gone forever. Retail, which employs many, will take years to recover if it does at all on a much smaller scale.
Deaths of despair should also be included in the death toll."
2020-04-29 1:46,"From Stockholm, now living in NYC. 
Part of the decision to not shut the country down has to do with Swedens dual income parents. It is extremely rare with a parent who doesn't work full time. If K through 6th grade was shut down, as well as the currently closed 7 through 12, that would necessitate a parent staying at home with those kids. That would knock out a substantial portion of the healthcare sector, some say 20%, due to that staff needing to be at home with their kids. Meaning when Covid cases end up needing hospitalization, there would not be enough staff to care for them, never mind all the other non Covid patients.

Saying that, I think the handling of Covid preventions have been lacking, to say the least. Many 80+ citizens live in their own homes, and have state sponsored helpers and carers that look in on them daily. That staff has been poorly prepared, walking in without PPEs, face masks or face shields, since noone had told them they were necessary. One of my mothers 86 year old friends, who hadn't left her house in 2 years, died of Covid19 that a helper brought into her house. The old timers are sitting ducks. My 97 year old friend is sitting at home dreading the next carer visit, since she thinks it's a death sentence.

People in Sweden are definitely not aware that you can be contagious without showing any symptoms.

This is only the beginning. 

Meanwhile, there is no solution to the NYC situation. We're all going to catch Covid eventually, I'm guessing."
2020-04-28 23:51,"Sweden, leading the way. Liberty prevails. 

America should be ashamed. We should’ve protected the vulnerable, quarantined the sick, but everyone goes to work, and kids stay in school.

Contrast that with Italy where multigenerational households are common as young adults cannot afford their own place to live.  Population density is also lower, there is a strong social safety net and overall health metrics are better.  Yet despite this, the mortality rate is still high and is climbing.  So the jury is still out."

It is becoming clear that Coronavirus is killing a number of mostly at-risk and elderly people, and that is ideally avoided or postponed.  But experts do not agree that the virus can be contained/prevented.  That seems to be a common premise.  Accordingly, shutting down NY may have saved very few lives.  The assertion that the shutdown saved many lives is yet to be demonstrated.  We don't know yet.  The answer may be that enormous costs will be born by future generations that did not save any lives.  It was a reasonable precaution, but a devastating one from which many people will never recover.  Sweden is not necessarily wrong in what they did.  They took the hit on a vulnerable population, and did not indulge in the unproven belief that they could control or master the virus absent a vaccine.  The crisis will finish first in NY, Italy, Spain and Sweden.  Of these, Sweden may be shown to have had the best policy."
2020-04-29 1:59,"It's a controversial statement and likely wrong, but maybe there's something immunologically specific to Northern Europeans that makes their experience different from other ethnic groups.

We don't know the immunological specificities of different ethnicities."
2020-04-29 2:09,"If you're comparing Sweden to countries that have suffered catastrophic death rates from CV, then Sweden looks like a success. If you're comparing Sweden to its Nordic neighbors — who closed their borders and thus helped protect Sweden from more cases coming into the country — it looks like an epic failure.

I wonder whether part of Sweden's nonchalance toward coronavirus stems from not having participated in WWII (despite the pleas of their neighbors in Finland) and thus not having suffered through a global calamity for a very long time. 

Finland in contrast, served as Sweden's poor cousin for centuries and has long served as Sweden's shield against Russia; as such, Finland was significantly better prepared than Sweden for this global catastrophe, and the Finnish death toll (even among the elderly) is very small by comparison."
2020-04-29 1:23,I think it is terrible that they didn’t protect their elderly and those in nursing homes.  I thought they were more sensible and caring people.

That's 1,400 people who didn't die in Washington State but did die in Sweden. Sweden didn't have to shut down once its neighbors all did, so it was a bit of a free rider in that regard. The Swedish heath care system is much better than ours, and the Swedish population is more healthy than ours. Given those two factors, the Swedish numbers are worse than they look--in comparison to Washington State which was one of the earlier U.S. hot spots."
2020-04-29 1:15,"As some have said...look into living situations and economics.

It will be disastrous to repeat this in the US as the majority of seniors are hypertensive, diabetic and overweight. We surely have witness the extremely cruel outcome of residents in nursing facilities. This is an atrocious way to conduct public health."
2020-04-29 1:25,"You failed to notice and mention that Sweden is a very homogenous society, socioeconomically and racially too. Everybody is white there. I mean, just look at the pictures on this article. There are very few minorities and immigrants in Sweden. Also, did you know that Sweden has a very restricted asylum policy and they deport so many immigrants every year? Yeah, they make sure deportees board their planes home even escort them on the flight, so they cannot flee. They don't hesitate deporting people back to countries that are still in a war. You really cannot compare Sweden and the US of A. Not only are we are 30 times more populous, we are way more diverse in so many ways. That plus the idolatry of freedom, you get a society that can be uncontrollable and unpredictable sometimes."
2020-04-29 1:40,"“The country was an outlier in Europe, trusting its people to voluntarily follow the protocols.

As commenters have pointed out over and over, Swedens covid death rate is HIGHER than their neighboring Nordic countries.   I trust the editors agrees that death is hurtful to victims and their families."
2020-04-29 2:20,"As a Swede I feel there is a lot of misunderstandings here. First of all; most people (98% percent according to a recent poll) are voluntarily practicing some sort of social distancing in Sweden. There are restrictions in place as well. Second, the government are basing their decisions on recommendations from our public health agency, who are basing their decisions on the scientific data available. The reason they haven't made a 'hard' lockdown is simply because they haven't seen proof of that it would make a big difference (for the Swedish society) in the number of death in the long run. They rather have the people on their side to make them take the responsible needed over the many, many month to come. If they're right, time will tell. No-one is intentionally sacrificing the old over economic gain as I have seen some comments here claim. And the reason Norway has much lower death rates atm has to do with less infected because of lockdown, but it might increase once they open up more again. They also generally have smaller nursery homes which seems to have helped hinder the spread among the elderly. Again, no-one knows. We all do our best."

2020-04-29 1:57,"""Flattening the curve"" is not about stopping the spread. It is about ""slow rolling"" the spread so hospitals can prepare and not overwhelm the health system. So, they are a success. We can't quarantine until there is a cure / vaccine. That is unreasonable. It's amazing how many people don't understand the economy effects public health. Public Health is about more than the virus. Undiagnosed health issues, alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, child abuse, suicide, etc. Are all things that are going to spike. Plus according to the CDC, this year total deaths is 94% of expected /usual numbers for January 1 - April 25. So, deaths are down. But don't let facts and reason get in the way of some good fear mongering. I'm more fearful of the runaway Government control."

Yes, there are many elderly in Japan, but what the headlines never reveal many are bedridden and it's a terrible life. Of course many older people, such as my parents at 85 and 83, are enjoying their lives as well. Therefore they should self-isolate until the risk passes. Let the young get back to school and work."

2020-04-29 2:44,"It sounds harsh to suggest that Swedish authorities simply decided that senior life was expendable. Then again, this is a country that stayed out of World War II as well. That it has managed better than the U.S. would have may be explained by the fact that it has an excellent healthcare system and very little poverty.  The reason American death statistics run so high is that so many people have never had money enough to pay for good medical care, or even education enough to take care of their own health. Therefore we have lots of people with underlying health issues --  hypertension and obesity and diabetes from eating too much cheap junk food, asthma from living in neighborhoods where the air is foul, and so on."
2020-04-29 2:47,"Having been to Sweden, I can attest that Swedes are phenomenally fit and healthy. I am a relatively fit American, but in Stockholm I am in the average quartile! As for health, Swedes do not have all the obesity, diabetes, etc., that come from eating poorly. Swedes eat fish! Lots and lots of glorious fresh fish! 

As well, their health care system is amazing. I needed routine blood work while there and was impressed with the efficiency, cost, and speed. 

Finally, educational attainment is higher than ours. I often say the average European high school student knows more about science than the average American college graduate. So their understanding of the pandemic and how to fight it is likely far more comprehensive and fact-based than what we see in far too many communities here."
2020-04-28 18:44,"Sweden has guidelines that people over 80 or between 70-80 but with one insufficient organ system or between 60-70 but with two insufficient organ system have no right to get a bed in intensive care.
I don't think, many people know about these Karolinska guidelines, and I know, I would not like my mother being treated that way. I was asking myself why Sweden has an 80% survival rate in ICU, and only 3% severe cases in hospital, but is among to ten worst countries according to deaths per million. I asked Swedish friends, and the solution is, that old people or those with severe pre-conditions never see an intensive care bed unless there's plenty of room.
We have had a very close look to Sweden here in Germany, and I feel your article is biased towards the positive consequences (happy young people) but leaves out the darker side of the Swedish way."
2020-04-28 16:59,Sweden has done the only sensible thing.  Allow young healthy people to continue living (since the risk is negligible) while having at risk groups self quarantine.  The US approach of quarantining all makes absolutely no sense when the danger from covid equates to that of many other activities associated with going out in public.
2020-04-28 16:33,"Sweden's approach should have been performed in the United States. Instead of draconian restrictions enforced by government agents with guns, science-based approaches should have been used instead.

Of course, Swedes are probably more generally healthy than Americans, with a universal health care system and fewer complications caused by poverty, so there is a greater chance that the mortality rate in Sweden would be lower than the U.S., even if the more open Swedish plan were tried in the U.S.

However, the long-term economic and resulting psychological impact from a prolonged shutdown may make the direct effects of COVID-19 small by comparison."
2020-04-28 20:19,"As a U.S. citizen who has lived in Stockholm for 20 years and has just last week lost my mother-in-law to corona, I can attest to the fact that the Swedish approach might best be summed up as being unethical but effective. It is unethical in that it has unnecessarily sacrificed the older generation, especially those living in senior homes, through its insistence on a looser approach that relies on voluntary action. It is similarly unethical in that the Swedish carefree lifestyle with job security and cradle-to-crave benefits means that the inconvenience of staying home is perceived as being too much to ask of its citizens by the authorities.

Yet it may end up being effective as a public policy in the long term partly by chance, partly due to low level of preparation and partly due to the nature of the pandemic. Compared to their Nordic neighbors, they were almost unscathed by WWII and with no wartime experience in the last 200 years, they have not had the mindset or training for emergencies and rigorous social enforcement. And although Sweden is a social democracy where all receive fairly good education and health care, it also has a quite competitive and open economy that is vulnerable to the global slowdown and must somehow compensate for it. By adopting voluntary measures that can be maintained for a longer period, perhaps Sweden will fare better than others when a second wave arrives. But those who lost someone in the first wave may see the results somewhat differently."
2020-04-28 18:59,"I wonder if Swedes are overall healthier? With their good government health care system, and social safety nets that remove much of the worry in life...compared to here in America. And so the virus has a milder effect on them as they have better immune systems? That's probably far fetched but it would be interesting to investigate."
2020-04-28 19:15,"A lot of people don't seem to understand this approach when they claim that Sweden's doing relatively bad when compared to X country. The assumption they're taking is that the virus is going to end up reaching the same percentage of people compared to a stricter lock down, and that other countries are just spreading the deaths out over a longer period of time. It's not a particularly bad assumption, given how far away a vaccine seems to be."
2020-04-28 21:20,"For the answer to this 'mystery' look at the Swedes featured in the photos accompanying this article . Having a long history of universal health care, they're far less likely to suffer from diabetes, obesity, and other pre existing conditions that make Americans especially vulnerable to serious consequences from viruses like COVID-19. It's also notable even in Sweden how for profit elder care has been revealed just as it has all over the world as a cynical confidence game - seemingly relieving close relatives of their responsibilities while providing only minimal or no security from harm for their terribly vulnerable inmates."
2020-04-29 2:32,Thank you to the NYT for finally bringing this to our attention.
2020-04-29 2:57,"According to wolrdometer, Sweden’s death rate is 233/m and seems to be accelerating while Washington state, which has similar demographics and weather (and a vestige of Scandinavian culture)  is 108/m and seems to be slowing down. In Washington state, the worst hot spots so far have been nursing homes and hospitals connected to each other by an overlapping network of employees, part time health care assistants who worked at multiple facilities and infected patients. Not canceling the sounders soccer game on March 6 (or thereabouts) might also have contributed to the early and fast spread in the seattle area. So From this perspective the article should have focused on how Sweden failed to protect its people when they had the chance rather than extol their virtues and a success that might not hold up to more rigorous examination."
2020-04-29 2:17,"Sweden is not doing well.  Their death rate per capita is higher than the US and far higher than their immediate neighbors Norway and Finland.  15 times higher!

They are testing half as many people per capita than Norway.  Is this all giving them kind of ""herd immunity""?  We'll find out when they inevitably travel and bring the virus with them, or bring it back from wherever they go to.  But before then, all those people who died in Sweden will still be dead.  

And PS - many Swedes are not sensibly following stay at home guidelines.  I have family in Sweden and they see people playing soccer, going to the gym, getting tattoos.  Summer will make all of this much worse.  Just try to keep a Swede inside on a sunny day!  There will likely be a big spike after the Midsommar holiday."
2020-04-29 1:14,"Basically they're willing to kill off people my age and older, vital, creative people who still make a contribution; indeed who may just be attaining full strength.

No thanks."
2020-04-29 3:01,"I find your tag line, ""The country was an outlier in Europe, trusting its people to voluntarily follow the protocols. Many haven’t, but it does not seem to have hurt them"" to be exceedingly misleading. Also, the choice of Ireland as the case to compare Sweden is a classic case of cherry picking.
Here is how the death rate in Sweden stacks up against its neighbors (all values are deaths/million):
Sweden: 233
Germany: 75
Denmark: 75
Norway: 38
Finland: 36
I would not look at these numbers and say Sweden is doing well at all when compared with other demographics similar to its own.
If the US had the same death rate as Sweden we would have 30% more deaths, so your general tenor making it sound like Sweden is weathering COVID just as well as others is only helping those who want to throw open the doors and ignore this pandemic."
2020-04-29 3:02,Covid mainly affects the unhealthy population (young or old). Sweden likely has a relatively healthier population overall than even other advanced countries - certainly the United States. That may be another reason why they were willing to take the gamble. In any event Sweden has unintentionally set themselves up for case studies when the book is written about this crisis.
2020-04-29 1:48,"No doubt the Swedes will do as their government requests - isolate and such. Americans bristle at the idea - and protest in the street.  No doubt forbidding older people from ICU care in good times and bad saves money and preserves society for the young worker who is economically productive. This is an inhumane societal attribute.   Our massive shutdown and  the unemployment,poverty,  lack of health insurance, and untreated diseases that will follow will certainly cause as much, if not more,morbidity and mortality than the virus. It is time to open up carefully."
2020-04-29 2:34,Half of Swedish homes have only one occupant.  So they have a lot more social distance than most countries have just because of this factor.  Nordics have more social distance than most as part of their culture.
2020-04-29 2:48,"What difference does it make? Sorry, but I don't think Swedes are different than anybody else. Because of the lack of  meaningful transmission limitation measures in place, probably about twice as many of them will die over the next two years as otherwise would, and will die generally unable to breathe. By the end of June, Sweden's Covid-19 mortality rate, now rising by about 50/m per week, could be the highest in the world. The data we have on Covid-19 comes from nations that exerted great efforts to contain its spread and to treat those who fall ill, and these measures are necessary to limit its harm. In Sweden, there is no effective federal public health system because almost all the public health funding is administered by local governments. Its a system that in my is set up to support the desires of local businesses to stay open, not to care for its population."

2020-04-29 1:52,"Concerning the 'Swedish response to COVID-19, here's what Sweden's Deputy Prime Minister Isabella Lövin response was to a question put to her by the media. 
(The question was: What is the biggest misconception you have seen about the Swedish strategy? )
""The biggest myth and misconception is that life goes on as normal in Sweden. It absolutely does not. We have seen Easter travel decrease by 90 percent, we have businesses going bankrupt, a record number of temporary layoffs, and a lot of unemployed people.
That's because people follow those recommendations we issue. The tourism industry has been hit incredibly hard. A lot of small businesses are on their knees because production is down or has decreased a lot. It is not business as usual in Sweden but the opposite, things are very, very tough.
No, we have not had a complete lockdown in Sweden, but if you look at people's behaviour it is a very big difference compared to a normal situation: a lot of people are working from home, a lot of people have called in sick with minor symptoms to limit the spread. You don't see your elderly relatives, you don't travel any more, and that comes as a result of people obeying the recommendations our government agencies have issued.
. . . 
This is, as I said, a marathon, not a sprint. The Swedish government's strategy is to make sure that those measures we take are acceptable enough to people that it is possible to keep them going – we're now talking about many months or maybe even years."""

Once you open things back up again, the virus will begin to spread but if it’s a measured approach you can keep it steady. Essentially, we are prolonging the number of deaths, not necessarily lessening them significantly."

Universal health care, companies willing to let ppl work from home, a generous unemployment system etc already a part of the mainstream means that instead of having to just start programs (and the teething problems that come along with it), it is just a matter of these programs being filled to capacity."

Why? Well, very simple: in a call I had with staff I work with there, they said they took the WHO advisories issued in January very seriously. In January - January! - they canceled meetings we had scheduled for March there. I looked at the email - Jan. 12. They acted quickly on the WHO advisories. Most Americans were not even aware of the advisories - and now blame WHO! There they were, issuing advisories per their mandate. You can't make this stuff up. Meanwhile, our president, genius as he is, was telling everyone there was nothing to worry about. And there wasn't. Until there was. It's interesting people trusted the president so fully - I don't recall him coming from a public health background. I wonder if the US Ambassador to Viet Nam sent any notices to the State Dept. in January and February about what was going on. Maybe he just figured it was business as usual in Viet Nam as everything was shut down.  Given the president has denigrated international institutions since the day he entered the Oval Office, it's no wonder Americans weren't listening to WHO or looking at what other countries were doing. After all, we're the best, you know, the exceptional, the city on the hill. Good grief."

Sweden is the opposite of all that.  They can “afford” to tinker with the notion of natural herd immunity.  My guess is the U.S. would be decimated by using a similar plan."

If you compare the current numbers of deaths in Sweden with those countries that went in full lockdown the at the moment it is bad.

But all those countries are right now being forced to open up their societies again since you can't keep an entire country under lock and key for many months. Yet the virus isn't gone from those countries.  Yes, the number of deaths have gone down and so has the number of hospitalized but the virus is still being transmitted.
So it is very possible that the number of sick and dead will spike again, once the those countries open up. And once you open up, it will be almost impossible to lock things down again so if it spikes things will most likely be worse than before. Much worse than Sweden's current numbers.

Sweden however, don't need to open up. It can pretty much go on like this indefinitely. Yes, its numbers won't improve but they won't get worse either. The curve will flatten into a line.

And that's the gamble Sweden is making. That things will stay the same and be manageable for a long time. They are betting a long game.
Everyone else is gambling that after a short time in isolation the number of sick won't increase again when things go back to normal. A typical short game bet,
We won't know who won their bet until a couple of months at the earliest.  If the virus never resurges after the lockdowns then Sweden did indeed choose badly."

$50 billion for the airlines?  Are you kidding me?

Then, in spite of our national conservative soul (miserly, niggardly, jealous of anyone who asks for help no matter that we create the problem knowing what will ensue) we set about making new and lethal bureaucracies to portion out free food to those with cars and time to wait in line for hours, we promise tiny sums to those who pass our gauntlet of worthiness, stall for weeks getting it out, and refuse to consider sending more until we are assured of more riches for our wealthy friends.

The constant bee-hive of pointless activity clogging city streets was unnecessary and harmful--I much prefer quiet cities with breathable air. 

The pandemic has shown us that providing each child with a laptop and a distance learning teacher has advantages over bussing millions of children millions of miles (in dirty and dangerous school busses) twice a day, and home has some advantages over a facility with 2500 children. 

We have also learned that with very little access to restaurants, theaters, bars and gyms, we can still satisfy our unreasonable demands for constant luxury and entertainment.

We didn't care that the planet was dying--we rushed to the airport and car dealer for our fossil-fuel powered recreation, ate so much meat it was killing us, and whined like a kindergartener if there were fewer than 30 exotic fruits to choose from on the grocery shelf or fewer than 190 channels on the remote.

Does anyone think “the economy” is some kind of separate entity from the people, from the human beings that make “the economy” function? Our untamed capitalistic system has been assassinating itself for quite a long time by concentrating in just a few member of our society the appropriation of the never-matched gigantic additional income generated by the larger-than-ever revolution created by the technological progress of the last few decades. “The economy” can produce faster, at much lower cost, any and every single gadget we want but if the large masses don’t have the disposable income to buy those gadgets that efficient, low cost-low price production will be dumped on the fields like the excess milk is being dumped now. It should be noted that the large masses referred to previously are NOT the 1% billionaires but the Millions and Millions working for a $10.00/hour pay."

2020-04-29 12:44,"I decided to sit on the sidelines after dropping 14% from year end 2019 because I expected the stock market to be rational and to basically track the economy. Silly me for going to all cash, although I'd do it again given the same circumstances, even though I was previously a strictly buy and hold investor through every downturn. 

Some may enjoy the exhilaration of radical daily swings, but I find excitement elsewhere.

My concern for my fellow citizens doesn't seem to be shared by wall street, which collects their 30 pieces of silver on fear, speculation, and irrational exuberance.

These events have made me reevaluate my goals, or more accurately, how I want to achieve them and who I want to associate myself with. I'm retired and mainly concerned with leaving a legacy for my children, which has been secured at this point.

This crisis has, or should, make us all take a more critical look into the mirror to decide what we really want to stand for. Putting the future of my children at further risk is not on my wish list."

Just a very simple example: We have a very, very serious problem with obesity in our country. What is the answer to that by our smart business leaders? The answer has been wider trucks, wider stadium and cinema seats, larger clothing and similar gimmicks. While all those “solutions” produce increase profits for those business they also incubate long-term larger problems for our society but we prefer the easy way out and look the other way. Yes, Sweden didn’t have a full lockdown but among other advantages in relation to the United States, Sweden doesn’t have even a fraction of obese people we have here in the United States and that tell a lot about brainpower."

The behavior of the wealthiest among us is distressing. They so believe their own fiction that they are ""the economy"" that they are the whiny-boys while the rest of us soldier on trying to make the best of a bad situation. 

Pandemics cause social and economic disruption. They always have and always will. Coming out the other side the world will be different. We are learning that a lot of ""essential"" workers are low-paid yet highly dedicated while many of the well-to-do reach out and take the cash meant for small business and complain that they don't like the way things are and expect us to remake the planet to their specifications. 

We are getting a lesson in the necessity of quality medical care that is designed for everyone, not just the wealthy and has to be in every community in America. That government is supposed to respond to the many, not just the few who have an agenda to make the wealthy wealthier. 

There was a pandemic in 1918 and it was followed by The Roaring 20's. We humans will remake society and the economy to benefit everyone not just the wealthy."

The Fed and Treasury dare not let the stock market fall much further as they have back-stopped it as never before, with virtual guarantees of auto loan, student debt, and last, but not least, junk bond holders. But don't think for a second that those obligated to pay the auto and student loans are protected. They are not. The protections go to those who bought the packaged ""bonds"" created from such debt who reap the private rewards when attainable but push the losses on the populace (aka ""socialism"") when the tide has turned. Moral hazard was much discussed in 2008. It is no longer an issue. The Fed and Treasury have socialized losses for the protected class.

One top Cardiologist who was at one time associated with the WH for 8 years, Dr. Reiner @GW said one night on TV.  ""Look we are at the first hole of an 18 Hole Golf Course"". 

Mr. Charles Scwab has a poignant message of ""Persistence"" currently on TV occasionally.  Also on YouTube.-   It highlights historic photos of the Depression since he was born and frankly, it made me weep because he is so completely real compared to our VP Pence and President Trump.  I sometimes forget what normal is any more
. 
Most might not realize Mr. Schwab believed in persistance back in the 1950s as a struggling Freshman at Stanford.    One of our sons has Dyslexia too and is also brilliant.   Many years ago he had an informational interview regarding the Program at Stanford the Schwab family Foundation supports for learning disabilities.  

""As a Stanford freshman, in 1955, he was ""completely buried,"" flunking both French and freshman English before finding refuge in economics. Even now, Schwab, '59, MBA '61, finds reading and writing tedious at best. He once confessed to a reporter that he had attempted to read the novel Shogun six or seven times.""

Instead of spreading fear about a virus like virtually every news outlet in the last couple of weeks (and just hours before with frightening graphics) it is increasingly important to hear also the concerns about the economy and balance things. Already very early in this crisis, one has shouted down voices who raised concerns about severe secondary  consequences of over-reactions with statements like ``we can not trade lives for the economy"". But the economy is linked to lives too, some very indirect, some also direct due to avoiding medical treatments or dysfunctional nursing homes. The doctors, nurses and staff in these places for example can not work as usual (maybe for very simple reasons like having to take care for kids at home who can not go anywhere), unfortunately  leading to casualties which never appear in statistics. About indirect casualties (stress, anxiety, domestic violence, depression, civil rights erosion, etc) one will probably never report. In any way, thanks that such an article appears."

The virus is literally reconfiguring the economy.  What used to be important is not.  What used to be taken for granted is now a high priority.  Spending habits will change dramatically.  The party is over. Once a person has tasted hardship, they start holding on to their money.

Our safety net isn't so safe.  Our security isn't so secure.  Our health isn't so healthy.  

There will be no fast recovery.  Even if a vaccine is rapidly developed, the economic healing will still take years.  Businesses will die.  It will take years to replace them.

2020-04-29 13:27,"How do we make sense of the contradictions between our political and economic policies?

On the political side we've opted for a national Covid-19 lockdown. While caution might have been justified early on, we now see that the models we relied on vastly overinflated the impact of the virus.

This is a serious disease but the actual data (as opposed to speculative models) shows that this virus is about on par with the last major flu epidemic.

That disease killed 60,000 Americans and world wide resulted in 650,000 deaths, but no major economic dislocation. So why the opposite policy now?

Most economists saw a recession coming. They argue over when it will hit and how long it will last. But most agree that our economy had grown multiple bubbles that were going to burst and cause an economic downturn.

But why amplify a predictable downturn into a very deep recession, if not an actual depression?

The conventional answer is medical necessity and the need to save lives. Both noble reasons but Sweden is pursuing their responsibilities with no lock down and substantially less economic disruption.

But their deaths are spiking! Yes, but mostly in nursing homes and by the end of the year their figures will look the same as those in extreme lockdown countries.

In other words, the data tells us that we can and should restart the economy and can do so while still applying public health advisories and maybe additional restrictions for exceptional areas like NYC."

Filling the hole in the economy will not cause inflation, but only stave off deflation, which is far more dangerous.

Global banks have interests that are not aligned with the interests of U.S. citizens. They won't actually invest in new equipment when demand is down. It makes no sense and the know it. They will create and pop market bubbles, so they can extract big profits even thought the economy is shrinking, just as they did after 2008..

We the People know where the money needs to go. When we pay our debts, it will bail out the banks, and when we shop it will bail out retail and manufacturing.
When citizens (who are all consumers) have more money, they clear inventory at stores and factories. Businesses that keep clearing their inventory can prove they need investment and get it.

Every trillion dollars thrown at global corporations by Congress and the Federal Reserve is $3,000 out of the pocket of EVERY citizen (or $12,000 from a family of four.)

The unemployment rate is going to spike in August after companies get the Q2 numbers and start mass employment layoffs. We're on the way down Mr. Mnuchin, not up.

The funny thing about unemployment. If people don't have money to spend, they can't buy things. If people can't buy things, businesses can't sell things. That's before we begin discussing the behavioral shift that accompanies prolonged isolation in the first place. I for one am not inclined to buy anything I don't absolutely need. We're going to be in this recession for awhile.

The question is whether we're going to experience a virus resurgence as economies experiment with removing restrictions. If we see a spike in open states, you can kiss Q3 and Q4 goodbye. If the doctors are right, Q4 is probably toast anyway. A fall/winter resurgence will knock out our year-end along with Q1 and Q2 of next year.

The current manipulation will just make the situation worse once the realization will sink in that until a vaccine,  the collapse of all sectors of retail, the catastrophic unemployment, collapse of energy prices and the second wave of Flu+covid-19 in the fall will converge to bring the market down.  Only when a viable Vaccine will be at hand that things will be back to normal and one can expect Market recovery. But unfortunately, this will not be anytime soon. Short term speculators will wiggle and twist until their backs are against the wall, but then it will be too late to jump out and be saved from the current dead cat bounce and total collapse of the Market.The most sensible thing would be to freeze speculation for a while use Federal money to cure the economy and provide for unemployed instead of stabilizing this insane market  which is illogical and does not make any sense."

Can we get an economic press that thinks the well being of the 90% requires a more complex yardstick than “can find a job”?  Like quality of the job?  Whether the job offers healthcare and parental leave?  Whether working conditions are safe?  Whether the company hurts the planet or not?"

Most people with a minimal brain realize that Trump is a complete failure and nothing Trump says or does should be heeded or appreciated but there are large segments of our population that – unfortunately – still see Trump as God on Earth and they will even inject bleach on themselves just because Trump said it.

2020-04-29 14:11,"I do not understand the stock market, or sophisticated economics for that matter, but does anyone think that the economy will recover soon? I hope that I understand some facts though. There is a paralysis of activities ALL over the world. Whether we like it or not, China has been the workhorse of the global economy in the last couple of decades. They just have the first drop in economic activity in almost 50 years. Europe is still in the middle of the virus with the economy closed. We have 22.5 millions unemployed, and counting, the economy mostly closed, and In many parts of the country we have not peaked yet. The tourism and hospitality industries are non-existent. Travel is almost zero. Sport and entertainment related industries have disappeared. Who expects to go to a stadium or a concert in months? Will go to a restaurant wearing a mask and see very few people there? A movie theater? Plan a vacation any time soon? Our economy depends on consumer spending which has plunged and will not recover in a long time. Maybe the 1% will come relatively soon to their spending ways, but the rest of us? Even assuming that we still have a job. The Chinese and Europeans at least manufacture something not us. Therefore, this is the time to build a stronger, better, more humane, and sustainable economy. What we have now is a house of cards. The wind just blew past. Keep safe!"

Recovery happened, but for the first 7 years of recovery, only the 1% recovered, and hence the Trump win in 2016. 

It trickled down in 2017 and is already gone with the coronavirus impact. What did we do to fix the economy now? 
Jay Powell printed trillions, and so Wall Street benefited, as evident by the disconnect between the market and general economy."

1) the stock market is not the economy, not now and not when Trump was pretending it was;
2) stock prices are more predictions of future earnings, and not reflecting present reality.

Plus my own personal belief is that the federal government will do whatever it takes to protect big business.  I feel more confident that the government will pull out the stops to protect business at the expense of people at every opportunity; eg, today Trump is ordering workers to return to work at meat packing plants, and the Fed is lending money to the largest companies without strings on retaining workers or executive compensation."
2020-04-29 13:33,"While the pandemic certainly isn't the fault of Republicans, it accomplished what reason, logic, and math couldn't do: It revealed the economic, social, and cultural fault lines in the GOP's 40-year Ponzi scheme. Through a combination of nationalism, racism, and economic evangelism they convinced working class Americans to surrender their money to the rich and, like a miracle, it would be returned to them tenfold. Miraculously, it never did. Now the head of their ministry, a shameless huckster who paired an absence of morals and ethics with a knack for stealing cash from a string of failed businesses, has managed to add America to the list in his lifetime of failures. Cornered at the pinnacle of his biggest con with no way out, he'll no doubt double down on his vapid patter of double-talk while leaving Republican leaders busy working on new hustles to keep voters in line until November."
2020-04-29 14:18,Trump’s only chance for re-election is an improving economy and a rising Dow Jones. He will also follow Governor Cuomo’s lead. He will argue that major media and few global leaders recognized the danger of the virus during January and February. Trump will hope that his voters give him a pass on his minimizing of the dangers of the virus at campaign rallies in February. Dow Jones at thirty thousand will drown out a lot of competing noise.
2020-04-29 14:27,"All we hear from Trump is the stock market.   He is obsessed with it.  He believes it is his lifeline to reelection.   The Federal Reserve keeps throwing trillions at it to inflate it.  The stock market is all about the rich and big corporations.  It is not about Main Street.  Corporate America is in dire straits right now along with everyone  on Main Street.  For the first time, we are sort of aligned in our misery.  So, why does Jerome Powell continue on this route for corporate america?  It's not to save the middle class or the poor because we have lost everything and it will be years before we recoup it.  Our children will be a lot older before they can again be prosperous."
2020-04-29 14:48,"At some point the country must ask whether taking away 30 million jobs with even more loses to come is a ""cure"" most of the nation should have been forced to swallow. Big government nannies like governor Cuomo tell us it's an inconvenience we must endure because his mother shouldn't have to die so the rest of us could live our lives.

As far as I know his mom is doing fine but other sons and daughters aren't so lucky. Statistics tell us that half of the Covid-19 deaths in NY (3,500) and NJ (2,973) have occurred in nursing homes and continues to rise. When we learn that governors Cuomo and Murphy have ordered nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to accept coronavirus patients discharged from hospitals, despite sharp criticism from the nursing home industry, staff members and concerned families, as well as some leading public health experts one can only wonder if there is a connection. Nationwide over 11,000, or nearly 20% of Covid-19 deaths have occurred in nursing homes. 

Perhaps we need some new nannies."

2020-04-29 15:40,"President Trump claims he ""built the greatest economy in the history of the world"" Let's put this in perspective, he was handed off a pretty good economy chugging along after a world threatening financial crisis. It was supercharged by gifting the wealth class and corporate coffers with a trillion$ in tax breaks. The wealthier got richer and up to 70% of the corporate tax breaks were reinvested in their own stocks thus artificially inflated stock prices. As a result, this pandemic revealed the true health of our economy, with corporations who once filled their own coffers with tax $ fights for federal handouts, medium sized business and chain store operations successfully pushing themselves out in front of smaller mom and pop operations to get SBA loans. 
There's a saying attributed to Warren Buffet that only when the tide goes out do you see who's swimming naked. If the pandemic can be considered a tide and we have this president at this moment in time and his history of financial bankruptcy, not to mention moral bankruptcy, then I am afraid we are in grave danger. Mr. President, this is not the Taj Mahal Hotel , this the U.S economy, as well as our position in the world is at stake.

I trust the NYT, and yet they don’t mention here that other trials of remdesevir showed insignificant benefit to using this drug to battle COVID-19, regardless of whether initiated early in the disease stage, or later to severely ill patients. It’s like this is saying the news is encouraging while in reality it’s not. Is it just so that the pharmaceutical companies/stock market can have an excuse to rise in value for a few days until they admit the real truth? Something is going wrong all around with people not communicating clearly and using language in mushy ways to never officially take a position and always be sure to massage everybody’s viewpoint so nobody gets upset. We need some serious truth in reporting these days because Doublespeak is officially here. Check out the article, “New data on Gilead’s remdesivir, released by accident, show no benefit for coronavirus patients.

They (Xhase) have shut down their website regarding accepting loans for PPP relief money claiming that they are too busy with the first round of applications. I find that very hard to accept. They should at a minimum be creating a second round of applications in a waiting list. I find it outrageous that Chase Bank will turn small businesses away because they probably haven't hired enough people to process the loans. Unacceptable, and if that's not the reason why, then why not provide the reason on your website instead of stating that you plan to do nothing right now.... AND why not just simply provide a second waiting list w Chase so at least American Small Businesses who have to go through Chase Bank for PPP can stand a fighting chance.

He talked about how it is impossible to properly value equities going out past a year given all the uncertainty, the unknown damages of the virus, and the unquantifiable damage it will take on economy as a whole.

Elon Musk officially joined the ""my money is worth so much more than your life"" team.  Good for him. He seems relieved to be out of the closet.  Free at last you greedy little genius!

Powell the money whiz, so called, confirms beyond all doubt the only economic interest of concern in Washington and the White House is mega-corporations and the rich people who own, run, invest in them.

They have the impression, and are committed to act on the sadly mistaken idea, that saving corporations equals saving the economy and then everybody (left alive) will be happy and vote for Trump.

In fact, so excited are they to share this insight that they are openly swearing to do all the things the swore no-one could ever do when the question was how to help the American people.

They will eliminate applications, evaluations, competitions and facilitate the slide of money from the Fed to the pocketbooks and bank vaults no questions asked, no conditions, no reporting, no nothing just ""Hey there! You're real rich, and real big. Ooooh...here, have some money.""

""Not worry"", reports Powell, ""if we run out we'll print more, and more, and more"".

In some way, having a backlog of pre-sales makes Tesla the envy of the auto industry which cannot even move the vehicles it's already produced.  But the reality is that just like other auto companies, right now Tesla is in a cash bind -- albeit for very different reasons.

One irony for us it that they are in the process of wiring our condo building's garage in LA so electric vehicle owners can charge up at their regular spaces.  We were about to head to the Tesla store when this virus hit.

2020-04-30 3:36,"Elon Musk is an idiot. I used to admire him, his intelligence, his talent, but to call policies meant to save lives “fascist” is absurd and stupid. Fascism is denying people liberties for political gains of one group, not the managing of society for the common good. When is being rich enough?

 and the key take away: 

""It is in internal politics that this word has lost the last vestige of meaning... there is almost no set of people which has not been denounced as Fascist [in print] during the past ten years... 
Conservatives: ... Socialists: ...Communists: ...Trotskyists; ...Catholics: ...War resisters: ...Supporters of the war: ...Nationalists:.
... even people who recklessly fling the word ‘Fascist’ in every direction... mean, roughly speaking, something cruel, unscrupulous, arrogant, obscurantist, anti-liberal and anti-working-class. ...almost any English person would accept ‘bully’ as a synonym for ‘Fascist’. That is about as near to a definition as this much-abused word has come.”"
2020-04-30 7:06,"So, Elon, were China’s lockdown rules and total tracking of citizens also fascist?  It doesn’t take much courage to lob ad hominems in a country with free speech.  If you were a Chinese citizen, you’d have been in jail by dinner time."
2020-04-29 12:54,"Both individuals and organizations face both risks and opportunities because of the Covid lockdown. They are quite similar I think, and at the root, are both is the same: elimination of non essential activities and expenses.

This means that if you build or supply superfluous goods or services you will feel the pain until we inevitably go back to our heedless ways. So the pointless aspects of the travel industry, especially cruises, will suffer. Restaurant dining will have a near death experience, and so forth.

There will be a “U” shaped recovery, but the bottom of that U will be very long and will be the only curve that gets flattened."
2020-04-30 17:33,"Assuring straight A’s and doing away with grades entirely seem like two extremes that both miss the mark. Especially for older students who require less handholding and can work without so much support from their parents. 

As working adults, we are neither being given promotions nor told that performance doesn’t matter; rather, we are expected to keep working but allowed some leeway given the unusual circumstances. Why not do the same for schools? Continue giving out grades, but allow more time for assignments or grade on a curve (especially for low income students)."
2020-04-30 17:34,"Certificates of participation, anyone?

And we do have a federal Department of Education. Some federal guidance for local school districts would be most welcome, so students seeking higher education are not (further) advantaged or disadvantaged by what locality they happen to come from."
2020-04-30 17:39,"(Ed's wife here.) In California, we are taking a no-harm approach. A student can accept the grade they had when school closed, which was at the end of the third quarter for my school. If they want to earn a higher grade, I am offering high-quality assignments to earn more points during the fourth quarter. The students who maintained A's are rewarded for their consistently good work; the students who want a chance to do more, can. As a teacher, I feel good about this approach."
2020-04-30 18:25,"College admissions offices are very aware of the grading policies and curricula requirements of each high school, especially the well-known competitive ones (and yes, they are aware of the grade inflation that goes on, the pay to play awards and made-up volunteer activities, etc). I imagine they will be informed of how each school handled the grading this semester and figure out how to make it ""fair"" - it is in their best interest to accurately assess and find the best candidates anyway. 

Smart HS kids, regardless of what their school decides to as to these grades, will find a way to use the time wisely and set themselves apart. Free from regular obligations, typically over-scheduled kids now have hours available to them for creative endeavors. Whether it's taking online classes, or learning a new instrument, I am positive the really bright, creative kids - the ones who can actually do more than follow a prescribed set of rules/schedules, are doing something really interesting with their time. 

And for kids whose economic or home situation has made this a very difficult, trying time - they should have room to share and express that in their college application essays. This pandemic has given all of us more than enough to ponder and think about. The ability to have lived through this time, and to be able to thoughtfully reflect and write about it would be a much more telling exercise of potential than a set of arbitrary grades."
2020-04-30 18:26,"My college is offering the option to drop classes for a full refund or change grading to pass/fail up to the very end of the semester. 

I think that this was actually a brilliant move. Had I had to choose exactly what to do when the pandemic hit, I probably would have dropped for a full refund or changed my grading option to pass/fail already, but given the choice I decided to wait and see. I have a lot less time for studies as a result of the pandemic (I am self-employed and taking whatever work I can still get with the fear that it may dry up more or less completely eventually), but I'm not doing too badly in them anyway.

The main caveat is that students are encouraged to have a chat with a counsellor if they want to pursue the pass/fail option and want to transfer or apply to grad school, because it may affect their prospects."
2020-04-30 18:28,"As students, pre-college and university, have had to uproot their education and adjust to a whole new education delivery system/conditions, we as educators should adjust the way we evaluate them. For many of my students (university professor here), I know that these transitions have been ranged from extremely paralyzingly traumatic to making the adjustments and keeping up with their studies. I had to change my expectations just as my students have had to change their expectations. Their grades will reflect these changes. My university is allowing them to accept the grades that they earn or convert those grades to Pass/Fail after final grades are issued. Additionally, some students depended on the school's computer facilities and digital services for getting their online work done. When these digitally-challenged students were forced into their homes, their work suffered because of a lack of computer and reliable internet access. All student did not have anything close to a level playing field which was glaringly exposed when campuses shuttered."
2020-04-30 18:40,"Pass/fail is the only reasonable option. That’s what our high school (high achieving urban public) has done. My kids are both juniors, and I am unconcerned.

Selective colleges know full well that this odd period is not as all normal. They can extrapolate from past semesters how well a student is doing.

Private schools are no guide. Those kids have an admissions advantage for two reasons only: ability to pay high tuition and legacy preference.    That won’t change.  In other respects they have no advantages whatsoever."
2020-04-30 18:40,"The real question at this time is should teachers who are doing little to nothing in remote learning continue to be paid? Some of my son's teachers are holding online classes (albeit not with the regularity of when school is fully in session), as well as doing assignments.
Others, however, are either doing nothing or the bare minimum with assignments like ""Watch a documentary or read an article and then write about it."" With no online classroom time or response to communications from the student. There is also no feedback to the student when they do turn in the work.
I understand this is a new world to all of us, but the response to these challenges by some, even after six weeks, is very disappointing."
2020-04-30 17:37,"I teach at two schools, college level. One went to pass/fail. Attendance? Students are continuing to participate at the same level as before remote learning.

At the other school, where an A's for everyone policy took hold, only a handful of students are showing up. I am forced to give A's to people who deliberately failed. 

These students are not from disadvantaged circumstances. They are all in good health. Many returned to faraway countries to attend a remote class at 10 pm. 

The all A's edict is idiot compassion at its finest. Inputting grades this term -- always a fraught exercise -- will be particularly painful this term. Persistence is one of the qualities that leads to success. What is the lesson here? It's not necessary to persist. Here's your free stuff. When I asked why the school thought this was a good idea, the answer was ""social justice.""

Yet this is deeply, deeply unfair to those who persisted -- when I think of all the long hours I put into teaching -- all the exhaustion I push myself through to get the job done -- yet it's ""just"" to reward people for crapping out....

Which I would never even think of doing myself."

2020-04-30 18:46,"I would underscore that fact that, in NYC, students who have their sights set our top high schools are, for the most part, students who face great hardships.  

This is not about the rich kids protecting their B+s or getting into selective colleges, it's about kids beating the odds, often in a language that is not spoken at home, through muscle and late nights getting a ""yes"" from Brooklyn Tech or Sophie Davis, or getting that full ride to a regional college."

Why should middle-/working-/lower-class students struggling with this epidemic, facing no jobs, getting no financial relief from the gov't even as they need to make rent ... why should these students be graded by a ""fairer"" system rather than the legacies? I'm sure its the same dynamic at Trinity, Dalton, Riverdale vs. the public schools -- and that's just one city -- imagine rural Alabama?"
2020-04-30 19:58,"Speaking as a lifelong college faculty member...

No, everyone should not get straight A grades. 

The A represents a particular level of performance that is well above the average. It says the student did far more than ""pass"" the class. She/he excelled.

Assigning an A grade to every student who would pass (I hope no one is suggesting A grades for those who would fall below THAT threshold!) would make those A grades virtually meaningless. Such A grades would be taken to mean ""this student earned a C or higher"" in the class. If I were a student who worked hard to earn a real A I would be incensed.

A better option would be to continue to assign letter grades, but allow students to specify whether they prefer to have their grade recorded as a ""pass/no pass"" indication or as the earned letter grade. They could make this choice at the start of the term. (Perhaps this could be combined with a temporary relaxation of standards for the ""incomplete"" grade.)

We have done this at my college for a long time. It is not a perfect solution — there are none when it comes to student assessment — but it is far better than awarding a meaningless A."
2020-04-30 20:05,"Many in Seattle were dismayed by the ""As for All"" policy here.  Nor is it clear that there is a shared understanding of how it will be applied.  Statements from the school board indicated it should be the default grade, but some teachers have indicated they are perfectly willing to award ""Incomplete"" to a student who has done little work.  There may be a lot of surprises when students receive their report cards."
2020-04-30 20:08,"Thought Experiment: ""Because of the pandemic, we should grant drivers' licenses regardless of whether students did the work."" Or how about pilots' licenses? Or medical licenses?

2020-04-30 20:25,"In New York City, grades (and state tests) have long been important for many 4th and 7th graders in determining where they go to middle school and high school, respectively. Screened schools in the city evaluate both final grades and test scores for their admissions, and they won't have those metrics next year when making offers. Mayor Bill de Blasio and School Chancellor Richard Carranza have long made a point that the city's schools are segregated. With a collapse of the screening system, perhaps all schools will simply have to admit students through a lottery—which may lead to greater integration."
2020-04-30 19:05,"Leave it up to students, or the under-18s parents or students whether to choose pass/fail or grading. Giving all As arbitrarily diminishes the value of learning at all, whether you agree or not with grading as a measure. That’s the education game you’re playing!

2020-04-30 19:28,"It's disappointing that neither the author or SMUHSD board member Marc Friedman appears to understand that students with emerging skills and habits are the ones that will be more harmed by the change in modality to an online portal. It's the students who come in at lunch to re-take a test after getting invited by a teacher, or who are developing more fluency and confidence with academic and context-specific language through collaborative conversations with classmates, or are members of a group project that forces them to transfer skills from one domain/subject area to another, something that other students might do more automatically. The gifted and talented students with a history of good schooling don't really need great pedagogy and will still be able to learn a high percentage of the material online without the coaching and without the immersive environment of a school setting. So, with all due respect, the idea that one semester of Credit/No Credit grading is going to disadvantage students from disadvantaged backgrounds is borderline ridiculous. 

The admissions departments of many colleges and universities have made it clear that this semester is not going to count against people. In a competition with limited slots, that means it can't count for people, either. 

It's interesting how the people who were already winning the game have been the ones most eager to continue keeping score, even when the nature of the game shifts to provide them with even more advantage."
2020-04-30 20:01,I'd be all for pass/fail if that was actually a thing. At almost every school i have ever been a part of pass/fail really means pass/complain to administration and still pass.

With the overwhelming majority of high school students at home now everyone will be in the same boat. I can't see how receiving a P for your Spring 2020 grade can possibly have any negative impact on a student's college admission since every other applicant will have the same grades. For cities like Seattle to suggest that it will somehow put their students at a disadvantage show's a massive failure on their part to see beyond what's happening in their city. Or they're just trying to artificially pump up the numbers in their district. Either scenario reflects badly on the district."

 I believe my son was offered to take the grades he'd earned up to that point if he could not continue, or he could return and attend classes and do his best to improve the grades.

Perhaps something along these lines could be used- the grades up to the middle of March count- and if students complete other work set up by the teachers, those grades can be enhanced.

Just a thought."
2020-04-30 22:27,"Sorry, the decision is not strictly up to teachers and teachers unions as the counselors, principals and superintendents that get a final say in our litigious state.   Yes, parents have been known to hire an attorney over a grade.

For now, grades are based on initiative and participation. not on mastering the subject.  It is a rather politicalize decision and subject to change after the dust settles.  

Some universities are allowing students to change to past/fail or drop the course up until the last day of class."
2020-04-30 22:34,"Oregon is doing Pass/Incomplete. The bar for a Pass is 60%.  

In my class, since I am not entering zeroes for missing assignments, it's whether my kids are turning in one assignment per week (out of three that I post, and down from probably 10 in real school). I've been upfront with families about this trimester being practice not performance, and progress not perfection. Still (some) parents say that it's MY class that is damaging their children. 

Kids e-mail me at 2 a.m. to say that they are really struggling with everything:  

""I don't know why, but I'm sleeping all the time.""
""I don't know why, but I'm really distracted.""
""I thought I'd have more time by just staying at home, but somehow I don't have any time at all.""
""I am really struggling with my mental health right now.""
""I am sorry this work is late, I've been really overwhelmed.""
""I miss school.""
""When is this going to end?""

This is a cross section of all my students: the ones with IEPs, 504s, ELD kids, general education students, TAG students.  

Because I work in a small school I have taught many of them prior to this year.  Some of my top students, the most hard working, persistent, independent, initiative-taking kids with a proud row of 10/10 on every single assignment before school was canceled, have turned NOTHING in and seem the most completely confused by their own behavior and inability to work outside of school.

Zillions are being spent, citizens over taxed by the biggest Ponzi scheme in our country. Just look at the cost of being a third rate educational machine that chokes taxpayers with no end in sight. And, illiterate graduates!

One can only hope that the upheaval in traditional services including education in this covid19 experience will bring more of these age old shams to an end.

Time to reaxamine, reassess. Americans are suffering, costs have to be adjusted to the new realities of life. Sacred cows can no longer be allowed to go on unchecked!"

I would feel bad for the author if she was forced to include the views of these politically connected pro-testing, pro-charter social engineers by higher ups. EdTrust dreads not having centralized, verticalized accountability metrics to compare kids against eachother like numbers on a spreadsheet. 

The article is otherwise good because it includes many examples from different sides of a debate to which there is no good answer. Sure it’s unfair that kids whose lives revolve around competition to get into top schools are denied letter grades, but thousands are dying every day. We might take a step back here to revisit policies that ignore the many other factors besides grades. For example, are the online versions of classes even remotely comparable? Can kids easily cheat on classwork or assessments? Are kids with no WiFi or sick relatives expected to keep pace?

If I was a top college, I’d rather enroll the hardworking kid who takes care of her sisters before going into the car to work than the kids of parents so concerned with GPA they send fake letters to reporters. 

Doesn’t a life or death crisis require we back up a bit and get philosophical? If these go-getters want to distinguish themselves so bad, jump into a passion project and create something useful for humanity."
2020-04-30 22:28,"I am the parent of a sophomore enrolled in the local high school. It is a mix of kids from middle to lower class socioeconomic backgrounds. My daughter is a hard-working, conscientious student who keeps up with all remote learning assignments and tries her best. She tells me the same cannot be said of most students at this public school. The kids who had poor attendance and bad grades before remote learning was adopted have continued the same or worse behavior after the school shutdown. Sometimes only 3 or 4 kids out of a class of 35 will bother to attend a Zoom. The numbers have consistently gone down as the weeks pass so it is not a simple explanation of not having computers or internet access. Indeed, this school distributes Chromebooks to every kid and the town provides free WiFi hotspots. Unmotivated students now have an excuse with Covid/Corona. Giving them all As is ridiculous. Pass/fail without the option of a letter grade simply punishes good students. Why do the worst students get preferential treatment when we should be rewarding good study habits and hard work, rather than discouraging an entire generation of future academic achievers."
2020-04-30 22:55,"As a parent of a high school sophomore in the San Mateo School District, I can tell you that all the kids I know are devastated by the pass/ fail. The students are ironically still being graded on individual assignments so there is still the stress of grades, yet they are unable to earn anything except a pass. 

Additionally, the quality of education has gone down from a  public school A to what I would say is a C-. Teachers are not required to Zoom with their students, and there is no daily schedule whatsoever. My sophomore, an A student, does 2-3 hours of class work daily and says that with zero work he could still pass all his classes. The grading policy change exacerabates this situation. This change tells the kids: ""The world has fallen apart, your education no longer matters, and you must be so stressed that we no longer think of you as competent learners.""

In contrast, the private schools in the area hold regular class schedules with on Zoom, and across the board my friends who are parents say the educational standards are the same.

Also the article fails to emphasize that the Board decision was made because of the teacher union pressure, and not for the kids. Apparently teachers should not have to work from home during the pandemic like everyone else does, regardless of familial responsibilities, but still get paid."

When I call parents some say the don't understand the computer so they can't help. I call this learned helplessness. On the bright side I have a few students doing better since they don't have the social distractions at school and about 1/3 doing most all of the work.

Public schools are not the ones who need to adapt to colleges; it is the other way around. As it is, the college admissions process is negatively impacting real learning for students across the country."

In the humanities it wouldn't matter. Who cares if someone going into to college to study 17th Century French Lit got an A instead of a D?

2020-04-30 23:59,"Since it is unlikely the schools will reopen this school year, the students shoofly get the grades they had when the school closed.    If they are working at home, those grades should be also counted.  No student should get penalized because the schools were closed."

So I can’t even imagine the horror it would be to have been trapped in a tight space with my family during a pandemic. I think we as a society should have a little compassion for the poor people who are struggling mightily in this time.￼ That should include grading policies that are very reasonable and doable for children. They shouldn’t have to feel like they’re not good enough when we’re having a global pandemic.￼"

I was focused on other things....later I did all the premed elsewhere and went to med school. The one time ""gift"" of a pass stuck to me and made me realize just how precarious what you do in your youth can  derail your future.  So my hypothesis is that if this is a one time event , this could be the cold water in a slackers face that will leave a permanent positive mark.  It's a counterintuitive reality."

So, that became the day my teens no longer did an ounce of the online school work their teachers were scrambling to provide. I understand the reasons the school made this difficult decision. It really is the fairest thing to do considering all student situations at home and this unprecedented time. But did they really think teenagers were going to put in the effort after being told they were automatically getting 100%? And anyone on here thinking I could have forced them to do it has never been the parent of teens."
2020-05-01 6:18,"I teach at a college that adopted the A/A- policy with the effect that the students who didn't do any work and missed several classes at the beginning of the semester have done now exactly zero work, don't show up to virtual classes  ... no,  they are not sick, nor facing financial hardships  ... rather they have daily work out sessions with their personal trainers in their mansions that they document on social media. which shows once again that they privileged get even more now."

2020-05-01 12:25,"Ms. Goldstein writes that San Mateo Board member Robert H. Griffin stated that the the school districts mission was to provide students with the ""best education and not necessarily the highest GPA"".  In doing so, he and his board members dodged the over-arching questions associated with assigning grades, which are ""What IS the 'best education"" and ""how do we measure it?"" 

It strikes me that online learning will be with us for the foreseeable future and employers already seek workers who can train themselves. In the world we live in the best education is one that develops independent self-motivated life-long learners. The attainment of that outcome cannot be measured with our traditional grading system, a system that is designed to sort and select students and based on external rewards and punishments. 

A well conceived pass/fail system could promote the kind of learners we need now and will need even more in the future. By linking passing grades to mastery of the information and skills the school is imparting to students the importance of the GPA will disappear. We use mastery measures for drivers licenses, entry into the legal and medical professions, and into trades and services that require licensure. All of those examinations are pass/fail and some of them are performance based. No one asks about their doctor's, lawyer's, electrician's, or hairdresser's GPA as a high school student or for the score on their licensure program. Why is it important for students?"
2020-05-01 12:55,"My (high-school age)kids are lucky enough to attend a school that does not inflate their grades, nor participate in the AP scam. They announced early on that the spring trimester was pass/fail, and that was that. They're doing six 90 minute classes a week (including art and Spanish), and they have lots of homework. This doesn't need to be a complicated thing. COVID-19 = all bets are off. Any learning is better than no learning, and some kids don't have the access to the tools for learning that others do. No kid should be penalized for that. No school system should be ""grading"" children at this point."
2020-05-01 12:51,"Imagine if education removed the Pavlovian processes that students have become accustomed to and, instead, the joy and satisfaction of learning--mastery of content and skills--were the targets. Instead, grading has created generations of dehumanized people seeking ""stickers"" forever, when we all know that there is no value in it.  Get rid of grading. Period."
2020-05-01 13:50,"What if every student started with a zero and points were added when they achieved educational objectives? Clearly, some students are dealing with horrific circumstances up to and including the loss of parents and siblings. There should be a way to opt into pass/fail systems, make up work during the summer, repeat classes if necessary, and add a comment to explain that a student's deviation from past academic achievement is likely a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. I think the closure of schools and attempts to start on-line instruction have highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of in-person and on-line instruction. Going forward, educators should consider utilizing both classroom and on-line instruction to achieve the best educational outcomes."
2020-05-01 14:10,"The educational infrastructure is a system.
Students, parents are concerned about how they will be evaluated by the universities to which they apply.

(My guess is that those without university aspirations are less concerned).

If credit/no credit was identified by the dates of the pandemic, wouldn’t the universities recognize that this particular grade period is a variable to note but not evaluate? In fact, an essay by the student that reflected on the challenge (having to deliver pizza as parents had lost their jobs) and learning from a crisis would be more valuable for admission purposes than a simple letter grade that has no depth.

Aren’t we all talking about resilience during this crisis? 

Resilience is defined as an organism’s ability to respond to variables in its environment. 

Adaptability requires more than a forced choice: letter grades or no letter grades."
2020-05-01 14:24,"I have a different perspective. As a pediatrician in a semirural area whose office remains open, I ask all the school age kids I see how the school process is working for them. There is an extreme scatter of replies from patients and parents. It does not correlate with ability or socioeconomic status. Grades do not seem to be the concern as much as getting some education out of this chaotic time. There is more to education than the almighty GPA."
2020-05-01 14:43,"Our son has a program at his college whereby a student can select the earned grade or a Pass/No Credit grade. The decision is made at the end of the semester when the student can see what they have otherwise earned. A grade of NC is equivalent to an F in terms of having to retake the course, but neither a P nor an NC grade is included in the student GPA. A P grade does count for earned credits and does count for later course prerequisites."
2020-04-30 21:39,"Do these parents think that college admissions officers live on Mars? They know exactly what is going on right now.  They also know your school system and/or your school.  If you have a high achieving kid, they aren't going to hold a pass fail grade given during a pandemic against them.  Your kid will still have a 80 to 95 percent of NOT getting into Stanford. And, I say this as the parent of a high achieving pep school student. I do, however, hope that admissions officers take notice of Rosa who cares for her younger sibling, shares her computer with her brother and studies in the darn car. Rosa, you make sure you tell your story in your college applications -and I hope you achieve all your dreams."
2020-05-01 14:48,"Unfortunately credit/no credit is only fair for everyone if it is federally mandated and every school goes that route. But a student at a school that is credit/no credit is at a disadvantage when competing against not only students whose school goes with grades or universal a (grade as of school closure gets averaged with an A) but even when competing against their own classmates. Fir example:
Student A had a C in math first semester. They worked hard and as of March 16 had a B+. Their transcript will show C/Credit.
Student B had a B in math first semester and a B as of March 16. Their transcript will show B/Credit. Student B is at an advantage while Student A's hard work is lost. Now think about when Student A is competing against a kid from a school with grades whose improvement is recorded AND their grade is part of their GPA. Now imagine the impact on GPA if the class was AP Statistics and they benefit from the grade bump. While admissions diretors are anecdotally telling principals this semester won't count, it will. When they need to weed out applications, GPA is one if the first ways to do so."
2020-04-30 20:13,"Confession time:  In the Spring, 1970 quarter at UCLA, when police battled students on campus and Kent State shocked a nation, we were ""sent home"" and the campus was closed.

The response by many faculty is still there to be found on my undergraduate transcript -- four, beautiful, pristine,  grades of ""A,"" two of which were in courses where my performance would definitely have called for a minus.

I still have dreams that someday  the truth will be revealed and that somehow a 40 year career as a university professor and senior administrator, will be revoked.

Oh, if I had only taken organic chemistry that semester!"
2020-05-01 14:45,"Both of my college aged children are suffering through distance learning.  My oldest had taken an online class in high school so she already was acquainted with the pitfalls so her expectations were low.  What has worked best for her learning has been the office hours.  My son hasn't even bothered and just done the reading to learn the material.  
Both schools have offered the pass/fail choice for all classes.  My daughter isn't partaking but my son is making two of his gen ed classes pass/fail.  There should not be ""A's for all"" but it is clear that not all educators are capable of teaching online and the students shouldn't suffer for this.  Not all students are capable of taking in information when presented online through no fault of their own.  Then, of course, there are the kids who totally take advantage and cheat --an article in the NYT yesterday discussed this problem at BU but it probably is happening everywhere.  Those students who do this won't have mastered the curriculum so it is to their own disadvantage.  That said, other students may not have learned sufficiently to weather a letter grade.  It is all such a mess.
But pass/fail is the only solution.  It isn't like when someone looks at these transcripts in the future they won't have any idea what the heck happened."

2020-04-30 20:55,"Kudos to Barrington Stage Company for making such an extraordinary and creative effort to  make theater viable in the age of coronavirus and its aftermath.

Unfortunately, one of the primary ways to prevent the spread of coronavirus is avoiding congregations of people:  in dormitories, restaurants, classrooms, lecture halls, movie houses and, of course, theaters.

Yes, there is still an ongoing debate on how/whether coronavirus is or can be aerosolized and transmitted by air conditioning and heating systems.

However, it seems like looking for trouble to suggest that 163 people ought to sit in an enclosed theater, breathing the same air for 80 minutes (for Harry Clarke), while undoubtedly some carriers of coronavirus (as yet unknown to themselves and others) are in the theater breathing, coughing, sneezing, etc. into the same volume of air.

Further, monitoring body of temperature of staff ignores the fact many of them may be asymptomatic carriers of the disease—i.e., won’t register on the thermometers.

And, of course, failing to monitor patrons means that even some coronavirus carriers who have elevated temperatures won’t be detected.

My wife and I are in our 70s, and thus more likely to experience severe illness or even death if we contract coronavirus. Sorry to say, we will not be going to theaters or cinemas or other enclosed spaces with large gatherings, even if there is creative spacing of seats, until the coronavirus disappears or a vaccine is available."

A vaccine won't cure the underlying problems that C-19 has laid bare: sweeping disparities in healthcare access, working conditions, job stability...the list goes on. A vaccine could mean that we return to business as usual, with resident Trump burnishing more phony successes as he enters his second term.

Just like Trump with the Constitution, C-19 has exposed our National weaknesses; they are far greater than a virus, and they can't be cured by an injection. 

Will we learn from this? I'm not confident about the answer."

I'm glad that moneymen are flocking to their door. That is the way it ought to be ordinarily, instead of all the money flowing into apps that add bunny ears to photos.

2020-04-27 20:41,"This vaccine requires two doses, 4 weeks apart. So if it proves effective and safe, then inoculation of the whole American population or some large part of it (to create ""herd immunity"") would require 600-700 million doses. 

The problem always comes in manufacturing, aside from the problems of licensing. One doesn't want to believe that American authorities would be so callous as to prevent the importation of an effective vaccine or not to order American manufacturers to produce it. But this administration has a tendency to value corporate welfare over the general welfare of citizens."

I don’t think they will though. They are superb at efficiency, obedience, and intellectual property theft - not innovation. Fortunately, that is the one thing western democracies will always have an edge with."
2020-04-27 21:13,"May the force be with them!  May luck and timing align to let Oxford win the race and not allow any manufacturer exclusive rights to the vaccine. I am glad they called that out in the article.  If this or any other vaccine is given freely to manufacturers, they should be allowed to charge enough to cover their costs and a small profit for their efforts, and then whomever can get the manufacturing and distribution in place fastest gets to make some $ but not profiteer.  I am a business person, and I support entrepreneurship and free enterprise, but this is not the time and place for big profit margins."
2020-04-27 20:22,If this turns out to be a success and the North American pharma companies refuse to produce because they do not get the world-wide rights they want then I think every CEO should be arrested and charged with at least involuntary manslaughter if not accessory to murder in the first degree.

It's a sure thing, not even a bet, that we in the US will pay the highest global prices for any vaccine, probably later than other countries.  All on a par with how our government has failed at handling this epidemic.

Step 1 – The US buys Oxford University.  We pay any price they demand (stay with me on this.)  

Step 2 – Acquire all rights to the vaccine.  We’re in the driver’s seat now and we make everyone else pay through the nose.  

Step 3 – We don’t need Oxford any more at this point so we default on all the loans we took to buy Oxford and let the banks take the hit.

The villains are North American pharmaceutical companies, which typically demand exclusive worldwide rights before investing. If there ever was a case of capitalism run amok, this is it. And, if the United States had a real president, this outrage would never happen here."

2020-04-27 21:49,"There’s a massive problem with our current method of experimenting with medicine.

Our current method is to experiment on people — to see who lives and who dies and who develops frightful unexpected complications — after experimenting on enormous batches of other species.

This mostly allows our pharmaceutical firms to maximize profits by swapping out more conclusive longitudinal testing — i.e. more time-consuming testing — with instead high-volume short-term testing. This enables us to rush products to market, but also partly allows the squeamish to pretend we don’t, at the end of the day, experiment on people. Which we do.

We tell ourselves we’re experimenting on cats, dogs, macaques, and pretend we aren’t experimenting on humans — which, to be clear again, we most definitely are.

Unfortunately, other species are terrible analogues to Homo sapiens. Of those products which we advance beyond experiments on other species and onto experiments on humans, 80% are then rejected by our bodies, e.g. are deemed ineffective, toxic, fatal.

Conversely, our experimenting on other species results in our tossing out myriad potentially life-saving treatments — well into the hundreds of thousands — because these treatments are toxic only to the other species we subject to them!

We need to study 100% human volunteers. But the lab animal industry is cheap to run and hugely profitable, so lobbyists work hard to label the current wasteful method sacrosanct. Too bad for humanity, though."

2020-04-27 21:54,"I was as happy as anyone to read this promising news. But my layperson's understanding of the vaccine development process is that there are many promising but false starts, not least involving whether what works in another species ends up working for humans. In addition, there are all sorts of additional hurdles regarding efficacy, toxicity, side effects, ramping up production, etc. Finally, it seems that scientists are only starting to climb the learning curve in understanding this new disease and its very multi-faceted effects. So while we welcome any good news we can get, I'm afraid that we remain far more than several months away from the vaccine we all desire."
2020-04-27 21:55,"Here is a question for an epidemiologist.  

If having and surviving the virus conveys only a short term immunity, or none at all, which seems to be the case, how can you make a vaccine that provides long term immunity?  Thank you in advance."

First of all, the rhesus monkeys which became sick and infected, have they been given proper treatment so they do not die from the stuff we deliberately gave them? Very important, at least in my mind. Perhaps we should have tested this in real human guinea pigs with an assurance that if they died their hiers would end up with a few million dollars - because we humans do put a price on the life of others who we consider less than us.
Secondly, I was reading an article about Prof Ian Frazier, the guy who co-invented the HPV vaccine, that a vaccine for this corona virus is like creating a vaccine for the cold virus and was very tricky. ""It is tricky because the virus lands on the outside of you."" Long article, but how does this vaccine work? Are people sniffing it and it coats the inside lining of the lungs and upper respiratory tract? 

If these guys do get a vaccine, then perhaps the next step is to create one for the common cold and let's put some drug manufacturers out of business for all the cold medicines they have been selling for decades that actually do nothing. At least for me, and my family, when someone gets a cold, we take a table spoon of brandy mixed with 100 ml of lukewarm water plus honey and a bit of lime juice. It fixes the cold and cough problem in a couple of days."

2020-04-27 22:38,The British government must do all it ethically can to produce a population big enough to keep the Oxford researchers from delaying trials by having to look to other countries.  Do I hope it will.
2020-04-27 22:45,"As far as I understand, the Jenner team have developed a prototype vaccine which is now in early human clinical trials. So, next steps are to expand the trials - as many subjects as possible, worldwide -  tweak, pause and adjust and if the trial is a success, then start making the stuff in vast quantities - again worldwide - using the capacity of every competent vaccine manufacturer on the planet.

Pharma companies (except for certain limited in-house trials) do NOT 'test' the medicines they develop. Nope, they contract that work out to third party companies and sometimes directly to doctors and clinics.

So, I'm mystified as to why any American pharma company - which hasn't developed the Jenner vaccine and most certainly isn't able to supply the whole world with it when ready, should assume some claim to an exclusive global license. What are they bringing to this particular party that could in any way justify such a claim? I mean, who loses out if these American pharma companies can't get their way?

Plenty enough money and plenty enough vaccine making capacity to put the  product on the shelves outside of the USA."
2020-04-27 22:41,"Not to worry, Professor Hill. With the buffoonery of politicians and their gun toting me-first supporters who pretend to know more than the epidemiologists, there will be repeated resurgences of Covid-19 here in the USA with outbreaks that create very good spots to test a vaccine. You can bet those in angry denial or who proclaim it all a hoax will be ready to push themselves to the front of the line and receive the jab. That's the MAGA mentality and it is very much in force in the USA. Just be sure to brand it with big US flags, NASCAR stickers, NRA logos, hand out MAGA hats and promote the vaccination as manly, patriotic and that is shows your vehement opposition to science and big government. They'll be dancing in line like excited children waiting for Santa."
2020-04-27 22:47,"This article sounds a bit  like  a satirical Infomercial: 
“ The Jenner Institute’s coronavirus efforts grew out of Professor Hill’s so-far unsuccessful pursuit of a vaccine against a different scourge, malaria.”
“Over the last 20 years, the institute has conducted more than 70 clinical trials of potential vaccines against the parasite that causes malaria. None have yet yielded a successful inoculation.” 
 Then :
“In 2014, however, a vaccine based on the chimp virus that Professor Hill had tested was manufactured in a large enough scale to provide a million doses. That created a template for mass production of the coronavirus vaccine, should it prove effective.” 

So no one in 2020 knows if the vaccine developed in 2014 was effective against the “chimp virus,”  but somehow the fact that many doses were produced  is an indicator that it will be effective against  coronavirus ... because it is a “template?”
And the pièce de résistance:
“ If too few participants are infected in Britain, the institute is planning other trials where the coronavirus may still be spreading, possibly in Africa or India.”  
  Ok, see you in September then, sounds good, and thank God for those US regulatory barriers still in place ..."

Once the SARS epidemic petered out in 2003, various pharma and biotech companies shelved their research efforts. No money in it. Governments can play a pivotal role to prioritize and fund this type of research.

Microbiology scientists and the development of vaccines eliminated the scourge of Smallpox, saved thousands upon thousands of innocent lives from Tetanus (seizures and death), protected millions from Polio (muscle paralysis, iron lungs and respiratory death), and prevented millions of cases of Measles (seizures, deafness, meningitis, encephalitis, mental retardation and death) and Rubella (seizures, deafness, encephalitis, mental retardation).

Then there are the problems of producing the vaccine at scale."
2020-04-27 23:53,"I thought the Phase 3 of drug trials typically lasts years. If this is accelerated to just a few months, does that pose risks? We should be concerned that a rushed vaccine that leads to negative outcomes would make even more people distrustful of vaccinations."
2020-04-27 23:44,"It is NOT acceptable to use animals for ANY medical or scientific experiments.

As a practicing primary care dr, I have seen that multiple backorders and patients waiting for the Shingrix shingles vaccine that came out 2 years ago. Patients were frustrated with how long they needed to wait for it. And that was a vaccine for a condition that is not life threatening and which was indicated only for people 60 and over (changed to 50 and over later). Business as usual at Big Pharma will not be enough with this pandemic. The federal government needs to take the lead in ensuring this doesn’t happen. I wish I could say I have confidence that they will do so. Because of that, I wish other companies and nonprofit entities who are willing to license their vaccine manufacture to others good luck."
2020-04-28 0:09,"It's no accident that the most promising research is being done in a non-profit environment.  Profit-making pharmaceutical companies are precisely that - profit-making, the more the better.  This inevitably focuses their attention on money-making products for conditions that are constantly  with us and provide a reliable income stream.  What incentive does the market provide for paying attention to occasional but devastating epidemics and pandemics?

This is but one example of how neo-liberal economics have swung so far towards satisfying private profit at the expense of the common good.  I don't suggest that non-profit research should necessarily be run by the public sector, but governments must take on the role of expanding it.  Which means a more equitable tax system.

1.  Given our willingness to reopen businesses at the height of the epidemic, the US will be the proud testing ground for COVID19 vaccines as our case count will be unrivaled in the world.  
2.  The gall of North American pharmaceuticals to want exclusive rights to gouge the world for the rights of getting vaccinated.  How dare they put their profits over public health and the economy.  Thankfully, the Oxford Institute has decided that sharing the vaccine with many manufacturers outweighs their profit motive.
3.  Because England realized studying the coronavirus that caused MERS would be ultimately beneficial, they were able to jump ahead of everyone else in vaccine development.  NIH and Pharma's agenda apparently dropped the ball on coronavirus research because it was not in America and not profitable.

2020-04-28 1:41,Prof. Hill is completely right.  Nobody should make a lot of money from this.  It should be like the chronometer; we have a problem we want an invention exactly to fit the need.  It's also time to think through how the manufacturing is going to take place.  With an explicit announcement that the development stage should be differently owned from the manufacturing process we can  start actually to think through to build the capacity for production of 7 billion vaccines.   We need the legal avenues to separate out this process.  Thanks go to all the researchers!
2020-04-28 2:11,"It seems we could get an answer within weeks, rather than four+ months, if the scientists recruited 10 healthy volunteers in their 20's to take the vaccine and then get injected with the virus.  Hopefully the risk of death for the 10 volunteers would be exceedingly low given their age and no pre-existing conditions.  Compensate each volunteer say $150,000.  I would think many patriots would eagerly sign up.  If the vaccine proved successful, many thousands of lives, millions of livelihoods, and many billions of economic activity could be saved through finding this solution months earlier due to the brave volunteers.

And they would not make it for profit purposes.

Hoping for success."
2020-04-28 5:53,"I wonder if anyone with knowledge of medical research guidelines can answer this question: Since teenagers contract the virus, but have a death rate of just about zero and an extremely low percentage who have more than mild symptoms, why would the government not approve paying a small number (say 10) of teenage volunteers who are in very healthy general condition $5,000 each for agreeing to be infected with the virus after they have been vaccinated?  There is a reasonable chance almost none of them would get sick, and even if some do, there would be a 99% chance that they would have no more than a typical bad cold. At this extremely minimal risk, you would be able to obtain a much faster and more confident answer within 2 weeks as to whether the vaccine works. Why should this not pass ethical standards, given that the risk of serious illness (which would be spelled out to them in advance) would be extremely minimal, and the risk of death just about zero, while the benefit to society could be monumental?"
2020-04-28 6:01,"PSA: ""genetic code"" does not mean genetic sequence. It rather refers to the rules of protein translation - the mapping of codons to amino acids. Sorry to be a pedant, but nails on a chalkboard."

But at the same time, progress IS being made and the Oxford scientists are ""months ahead of any of the other announced efforts - if it proves to be effective.""

Right now, that's the best promising news I've read in a while, even if everything is still too early to assume effective.

My nerves are nearing the breaking point.  This little spark of hope gives me something concrete to hold on to.  And today, that's good enough for now.

Good luck Professor Adrian Hill and scientific team.  Thank you for all that you are doing and trying to achieve.

North American Big Phama companies usually demand global rights to manufacture a vaccine? Here is a good example of why the free market does not work with health care. Also a situation where our government should step in and demand companies produce the vaccine (using the DPA) at cost. It’s for the common good, perhaps a foreign concept to our president and drug companies, but something they should nonetheless try."

At the policy level, of course, research to support the development of tools to control the viral spread is highly needed. If this proposal yields good results, there is work at multiple levels: inter-governmental, economies of scale, and supply chain, delivery systems and so on. I would think that this effort would involve private and public efforts. 

What is fascinating to me, is how the effort of scientists can be used to the progress of society. That is why we can’t stop science!"

They are all infected irreparably by the profit motive and are integral partners in the corrupt and ineffective American medical system. The US has lost its motivation to help humanity and humanity should be wary of putting trust in it.
2020-04-28 7:19,"WHO needs to make sure once the effective vaccine is found, that it should be funded immediately to manufacture across the globe that should be available to everyone.

Perhaps, the UN/the WHO should go ahead now and ensure how this effort will be coordinated."
2020-04-28 7:39,"Now another close relative of ours has joined the ranks of care givers at the front lines. I refer, of course, to our cousins, the rhesus macaques who ""volunteered"" to be innoculated and then exposed to massive amounts of the virus. We are indebted to them for the risks they are taking."
2020-04-28 8:20,"“We’re the only people in the country who want the number of new infections to stay up for another few weeks, so we can test our vaccine,” This is a very disturbing statement. I'm quite concerned about the role Big Pharma, always hungry for more profits, will play in this process, not to mention unelected billionaires like Bill Gates who seek to advance their agenda.
The media presents a ""vaccine"" as the only alternative while ignoring promising natural therapies, including Vitamin C infusion therapy and zinc, that get little or no press in the mainstream media. We also need to remember the vast majority of those who get severely ill have pre-existing conditions; obesity has been identified as a major risk for COVID 19. The upshot is that this is a wake-up call for better health and nutrition, access to healthcare and nutrition education.
The great variation in effectiveness of the annual flu vaccines ought to be a caution, especially if the virus mutates. On the other hand, it is possible the virus could mutate in a manner that lessens its severity. 
Until we get the testing mess fixed and get a better handle on how many people have been exposed and asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, and/or have antibodies, we will be unable to determine the actual death rate in the wider population. It is not feasible to think we can vaccinate the global population."
2020-04-28 8:23,I’m fascinated by this news and by Professor Hill’s story. How many people have an experience in their 20’s and pursue it for their entire careers only to end up solving a worldwide pandemic. Fascinating but I don’t look forward to being the next test subjects. I hope all is settled before the Fall.
2020-04-28 8:29,It would be a rich irony indeed if it turns out the first effective vaccine is developed by a non-profit vaccine research center. All that profit motive that Big Pharma keeps telling us is needed to keep us healthy -- heh.

If ""Nobody is going to make a lot of money off this,"" then why should scores, if not hundreds, of private companies invest their limited funds in trying to find a cure for which they will not be rewarded?  Investors are not charities.  This research should be funded by interested governments."
2020-04-28 8:00,"Once upon a time, it would have gone without saying that USA would solve this problem first.  Now, South Korea anticipated the problem and prepared for it before anyone knew any specifics about the virus (even its genetic sequence!), and it looks like the Brits will get the first vaccine.

We should multiply the BASIC-SCIENCE budgets--not the overall budgets, just the BASIC-SCIENCE budgets-- of NIH, NSF, DOEnergy, EPA, DOD, USDA, and NIST by a factor of at least ten.  And we should create new funding agencies as well, and fund them robustly."
2020-04-28 6:19,"Good! That's very good news. It looks like many efforts are finally reaching for true advanced stages in studies now of human safety with tools against Covid-19. The Jenner Institute has its own merry history with nothing less than Edward Jenner himself the inventor of vaccination. It could also be a good thing if the other research groups in Europe, China and in the U.S. can give a hand to accelerate the whole process. I'm pretty sure governments, WHO and private foundations can manage together to support this giant step for the good of the Humanity."

And there you  have it: decades of putting profit before all else, of defining every action and every choice in terms of the money to be made, and of gutting the government's public health institutes as put the well-being of America in the hands of money-grubbing Big Pharma. 

Last night on PBS's ""Independent Lens"" we saw the same story, the same corrupted motives and behaviors, in the story of a brilliant immunologist who could not get through the front doors of Big Pharma (or, if he did, was shown the way out through the back). His contribution to curing cancer was blocked for 15 years.

2020-04-28 14:25,"The good news is that this vaccine might (emphasize might) save lives. But caution is in order.

Previous flu vaccines contained mercury and while we were told that the ammonuts were insignificant, the laboratory environment for testing does not reflect the chemical soup of our daily environment.

Annually the CDC touts public relations message that its seasonal vaccine will be 60% effective; however, the vaccine repeatedly falls short. But last year’s vaccine was one of the worst on record. 

The CDC lowered its original 60% efficacy estimate to 37% after the flu season was underway.  But a commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine estimated it was only 10% effective because it is believed the H3N2 targeted strain had mutated.

But the big concern is that all vaccines compromise the immune system. After all, they are designed to infect us with a ""small"" dose of a disease from which our bodies produce antibodies.

But studies have shown that even when the vaccine is effective, the recipients show increased susceptibility to a host of other viruses, many of which affect the respiratory system.

While I hope this work is effective we must reexamine our entire approach to vaccines. As a child I received maybe 5 or 6 vaccines. Today our kids are required to get up to 20.

In the name of protection we are overloading our young immune systems, protecting them against one disease but weakening their natural defenses against others.

I wish, then, they would actually read the data.  Serology tests have confirmed across the nation that the infected cohort is much much greater than the number of diagnosed cases. The lethality of the Covid-19 is less than .003%, about like a flu season.

The curve would have flattened (as it has in Sweden) through usual infection and ""herd immunity"". Time to stop the  economic madness.

The lock downs were useful in allowing the hospitals to catch up but it we continue the lock downs  any chance at herd immunity will be delayed indefinitely. Perhaps lives were saved in the process.  We wont ever really know.  Sweden didn't lock down but seems to have done OK. But, again, that is because the virus isn't as deadly as originally believed.

Note to file: there has NEVER been a vaccine produced against any other caronavirus, so, don't expect one any time soone.  This is not unusual, there aren't vaccines for other viruses...HIV, for example, either.

So, let's open it up.

Oh, somebody please ask Drs. Fauci and Brixs at the next press conference about this and don't let them wiggle their answer about ""unreliable"" tests.

Phase I: determine safety
Phase II: determine whether the drug works
Phase III: determine how effective the drug is compared to currently available, effective drugs

Phases I and III are not as important in this case, as safety is not really a concern and there is really nothing to compare the new vaccine to. Phase II is the issue. 

To show that the vaccine works, in this case there will be a control group of 2,500 people and a test group of 2,500 people for the combined Phase II and III study. Those doing the testing will hope that some of the control group get the disease but none do in the test group. If there is a clear difference early on in the trial, they may declare it a success and give the vaccine even to the control group. 

That vaccinated monkeys were exposed to the virus but none got it is promising that the Phase II trials will show the vaccine to be effective in humans. But you never know. Godspeed (literally) with these clinical trials, and let's hope for a vaccine by September."

   Live animal markets where bats and exotic animals are still sold for human consumption have been the source of previous outbreaks and the CCP is doing nothing about it and the WHO would not demand the Chinese to ban those wet animal markets either. 
   China could have contained the virus within Wuhan by banning international travel of its citizens outside China just like they banned domestic travel within China. The World Health Organization was complementing China and criticized Trump for the travel ban from China.

He is calling out intelligence officials to make up a story about China losing control of the virus when there is no proof and there never will be.  China doesnt allow people into their laboratories nor any of their secretive buildings or anything else.  Trump is desperate because he owes the Chinese huge amounts of money in loans and the President of China could easily call him out on them.  Not only his personal loans but China reportedly holds a zillion dollars in US debt.  Trump is looking and acting like a man having a nervous breakdown.

You say the word ""economy"" as if it means something to me.  Like I know why you send the bulk of us down the drain of inevitable ruin at the same moment you giddily report the stock market is doing better than expected, better than fine.

You talk about me, marooned alone in my house, as if I want to be here.  You can't seem to make your money news and your personal news make sense together.

This is not an economic phenomenon.  It is a health policy decision, made with full awareness of what would happen.

No panting headlines are necessary or accurate.  You knew, you predicted from day one exactly this.

You knew for a certainty people sent home with no notice, no preparation would come to desperate financial straights in days.  You knew that means local business, small business will go down and then under.

The fool is not the person who shines a light on Trump's ridiculous and possibly dangerous musings. 

The fool is the person who believes his musings to be the truth and goes on to ingest and/or inject household cleaners and disinfectants.

And for those who argue that Trump never actually told people to attempt these irrational ""treatments"" for the virus, don't we already know that conspiracy theorists like Trump rarely state anything definitively?

That's not how it works in Europe and other civilized places that understand the need for human spaces, privacy, and personal control over data.

We need laws, not vows made by known liars.

Please remind Times readers of who (Harvard) Professor Zuboff is, as no discussion of these matters should be completed without doing that.  As she shows, we need new terminology (like 'surveillance capitalism"") to discuss these things and to have a good understanding of what's at stake."

They can't win elections without cheating (gerrymandering) and suppression, and now they can't abide by media policies against falsehoods that mislead and endanger the public.  Sounds to me like a special interest wants special treatment. Like permission to lie and call it 'truth'.  

It's an interesting take from folks who have spent lifetimes telling Americans to stop 'depending on government' and raise themselves up through hard work and diligence, which ""will be it's own reward"".  Qualities that are conspicuously lacking when they insist on such special treatment for such suspect 'information' -- and upon threat of government intervention. no less!

And it will allow voters not to forget some of the inane comments and decisions that have been made during these times, rather than having them disappear in the fog of other inane comments and decisions that are unfortunately sure to occur in the coming months."

Remember the Mr Yuk Face icon to teach toddlers not to touch the bleach or household cleaners?  So two?  I’m surprised Penn and Wharton don’t threaten him with slander for saying he was educated at those institutions.

The early studies were carried out by several physicians in USA and published in the American Journal of Surgery. However with the development of antibiotics, the use of UBI declined and it has now been called “the cure that time forgot” ...  With the recent emergence of bacteria that are resistant to all known antibiotics, UBI should be more investigated as an alternative approach to infections, and as an immune-modulating therapy.""

Interest rates will never rise above negligible and the national debt will never be paid off. Eventually the debt comes due and is replaced by new debt. If interest rates were to rise appreciably then interest on replacement debt would rise beyond the government’s ability to pay, except by a rise in taxes, which is a political anathema.

It is too bad that in normal times the contributions of workers to the economy is ignored, in all the talk of markets and investor confidence and too big to fail.

Workers' wages have been stagnant for decades, by design. Even that wild eyed Socialist Henry Ford knew he had to pay workers enough to be able to buy back the cars they built - at a profit. Unregulated greed isn't even good for capitalism.

That means the actual carnage among small businesses across America has yet to register.  For the family farm, the small shop, all the local entrepreneurs - how many can survive without revenues for 4 or 5 months? Talk of a V shaped recovery may twinkle fancies on Wall Street, but main street is looking at a burned out downtown with no insurance. 

How will small businesses recover months of lost revenues? How will they manage labor dislocations, loss of tourism and discretionary consumer spending? We'll be looking at defaults and bankruptcies, closures and unemployment, as well as depleted treasuries at county and state levels as tax revenues plummet.

1. Ample testing and contact tracing, so we can ease up on lockdown.

2. Ample *domestic* production of PPE, which would also slow the spread to help us ease up on lockdown.

3. Open the schools! A recent report in the Lancet suggests that kids are so minimally responsible for the spread. It's irresponsible to keep schools closed in areas with low cases numbers and sufficient testing. (The WHO set a threshold of 10% positive tests or fewer for deciding if there are enough tests being run in an area. There are parts of the country where the percentage of positive tests is far below the target!)

4. Stop paying people to stay home. Unemployment insurance is great, but many people are making more than they made when they worked, and that's not even factoring in that people don't pay the 7.65% social security and Medicare tax on their UI checks.

5. Put returning office works to work at the bottom of the priority list if they can do their jobs from home. This will allow us to open other aspects of the economy first."

So, for a 60-year-old who dies due to the pandemic, add 27 years of life lost, which is about the life expectancy at age 60.

2020-04-29 12:08,"1 million confirmed infections in US and 37,587 deaths per CDC, 97% over 45 is a heart breaking statistics, but some have made a disgusting comparison to our young men who were drafted to go to war in Vietnam who never returned alive or returned with significant damage physically and emotionally. The ungrateful nation then never respected or honored their service until the wall came up in Washington with the names of each of them who made the ultimate sacrifice. 

BRAVO SWEDEN. Fortune favors the brave and you were cautiously brave and rewards for your bravery will be the prized ""Herd Immunity"". Acquiring herd immunity or protective immunity from a vaccine is much needed if we are ever trying for eradication of COVID-19. Sweden deserves to give the 2020 Nobel to its own decision makers for their bold decision to not shut down businesses and clinics through this panic pandemic. There are 100s of ways humans die and what we have done in the US and many other countries is we have shut down all kinds of clinics and Hospitals that are not involved in COVID-19 care but save lives. 

 The US economy is in shambles and unless the loot from the tax payers by the millionaires and billionaires is returned we will never recover, even well after the nano sized rascal COVID-19 is booted out of mother earth. The 2.5+ trillion (T) Corona relief package shoveled by the US congress to bail out businesses and pay the unemployed, to stay home is already blown up with national debt at 25 T."
2020-04-29 13:48,"The fight against the pandemic has shown us the difference between our intelligent governors and a complete brainless President. It is really saddening that our governors, both, Republican and Democrat, had to fight against the pandemic carrying at the same time a heavy counterweight on their shoulders. Most people with a minimal brain realize that Trump is a complete failure and nothing Trump says or does should be heeded or appreciated but there are large segments of our population that – unfortunately – still see Trump as God on Earth and they will even inject bleach on themselves just because Trump said it. That is the major counterweight the intelligent governors have had to deal with while fighting the pandemic at the same time."

Just a very simple example: For quite sometime now we have had a very, very serious problem with obesity in our country. What is the answer to that by our smart business leaders? It is not help society to correct that ill. The answer has been wider trucks, wider stadium and cinema seats, larger clothing and similar gimmicks. All those “solutions” certainly produced increased profits for those businesses but they also incubated long-term larger problems for our society.  The easy way out was preferred and looking the other way has been the norm. Yes, Sweden didn’t have a full lockdown because of the pandemic but among other advantages in relation to the United States, Sweden doesn’t have even a fraction of obese people we have here in the United States and that tell a lot about brainpower and Sweden has universal health care and more socially responsible business leadership."

Does anyone think “the economy” is some kind of separate living entity from the people, from the human beings that make “the economy” function? Our brutally untamed capitalistic system has been assassinating itself for quite a long time by concentrating in just a few members of our society the appropriation of the never-matched gigantic additional income generated by the larger-than-ever revolution created by the technological progress of the last few decades. That “economy” can produce faster, at much lower cost, any and every single gadget we can imagine but if the large masses don’t have the disposable income to buy those gadgets the efficiently generated, low cost-low price production will be dumped on the fields like the excess milk is being dumped now. It should be noted that the large masses referred to previously are NOT the 1% billionaires but the Millions and Millions working for a meager $10.00/hour pay."

2020-04-29 14:05,"The largest mistake would be to try to re-start “the economy’ exactly as it was right before the pandemic. We should see the silver lining on all this. For example: New fossil fuel powered cars’ sales will be stagnant for a long time even after the pandemic is defeated. Intelligent leaders of the major carmakers should lead the way in our society for the transformation of our way of life and our generalized attitude towards climate change. The carmakers should re-convert some of their plants to produce renewable energy oriented equipment and also to produce in the United States strategically sensitive medical equipment. That alone will create thousands and thousands of well-paid jobs almost overnight. The carmakers should also accelerate the introduction of non-fossil fuel powered vehicles in all segments, including particularly heavy transportation vehicles."

In their eagerness to protect big business through both bailouts and market actions leading to artificial stock price increases, the monetary and political authorities are showing their true face.  For this administration, helping the portfolios of the wealthy and large institutional investors is clearly seen to be way more important than supporting  citizens suddenly left with no means to live their lives.  It's job one and a mockery of their social responsibilities.

If there ever was an argument to be made in favor of direct Treasury, surely it should be forcefully made now.  Forget giving money to financial institutions and big business and put the funds directly in people's bank accounts, and make it for more than a month's rent.  There would be far less wasteful leakage into stocks and also far less fraud.  Also, people would spend the money, not hoard it or buy back stocks.

Explaining that because he is tested regularly and is neither infected nor asymptomatic and, therefore, does not need to wear a mask, completely misses the point. Leadership, by prima facie definition, means to lead by example. Pence refusing to wear a mask because he doesn't need one is like a battle field commander refusing to engage in the fight because he doesn't have a weapon at hand.

Part of this is because many businesses won’t survive, so “open” is a truncated idea. Survivors who can open need a public confident enough to go out and spend enough. Many of those won’t make it due to a meager consumer response.

Some put out specious arguments about how the markets are ""forward-looking"" or US companies hold ""intrinsic quality"" even as the future (with a COVID-19 second wave inevitable and new mutant strains arising, endangering even young children) is even bleaker, and price-to-earnings ratios soar to levels that would make investors in the South Sea Bubble and Dutch Tulipmania blush. And all this even though before COVID-19, US companies were already heavily leveraged and most of their ""profitability"" was coming from stock buybacks and laying off American workers to be replaced by cheap foreign labor to boost the next quarter's statement. (See: Boeing for example.)

The real reason for the US stock market's rise on abysmal news? Massive corporate welfare from the Federal Reserve and Congress. That's right, the ""socialism"" derided by business conservatives (when it's used to provide healthcare or education for Americans) is now the chief source of comfort for so-called titans of industry and free market capitalists. They are the true ""welfare queens"" begging for handouts.

Trump and the GOP cannot control of the gears of the economic system.  How our response will be manifested is anybody's guess as it gets worse and starts to affect life as we’ve known it.  We’ve already see the best and the worst of mankind.
At the moment, though, I can’t think it’s more important than  the news appearing on the other side of this report on the NYT first page:

“Total deaths in seven states that have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic are nearly 50 percent higher than normal for the five weeks from March 8 through April 11, according to new death statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is 9,000 more deaths than were reported as of April 11 in official counts of deaths from the coronavirus.”

Any person with a working brain each and every input to improve our own response to the pandemic should be welcome as a basis for study and development of our own strategy not for instituting a carbon copy of any other country’s handling of the pandemic. Several factors should be considered when looking at the way Swedes handled the current situation. First size of the population: Sweden has a little over 10 Million people, Stockholm is the largest urban center and has less than 2 Million people, the land area of Sweden is 410,000 square kilometers, similar to the area of California, a state with a population of 40 Million or a ratio of 4 to 1 compared to Sweden. Let's consider differences in socio-economics. Universal health care coverage, guaranteed replacement of income from work, general education levels, homogeneity of the population all are much, much higher/better in Sweden than in the United States. The ideological divide of the population is almost non-existent in Sweden while is scarily profound in the United States.

If meat is scarce in the market, we will eat healthy vegetable casseroles and survive. If the large shopping mall next town over is not opening, believe me, we will survive. We already have enough 'stuff' and there is no need to purchase more of the same.

2020-04-29 17:12,"Unfortunately, the Times’s highlighting of CDC data from just seven states will lead COVID skeptics to accuse the reporters of cherry-picking. Without having read the CDC report itself, I don’t know whether data from other states were reported and whether they showed significantly increased mortality. Nonetheless, skeptics, as noted in the piece, there is a lag time in ascertainment of all deaths. Differences in state-level investment in public health may contribute to a varying efficiency among states in compiling mortality statistics. And differing timelines for infection may mean excess mortality won’t show up until next month or the month after that. 
Of course, overall mortality by definition captures deaths other than from COVID-19. Still, an increase in mortality that’s large enough not to be attributable to random variation has to be attributed to COVID-19, absent any other significant event such as increase in some other infectious disease. Whether deaths are directly caused by infection, are due to other conditions with COVID-19 a contributing factor, or result from reduced access to care because of the pandemic or failure to seek care out of concern about infection, the excess mortality is related to COVID-19, and it can’t be reasonably explained away. And it refutes the argument that COVID-19 death rates are inflated due to deliberately broad criteria set by government for designated deaths as infection-related or to financial incentives to hospitals."

Flattery will get you anywhere, as oilmen know.  Vladimir Putin's long game of cornering the market on oil required the utter destruction of U.S. fracking and the manipulation of OPEC toward that end.  Saudi Arabia had a financial stake in U.S. fracking, but Putin's pressure tactics broke that connection.  To insulate Russia from the supply shock, Putin stockpiled vast hoards of gold.

If the small ruling class of wealthy elites have their way the American people will remain in the dark and will indeed resume their miserable existence only to complain to themselves and manifest their disappointment in tragic ways that crystallize their suffering, such as declining to become politically engaged or succumbing to the seductive advances of the next counterfeit populist demagogue the elites put in front of them.

We progressives must intervene right now to teach the American people that this crisis has exposed America as being an unfair country that messed up because it has been preoccupied with helping the wealthy and not the common people.

Therefore, the majority will get better no matter what you give them unless you kill them with the drug treatments like azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. The antiviral  treatments we give for the flu do not seem to have decreased the death rate (.1%)from influenza but decrease the duration of acute symptoms by 2 days or so and unfortunately , the same is likely true for treatments of Covid 19 where the true death rate is close to 2-3 % and likely will be the same.

What there has been is a lethal pandemic that has paralyzed the world economy by forcing shutdowns; we are frozen in place.  The way out is not to send people out to die. Not only is that plan immoral - not that Trump & Co. care - but it will fail, thereby prolonging the crisis.

The way back is for our wealthy nation to subsidize the workers who been laid off or cannot work for home; support small business; and work globally, with other nations and WHO, to develops reliable tests, treatments and vaccines.

We should be on a 100% war footing, developing and manufacturing reliable COVID-19 and antibody tests, finding treatments, creating vaccines, testing and tracking, enforcing stay-at-home orders, and isolating and treating the sick. 

What Trump and Co. are doing is criminal, stupid, ignorant and doomed to fail - and will kill tens of thousands unnecessarily. The economy will recover when the virus is controlled.  The virus does not care who becomes US president in January 2021.  It is trying to survive. And so are we.

The economy is not collapsing, it is dormant, but only in certain sectors.  What we have is a distribution problem.  All dollars spent in this economy come from the Treasury.  When society is completely functioning Reserve Notes should flow partially by government and partially through private entities.

During this crisis it should be determined how many dollars it takes and to whom will preserve the economy.  At present dollars are not circulating enough. More needs to flow to individuals so goods and services can be exchanged.  Is it free?  No, we are being employed by government to take care of our households and prevent contagion to others.  The usual tender transfer has dropped out so government has to more directly give people spending power.  It is a reverse Social Security for all, waiting until it can be paid back by normal economic activity. 

During the 1929 Depression the funds were cut off too soon and the misery continued until WWII when employment increased in war industries.  The latter is a poor substitute for paying people. Keeping them safe and alive, ready to re-enter an open productive society, IMO, is a better objective.

2020-04-29 17:34,"Particularly with regard to habitual liars, the best why to evaluate them is to observe their conduct.  A case in point is our president and vice-president.  They both acknowledge that their COVID medical experts all agree that wearing masks when out and about is a best practice.  Yet neither will do it.  Trump said yesterday that he thinks it would be disrespectful to the desk in his office for him to do so.  (!?) Pence said that his violation of Mayo Clinic's policy by not wearing a mask when everyone else was didn't matter because as Vice President he had been tested and besides he wanted to be able to look the people he was visiting 'in the eyes.'  Masks, of course, do not cover eyes and in the real world not everyone can get even one test.  

The important take-away from this is that the conduct of refusing to wear a mask shows abject lack of real leadership -- good leaders lead by example.  If we want people to protect each other by wearing masks, our leaders need to set that example.  Trump and Pence fail miserably again."
2020-04-29 17:39,"For anyone who can read the economic tea leaves, the PRE-pandemic retraction clues were there for all to see.

The pandemic has merely exacerbated and accelerated the retraction.  After 10 years of growth, some real and some sleight of hand, a slowing economy is not unusual.

As with any downturn there will be opportunities and losses.  In our consumer-based, debt-laden economy, the massive, rapid loss of jobs and subsequent financial disaster faced by the folks who for years have propped up the economy but lack financial stamina does not bode well for a rapid recovery.

The shattering of the intangibles that spur spending - security, optimism, trust and hope for a better future - will likely hold back a recovery far more than returning to employment and a stock market recovery.

Until those return (along with jobs or real, mid-to long term economic assistance)  it is going to be a rough ride indeed."
2020-04-29 17:44,"Picking just one vital initiative: if the FDA can speed the development of a vaccine or form of treatment along responsibly, of course. Godspeed.  We are also still awaiting easy availability of accurate testing, bot for the virus and its antibodies.

But the way the administration seems to pressure the FDA and CDC, they now suffer from a huge  credibility gap over their announcements.  To me, it appears that Trump & Co have attempted to turn a team devoted to science, health and medicine into marketing branches of the executive office."
2020-04-29 17:46,"Germany and Canada report daily the breakdown numbers of recoveries or resolved cases, deaths and hospitalizations. Just throwing out one million cases continues to excite fear and does not give the information to people so that they can understand we are moving through a pandemic and not just stuck. The one million case number is no longer relevant after 100 days, because the vast majority have resolved."
2020-04-29 18:04,"As a retired Professor of Health Psychology specializing in research methods, it's clearly much too early to consider remdesivir as an effective treatment until a major randomized clinical trial using a placebo control group is performed.  The best way to characterize it is with ""cautious optimism"" rather than ""'very optimistic'"" given the negative results of a placebo controlled study."
2020-04-29 17:58,"Let me guess. Remdesivir will now cost $10,000 a treatment, and everyone without a nickel to their name will now be expected to go back to work, because ""we"" have a ""treatment""."

Most commentators I hope will be happy at the news although as the light at the end of the tunnel draws near it will give Trump a tailwind. It might even be a sign to Biden to give proof of life. To directly answer charges of sexual assault is too much to expect of him. He may even have forgotten what it means.

All cadets will be tested for the virus. All will need to undergo 14 days of quarantine. Unlike the Air Force Academy ceremony, President Trump has insisted that all be packed in for his address. He prefers that ""look"" to that of the Air Force. All travel and accommodations will be at taxpayer expense. Of course, Trump's travel will be covered by taxpayer expense as well.

Yesterday I learned that HALF of the residents, over 100 of them, are positive, and ten have died from the disease. I know the nursing homes have done what they can to limit the spread of infections, but it is not working, since the staff are bringing the virus into the homes. We have shut down our schools and universities to protect a population that is at very low risk for Covid-19 (only one person under the age of 29 has died from Covid-19 in Massachusetts, out of 58,000 infections), while allowing our nursing homes to become Petri dishes for the virus."

2020-04-29 18:35,"One of the most amazing aspects about the US government response to this pandemic is that we were so unprepared that we ran out - or did not have - so many things we needed, such as respirators, tests, medical gear, etc.  

Can you image getting 2 weeks into a war and having the military say ""we ran out of bullets and helmets!""?

This puts a real spotlight on our priorities.  To this end, it's no wonder we're having so much trouble socially, culturally, and economically.  One thing for sure - is highly unlikely that we are going to come out of this as well many other countries.  

We are just totally unprepared, and apparently more willing to make arrogant excuses than humble reparations."

2020-04-29 18:22,"What the average voter doesn't want to lose sight of is where we were economically as a nation before this pandemic came ashore.

The economy was starting to show serious signs of pending problems.  We were running on a $1.2 trillion annual deficit.  Interest rates were being manipulated artificially low by a president focused on a short-term goal (getting reelected) at the expense of long-term stability (fiscal responsibility).

We dropped in a short-cited corporate tax boondoggle.

The self-inflicted trade war was pushing us into almost certain recession and involved the government needing to subsidize U.S. farmers to the tune of $20-$30 billion.

GDP had slowed to 2.1% in the 4th quarter and job growth was slowing. The stock market is not a precursor for future economic success as people might believe.

By all measures, we were going to have some economic issues and we had a ""leader"" with no contingent plan.  Then this pandemic comes around and we're forced to absorb the ills of a short-sighted president who is only focused on getting reelected.

When Trump was elected, I feared the necessity for leadership should we be faced with a crisis.  I just never imagined it would be a health crisis and we have no competent leadership.

I hope the American voter possess the ability to look at this mess through pragmatic eyes and see how ill-equipped and unfit for office this man is."

Perhaps remdesivir can provide some curative effect in selected cases.  But it does not appear to be a wonder drug by any means.  The data is scanty and the doubts as to its efficacy are realistic.  It may help about a third of mild cases.  It doesn't seem to work for severe situations and certainly won't bring the dead back to life.

A sane society would place cautious optimism in its application while steeling itself for possible disappointment.

But we going to witness this drug be touted by the Huckster-in-Chief as a magical formula that justify's his personal sense of genius.

Dr. Fauci very clearly laid out the case for his optimism, calling the data ""highly significant"".  Of great significance is the fact that they now know a drug can block this virus. 

Dr. Fauci also explained the rush to announce the results.  When results are this good, ethics require the results to be communicated immediately to the placebo group so they can take it."

When you're big you can do things in a big way.  It sounds like these will be very large but experimental trials that will amount to millions of doses.  If allowed to do so, it will be a new but necessary approach to curtailing the corona virus.  Despite risks, I find it encouraging, hopeful."

Still, when reporting on science, for crying out loud leave the politics out of it and have someone with at least a nodding acquaintance with said science write the content. 

Remdesivir has been extensively studied as an antiviral agent effective in treating in coronavirus-induced respiratory illness since the catastrophic SARS outbreak of 2003. (Yes, the current virus is a SARS virus. It’s not that new and definitely not a complete unknown.) A search of any peer-reviewed source databases yields pages of results, not just one Lancet study. 

Also, as much as it pains you to do it, dear NYT, responsible, comprehensive reporting means stating that almost every single study on the efficacy of Remdesivir also reports on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. I have no dog in this fight; if anything, as someone with lupus I’d just as soon not have the masses buy up all the medication I currently take.

It is about to be tested under fire in the real world of this coronavirus pandemic without knowing about any potential side effects.

The same applies to the study done at the U. of Chicago in which Gilead was also involved.

They are distinguished researchers who justly deserve their stellar reputations.  But it is clear that Trump just cares about re-election, and spinning good news at this time is not what the country needs.

The fact that remdesivir will continue to be studied does not yet make it a silver bullet, and Dr. Fauci should not put himself in the position of becoming a Trump enabler.  He has already done some harm when understating the magnitude of the pandemic back in February.

So Trump should just stand there with Pence and not drag honest and ethical people into his show."
2020-04-29 19:30,"Hmm, the moment FDA gives an emergency authorization for Remdesivir, it would become much more difficult for Remdesivir double-blind clinical trials to recruit new patients, for no one would want to face the possibility of being given only placebos by enrolling in a double-blind clinical trial anymore. Instead, patients would probably prefer to obtain Remdesivir directly via the FDA emergency authorization. Hopefully FDA has thought this through and is confidence that there would be enough data regardless of its actions to fairly assess Remdesivir’s effectiveness. 

Nevertheless, it seems to be a good news and hopefully the beginning of effective treatments and/or vaccines coming online."

However, the graph shows that our first quarter GDP seems down more than -8% if compared to the first quarter of 2019.   And China's first quarter GDP went down -6.8% compared to their first quarter of 2019.

I have no idea which one performs better in the first quarter.  But we are a consumer driven economy (>80% of the GDP), and China is about 50%.  I guess that was why Trump was so eager to reopen the business to push consumer back in the market  and drive up the GDP.  On the other hand, China seems to take a more careful and tedious route to reopen the market.  Their main focus is on production and not consumption."

Also, how can anyone not become enraged when Kushner's idea of success is almost 60,000 dead (as of today) even when Trump weeks ago declared the incident under control with no deaths expected.  To say that Kushner and Trump continue to move the goalposts is an understatement. 

Without any experience or training in emergency management, Kushner's gushing praise of this administration's inept response to this pandemic is not only beyond comprehension but more importantly, an insult to those who have died and those who are still on the front lines of this war.

On the other hand, the FDA has been made aware of truly positive preliminary results for another drug from a much smaller company, but they aren’t moving on it for compassionate care or emergency approval.  Despite trial results showing no negative side effects.  Despite countless patients dying each day.   Why?

2020-04-29 19:55,"So our ""standard of treatment"" in the US is going to continue to be:

1) No treatment
2) When you feel ""short of breath"" -- meaning your lungs are failing -- you can come into the hospital and they will try to rescue you before you die, and one of the drugs they may use wlll be a very expensive biologic that can only be administered intravenously.

This sounds like a good way for hospitals to make money. Certainly it's a good way for Gilead Pharmaceuticals to make money. But is it the most effective way to treat this disease?

Other countries such as Italy have moved away from hospital/ICU-centered care to aggressive early treatment at home as soon as symptoms appear and there is a covid diagnosis. So Italian patients are getting medicine maybe a week before American patients will be sick enough to go to a hospital. 

Italian doctors say early treatment is working -- their hospital and ICU admissions have plummeted, deaths have plummeted and their death/recovery ratio has improved dramatically in the last 3 1/2 weeks.

The question I have is -- is anyone in American paying attention?"

The only right way to handle this is the way Sweden and the Netherlands are handling it: 1) protect the most vulnerable, 2) practice reasonable precautions stemming from universal knowledge of the threat, and 3) get on with life.

I wish every country the best they can achieve in matching their national values with actions and outcomes.

Now with the sudden ""very optimistic"" reaction by Dr. Fauci about this drug in addition to the F.D.A. announcing an emergency use of it, the stocks rallied and the close was up 3%.

I reluctance and caution I have surrounding this drug is that only ONE study showed the experimental virus drug having had only a 31% improvement while a similar study in China showed no difference at all.

This new drug IS a potential first step, a positive first step.  But there is still a long way to go.  In the meantime, not a word was mentioned about how far along the team of researchers at Oxford are coming with a potential vaccine in the works, with a hopeful target date of September."

1. The trial DID NOT meet target enrollment because Wuhan stabilized. It was intended to have 650 total patients in order to be adequately powered, but only 236 were enrolled. The trial had no p<0.05 (statistical significance), but this is because they were unable to enroll even half the number of patients needed to reach that statistical power. If you are not sufficiently powered, you CANNOT claim that a treatment does not work.

2. Despite this, among patients who were treated within 10 days of symptom onset, remdesivir was associated with a numerical reduction of 5 days in median time to clinical improvement. However, this failed to reach significance (again, this study was underpowered).

Or was it the infection rate in the Staff, if that was the issue, then that surely raise some valid questions about the regulation of the whole industry.

Or did illegal hourly workers simply decide they weren’t taking the risk of turning up for work. 

Here in Canada because of Socialized healthcare their are hardly any unwelcome guest workers. Yet Cargill’s hourly paid  legal immigrants refused to turn up for work, not because they have no Healthcare but because they did think the risk to their family and friends was worth it.

It begs the question of just what is on the meat when it’s packed, as I believe US or Canadian plants don’t test for infectious agents  frequently.
In Europe most are regulated to frequently test and dump any product which is contaminated, this leads to stopping production and cleaning the plant until productions is clean again.

Close to 95% of those infected with COVID-19 in the US have recovered without Rem. but with critical support of oxygen or ventilators to survive longer until such time the patient has acquired immunity to clear the virus. 

My modest family doctor who refused to play God, said 
""Doctors don't cure patients. Doctors help nature to cure patients"" At best what Rem. will do is, it will give those with a weak immune system, time. Time is of the essence when a person is infected because a person's immune system takes its time. The younger a person is the faster will be the immune response, assuming that there are no underlying medical issues like obesity or diabetes either type I or II. 

Another study that found no benefit of the Rem, in severely ill patients is no surprise because such patients had already lost the race to stem virus spread in the lungs due to irreversible damage to the lungs. A very narrow window of opportunity exists for those who could benefit from Rem.

""Hospitalized patients with advanced COVID-19 and lung involvement who received remdesivir recovered faster than similar patients who received placebo, according to a preliminary data analysis from a randomized, controlled trial involving 1063 patients, which began on February 21. The trial (known as the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial, or ACTT), sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is the first clinical trial launched in the United States to evaluate an experimental treatment for COVID-19. 

An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) overseeing the trial met on April 27 to review data and shared their interim analysis with the study team. Based upon their review of the data, they noted that remdesivir was better than placebo from the perspective of the primary endpoint, time to recovery, a metric often used in influenza trials. Recovery in this study was defined as being well enough for hospital discharge or returning to normal activity level.   

Preliminary results indicate that patients who received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery than those who received placebo (p<0.001). Specifically, the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared with 15 days for those who received placebo."""
2020-04-29 22:39,"So this is the New York Times comment section, so there has to be a qualified medical person here that can answer my question which I haven't seen anywhere, but maybe I missed it.

So in round numbers, we have done 5 million tests, and have 1 million cases (U.S.). Does that mean that drs think that 20% of the population is infected? Or is it greatly skewed by where the testing is being done and who is allowed to get a test? What percentage of the US do experts believe is infected if not 20%?"
2020-04-29 22:36,"Remdesivir - so Dr Fauci says (and I've combed the web to try to establish his EXACT words) reduces the duration of the Covid-19 illness from 15 days (placebo group) to 11 days. That's a 27% reduction. It's a 'clear cut' effect but, no words about deaths - and we know that milder cases recover in a couple of weeks. The more severe infections take much longer. The need we have is for a drug, any drug, which saves the lives of people with severe Covid-19 pneumonia which, untreated, has a mortality rate of about 50%, We don't much need a drug which modestly attenuates the disease in people who were going to recover anyway.

I think Dr Fauci's 'optimism' derives from the finding of clear evidence that, for the first time, there exists a medication which slows or stops virus replication. That certainly IS a cause for optimism, even if Remdesivir isn't able to slow the virus very much. It CAN be slowed and better, more effective similar drugs will likely follow.

But, I'll wait to see the actual data. Remdesivir isn't new and it previously failed to benefit HIV, H1N1 influenza or Ebola infection despite high hopes and 'promising' early trial results. Remdesivir has also been hyped and spun to investors more than any other drug I can remember.

A cause for quiet optimism - but nothing more at this stage."
2020-04-29 22:54,"The eagerness for positive news is understandable and to give Hope for those suffering and fighting for their lives but Fauci and Trump are not the head of the FDA, so let the FDA do their job and avoid hyping something when big question marks remain and more work is required.

FULL STORY

Scientists at the University of Alberta have shown that the drug remdesivir is highly effective in stopping the replication mechanism of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, according to new research published today in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.

The paper follows closely on research published by the same lab in late February that demonstrated how the drug worked against the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus, a related coronavirus.

""We were optimistic that we would see the same results against the SARS-CoV-2 virus,"" said Matthias Götte, chair of medical microbiology and immunology at U of A.

""We obtained almost identical results as we reported previously with MERS, so we see that remdesivir is a very potent inhibitor for coronavirus polymerases.""

2020-04-29 23:13,This is very misleading coverage.  A 5 percent decrease in the midst of a pandemic is actually pretty good.  And the death statistics probably reflect many people failing to seek care for other illnesses—something the Times’ ceaseless panic is encouraging.
2020-04-29 23:17,"As thousands still die, tens of thousands become infected and millions are unemployed, I hope people remember the Florida Governor allowing spring break kids to infect themselves and others- while he sat back. ""Hysteria""? I feel it when I hear Republicans."
2020-04-29 23:12,"Heartbreaking news out of Holyoke Soldiers’ Home. What a horrible situation.

The thing about this whole ordeal that I have been having such a hard time coming to terms with is the fact that Trump seems to think that Democrats want him to fail. No sir. We sure don’t. We want you to do the right thing. To lead us. To offer words of comfort and hope. 

I would love to read a news story and think wow, he did something really well. I think everyone wants to feel like we can trust our president and feel proud of him. This isn’t about politics. It’s about saving the lives of Americans. 

When 68 veterans die in a veterans’ nursing home, it’s not political. It’s an American tragedy. Please, Donald a Trump, stand up and make us all proud by offering some true empathy for this soldiers’ home and all the veterans and their families. It’s really sad that we are wondering if you even care."
2020-04-29 23:15,"These are early days. Anybody who claims these drugs work at such an early date is really risking their reputation. 
I suspect in one to two months we’ll find that there’s really no difference this drug makes! When this is all done I would bet the reputations of any of these medical professionals serving under Trump will be tarnished. 
We’ve already started to see that with Dr. Birx kneading herself into all sorts of pretzels and noodles to explain Trump’s bleach debacle! 
I think she’s gone, she’s more politics and less facts now! 
Trump, as usual, is using these sad characters, and when he’s done, he’ll leave them as he has others before them, with torn and sad reputations!"
2020-04-29 23:14,"She might object to my attempt to offer anything up here. but my wife is an infectious disease physician here in KC where we've had a more manageable incidence of coronavirus. She's described to me as Remdisivir as being ""the drug nobody can get,"" alluding to the fact that it has already been in use for COVID-19 but nearly impossible to obtain as it requires the patient to be near death to qualify. That may change with these recent studies.

But more importantly, the therapy she and her colleagues have had the most success with is treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients using prone beds. Placing someone on their stomach for several hours to relieve the airways buys precious time. Short of having enough of these beds to be widely used, the pulmonologists at her hospitals recommend simply lying prone for extended periods. This may not be useful information but if you've tested positive for coronavirus and your doctor hasn't discussed this as a therapy, you might want to inquire. Don't do anything though that isn't specifically recommended by your doctor.

Thank you to all those working the front. And a special shout out to Mayor Quinton Lucas and leaders in the 4 County greater KC area for acting early and holding steadfast to spare our citizens, healthcare workers, and more importantly (to me), my wife who, with lesser, more Trump-like (lack of) leadership, would have been subjected to so much more."
2020-04-29 23:18,"This crisis really is within our grasp. We have the ability and are very capable to contain this pandemic.  The problem is entrenched power, and the almighty free-market and profit for the few at the expense of the many."
2020-04-29 23:13,Sounds like wishful thinking to me which will be politicized. NYT should do an educational series on what good research science looks like. This understanding is becoming more important with all these idiot politicians and media clowns.
2020-04-29 23:02,"The hostages—Fauci and Birks—can no longer be trusted.

Receiving important medical news from the Oval Office under the gaze of this President is wholly inappropriate. 

Fauci’s over the top “standard of care” proclamation is suspect."
2020-04-29 23:10,I say let Trump be the first to try all of the experimental COVID-18 vaccines he’s pushing.
2020-04-29 23:06,"The death numbers are very inflated. The NYT had an article last week about NYC counting as virus deaths any deaths ""linked"" to it or ""presumed"" to be virus. So a 97 year old with congestive heart disease who tested positive and dies is counted a virus death.  REALLY ???? What is the life expectancy of a 97 year old with congestive heart disease? 

Guess the more deaths the more federal aid?"
2020-04-29 23:14,"If you haven't dumped your stocks yet, here's your last opportunity."
2020-04-29 23:25,"It’s hard to believe that it was just 6 weeks ago that trump asserted  the whole virus thing was a ‘hoax’, that there were only 15 ‘flu-like’ infection cases all of them mild and soon with the coming warmer weather the threat would disappear “like magic”.  Now faced with the reality of over a million cases reported and 6000 deaths (and counting)  trump laments “who knew it was coming?” while blaming the 'fake news’ for not recognizing what a “great job” he was doing. It’s impossible to fathom what this president means about anything. One thing is obvious  ... if anyone should have known it was trump: 
  >  during the transition to the trump regime in 2016 Obama warned trump to be vigilant about the possibility of a viral pandemic crisis. He ignored the warning but then promptly gutte all the considerable measures Obama had taken to protect the nation from the 2014 Ebola crisis and to guard against all other infection events. 
   > trump like-wise ignored throughout 2019 and early 2020 a series of urgent intelligence reports (12) warning about the impending Coronavirus crisis.

There is no excuse for what amounts to not only reckless incompetence but criminal negligence of the highest order. Pelosi  has another much stronger case for impeachment of this president now than she had before."
2020-04-29 23:25,Regardless of the good or bad results of this drug it is delusional to think that it was “discovered” because of Trump. To think that serious intelligent scientists will wait for Trump to tell them when to investigate what is something that only a Rush listener can believe. Besides they already had trials in other – Trump-less – countries also.
2020-04-29 23:41,Very perplexing to see the raise in the market irrespective of all the bad economic data. I don’t get it.
2020-04-29 23:46,"I get it now. In order to make the American Remdesivir data look better, it's necessary to dismiss the Chinese (Wuhan 10 hospitals) study published in The Lancet.  

I've read the Chinese study in detail now.  It's quite wrong to ignore it. In fact, the results actually SUPPORT the findings of the American researchers. Remdesivir DOES appear to do something.

The Wuhan trial recruited 237 patients, 158 received intravenous remdesivir, 79 placebo. Due to the cessation of the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan, the target recruitment number of 453 was not reached. Yet, even with 158 patients getting remdesivir, no significant benefit could be shown. How is that? Because the observed benefit was VERY SMALL - you'd need huge numbers patients to confirm it statistically. There was NO 'game change' - despite using remdesivir in more than one hundred and fifty cases. No big reduction in deaths.

There are two novel features about this China trial. Firstly, the patients recruited were less sick than usual in similar trials and secondly, some patients got given remdesivir early - within 10 days of falling ill. Whilst there was no difference in overall mortality (14% vs 13% placebo) length of ventilation and overall recovery time there was slightly lower mortality (11% vs 14%), ventilator time and recovery time (18 days vs 23 days) in the early treatment group.

Both Chinese and US studies show redesivir does something. But, not very much."
2020-04-29 23:48,"Ever notice the jump in market coincides with hopeful messages from the administration? 
UP over 500 points today. Optimism over a new drug? Hmmm...

How many people unemployed? 
Something is amiss.  You have to assume it is until someone can prove that it isn't."
2020-04-29 23:53,"I’m surprised Fauci touted early positive outcomes of an unpublished Remdesivir trial funded by the NIAID on the same day a peer reviewed controlled trial is published in The Lancet, an excellent medical journal, showing no benefit. In fact, they had to take patients off the drug because of adverse side effects. 

Let’s say at the very least, the benefit is not certain at this point. We need to wait for further data."
2020-04-29 23:36,"Why are Florida officials telling the Medical Examiners to withhold Coronavirus death numbers for the past 9 days?
Something smells here and surprise surprise the Florida Governor is planning to reopen the state. 
I hope they are not fudging the numbers. You are doing the people of Florida and the health experts (Drs. Fauci and Birx) a terrible disservice!"

2020-04-29 23:43,"There is a real danger people will see hope  and become optimistic too soon to destroy Trump’s election chances.  Stay on your mission to use negative adjectives in headlines as much as possible.   The Biden campaign, with whom you consult, depends on you.  And no more Tara Reade stories, no matter how much new evidence comes forward. You have investigated, she is a liar.  End of story."

2020-04-29 23:55,"This is all boiling down to common sense, scientifically based facts, versus fantasy statements from a mentally impaired idiot as president, and a staff of morons and yes men that are terrified to question the idiot in charge, 

You decide.  Your life depends on what you decide to do.

Science or stupid.

Time to decide."
2020-04-30 0:06,"It is now 20 days since Fauci announced that the US death toll from coronavirus would be 60,000 by early August. Today is April 29 and we have reached that number. The true figure is probably higher since I keep hearing about bodies being found in their apartments in NYC and other hot spots. 

I am sure that Fauci used to be a man integrity but nobody with integrity survives in the Trump administration. Fauci is obviously under pressure to offer overtly optimistic assessments because Trump thinks that he can talk his way out of this crisis. The problem is that we cannot afford such assessments. This is the real deal. An illness that might take weeks to leave the body with a case fatality rate in many densely populated areas exceeding 10%. This is not the flu. Admitting the problem is the only way to a good plan for recovery. 

Lastly, I really do not understand Trump's strategy here. He seems to think that only the economy can spur him to victory. If there is a second wave with more fatalities, however, the economy will sink like a stone and there is no chance that he will be re-elected. Not that I want him to be re-elected but I'm just pointing out that there is no point of view from which his behavior makes sense."
2020-04-29 23:58,"So your telling me there's a chance, isn't that from a Jim Carrey movie? It's Remdesivir today. Its impossible for Trump to generate hope because many see him as completely dishonest. A new President is a realistic dream."
2020-04-29 23:58,I have yet to see a data-driven model for how they determine to  initiate a shutdown. We have this Imperial College paper and a lot of extrapolation. Can officials shutdown the world any time? What are the criteria? No one knows. it's based on 'feel'

2020-04-30 0:11,"In regards to the promising results for the drug remdesivir , it must be noted that the results while promising have been a mixed bag. It appears that the earlier the drug is administered, the better the results. However, as is pointed out that a rush to bring this drug to market (""Operation Light Speed"") could have catastrophic results because of the lack of widespread peer review and testing.  Initially, it should be used only in critical cases while the FDA continues its review process.

My fear is that Trump will try to steamroll any objections in hopes of saving himself in November regardless of the risks. Actually, I am a bit surprised that Dr. Fauci made the announcement given the Trump dynamic. And, coming from Fauci, it gives Trump more cover than had he made the announcement though its possible he was pressuring Fauci to do so. 

We are all certainly hopeful that this is a first step for treatment of the virus with more breakthroughs to come."
2020-04-30 0:17,"as much as i trust dr. fauci, his optimism may be a bit misleading. this drug is not a cure nor is it the badly needed preventative vaccine. in a short clinical trial, all it showed was a lessening of symptoms and a reduced hospital stay, great news for sure, but not the silver bullet we need. trumps' headlong rush into a vaccine is likely as dangerous as this virus itself."
2020-04-30 0:17,"The destructive effects of the shutdown orders appear to have been justified by a false hope that a vaccine for Covid 19 could be developed quickly. How many time have we heard that a vaccine is only 18 months away? The lessons learned from the long 30 year search for a vaccine for  HIV should have guided our political leaders' flawed decision making. But, experts knew the development of a vaccine takes 10 to 20 years, so the question remains. Why did our governments decide to damage our shared economy by forcing many businesses to close? Why are people still being told to stay in the homes when there is well established evidence that time outside is healthier? Why did politicians make such radical decisions without researching the facts? And why are so many promoting continued lockdowns based on a false promise of a vaccine in a short time? Do they really believe our society can wait 18 months for a vaccine? What will happen to our society and our economy if unemployment continues to rise and drives a diaspora of despair across the country? Who will be the winners?"

My guess is that tax payers are on the hook for well over $100,000 PER PATIENT in transport costs, fuel, salaries, pier fees, personnel travel reimbursement, supplies, etc. If this is not an example of gross government overspending and poor judgement, I don’t know what is.

2020-04-30 0:45,"The timeline of Donald's appalling incompetence and his stupidity (as demonstrated by his disinfectant comments); is very important to remember and not be distracted from:
Trump announced the failed China ban on January 21st to take effect at the start of February.
He made the virus-is- a- Democrat- hoax comment at a crowded rally on February 28th, a month after he made his much touted China ban announcement. It begs some questions
- if he knew enough to make the China ban over 5 weeks earlier due to a perceived threat, why was he holding a crowded rally later: when he called called Democrat warnings their latest hoax over 5 weeks later?
If he was so onto it why did he make the ""down-to- almost- zero -soon"" comment  on the 26 Feb, over a month later?
So he announced the ban on January 21. Over a month later he said it would soon be zero cases.
Therefore if he knew enough to make a rather porous China ban on 21st of January, he should not boast of it, since it admits he had plenty of time to do something about it.
It is about has logical as asking Dr Birx to research injecting disinfectant. That underlined his foolishness in that it was not only unscientific, but also politically asinine.
His negligence is palpable, on the record, grievous and undeniable
His undermining the postal service is a clear indicator that he will obstruct postal voting at a time Dr Fauci says there is likely to be resurgence of the virus  - IMHO."

Surprisingly, well before the national election, Covid-19 has emerged as an unexpected opportunity for Florida to manipulate results, not of votes but by providing a dishonest count of the dead. Uniquely, given the world-wide attention focused on the pandemic, our governor has been forced to publicaly direct our medical examiner's to withhold the count of daily fatalities in each county.

2020-04-30 1:00,"For most of Americans, they live in a world of COVID every year, with 40,000 dying yearly of treatable diseases due to inability to afford health insurance and healthcare.  They also don’t own stocks.  This is and will continue to be their world before, during, and after COVID."
2020-04-30 1:01,"Meat rationing would be far better than endangering  workers. We did it in WWII. All sacrificed to support front line warriors. The war is here. We have to protect our front line workers. Rationing and management of scarce  commodities is one way to do that. Why would the president refuse to invoke powers for PPE and tests, and do this for “hamberger”? I don’t get it. 
I can’t even buy a thermometer! Who is running this chaotic response? Could it be that NOONE is?"

2020-04-30 0:58,"One fact without a doubt is Trump lied and Americans died, whatever his son-in-law or any Republican politician is trying to say to change that fact.

The next fact is Trump and the GOP are in panic mode because they know the majority of Americans know the above fact. The election is less than 5 months away with Biden pulling ahead.

November 3rd cannot come soon enough."
2020-04-30 0:59,"When one is brought up to believe in ones government, in ones way of life, what does one do when all that is destroyed by a usurper, a plant from a foreign power, an egotistical maniac bent on his own agenda?

Trust in the historical ways of the country?  Hope that reason and common sense prevails?

These are troubled times indeed.  A way of life is threatened.  A world wide pandemic makes things even worse.

Give in or resist.  Decide quickly.  Your life depends on it."
2020-04-30 1:01,"It is about time that families who have a loved one die from the covid 19 virus to start suing the Trump government and especially Trump himself who has been responsible for an extremely delayed action to the virus, to his ￼destruction and firing of the team that has been researching futures possible virus attacks, his refusal to speed up delivery of urgently needed hospital equipment, for his favoritism sending equipment only to states who blindly support his incompetence and non action, supporting states who have voted for him with financial incentives and help.
For refusing ￼the one thing most people important for each President to represent and support all citizens of this country.
For massive financial support to Corporations who have donated to have s campaign.
For complete neglect to the laws of the land as written in the Constitution to equally represent and support all states and all citizens in the exact same manner.
This President, through his many failures and revengeful way of political response benefiting him personally, has endangered and is responsible for the lives of many Americans and deserves to be sanctioned and prosecuted for all of the above."
2020-04-30 1:02,"Given the Times article on how Fauci sold his soul to support Trump’s dangerous lies, I can’t believe anyone could give credence to his support of anything. It is extremely hard to regain trust. Countries that have done well have given support to science. We have failed on so many levels that I weep. Every death is a story."

2020-04-30 1:11,"It appears that Dr. Fauci has gone to the dark side. A sad ending to an illustrious career. Fauci touted Remdesivir after a peer reviewed controlled trial is published in The Lancet, an excellent medical journal, showing no benefit. In fact, they had to take patients off the drug because of adverse side effects. According to The Lancet, ""No specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."" <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com"" target=""_blank"">https://www.thelancet.com</a>/…/PIIS0140-6736(20)31022…/fulltext

And it appears the Stock Market also known as The Casino jumped 500 points because Fauci made this ridiculous announcement that has no relation to reality. What a tragedy for the American people. We are merely a commodity. We ARE the economy. They need us out there buying stuff and spending money. Take malaria medication that give you a heart attack! Inject bleach! Snort Comet! Stick a UV light stick up your bum! Now get back out there and spend your money! Billionaires need you!"

Myths about “success stories” are the last thing we need to hear right now from a slum lord tasked with public health responsibilities he knows nothing about."

2020-04-30 1:32,It's really interesting to see just how easy it is to manipulate the stock market.
2020-04-30 1:33,"The rush to declare Covid 19's defeat is pure fantasy. Science doesn’t support it. Trump is desperately trying to foist a deadly Jedi mind trick onto the American people. Do we really need to be used as canon fodder for Trump's re-election campaign? The ill-advised and illusionary rush to “normal"" will cause Covid 19 infections to spike in about 14 days. The rush to remove social distancing guidelines to encourage people to behave ""normally"" and spend ""normally"" is going to cause people to die. We don’t have a cure yet. Covid 19, the single most contagious virus on Earth, is still with us. It's still here. That's reality."
2020-04-30 1:26,"Instead of telling people to wait until they are gasping for air to seek medical attention the paradigm needs to change.  It is now known that oxygen levels decrease before the body reacts unlike typical oxygen deprivation and the covid 19 pneumonia is considered silent onset again until the body is about to tank.

once gasping most get put on a ventilator which must come with feeding tube, catheter, sedation, induced coma and other critical care procedures.  Every tube is prone to infection, all treatments require constant hands on care , moving unconscious patients is a 2-3 person task, etc.   

Getting patients care before the critical care level needs to be the focus going forward.  People should not be told to go home from EDs or not go to EDs until they are near death.

Add checking oxygen levels at local drug stores would be real easy to implement now.  Since testing is inadequate , turnaround time is too slow and the false negative rates are unacceptably high, not widespread it is crucial to deploy supplemental easy to implement community based symptom assessment.  Oxygen levels stand out as the primary early manifestation.

Early detection of the disease will reduce ICU needed care.  Infection control I.e. PPE will still be needed but the patient will be able to participate in care reducing the burden on nurses, CNAs and other medical support personnel.

The pandemic attack is multipronged.  Each requires its own strategy.  Saving the sick needs early detection now."
2020-04-30 1:26,"It is so absurb to refer to the Stock Market as if it were monolithic. 

The buys and sells are driven by computers, algorithms, gamblers, and those would buy into a panic or short this or that.

It is futile to try to interpret what makes the NYSE go up, down, or end neutral on a given day."
2020-04-30 1:30,"As a clinician, I am horrified that the administration has the audacity to call the pandemic in this country a ""success story"" as Jared Kushner expressed. Every day I believe that there is no way that the administration could go even lower and demonstrate a lack of compassion for my neighbors and patients. Somehow that is challenged every day and as my colleagues continue pronouncing these very same neighbors dead from this disease that Trump ignored for months, I lament the world my patients have to live in."
2020-04-30 1:34,"Dr. Fauci, whose conservative scientific medically fact based approach is borne by decades of experience and peer reviewed evaluations, was surprisingly, but cautiously, positive about the evidence gleaned from  the recent remdesivr study."
2020-04-30 1:38,"My question and the question from many Americans: will remdesivir be an affordable treatment, if and when it is deemed safe and effective? Any other COVID-19 treatment/vaccine should be scrupulously monitored for market manipulation."
2020-04-30 1:38,"Many years ago when serving as the medical director of a company developing diagnostics to provide improve improved therapy to certain cancer patients I realized that the science was suspect and the company was selling hope rather than any therapeutic advantages to the physicians who ordered the testing. Shortly after leaving the company it reorganized and then stopped testing. The moral of the story is that no matter how valuable hope might be, science has to triumph over emotions to make progress in medicine. Empty promises won’t solve the problems - either medical or economic - of the pandemic. Politicians who for decades have belittled, questioned, and underfunded medical research have contributed much to our current problems and have created doubt in the minds of people who trade in conspiracy theories. The COVID-19 problems will be solved by scientists, epidemiologists, economists, and politicians working in teams (not presidential task forces) and dealing rationally by testing hypotheses that can be subjected to rigorous methodical research accompanied by competent data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The high priests of punditry need to be ignored in favor of thoughtful and capable people who devote their lives to solving complex and complicated medical and scientific problems."
2020-04-30 1:38,"Trump comments he wants to get out and about and Kushner praises the virtuous and great work of the administration in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Never a word to acknowledge the suffering of millions who also can't get out, the thousands who have lost their jobs, the grieving families, the tireless and traumatic trials of the healthcare workers. And a vice president who arrogantly refuses to wear a mask while he unctuously parades the good will of an administration that has failed to provide basic protective equipment and life-saving medical supplies to hospitals in time of dire need. Enough of these self-adulating hypocrites and their lies - let Pence walk the halls of any one of a number of NYC's hospitals and see how he can ""look in the eye's"" of the staff and patients who look like characters in  Dostoevsky's darkest novels. No Mr. Kushner you hardly have any reason to bask in the glory of your ignominious  actions and accomplishments - they are hardly worthy of positive comment. Praise and respect is earned and this administration is deserving of neither."

2020-04-30 1:54,This interview with Kushner was the first time I have heard him speak. He did not disappoint. Incompetent nepotism on display. Trump’s desire for loyalty over ability for the appointed jobs going to incompetents like Kushner is in full flower.
2020-04-30 1:59,China needs to start making reparations payments and if they refuse then maybe it's time for our military to get off their rears and actually do something for once.
2020-04-30 1:42,"The US has all the resources needed to be an industrial powerhouse, at this moment. Its factories designed for building something else could modify to produce masks, visors, gowns, prefabricated hospital wards and ... components of equipment for testing.

America has indeed become 'Great'. Its 1,064,194 identified cases are 33% of the world's 3,219,242.  Its population of 318,816,000 is some 4% of the world's 7,263,838,000. 

33% to 4% seems somewhat disproportionate.

That's embarrassing to a politician whose main focus is upon claiming the US to be superior in all things -- but not that one!  

The fewer the tests performed, the fewer the quantity of cases recorded. Such a politician would want to see as few test performed as possible. 

That can be achieved by making them unavailable.

Of course, all those funny numbers and percents and stuff are just fake, fake news and words like 'unavailable' have over two sill... syll... are silly for being too long."
2020-04-30 1:47,"Demand, Supply and Cost of Remdesivir

Demand:

US current infected        1, 000, 000

US daily increase, latest (4/28/)  23.400

Supply:  

By the beginning of April, Gilead already stockpiled enough to treat 140,000 patients, each over the course of 10 days. The company plans to produce enough remdesivir to treat 500,000 patients by October and a million patients by the end of 2020.

                                          Source  Ars Technica 4/29

Demand will outstrip supply for the foreseeable future

Cost

A recent study published in the Journal of Virus Eradication tried to analyze the cost of manufacturing remdesivir. The authors looked at the chemical synthesis of the drug and concluded that a 10-day course for one person would cost $9, allowing for 20 percent losses during formulation, plus the cost of the vials, a profit margin, and tax.

2020-04-30 1:58,"It's like a whack a mole game.  On the one hand, the Trump group is bubbling with optimism.  A great American story, we hear.   Trump is trying to take credit for this yet unproven drug.    Football in the Fall, barbecue again.  On the other hand, the NY Times counters every Trumpy enthusiasm with a reminder that it's all too early, (yes, but) to be enthusiastic.  Actually, in this case, the Times' caution is correct and proper but like whack a mole, it has no effect on the enthusiastic revelers.  By shouting success, Trump deflects (again) from his responsibility in being a terrible leader in the corona virus fight and gives the Federal government credit although he's trying to disembowel it.  What a time to be deceiving as  thousands are sick or have died.  But Trump is good at deflecting and deceiving and his audience is usually receptive to being misled.  His strategy, cynical, may help him."
2020-04-30 1:58,"So now, a semi-tested anti-viral powder that may reduce intensity of symptoms and some deaths is announced. Upon this news the entire economic future of the world's richest country has tottered and balanced for the past 12 hours. Instead of the projected 20 million deaths in 12 months, a prediction of 16 million has been made. Cries of Eureka echoed well into Eurasia, and up and down the canyons of Wall Street. A gilded carriage was seen  departing the Royal Palace and the King and Princes went to dedicate a 19th hole on a Florida golf course in honor of National Day of Salvation. 
Later, the Family announced the commission of a theme park at Orlando, tentatively called Rem-Desire. Plans for a national holiday will be released,but not until bins of corpses in the cities have been removed from traffic arteries and from tenement lobbies, and shipped to rural disposal centers owned by the Family.

They have set a new standard for sleaziness in Washington and now their dishonesty and carelessness has resulted in millions of people being out of work and in thousands of  deaths  that could’ve been prevented. 
Their lies and “spin “ are now wearing painfully thin with Americans. In the middle of their deception, manipulation, and subterfuge the Trump imbeciles should realize that they have blood on their hands ; they are responsible in advertently for the death of over 60,000 Americans.Trump not acting quickly enough has cost millions of Americans their jobs, and ruined lives permanently .Added to this blunder is his insane and delusional advice with recommendations that he has issued at every one of his relentlessly stupid press briefings.  If he is so convinced about how to treat Coronavirus patients, maybe he should take his own advice and ingest the Lysol he was suggesting that millions of Americans take to combat the virus. 
 When this is all over and the bodies are counted in totals approaching a quarter of a million, there will be 250 million more people wanting to tear Donald Trump and his band of morons to pieces ."

Including China's Xi Jinping and his Chinese communist medical experts. All they know is lock down and lock down. People can't go out. No one know exactly how many lives disappeared in the Wuhan virus pandemic. Everyone is guessing including our intelligence agencies. I just stay home all the time since I have difficulty to walk because of my age. But I am already tired of watching all kinds of briefings.I just read the captions of this report and no interests to read the entire  article. Now I am watching old funny movies such as the Three Stooges and Doris Day's musicals. Sorry that she also passed away recently.

Some of us tenants perceive that a dimly understood kingdom of High Finance with all its mountebanks and shell-game financial instruments controls all the marionette wires goading Earth to eradicate us.

2020-04-30 2:13,"In Dr. Fauci, Trump has now found a willing cheerleader who will help ignite enthusiasm about this yet mostly unproven drug, enthusiasm that will deflect from Trump's abysmal handling of the corona virus catastrophe.  It's unlikely that Fauci could keep his job if he, like a good clinician, strongly tempered Trump's child-like excitement with sober caution.  Yet, Fauci did the opposite stating that we now have a new approach to treating corona patients. Really? It's terribly premature to make such a statement, especially given Fauci's position as head of a crucial federal agency whose responsibility is to be credible.  So, again, Trump destroys something good about those who choose to connect with him.  Fauci is the latest example."

Pushing yet another drug, not licensed or approved globally for use due to inconclusive data on efficiency  against other coronaviruses (SARS & Ebola) and limited data on COVID-19 (low power & not peer reviewed).

The White House’s doesn’t answer my calls. I’m sure my senators and representative are trying to figure out how to get me on their do not call list.

2020-04-30 2:40,"If a person dies from a heart attack consequent to COVID-19, some places will record the cause as COVID-19 and some as a heart attack. While true with foreign stats, it's also true here.

Statistics for confirmed cases of COVID-19 are highly dependent on the very varying numbers of tests in different states and communities. Consequently, one would think the most relevant statistic available for comparison purposes would be the deaths per number of residents. However, if you look at the state by state comparisons, some seem to make no sense, inasmuch as states with significant numbers of cases and/or deaths have very different fatality rates.

Different states and different localities use different criteria for attributing cause of death. I expect politics as much as medical protocols play a significant role. Responsibility, accountability, and image undoubtedly are factored in to states' reporting of deaths. Is it coincidence that, even pulling out the sparsely populated high plans and mountain states, you still pretty much see the states with Democratic governors reporting higher death rates than states with Republican governors?

For instance, Florida with 1088 deaths has a fatality rate of 5/100,00 while Louisiana with 1740 deaths has a fatality rate of 37/100,000. Texas with 666 deaths reports a fatality rate of 2/100,000 while Connecticut with 2012 deaths has a fatality rate of 56/100,000. These differences cannot simply be attributed to a difference in medical care."

Now FDA has approved remdesivir as a more effective drug. Hope liberal media won't attack. But by this time many might have died  who refused to take it as suggested by Trump and they won't get a second chance. Thus liberal media harmed people.

 The Trump administration’s inadequate and incompetent response to the Covid-19 pandemic has been detailed sufficiently in the NYT and elsewhere that claims to the contrary should be immediately and forcefully rebuked at every instance.

By now, Trump must surely be the most documented liar – by media and independent fact-checkers – in American political history.

The success of the U.S. government's response to Ebola created a model for how to be prepared and respond to the warnings of a potential pandemic that were provided in the daily intelligence briefs, long before the White House announced that it was stopping visits from China but for the American citizens who were entering the country from China and Europe there was no routine testing of those who did enter.  

As a further example of WH incompetence was John Bolton's disbandment of the special group of pandemic trackers attached to the National Security Council. It has not been reported whether or not he briefed the President on this action or why he decided that this group was not required.  

There is no question that our old group of virus hunters that were deployed around the world to detect the next epidemic so that a vaccine could be ready clearly dropped the ball and it has not been clarified in the press the level of interaction with the virologist in China that first detected the novel C-19 virus.

The President and WH did a poor job.

2020-04-30 4:43,"If a person dies from a heart attack consequent to COVID-19, some places will record the cause as COVID-19 and some as a heart attack. While true with foreign stats, it's also true here.

Statistics for confirmed cases of COVID-19 are highly dependent on the very varying numbers of tests in different states and communities. Consequently, one would think the most relevant statistic available for comparison purposes would be the deaths per number of residents. However, if you look at the state by state comparisons, some seem to make no sense, inasmuch as states with significant numbers of cases and/or deaths have very different fatality rates.

Different states and different localities use different criteria for attributing cause of death. I expect politics as much as medical protocols play a significant role. Responsibility, accountability, and image undoubtedly are factored in to states' reporting of deaths. Is it coincidence that, even pulling out the sparsely populated high plans and mountain states, you still pretty much see the states with Democratic governors reporting higher death rates than states with Republican governors?

For instance, Florida with 1088 deaths has a fatality rate of 5/100,00 while Louisiana with 1740 deaths has a fatality rate of 37/100,000. Texas with 666 deaths reports a fatality rate of 2/100,000 while Connecticut with 2012 deaths has a fatality rate of 56/100,000. These differences cannot simply be attributed to a difference in medical care."
2020-04-30 4:50,"Several of us in my university have read the original research articles on the remdesivir clinical trials. We are deeply concerned at the hype-filled reporting of this drug in multiple media, which often verges on grossly irresponsible and even yellow journalism. Yes there are some potential modest positive effects for the drug (and even Gilead's own positive data have been underwhelming) but that's about it. One of my colleagues and good friends has tested positive for COVID-19 and I'm desperate myself for good news but reporting on remdesivir has been misleading. Here is what we know from the published data:
- Remdesivir does virtually nothing to reduce morbidity and mortality when administered at any point in the infection.
- The drug has no effect on people with advanced infection (Lancet study, not in itself surprising).
- Remdesivir may have some positive effect in reducing length of hospital stay if given early, like Tamiflu, however
- The study suggesting this lacks a solid control arm and was not blinded, indicating that physicians giving remdesivir also gave special, more aggressive and intensive treatment in general to the remdesivir group.
- Remdesivir damages kidneys in many patients.

On balance it looks like remdesivir does have some modest positive effect in a specific sub-set of patients, but this needs to be weighed against the adverse effects. It also didn't work well against its original viral target (Ebola) so it's not clear what it's even doing here."

Even devoid of emotional intelligence and empathy, as he is, Trump, cynically, could have used the crisis to his advantage.

2020-04-30 9:17,"As the definition of a COVID-19 death expands to absurdity (even to the point of including people with no tested evidence of infection just because the symptoms are similar to influenza) the number of deaths has been inflated beyond the point of reality. Most deaths from COVID -19 are people who die with COVID-19, not from it. An individual 100 years old does not die from COVID-19, the person dies because they are 100- and may have a fatal outcome from catching a cold.
  After weeks of lockdown the number of new cases is still over 23,000 cases per day- and has been at that level since March 30.
The shutdown has done nothing to alter that - and what we are seeing is a plateau- no flattening of the curve. This is the same result that we would have had if we had done nothing more than social distancing- or even perhaps nothing.
The media should be asking hard questions- not following the pronouncements of “experts” who have been spectacularly wrong on virtually every aspect of this outbreak."
2020-04-30 8:27,"The arrogance of Kushner claiming a ""great success story"" for the Trump administration's bungled response to this epidemic is infuriating and emblematic of the narcissism and incompetence that defines Trump and his enablers' warped view of reality. 
Until the testing fiasco is fixed, we have no safe way to contain the virus or safely ""reopen"" the economy. Yet, Trump blames the states. 
While we all yearn for some positive news, we need factual, science-based good news, not Trump's delusional predictions. 
Rushing a vaccine that could result in harm or deaths is no solution. His ""Warp speed"" vaccine program is not about helping people in need but his obsession with himself, his poll numbers and reelection. 
I'm glad the experimental drug seems promising but this is no magic bullet. 
We need testing. 
We need SAFE, properly vetted vaccines.

2020-04-30 7:34,"Care homes are exceptionally vulnerable in this pandemic, and it is quite expensive to seal them off. In this context for profit care homes are not the best solution for a wealthy society. It is proving impossible for the US society as a whole to protect these facilities and prioritize resources.

Even in Denmark, where elderly care homes are publicly owned and managed, and attempted sealed 8 weeks ago, we have recorded about 1/3 of our rather low Corona casualties from elderly care home citizens.

Under a pandemic honesty and real knowledge are vital for a rational response. Politicizing casualties will only make matters worse.

The US authorities do record deaths, and now also publish estimates of surplus deaths, state by state. The numbers are apparently delayed for many weeks, but eventually gives a picture of the excess toll:

Deaths from Covid-19 is rather late in the pandemic spread. An average of 3-4 weeks from contamination to death is likely.

Looking at the numbers in the above link it seems the pandemic started to spread for real about 10 weeks ago in mid February, where US testing was almost non-existing. Even in New York City the excess death toll wasn't noticeable until the week ending March 21st.

But look at West Virginia! Already March 7th the excess deaths were noticeable, and since they have exploded. But still the official Covid-19 casualties in the state are only about 45?"
2020-04-30 8:30,"One simply cannot quote George Packer’s acute profile of Kushner in The Atlantic enough:

“Kushner quickly gained power in an administration that raised amateurism, nepotism, and corruption to governing principles. ... since he became an influential adviser to Trump on the coronavirus pandemic, the result has been mass death.

In his first week on the job, in mid-March, Kushner co-authored the worst Oval Office speech in memory, interrupted the vital work of other officials, may have compromised security protocols, flirted with conflicts of interest and violations of federal law, and made fatuous promises that quickly turned to dust. “The federal government is not designed to solve all our problems,” he said, explaining how he would tap his corporate connections to create drive-through testing sites. They never materialized. He was convinced by corporate leaders that Trump should not use presidential authority to compel industries to manufacture ventilators—then Kushner’s own attempt to negotiate a deal with General Motors fell through. With no loss of faith in himself, he blamed shortages of necessary equipment and gear on incompetent state governors.

To watch this pale, slim-suited dilettante breeze into the middle of a deadly crisis, dispensing business-school jargon to cloud the massive failure of his father-in-law’s administration, is to see the collapse of a whole approach to governing.”"

In research reported on Wednesday in The Lancet, a trial in China of 237 critically ill patients found that Remdesivir worked no better than a placebo.
Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral, was developed more than a decade ago to cure an unknown 'Disease X' and is currently being trialled on patients in the NHS.
It was hoped that it would stop the virus replicating and aid countries in lifting lockdowns, but the first published results showed no benefit.
""Unfortunately, our trial found that, while safe and adequately tolerated, Remdesivir did not provide significant benefits over placebo,"" said Professor Bin Cao, from China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University in China, who led the research."

2020-04-30 10:18,"Unfortunately for Dr. Fauci, he is in an untenable position.  He must provide accurate empirical evidence, not parrot flights of fanciful aspiration. Trump postures his 6'2"".5  portliness threateningly close to Fauci's diminutive frame while Dr. Fauci responds to press queries; noticeably circumspect, or perhaps even frightened by having this creature loom over him.  We don't need a redux of him stalking Hillary Clinton. We know he's a bully. A perfect bully.

Comparing Remdesivir, which Gilead formulated years ago does not stop COVID-19 from replicating. Fauci is using a pathetic and false equivalent by saying that GS480 (Remdesivir) is an exciting possibility for COVID-19 sufferers.  Doubtful he hasn't read the reams of data on this drug, which presently cannot be administered orally. It requires IV administration and must be done in a hospital setting. So Fauci knows better.  

It is disappointing at best that Fauci would spout these premature and incomplete trial results because the President demands a ""cure"".  Viruses don't respond to threats or demands.  This concept although linear, is far beyond Trump's intellectual capacity.  GS480 mitigates scant symptoms of severely ill patients and to liken it to AZT is a grossly false equivalent.  It is NOT a ""very significant and hopeful"" medication.  False hope disappoints and kills. Just like the perfect occupant of the oval office."

This is a complete self-centered selfish man who is incapable of taking responsibility and when he does he has failed.

But all you read in the comments is a Trump hate-fest. Ditto the good ness about Remdesivir. It is being clinically tested in several countries, including China and Israel (those are the ones I know of) and the results are positive, though it’s not a cure-all. But the comments? Screeds about Big Pharma. Well, if you prefer to rely on essential oils or some other “alternative medicine” rubbish, you are welcome.

Anyone who ever thought Trump was a halfway decent businessman has been shown that that's surely not true.

The United States has a plethora of great managers, directors and executives who are fully capable of developing and implementing a plan to slow down and stem this epidemic.  Except none of them seem to be working in this incredibly inept administration.

 I was so in hopes that your correspondent would explain the truth about the fracking process -and the great quantities of extremely toxic and radioactive chemicals that are injected into the ground that permanently pollute land, life and the surrounding water - and not only around the drill sites, but also along the maze of pipelines that were allowed to be built all over our country. Instead, only water and sand (which were initially used) is mentioned.  The government has protected, subsidized and allowed self-regulation of this industry, even allowing it not to reveal the toxic chemicals being used and the wastes being injected, leaking into rivers etc. and the vast planetary destruction it continues to cause.
I suggest you present an episode/interview with Bill McKibben, a world respected author and environmentalist  and Professor Anthony Ingraffea from Cornell, who could give a true picture of the other side. Also perhaps interview some citizens from fracked gas ghost towns in PA. This would be - and I would argue - a compelling and important side of this story.

2020-05-01 18:50,"In 1974 when we had the first oil embargo and shortage of gasoline nation wide, I was so hoping that this would have been the catalyst to cure us of consuming oil as our main source of fuel (after electricity) and we would finally look forward to wind and/or solar power.  But no, another embargo again in 1979 because we were still stuck on oil.  Then some auto manufactures made an anemic attempt at making electric cars, but insiders knew it was just window dressing; never meant to really develop.  We kept on finding ways to satisfy our glutinous demand for the black syrup.  
We've had numerous opportunities to rid ourselves of this planet killing addiction, but we can't say no to ""big oil"" itself even  when a major oil refiner does research on how the world climate is suffering from it and then conveniently buries it.

However, I think the numbers are different. The US figure is the decline from the previous quarter and then annualized. This assumes 4 consecutive quarters of decline at the same rate. So the US decline was something like 1.2%. The EU figure was simply the decline versus the prior quarter. So the 3.8% figure should be compared to 1.2%.

It seems like people go there to eat and socialize (I go there when I need something and think I can maybe avoid getting something shipped to me in a one-off box, maybe directly instead of indirectly from a foreign country). These are JOBS, so it is actually important that malls reopen. But the idea that people with a brain and a minimum understanding of the capability for virus spread will go to a mall (or a restaurant or a concert or a sporting event) without expansive testing is brain dead from the start.  For evidence of the fact that most people have a brain and minimum understanding of virus spread, just check out the amazingly beautiful and at the same time chilling photos NYT has been showing of Ramadan during the pandemic.

Shops need to display clear mandatory rules – Mask and Gloves a MUST.  this can only serve to encourage customers NOT discourage them from shopping in their store.  Customers should not have to police other customers.  

Simon Properties must make it mandatory – stores in their malls can reopen ONLY on the condition Mask and Gloves are made mandatory for entry until the health bulletins tell us a different story about the spread. Why does this policy seem so frightening to business?

Michigan City's population is something like 31,000. Hoards of people from nearby Illinois are the crowds that frequent this large outlet mall.  What they are doing is bringing into a relatively small community customers from the hot spot of Chicago.

For those of you that tout buying everything online, note that will be the death of our communities.  Retail stores provide jobs for our citizens - you can argue the wage rates as a separate issue, but the jobs are still there.  The construction and maintenance of brick-and-mortar stores also employs many.

More important, internet sales starve our local governments, who are by the large dependent on sales taxes.  Sure, some states (not all) have passed laws requiring payment of STATE sales tax, but mostly overlook the local sales taxes.  Amazon et al argue that it is too complicated to keep up with the sales taxes in effect at the delivery point.  Huh?  If they can track every click you make while surfing the web, they can know what the local sales taxes are.  

So if you want your community to die off, shop on the web.  If you want your roads and streets maintained, police protection, fire protection, etc., keep your money at home and shop local.  That includes shopping malls, whether you go regularly or not.  At least the stores there will pay their taxes.

They will be unable to encourage safe distancing. The weekend they closed the malls, my mall was slammed with customers everywhere. It was terrifying. The bathrooms are small and even with taping off sinks and stalls there is no way to stay six feet apart while in them. This is a poor attempt to keep people safe, and filled with lack of responsibility on Simons part. The security guards are useless when it comes to maintaining order and many of them are in the high risk category by age. Until there are more tests and safety measures there is no way malls will be safe. However, believe that the malls will get crowded with people tired of being home, and needed a distraction. This is the typical mall shopper behavior. For many it is a family outing, a place for teenagers to hang out, a place to socialize, and reconnect. The malls will be busy. These types of human interactions are too missed by humans for them not to be."

My observation has been that the vast majority of shoppers, any time of the day I go, are not wearing masks and do not stay 6 feet apart.  In my wildest dreams I do not feel that mall shoppers, might be the same people, are going to uniformly follow any guidelines.  Washing hands after every transaction?  How in the world are employees going to have time for that?  And, been there/done that, would fully expect some customers to get annoyed, and tell you so, complain about you being rude, for taking the time to walk to the nearest, not close, sink to accomplish that one.

Simon does not care about the store employees or the shoppers.  They can create a fake plan for rules that won't or can't be enforced to create a false sense of safety but that is all it is, police had to shut down at least one of their malls because they refused to closed after Governor issued stay at home order and ordered non-essential places such as malls to close.  Who would trust them to re-open safely.  Most people who enjoy shopping and have money to do so are currently doing so online from the comfort of their homes.  For the most part, the only people who will go to malls will be people there to walk, let their kids run around, are just there to loiter about.  They won't be spending a lot of money.

American life means freedom and I want to go out, if possible, and shop.

I'm on the border of Kansas and Missouri, in Kansas City, where the virus is present but not common enough for people who need to be ""shown"" a thing to grasp. We've been socially distancing for more than a month and it's been keeping the spread down in middle-class communities. People are letting their guard down. In Prairie Village, KS, a KC suburb of middle-class professionals which you think would do better, in the shops that are open and busy, very few people are taking the precautions to keep others safe.

I would imagine the malls will be the new outing for families. Especially when it’s really hot outside. Nothing there is essential. Nothing there cannot be ordered on-line. But, there is more space to walk or run around. So people may go, but I don’t see the economy improving anytime soon because things are “opening up.” You need paying customers for that. 

This will end up being more work for our healthcare system. More anxiety for those of us who stay home and follow the guidelines. And certainly more death."
2020-04-29 13:44,"I can't find masks, gloves and hand sanitizers for myself and my family.  Where are all these businesses finding masks, gloves and hand sanitizers in the millions for their customers? 

Are they the ones that clean up the supply chain in plans to reopen and left Americans markets with empty shelves?"
2020-04-29 13:48,"The word, 'ENCOURAGE', is used so many times in place of something with genuine 'bite' to it. We encourage safe distancing. We encourage, for people not to shop in groups. Why not try this as an experiment in human behavior: Put up a sign at the entrance to these malls that reads, all electronic anti-theft devices and sensors have been removed from every item in every store. We encourage honest shoppers."
2020-04-29 13:48,I'd basically written off malls before this because spending an entire day walking for miles on hard concrete chasing non-existent deals is really a holdover from the boomer generation. I'd rather spend my day doing literally anything else.
2020-04-29 13:54,"What about the clothing stores?  Are you going to allow the fitting rooms to open?  There are people that can be positive but asymptomatic as well as people that had the virus, and are now negative and both of these groups of people can be shedding the virus. How do you keep your customers safe trying on clothes?  This is dangerous and irresponsible during this time and should be reconsidered immediately."
2020-04-29 13:56,"I live in Indiana, near one of their malls and this is ridiculous: profits over (all of our) health. People who do go will be inclined to downplay virus and with it the warnings, for which there will be no enforcement, thus spreading the virus. Who otherwise would go to one of these places to buy a pair of shoes or the like under these circumstances?"
2020-04-29 14:04,No thanks. It’s time to convert most malls to housing that is more needed now. Those with money are all shopping online and that’s not going to change until good testing and a reliable vaccine is really available.
2020-04-29 14:06,"This Pandemic is the last, Dying gasp for Malls.  Temples of extreme Capitalism, a huge waste of Land, Energy and Resources.  I’ve been to an actual Mall just Twice in the last Decade.  It was NOT enjoyable.
   Good Riddance."
2020-04-29 14:06,"I expect a few plaintiffs attorneys are already preparing their clients lawsuits ... each with especially high punitive damages for any post shopping “experience”.  And, they will surreptitiously taking pictures. Not having temperature testing of each person interning is the fault of the mall owner. Not providing reasonably necessary safety masks at the mall entrances....same!

Don’t forget to keep a dated receipt, shoppers!"
2020-04-29 14:07,"Wow, the takeaway here is simple: We aren't ready; we aren't safe; we don't know what we're doing; and, even though we've thought this through as best we can, we don't give a rip about your safety as much as we care about getting your dollars, and we don't care if we endanger you or our employees in the process.
It'll snow in Florida before I step foot in a mall within the next four months. Or go to the theater. Or eat in a restaurant. 
You can quote me."

2020-04-29 14:17,"Simons actions remind me of George W Bush after 9/11. Go out shopping or the terrorists win, now it’s go out shopping or Coronavirus wins.
Temperature checks are the 2020 version of the TSA excess, just performance art to make people “feel” safe. Someone can have a fever but not be carrying the virus, it’s no doubt prudent a person with a fever not interact with others but it’s not the be all end all.
Same with testing, a positive result helps identify carriers a negative test result is only a snap shot at that point in time, it’s indicative of nothing more."
2020-04-29 14:28,"I worry for the (presumably low-paid) mall employees doing the cleaning, 'temperature checks upon request,' and handing out masks and sanitizing wipe packets upon request. And the mall security employees having to confront shoppers who aren't maintaining proper distance from people. I'd want a hazmat suit for those repeated encounters."
2020-04-29 14:37,"Why are they opening when there is nothing to buy?  China is just now churning out some stuff but Bangladesh and some other countries which make our clothes are in shutdown according to all accounts.  Even so, who needs clothes right now?  The big reason they want to open is because in all probability Trump told the big boys at Simon that if they open, people will start socializing and America will start reopening.  Who cares if the virus continues on its destructive path according to Trump?"
2020-04-29 14:41,Even if it were safe and/or smart to reopen (dubious proposition) who has any discretionary money - at all - to spend? This feels more and more dystopian every day.
2020-04-29 14:42,"Right now, Amazon is doing more to protect their employees than these malls will ever do. I stopped going to them that are throwback to the 1980s twenty years ago. Gee. just when I started shopping on Amazon. And I certainly don't miss the zombie-eyed shoppers."
2020-04-29 14:43,"This mall developer is not saying whether they will enforce lease agreements that tenants must be open during mall hours or be fined.  Companies such as Gap or Macy's, as noted here are not planning on opening, so in addition to having to pay rents that no longer make sense for space they could not use during this crisis, are subject to all sorts of regulations to operate and may be currently fined if they choose to put their employee and customers health first.   I noted while reading through comments, ""malls are dead"", ""shop online"", ""environment impact"", etc. Malls are not ""dead"", they are and should be evolving.  I am sure half the people who say ""malls are dead"" say that as they pull into their local Target or Wal Mart parking lot to shop.  When I was a kid, everyone shopped at the plaza, then came the mall, the life style center, etc where people go to what used to be a cornfield to enjoy the feeling of walking around a downtown when their own downtown is quiet and empty. Outlet Centers are packed with the very same people who say, ""I do not go to Malls"".  MALL.  Costco...MALL or at best Dept store.  And as to the environmental aspect.. how anyone can equate a driver delivering individual packages, burning fuel, resources to get you your cheap new pants as better than going to one place with a selection is beyond me.  Do you want to make environmental change? support public transit and get rid of one or two of your cars."
2020-04-29 14:44,"Maybe people still go to malls in some areas but there were two where I live.   One closed a year or two ago except for 2 anchor stores.  The other has been practically empty every time I go there.  Malls have been dying a slow death for a while now.  Simon can hope to get the restless in for a while, but it won't last, and I wonder how many will go for it anyway."
2020-04-29 14:52,"How are clothing stores going to handle fitting rooms? If a customer tries on a pair of jeans and does not buy them, are they going back on the shelf? What if a customer buys something, takes it home and then wants to return it? Will stores take returns after the item has been out in Coronavirus world? 
Customers generally stand in front of clothing racks and move items one by one to find what they want. Will all those hangers be disinfected right away?
There is more to shopping than standing 6 feet apart and having your temperature checked."
2020-04-29 15:01,"Most of these malls are in the states that will be hottest and most humid this summer. Look for these to be havens for the poor who have no air conditioning, health care or alternative entertainment. Here is where the red states will have their retail economies wrecked."
2020-04-29 15:11,"I last went to a mall 3 or 4 years ago. Don't see any reason to change now. Why park in the back forty and then walk past dozens of  stores with identical merchandise. I know lots of people treat the mall as a social experience but I don't really understand it. Oh well, to each his own."
2020-04-29 15:11,"A lot of malls have closed. In my town they built one late 80s/early 90s which was hopping then even with everything overpriced. For the last 10 years or more it’s been a ghost town. Finally, the town has decided to tear it down."
2020-04-29 15:13,"Because government at all levels has failed to keep our trust with their response to this pandemic, many of us have decided that it falls upon us to keep ourselves and those we love safe, and reduce the spread in our communities. The only feasible way to do this is to stay home as we are now until a reliable vaccine is widely and freely available. A vaccine that has not been rushed, nor were shortcuts taken in the hurry to develop it.  So these malls can open; we’re not going now and probably not for a couple of years. What is the deal that people are so desperate to buy more stuff, shove food in their faces at a restaurant that they’re willing to risk so much?"
2020-04-29 15:18,It looks like Simon property should be in charge of opening our country instead of the Trump administration. I wish we witnessed this well of a thought out plan from our president.
2020-04-29 15:20,"Frankly, I will be very surprised to see malls survive outside major US cities after this pandemic passes. I certainly enjoy walking about a physical space and shopping, but I haven't done it in years. Online is simply faster."
2020-04-29 15:23,"I can’t fathom why an intelligent person during this pandemic, no matter how long it lasts, would want to go to a mall or any store and try on clothing or touch items that have been worn or touched by others."

2020-04-29 15:27,"I haven't been to a shopping mall in years. As the internet grew, retail stores gave up long ago about providing a satisfying in store experience from reduced staff and reduced merchandise.
Why bother? People would just go online to find their size or color or better price.
I mean, if they want to take a stab a getting the customers back okay. I don't see people flocking to a mall for a poor shopping experience combined with a virus fear."

2020-04-29 14:35,"Yesterday a few hundred people gathered at the North Carolina Legislature, then on to the Governor’s mansion. Film clips showed many within a few feet of each other, many without masks. Unbelievably, the leader of the group, who had COVID and declared her quarantine period over as of Sunday even though she admitted that it hadn’t been 14 days before she took the post down, was out there breathing on people. Pity the cops who had to arrest her for trespassing onto a sidewalk that they told her was off limits.

What Trump hath wrought, beginning with his defense of the racists in Charlottesville and then through his overall lying and deceit is an unbridled anger and perceived right by his base that to do whatever they want, regardless of the dangers created for others.

No malls, no gatherings, no sporting events, and by all means no restaurants, please. Look at the Washington Post article on air in plane cabins, btw.

When the uptick of COVID cases hits in 2-3 weeks (like for those Wisconsin voters who had to stand in line for hours), we’ll know the cause."
2020-04-29 15:33,"I truly appreciate the desire and need to get back to normal with our economy and social lives. 

But, in nation with the world's most disorganized and deadly response to the challenge and leadership that bounces around like five year olds at an unsupervised birthday party, I have to wonder if we can muster the organized testing regime and rational behavior needed to open up safely. 

In short, I have little to no confidence that I'll be safe in these open settings. 

So, until I see better leadership - state level is where it will come - my rule, unfortunately, will be…

""You first…""

If you dare."

2020-04-29 15:36,"The only time I’ve been to a mall in the last two years was to renew my drivers license at the DMV office located within one.  Other than a movie theater, which I frequented quite often pre-virus, a mall is the last place I’d go now."
2020-04-29 15:46,How would the cashier wash his or her hands after every transaction unless there was a sink next to every cash register? Pure greed at the expense of retail workers.

A dead cat bounce and not a very good bounce at that."
2020-04-29 15:55,"I can understand SPG's desperation, but the reality is there will be little or no consumer confidence until we are doing mass testing like other countries and reporting the results openly.  Until them, most people will stay away.  Unfortunately, the leadership to lead us out of this crisis is just not there and people have little trust in what we are hearing.  One political party has even made it very clear they are willing to sacrifice any of us if it puts money in their pockets.  Not exactly an atmosphere that gets you to open your wallet.  Also, with millions of people out of work and unemployment checks very slow to come, i have a feeling mall traffic will not be recovering no matter what the sales.  And lets not even start talking about the Fall."
2020-04-29 15:58,"At the very least, masks should be required for all shoppers and employees - and folks should be told to fix any not worn properly (can't count how many folks I see with ones covering mouth, but not nose).  Of course, whether people will want to go shopping at this point is an open question. I will not."
2020-04-29 16:01,"Consumer shopping drives at least 70% of the American economy. Three quarters of the population lived paycheck to paycheck to keep up with it.
That demand is gone. I have no ""need"" for fancy coffee and $80 blouses when I have to watch every penny for food and shelter and medicine.
I may have to risk my life to go out to work, but I don't have to risk my life to mindlessly shop."
2020-04-29 0:00,SPG is feeling overconfident.  They are in a tough spot to open.  This could definitely backfire on them as testing is not widely available.
2020-04-29 0:09,"As a person that works in a Simon Mall, this is going to be an absolute nightmare.  I had adults arguing with me about using hand sanitizer before we closed on March 18th... In a place that sells things that go on your face.  People insisted that I touch them while they were telling me this is all a hoax.  I need genuinely fear for my health, the health of my employees, and the health of other tenants in the mall.  This is not okay."
2020-04-29 16:12,"There are a lot of issues at play here, all primarily driven by good old greed.
If a Mall is closed, retailers don’t pay rent. If a Mall is open, retailers pay rent. Because of their size and clout, stores like Macys and Sears, don’t pay rent. But, opening the Mall is going to force Ma&Pa retailers to pay rent, no matter the level of foot traffic.
We’re talking about the guy who sells watch batteries, the Orange Julius shop, the cookie and candy stores – all the small merchants who have been hit hard by the lock downs. Most of these businesses are barely squeaking buy and have probably exhausted all their savings just staying alive – unless they’ve been lucky enough to get a PPP loan.
That changes the dynamic greatly. Now we’ve got the Government indirectly paying the mall owner! So, folks, you’re going to be paying Simon Property’s revenue stream for the next ten years or so – makes you feel all warm and fuzzy doesn’t it?
Wealthy mall owners are not eligible for PPP loans, but by opening their properties they can siphon off probably 1/3 or more of the PPP money. Without establishing rules, Simon Properties is going to contribute to another flash of the covid-19 virus. Anyone who has walked through a mall during flu season, knows that people have no regard for others – coughing, sneezing, shouting directions to someone on the other side of the mall all lead to the spread of infection. Is someone going to make Simon Properties liable for the death of a family member?"
2020-04-29 2:01,"Outstanding plans by Simon. Providing free masks is going above and beyond. Malls are huge and it is easy to social distance - if it looks packed, simply come back some other time. 

Malls are much safer than your typical grocery store or workplace. Certainly way safer than the subway or theaters or restaurants."
2020-04-29 11:53,"Opening a store involves a certain amount of overhead — utilities, salaries, security. Unless there are shoppers to buy merchandise, it’s a losing proposition.

Simon likely needs to open so it can start charging rent again. It will be interesting to see what companies like Gap do when mall owners reopen their facilities. There will be a lot of lawsuits around this, that’s for sure."
2020-04-29 12:40,"Be very careful with this. Open with the utmost care and follow basic CDC guidelines.

If it can't be done, especially is there is a spike in Covid 19, close immediately."

2020-04-29 16:09,"The traditional shopping mall is among the most ugly, dehumanizing and anti-nature things ever delivered by earthmover, road grader and bulldozer. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadmalls.com"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadmalls.com</a>
Just look at the endless square miles of asphalt parking lagoon in the accompanying photo. The average mall, among those still surviving today, is number one in the list of the 100 places that no one cares about. ""Let's see. Did I park in the red zone, or was it the yellow zone?"""
2020-04-29 16:20,"This all seems like a lot of work just so people can go shopping for things they don't really need. Malls were already dying before this pandemic. Large department anchors were  nearly all already on the bubble. Now people have been away for a while, and I am betting many have reset their priorities. In my area, malls are basically wrapped around robust dining opportunities...in other words, the mall exists because people go there to have a nice meal and then they stop in the mall as an afterthought, sometimes making impulse buys. The effects of this pandemic on consumer behavior is yet to be seen, but anyone who thinks that things will return the way they were is being incredibly naive. So, yeah, go ahead and open the malls. The net effect will be putting people who are finally getting unemployment back into a retail environment that is still very much on life support."
2020-04-29 16:27,"This is a true act of desperation. I am not unsympathetic to the retail trade, but malls are generally places that provide few real essentials that people can't forgo, temporarily, at the risk of contracting the coronavirus.  Employees are at the greatest risk."
2020-04-29 16:32,"In my small corner of the world (central Maine) the large mall in Bangor was dying long before COVID-19.
In October, 2017 Simon Properties failed to pay an $80 Million loan. Since then the property has passed through a number of hands and has steadily gone downhill.

Many stores with big names and lesser well-known names in the vicinity of the mall seem to be doing well -- pre-COVID-19. Hopefully, most will survive.

Unless and until there is much more testing (as of this morning only 5,795,728 Americans have been tested) and there is a proven vaccine this household will not return to pre-COVID-19 shopping practices. 
We will stay home and get what we need on-line."
2020-04-29 16:20,"These malls once they open, will be like crowded saloons from the wild, wild west.

Know where your exits are and be ready to take cover."

If I had my way, they would be getting another couple months of UI MINIMUM with that extra $600, to give them the chance to sock away some small financial security. 

While I’m at it, last-minute scheduling (with employees having to be available 14 hours a day, 7 days a week has GOT TO GO. 

Please, people—UNIONIZE."
2020-04-29 17:22,"Nice efforts but not realistic. At minimum everyone  must wear masks covering their nose and mouth. Temperature taken for customers and employees. Must use sanitizer when asked to do so. Sanitizer available at every srore emtrance. It doesn't seem possible to let any items be tried on. 

I work in retail. Employees and customers wearing masks around the neck only or with nose uncovered. People walking right up to you to ask a question, and pull down the mask if they have one before they start talking. People crowding the aisles. It's ridiculous. When we try to ask for 6 feet they get all bent out of shape. Even employees walk right up to you and start talking. People in the breakroom sit right next to you and common to have 4 people at one 4 foot round table.

And please, give me a break Simon: ""employees are to wash hands after every transaction"". Really? Not going to happen, get real. No time. And does every store in the mall have access to a hand washing station inside? We are supposed to be cleaning every 30 minutes but guess what? No time and it happens about 3 times a day."
2020-04-29 13:49,"The majority of the malls are located in Texas, Indiana, Georgia, Missouri, Tennessee, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alaska and Mississippi.....where science, facts, and serious critical thinking are frowned upon.

Sad.
Tragic.
Fatal."
2020-04-30 2:16,"The malls may open, sure. But they may very likely be devoid of customers. Well before the shutdown, malls were having a tough time attracting customers; anchor stores were closing and the smaller storefronts were already vacant or being repurposed into standalone spa treatment shops or real estate office, not traditional retail.

The heyday of malls has long since passed.

I know that even if the malls near me reopened, I wouldn't go to them. And being in California, there's no likelihood of that happening, regardless."
2020-04-30 2:27,"The headline threw me on this one. I thought it meant that the owner of 49 abandoned malls had remodeled them, signed tenants, and was ready to go with the comeback of malls as a shopping experience."
2020-04-30 2:30,"Just like movie theaters, this is a very bad idea.  Providing yet another petri dish in which the virus can spread.  Putting profit before peoples' lives is the ultimate insult to all the front line workers!  Think of a dedicated ER or ICU nurse or doctor while you're out purchasing items you neither need nor cannot do without; I hope you feel some sense of shame!"

2020-04-30 16:10,"The German minimum wage is 9 to 11 euros? that's like $10-$12 US dollars -- the effective US minimum wage (vs. the official Federal minimum). Walmart and Target both now pay $13 an hour TO START.

I thought European nations paid $20-$25 an hour! even to burger flippers! isn't that what we've been told in the US for years and years? how high European wages were compared to US wages?

NOTE: in a number of major US cities and states, the minimum is $15 an hour, and I think the highest is Seattle at $16 an hour.

Of course...none of that matters at all if you are unemployed.

As the recession deepens and the virus spreads....this problem will grow and not go away. I think frankly all nations around the world are acting like ostriches with their heads in the ground. You can only replace 80% of income for SO LONG and then you are broke, and the problem (coronavirus) is not solved at all.

No nation, not even the most socialist, can pay tens of millions of workers for a year or 18 months until a vaccine is developed. The cost would exceed GDP by many multiples."
2020-04-30 17:27,"One of the biggest differences between the US approach and just about everywhere else in G20 countries is that most of the others have done what they can to keep the workforce employed and paid in some form. There are examples of blatant engineering of the situation, but that will come out in the wash later. Wren Kitchens (wouldn't touch 'em with a barge pole) will have the newspapers after them when there is time.

Most societies are compassionate and democratic governments need to take that into account, but clearly in the US, that is not the case."
2020-04-30 17:36,"Well, every employee in Germany who is in “Kurzarbeit”, which means to be furloughed because of the lockdown, will receive 60% (or 67% if you’ve kids) of the monthly net income for the next couple of months. Based on contracts with unions, that can be enhanced by the employer, as described in the article. But you compare here apples with pears. Low-cost carriers are low cost because they offer low prices, which on the other side means they pay lower wages. If customers would pay more for the ticket, employees could earn more for their service. That’s not unfair, it’s the economy and normally easy do understand. But if you ask an official from a union, everything is bad. They would like to have everything being equalized, regardless of kind of service or prerequisites. That couldn’t and will not be paid by either customers and or taxpayers. 
BUT: Although the wage might differ, every employee has the same kind of medical insurance, and that won’t vanish in times of unemployment. There is no difference in the medical treatment in the hospital, e.g. in case of COVID-19 if you are a part-time worker, a blue-collar or a white-collar worker or unemployed. And that way of social security for all is not in question here in Germany or Europe. It’s part of our social contract in our societies and accepted by more or less everybody. It’s not the heaven for socialists, but it also not the nightmare of free entrepreneurs, because our companies do still make profits."
2020-04-30 18:33,"Despite the rhetoric that Europe takes care of its people much better than the US that has rarely been the case. The abuses in Germany, the UK and France in particular are nothing new. During downturns so called guest workers-low wage immigrants who have greatly contributed to growth and prosperity, are treated poorly and left to fend for themselves. The darker side of capitalism knows no borders, expect that there are more employment opportunities in the US."

“hundreds of employees saying their performance was not up to par” instead of furloughing them SHOULD BE ILLEGAL outright. If not, there should be some other prenalty

Trump seems to be the focus & even many of those are poorly referenced. Can we even get a link to an executive order, of do they not have access to that type of the data?"

2020-04-30 11:59,"Trump is desperate. He will try to deflect and distort. The facts are there. trump failed the American people. His inaction during January and February led to thousands of unnecessary deaths. He played golf, held rallies, gave us back energy sucking light bulbs, but did nothing to protect us against the virus. He failed to read briefings, and when told verbally, failed to listen to experts. Now is lifting social distancing, pretending it’s over because he thinks we will all go out and but stuff, much of what we have learned to live without in a few short weeks. The China deflection won't work. Trump ruined the country, the economy, and caused over 60,000 deaths. That is his legacy."

""

the work ""Link"" connotates conspiracy, ""hunt"" connotates investigate, which is it?"
2020-04-30 12:04,"Maybe they’ll find Hunter Biden hiding in a Wuhan lab. If China gets to a vaccine first, I wonder if the Patriots plane will be allowed to go pick up a few doses for us.

2020-04-30 11:26,Funny how this seems to parallel the search for WMD's in Iraq. I can only hope our civil servants resist the pressure to make the facts conform to Trump's fantasy blame game.
2020-04-30 11:35,"These two sentences - which appear in sequence in the article - don’t refer to the same proposition: 

“A few veteran national security experts have pointed to a history of lab accidents infecting researchers to suggest it might have happened in this case, but many scientists have dismissed such theories.

‘We do not believe any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,’ five scientists wrote in a paper published in March in Nature Medicine.”

The first refers to the question of whether the virus may have escaped from a lab by accident.  The second whether it was created in a lab.  Either the reporters and editors are deliberately misleading by stringing those together, or they’re not curious enough to understand the difference.  Or - possibly - both."
2020-04-30 11:50,"This is similar to the events leading up to Trump's impeachment, when an ""investigation""   was created to divert attention to Trump's asking a foreign government to intervene in our election process. Now a similar ""investigation,"" based on nonsensical conspiracy theories, is being created to divert attention from this Administration's complete failure to address the COVID - 19 crisis. Intelligent people are not fooled."
2020-04-30 11:25,"Let’s just imagine for one minute that Trump was this concerned back in November 2019 when he was told that this virus was coming, and he had gone to China determine the pathogen, sent resources, and helped contain the spread.  Let’s just imagine we had a “leader” instead of an obstructionist."
2020-04-30 11:25,"So the intelligence agencies were not to be believed when they said Putin/Russia interfered with the election, but now he wants to use their credibility to find someone to blame for the slowness of his response? Got it.

This is exhausting."
2020-04-30 11:40,"We will see where the facts lead. If China was a 21st century partner on issues of science and health or anything else, they would let us see this lab we helped to fund. Alas, China is not a partner. They destroyed evidence and muzzled critics. Remember what happened to Liu Xiaobo, a hero for all mankind."
2020-04-30 11:22,"I am so tired of the endless China bashing that our government and media has engaged in. It is counterproductive at best and dangerous at worse. By focusing on scapegoating China, we have on both conscious and unconscious levels reinforced the perception of China as ""other"". I believe that this has been part of the reason that our response has been so delayed and inadequate. Remember the ""relief"" when this hit Italy because then we would get some ""real"" information and see how a modern Western nation could successfully deal with Covid without resorting to the ""draconian"", ""totalitarian"" and ""Maoist"" strategies employed by China. Then to our astonishment and horror, we saw this thing literally steamroll Italy. Oops. It really doesn't matter what China publicly said, they gave us a step by step playbook of how to handle this. What they did to contain and mitigate was literally visible by satellite and based on sound reasoning and science. If we did not see them as ""other"" we would have appreciated the severity of the threat sooner and would have followed their, now proven, strategies. We are blaming them for our own failures and continuing to do so will jeopardize the global cooperation that is required to deal with this and future pandemics."
2020-04-30 11:17,"The Chinese government’s decision not to inform the rest of the world is responsible for thousands of deaths and a potential economic depression. One very good explanation is that the virus escaped from the lab in the Wuhan Province. At the very least, the coincidence is too great not to investigate the possibility that the Chinese government is responsible  for devastating the world, and the degree of their culpability."
2020-04-30 11:28,"Interesting collection of facts and conjecture however none of it will be relevant to Mr Trump and his Senate and media boosters. 
They will continue to create the narrative that benefit them politically, or if faced by facts that don’t suite their purpose, say it could be this or could be that allowing them to continue to claim the truth they want to see. 
The President is already recasting his delayed and weakly coordinated response that cost lives by saying without his efforts it would have been much worse. 
The truth, in all this, is irrelevant."
2020-04-30 11:47,"This is really the appropriate time to waste resources and time finding out who/what to blame, instead of using people and resources to effectively provide testing for all, and helping to resolve the medical and economic crises.

The virus could have originated in Wunan or on Mars; the president ignored it and more have died on his watch than bin Laden and Vietnam.   And it is not China's fault the Senate says nothing as the president suggests serving poison as a cure and the vp defies the Mayo Clinic.

I think that his argument needs to be investigated by an international league of scientists to find the systemic causes of this pandemic and eliminate them for the safety and security of our species.  The Chinese government needs to allow international scientists into their research labs to closely monitor standards and practices for viral research. If they do not agree to such monitoring, then they should indeed be censured by the world community. No amount of money can replace the losses that people have suffered from this outbreak nor should we have to live our lives in fear of more to come."

He and his agents will disavow the truth as the enemy.  Who is the real enemy of America here?  

COVID-19 is affecting the entire planet.  It requires the work of every nation.  Some nations are not equipped to deal with the virus due to poverty and low levels of health care.  Some nations like the U.S. have great capabilities but due to a policy of providing health care to only the rich that can afford it will let the poor and minority citizens suffer.

They don't care about the consequences, even war with China.  When you think of how much money, time, and resources are spent by Donald Trump to push his political priorities, you have to wonder: how much could they have accomplished had all this time and money had gone to  combatting the virus?"

Well it's more than concerning!  It's outrageous.  It's consistent with so much Trump has done to first, ignore the virus and then to blame everyone else to shift focus from his incompetent handing of the crisis. We need journalists to tell it like it is. Saying some experts are concerned doesn't cut it. Most any expert worth his salt (and worthy of being consulted by the NYTimes) will be more than concerned that trump is expending hours of intelligence time trying to prove another of his  hair brained theories when there's a virus to manage.

What this means for the USA is disaster as it can lead to undue influence over key decision makers with the threat of demotions for those who won't ""play ball"".  

A classic example of the damage associated with 'top-down""  control and an elimination of independent analysis is Operation Barbarossa wherein the Wehrmacht preparations and the actual date of attack were communicated to the GRU and the Stavka well in advance of Sunday, June 22, 1941, but Stalin did not want to mobilize in order not to provoke the Germans into attacking as the Tsar had done in 1914.   As a consequence of Stalin's pathological refusal to accept an inconvenient truth, the Red Army lost most of its planes in the first few days and was woefully unprepared and    needlessly forward deployed resulting in millions of KIAs and POWs (the latter were ruthlessly starved to death) and the loss of the Ukraine, Moldavia, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Belarus and western Russia  which again set the stage for genocides which killed over 20 million non-combatant civilians.

It is also true that many locals are employed on or in close contact with those bases for support, logistics and provisioning.

If he can pin COVID-19 on China, and get it to stick, he feels he can reap a windfall of political currency towards his reelection this year. He can deflect blame on himself and look tough on those ""dirty"" Chinese simultaneously. But at this point in his presidency, this is not going to work.

How else can the low incidence of the disease in China be explained especially when compared to outbreaks in western European countries and the US? Whether it was a genomic mutation in the wild or a result laboratory studies that caused the illness becomes a geopolitical question of great importance.

The Chinese govt is pushing a claim that the virus was started by US military; that, in and of itself, would seem to undermine other claims they've made."
2020-04-30 11:57,"There is a substantial difference between a collection requirement and an assessment. “Collection” refers to actively seeking information about a particular topic of national security interest. The raw information collected is recorded and disseminated in a report. An assessment is the conclusion reached by synthesizing and analyzing a body of reporting.

If the White House merely directed the intelligence community to collect on the possibility that the virus escaped from a laboratory, that is a non-issue. That’s merely an attempt to find out the truth, which is extremely important in all cases, including this one. If the White House is actively dictating the assessments made as a result of that collection, that would be a problem.

The article seemed to use the word “assessment” liberally, which seems innocuous, but is an important distinction that makes the difference between an truth-seeking attempt or a politically-driven witch hunt."
2020-04-30 12:35,"How many of the recently reported ""excess"" U.S. deaths occurred  in January and February?  How about a possible unusual spike in  December 2019?  I am eagerly awaiting news from ongoing research about the virus spreading here long before it was officially detected.  We believe my daughter went through it in New York in early January (tested negative for flu, strep and mono). If that turns out to be the case,  the conventional theory of trajectory of this virus is turned on its head.

All this blaming and shaming directed at China but what does it say about our healthcare system if people were coming down with this in a significant number in those early months and no one realized it?"
2020-04-30 12:03,"This is the administration that refutes any verifiable, scientifically valid information that comes their way, to the cost of human lives.

And now they want help, any help, to pin this on another conspiracy theory, which surely has Trump convinced.

I hope the intelligence community shows some intelligence and spine, and verifies the verifiable and testifies to facts, truth and science."
2020-04-30 12:39,"""Some intelligence analysts are concerned that the pressure from administration officials will distort assessments about the virus"". Of course, they already have. Trump's pressuring has ensured that half the country will have no faith in the intelligence community's conclusions if they conform to his preconceived idea of what they should find. Seems to me we've seen this dance before."
2020-04-30 12:23,"If they’re going to pick fights, they may as well do it with a country that has a decent candidate for the next reserve currency, because the dollar is just about toast. Two birds with one stone."
2020-04-30 12:34,"Reminds me of an interview with a Pentagon official some years ago about the lack of plans to destroy biological warfare weapons.  ""We thought that we would use them,"" the interviewee noted.  Wherever this came from, whether a lab or a population that needs to purchase live animals for food, it is an unprecendented catastrophe that, well, was anticipated, but for which we were not prepared.  Blame should take a back seat to recovery, unless one is concerned that one is going to lose one's job - as apparently is our president."
2020-04-30 11:55,"It really does not matter how the virus began, that was largely beyond our control.  What matters most is how we responded it to its threat.  That has been a failure.  We had reason to expect exactly a virus that appeared and through failed management at the highest Federal level, chose to ignore all of the warnings and discard the preparatory work already in place to address it."
2020-04-30 12:37,"There is currently a lack of direct evidence, but some very convincing circumstantial evidence.  While his tone is off as usual, Trump's instinct to investigate further seems entirely reasonable.  Wuhan is China's headquarters for research of this type of virus, and multiple agencies have cited this lab over concerns regarding its safety protocols over the past 2 years (well before this epidemic).  There are open markets and bats around the county, but the fact is that the virus started here, right on top of this lab.  That is simply too big of a coincidence to ignore."
2020-04-30 12:49,"Looking to blame the Chinese for creating this monster pandemic. 
No surprise . 
A discussion takes place with Trump about China paying reparations to the US. 
When mad king Trump heard this ridiculous idea. 
He probably thought . Can I get a piece of this?"
2020-04-30 12:50,"FoxNews and his cult will run with it, but the rest of the world--I mean, every last soul of us--know that it's just more of Trump's lies. He is a failure and a fraud."
2020-04-30 12:47,"Trump is incapable of accepting responsibility for his actions. His ruse is to blame the other - be it Obama, Mexico, the FBI, the fake news, you people,  Judges, governors,  China and on and on. The one and only vaccine we have to rid ourselves of this very dangerous illness in the Whitehouse is to vote it out in November."
2020-04-30 12:51,"So if there is any truth that this virus was developed in a lab - and I am not giving any credence to that view, just hypothesizing - then it is even more despicable that the Trump administration defunded pandemic response teams and other efforts that should have been in place to deal with not just pandemics, but possible biological warfare.  More gross incompetence, more failure to prepare for things that are clear possibilities in our world."
2020-04-30 12:51,"So the President - a chronic liar on every subject, including his malfeasance and incompetence in responding to the Covid-19 pandemic - is directing our intelligence agencies to produce a report that China concealed evidence of the severity of that outbreak. Just another example of how Trump and his cronies have corrupted and degraded our our government and squandered its credibility."
2020-04-30 12:44,"The circumstantial evidence is substantial that the virus originated in Wuhan. If we don’t get to the bottom of the root cause, the chances of a similar pandemic coming out of China in the near future rises exponentially. Close the wet markets permanently."
2020-04-30 12:31,"No surprise. The Chinese Politiburo did try to hide the outbreak, but far more important was the fact that the White House, informed via US intelligence, the WHO and others, chose to do nothing. Now, the Trumpian Apocalypse Maladministration, struggling to point the finger of blame away from their own colossal malfeasance which resulted in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Americans so as to gain four more years to completely destroy the United States as a credible, respected and functional member of the world community and to enshrine the power of the rich and privileged to the detriment of ordinary decent Americans, is trying to turn this situation into political advantage and evade all responsibility for the criminally embarrassing ineptitude of Fake President Donald J Trump,"
2020-04-30 12:54,Is this really an effective use of our resources right now? Blatant blame-mongering.
2020-04-30 12:48,"Yep, and it's deja vu all over again.  This is the ole Sadam and Iraq have weapons of mass destruction playbook.  Send W.H. officials (not Pence--he's not even an understudy for the Cheney role) to twist the arms of CIA analysts and, voila, it's all a Wuhan lab scheme.  This administration doesn't have anyone left of the stature of Colin Powell to sell a bill of goods to the UN or elsewhere.  Powell knew it was a scam though and still let himself be subverted.    Given an administration without a shred of integrity or accountability, how can we even hope that the Sadam/Iraq/WMDs type fantasy won't be sold to those only too wiling to believe it?"
2020-04-30 12:26,I'm not sure why this article would begin stating it's an 'unsubstantiated theory' that the virus leaked from a lab. I think it would take an investigation to truly determine its origin.
2020-04-30 12:46,Wouldn’t it be nice if the federal government’s full attention was on saving lives and not trying to shift blame for a pandemic that our oafish “President” didn’t adequately prepare the nation for?
2020-04-30 11:14,"trump has gone off the deep end. If there is anyone on the planet who would make a senseless decision to start biological warfare, it would be trump."
2020-04-30 11:31,"Trump is looking for a scapegoat, and wants to sell China as that scapegoat.  This is traditional dictatorial stuff:  Misdirection.  Soon - if not already - Fox will be spinning this up to deflect responsibility for the administrations failures to properly lead and guide the ship of state around and through the pandemic.  China will be a villain drawn straight out of central casting and will receive the full Iraq treatment that preceded the second gulf way.

This is not to say that China's initial handling of the nascent outbreak was not contributory to the spread rate.  It most certainly was, but the Trump pot calling the Chinese kettle black is just a scapegoat strategy.  It is the desperate act of a dangerous demagogue to focus blame on an external agent that his people will accept - or can be manipulated into accepting.

We live in very dangerous times."
2020-04-30 12:32,"Where the virus started is at this point irrelevant. The virus could have been deposited on earth by alien spaceship, but none of that changes the fact that Trump and the Republicans failed to protect Americans. 

Trump will be #1 in something: the greatest presidential failure in American history."
2020-04-30 11:50,"there is currently 0 evidence that there is a connection, and not leading with ""dispite lack of evidence,"" is irresponsible in these days of saber rattling and short attention spans"
2020-04-30 12:38,Is there any button Trump won't push or any lever he won't pull to avoid taking responsibility for his own ineptitude? Where the virus came from has nothing to do with his mishandling of it in the United States.
2020-04-30 12:40,"""But by mid January, American officials said the Chinese scientist cut off official communications"". It sounds a lot like what happen at Tchernobyl in 1986, communist leaders trying to hide any misconduct due to a lack of safety."
2020-04-30 12:43,"The US wastes $750 billion annually on the military, so it naturally needs enemies to justify this outrageous misallocation of resources.  More so now, as Americans see how unprepared and inadequate our government and for-profit healthcare system have been in responding to the very real threat of a pandemic, that was predicted for years by health experts.  

Sec State Mike Pompeo and various enablers are determined to initiate a new Cold War with China to shift blame from the Trump administration, and ensure that Congress will continue to overfund the largest, wealthiest, and most violent organized crime network on the planet, aka the MIC."
2020-04-30 11:53,Trump is using the power of the US government to influence the election. It is obvious and it is wrong. Will there ever be a step too far for the republicans? When will they stop the madness?
2020-04-30 11:31,"Covid-19 did have its origin in China virtually no one is disputing that fact because the evidence is more than overwhelming. It is also fact that China did nothing to prevent millions of Chinese from leaving Wuhan to places all over the world spreading the pandemic globally. Finally it is also fact China refused initial requests from the United States and other to share vital information about Covid-19 and refuse U.S. scientists to go to Wuhan.

So what exactly is in dispute here ?? That we should not acknowledge reality and rather give Chinese authorities a free pass for spreading the most dangerous virus in 100 years.

We still need to find out if the virus originated in the Wuhan lab and exactly how much Chinese authorities deceived the rest of the world. Blaming the Trump administration for utilizing the CIA and other agencies to find out the truth makes no sense."
2020-04-30 12:07,"This is too eerily similar to the investigation into the ‘spying’ on the trump 2016 campaign, the origins of the Russian interference in the 2016 election, and barr’s lies about the content of the Mueller report.

Still, we have yet to reach the bottom. And we can and will be subjected to this continuing unmitigated descent."
2020-04-30 12:49,"WMDs all over again. 
China deserves a lot of blame. But Trump thinks blaming China more will make him look better."
2020-04-30 11:15,"As disturbing as this sounds, it should surprise no one. When has this president ever took responsibility for anything, or risen to an occasion rather than sinking into the mire? 

He can blame China, and it will be parroted by every right-wing media outlet between now and the election. If he can extort some flimsy intelligence to support him, we should expect him to do just that. 

The fact remains, it wasn't China that couldn't provide masks, or ventilators, or test for the virus. It certainly wasn't China who ignored repeated daily briefings as far back as January and lied to the American people consistently for months.

I can only imagine the unintended consequences of this policy."
2020-04-30 11:43,"So predictable, I can already see Pompeo waving a test tube at UN SC. I am sure some defecting Chinese virologists code named ""Slider"" or ""Change-up"" will be happy to collaborate. I don't think anyone will be invading China though. But keeping the trillions they lend US as compensation for their misdeeds will be totally fair."
2020-04-30 11:28,Can't this administration do anything that is NOT vindictive.  Whats the point of wasting time on a dubious political issue when theres so much to be faced up at home by this administration
2020-04-30 12:25,"Clearly Trump needs yet one more red herring to dangle before the eyes of the public. But the fact remains that it matters little at this point where the virus came from. What matters is to recognize that we are in the present predicament in large part because of the bungling of the administration. And what matters even more is not to keep on bungling from now on, when we are re-entering danger by once again resuming public activities like work and leisure. 

Sadly, the bungling continues. The politically driven rush to resume activities, the absurd ""advice,"" like Cloroxgate, that turns the whole country into an international laughing stock, the firing of capable people for refusing to pervert the truth. In truth we are leaderless, so that now it is every man for himself. Which is how Trump has been behaving all along, is it not?"
2020-04-30 12:23,"It’s ironic that instead of focusing on how to respond to the next pandemic better, the US government is focused on how to shift blame. Just as it concocted evidence to invade Iraq, it’s now attempting to concoct evidence to blame China."
2020-04-30 12:38,"Another distraction from the administration's totally-failed relationship with China. A diversion from the fact that Trump and his ""braintrust"" have destroyed a critical trade relationship with their ham-fisted mismanagement. 
How many American jobs were lost in this bungled attempt at pushing the Chinese around? Where are the ""trade-agreements"" that we were promised? Where are the reforms that we were promised? 
There has never been an enemy that has done as much damage to America as Trump: 60,000 lives and counting."
2020-04-30 12:05,"This is insanity.  Opening an investigation with its conclusion is a guarantee of failure.  Any such conclusion would be viewed with appropriate skepticism for its taint.  Discarding facts which do not support your desired answer makes them no less true.

We have numerous examples in governmental and personal spheres:

""Tax cuts will raise investment and increase jobs.""
""Saddam Hussein is hiding WMD.""
""Barack Obama is a Kenyan national.'
""Tariffs are paid by foreign countries.""
""I alone can fix it.""
""The telephone call was perfect.""
""Of course I will respect you in the morning.""

How many more times do we need to have this lesson?"
2020-04-30 12:41,So Trump wants the deep state to fake into being what he wants? But we knew that.
2020-04-30 12:43,"Is this really the time to blame China?  I look forward to a leader that can confront and manage a crisis.   Real leaders don't blame, they fix.   The reason that you know that Trump is the wrong person for this moment is he and his administration constantly lie and wrestle with the truth.    His press briefings are laughable and the more he talks the worse it gets.   We are obviously going to navigate this crisis without testing.   The lack of testing seems to mean that we are going to be flying without any instruments.  God help us!"
2020-04-30 12:49,"Downplaying Trump's grossly incompetent response to the pandemic and focusing on blaming China is already part of a well-publicized Republican campaign strategy.  It is not surprising the the Administration is pressuring intelligence agencies to come up with any shred of evidence, or even speculation, supporting that strategy."
2020-04-30 12:13,"No matter how the virus started (wet market or lab), it's pretty obvious from the information that's public that the Chinese government allowed the virus to spread out of the country in order to even the playing field. China played the virus down until it was all but certain that other countries would go through a crisis as well."
2020-04-30 11:58,"This theory makes no sense on multiple levels.  China obviously didn't know a thing about the virus.  They didn't know the symptoms, virulence, death rate, method of transmission, or whether it could be spread human to human.  All those things had to be discovered in the early days.  That ignorance is itself evidence that it was not previously studied in a lab.  Otherwise, they would have known something about it.  

Furthermore, I don't understand why it would make any difference.  Even if it were accidentally released from a lab, that is not a casus belli.  

Finally, the whole idea of holding a country ""accountable"" for a virus outbreak is ridiculous.  Did anyone hold the U.S. accountable for the Spanish Flu?  How about Lyme Disease?    The whole notion is absurd, and totally counter-productive.  We need to focus on saving lives, reducing infections, and getting first responders the gear they need.  Everything else is a distraction."
2020-04-30 12:05,"Determining the cause of this outbreak is extremely important to inform how to prevent futures ones.  Having said that, this article kind of misses the point. It's fine to say we shouldn't shop for conclusions. I fully agree.  But we also should be willing to hold China responsible. This article seems scared to do that. This isn't about people who are Chinese, it's about the government of China withholding information and lying.  Sure, could we and most other countries have managed the crisis better, yes, but this article blames the victim.  It's highly likely mismanagement by the Chinese government (i.e., poor information flow, allowing legal trade of wildlife markets) caused this mess; it would not be the first time.  If that's the case, China should be held to account without fear.  Let's not ourselves get distracted by Trump administration antics and give China a pass."
2020-04-30 12:54,"Even if they could prove that the Chinese invented and weaponised the Coronavirus, you still need to consider the Trump administration's response to it compared to other countries. The United States - even with our world leading health Care system (debatable I guess), our research labs and universities, our Noble (pun intended) winning scientists - totally botched our response to the disease. We were not South Korea here. We were Banana-land. Trump owns this no matter what they find."
2020-04-30 12:56,"The obvious has not been stated.  We need to find out where Covid 19 originated and put measures in place so that it does not happen again in the weeks, months, and years ahead.  If it was a lab or a market we need to know.  Everyone needs to know."
2020-04-30 12:55,"I support this effort. I will never forget how China wronged us. They clearly want to eradicate Democracy. This virus has given them license to increase Authoritarianism everywhere. We need to make sure our digital transmissions, which are almost everything due to the virus, are secure. China is watching and trying to control everybody. We are all grounded by China. This is the beginning of an epic confrontation. We need to muster our worldwide allies. We need to build our resolve to defeat them and keep them out of the free world."
2020-04-30 12:59,"I think we can rule out that it was intentional on the part of China; they wouldn't have infected their own people.  Lab accidents have happened in the past and security is vital.  We may never know the source of the virus.

But must we utilize everything for propaganda value?  Underneath this war of words globalization proceeds apace with Ford, Tesla, Apple, Exxon and others taking advantage of China's vast workforce and consumer market.  We don't need to make China a villain.  

Now comes the propaganda war for the presidency.  Trump's backers will belittle Biden and Biden's people will vilify Trump.  But underneath is a corporate array jockeying for privileged position.  The common people are not represented by strong unions and a social safety net, or even an unhampered ability vote.  

So when China or the World Health Organization or one's political opponent or anyone else are being set up as the foe, let's stop and consider the source."
2020-04-30 12:50,"This is right along with what the 'leaked' GOP memo to Senators was talking about - don't defend Trump on COVID response, (defense if indefensible), but rather focus on blaming China, that 'it is China's fault', and that Trump is 'strong on China', and further that Biden is both weak on and complicit with China.  This was/is the present re-election strategery.  Interesting to watch it play out. 1) it is China's fault, 2) Trump fights China, 3) Biden 'soft on China'."
2020-04-30 12:50,"We may never know where the virus originated.

Who was patient zero?

But what we do know with high  confidence is that the Trump administration had plenty of advance notice of the  pandemic and negligently failed to prepare for it."
2020-04-30 13:12,"Yes, there should be multiple, intensive post mortems on the impacts of business practices on coronavirus and future pandemics - scientific, not political - especially those due to the rapid acceleration of climate change. But not today. Today we have to minimize unnecessary, tragic loss of life and minimize massive disruption to our economy.

We can't waste effort telling Donald Trump what not to do. Instead, focus our message on what we need to do, and stay consistent to keep the message clear. We need to partner public, private and international resources to accelerate the development and production of testing, treatment, and protective equipment for healthcare workers and essential workers out in our communities. We also need to rapidly develop and enact new safety standards for working conditions - by industry and supply chain segment. Case in point, if meat production is to be designated as essential - then those workers must be protected, immediately. 

We have to focus - and we have to do it now - or there will be far fewer of us to do so by this time next year."
2020-04-30 13:12,"I do not understand why the US government, i.e., this idiotic administration, thinks it has the right to enter a laboratory in Wuhan and why it is outraged that they have yet to do so - and probably never will.

Wait, I do understand. Trump and his minions will do anything to deflect attention away from their utter failure to handle this virus in a reasonable and responsible way. Shame on them - and on anyone who believes this malarkey."

It was Trump’s downplaying of the virus and the squandering of the early warning that I hold Trump responsible for. No one is blaming him for the cause of the virus or the inevitable shutdown of our country; it’s his downplaying of the seriousness of this illness and his lack of action and ultimately his mishandling of the pandemic in almost all phases that he needs to be held responsible for. In addition, his attitude that the worst is over and the country should reopen now may be the most damaging of all his decisions.

2020-04-30 13:13,"""Trump Officials Are Said to Press Spies to Link Virus and Wuhan Labs""one 

Once again, Trump people are not listening to the US National Security Agencies and may end up shooting themselves in the foot.  By fingering the Chinese bio-lab in Wuhan to be the source of the virus, they are in fact providing China with reasons to implicate the US. 

When the history of germ wars are written, we will learn that the primary target area for releasing germs in the enemy's territory is always somewhere close to an enemy biological lab.  The logic for that is simple. After the release of the germ, it allows the side initiating the release accuse the other side of being: 1) War criminals for their involvement in morally repugnant germ war fares; and, 2) Clumsy and blundering to the point that they have unwittingly exposed their own population to offending germs. 

The latest example of such a ""bio attack"" was conducted by Russian agents in England.  On March 4, 2018, they used Novichok nerve agent to poison Sergei Skripal - a former Russian military officer and UK double agent - and his daughter, Yulia, in the city of Salisbury, England. If one checks Salisbury on the map, one can see that just 5 miles away from the city is England's controversial Porton Down bio-chemical research facility.  It is a highly secretive lab, known to work on extremely dangerous bio weapons such as Ebola, plague, and anthrax, under direct control of the UK Ministry of Defense."

They were the last to come out with any information on cases at all and they are the country that is responsible for some of the most atrocious cases of international espionage for example the poisoning cases recently in Europe. As a crime, this has Russian DNA through and through. But, you know what, this is probably a naturally occurring incident caused by human stupidity and just plain bad luck. As a species what we've learned from this is almost no country is willing to make the tough decisions to make incidents like this less a threat and at the forefront of that stupidity is us, I mean the US."

And the WH says not my problem and attempts to shift the blame. We fire ship captains who try to protect their crew while the UK salutes the 100 year old Captain  Tom Moore who raised $30 million dollars doing laps in his garden to raise money for their National Health Service.

Maybe the focus should be on the Denense Inel Agency's ""Medical Intel Unit,"" more than upon CIA.  And maybe the investigation should take a look at that MIT scientist who was working (for pay) for a Wuhan medical laboratory."
2020-04-30 13:23,"Scientists that doubt any lab invented or released COVID-19 include: Jonna Mazet, Robert Garry, Lim Poh Lian, Simon Anthony, Peter Daszak, and others.  These are legitimate researchers, not quacks, conspiracy theorists, or political stooges.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology has existed, in one form or another, since 1956.  There is no evidence it promoted biological warfare or zoonotic contagion.   Many people in rural China have antibodies that indicate a long history of exposure to animal viruses.  Nobody conspired to do that.  Failure to suppress popular consumption of exotic animals is simply that: a failure, not unlike US failure to prohibit booze, weed, or even guns.  To outlaw something done by millions simply creates millions of outlaws, plus protection rackets and underground syndicates.

It is absurd to think that it will do any soul any tangible good to pin blame for the existence of the virus on any people or government.   To vilify or hate is a fake remedy, a mere distraction.  It will only fan xenophobia and fool.

The real guilt or blame is failure to have a plan or resources to deal with pandemics.  If China develops a good vaccine or can supply PPE, we do ourselves a real disfavor by attempts to blame its government or people."
2020-04-30 13:28,"Some things just don't change.  This sounds like the same pressure Bush and Cheney put on our intelligence sources to say that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.  They did say that. And the war in Iraq quickly followed.  Later of course when it was too late to turn back all of that so-called ""intelligence"" was shown for the figment, fabrication, lie that it was.  Now, Trump desperately wants someone else to blame for his epic and deadly failure to deal with the Coronavirus.  Voila!  The Chinese created it in a lab and set it loose on the world, starting with their own people.  So what is Trump's goal here?  War?  Not likely.  His reelection in November?  Yes indeed."

 China has too much money and influence on the media and they hate Trump too much for me to believe their evaluation. I don't trust the president for obvious reasons. I agree the most likely scenario is the official one but the CIA is using the Washington post to promote the other. Are we to believe David Ignatius is naive or a Trump mouthpiece?

That's what we're left with."
2020-04-30 13:23,"The odds were astronomical against a lab release as opposed to an event in nature.  UK's Lancelot Journal already published a medical research report to confirm that. This is just one of the many studies to verify the originality of the Covid-19.

WMD is still fresh on my mind.  Despite all the intelligence, we still couldn't tell what went wrong to locate the weapon.  And the consequence is a catastrophic man-made disaster.

It would be nice to have an administration that values the truth, but I am convinced there is no chance of that happening. Nothing the Trump administration does or says is credible."

This time, almost all our businesses are in China and they have nuclear weapons. The military here started their baloney ""Pivot to Asia"" under the limp compliant Obama, and here we are about to lose it all because our ignorant citizens have no intelligence and comically, the spies are called intelligence.

Is China to bear any responsibility in this disaster I ask you?"

The White House, for years, had been denigrating our American intelligence community as “deep state” promoting “hoaxes” and firing anyone and everyone who had institutional knowledge and training.  Yes, the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for the failure to contain the outbreak (we must redouble our support for democracy in Hong Kong; defend our ally—Taiwan; stop the terrorizing of the Uighur people in Xinjiang), AND the White House is responsible for gutting our government of all the people with integrity who may have helped us mitigate this unmitigated disaster.

2020-04-30 13:05,"Don't get me wrong, the Chinese still have a lot of explaining to do about how COVID-19 first infected people and how it spread, and need to allow an independent international investigation to go ahead that is thoroughly independent and transparent, because pandemics like this must never be allowed to happen again.  That said, the idea of our spy agencies being pressured by the Trump administration to come up with ""intelligence"" to justify what is at best a conspiracy theory reminds me way too much of what happened in the run up to the G.W. Bush administration’s war with Iraq, where you had the likes of Dick Cheney going to Langley to demand that the CIA find evidence of weapons of mass destruction that just didn't exist.  Going into investigations with such preconceived notions just leads to faulty intelligence and worse decisions.  Always has, always will."

It seems like there's a decent connection here between a biological-studies lab in Wuhan - which housed and studied coronaviruses - and the premise that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan. How close was this lab to the meat market? What is the security like on site? Have there been any previous cases of stock leaks?

While the US is testing for the virus and antibodies/antigens, and trying to fix the broken unemployment system, why not follow a lead that this time, looks pretty obvious?"

1. I have no confidence in an unbiased analytical conclusion by Trump's  lackeys. They will just try to redirect the anger from what they did...
2. No matter what the conclusion, the administration and Trump had the data and analyses and warnings that the pandemic was going to hit the US hard, and they failed miserably. That is the bottom line."
2020-04-30 13:37,"The lab theory of the origin of the virus has its origin in a Washington Times story written by Roger. That story has been throughly checked and completely debunked.

The science is bad, the conclusions unsupported and the writer refused to allow scientists to see the diplomatic cables that allegedly claim there were serious safety problems in the Wuhan lab. Even the parts that were released didn’t support the theory.

When you look closely at who Rogen is and the ideological origins of the Washington Times this has all the earmarks of a “planted story.”

If you look at the timeline revealing how China handled the reporting on the virus it is identical to how we (the US) responded to and reported on the N1H1 virus that originated in California.

No one has labeled that “the American flu” nor have they threatened law suits. China is on record contacting the WHO within one week of discovering that the pneumonia cases in Wuhan were in fact an “unknown virus.”

Part of this standard protocol is for all WHO representatives, including the Americans to also be notified. This occurred in early January.

The failure of the US response has been well documented and the deeper we look the more negligence we find.

So the Democrat’s failures in 2016 were all blamed on Russia gate. Now the Trump administration is doing the same with a fabricated China gate.

All available data says that a pandemic was inevitable and despite knowing this our political leaders were unprepared."

I for one would like to bury China and their so-called values, the nature of their totalitarianism and the fact of them as a rapacious competitor in all things."
2020-04-30 13:55,"We're getting disinformation out of China.  Did we really expect total transparency from them?  This doesn't mean the virus came from a lab.

All early indications are that the virus came from a bat virus and was transmitted naturally.  

Our American win-at-all-costs mentality is now costing us precious lives and shouldn't be allowed during this pandemic. 

Republicans are starting to realize how much they've bungled the handling of this crisis, and how it will ultimately cost them the election-as it should.  I have no sympathy for them.  They've done it all to themselves.  And, the bat virus has come home to roost."

This is the bottom line.  The intelligence agencies should report what they have learned through human and signal intelligence, without interference from government officials, but the answers are in the notebooks and with laboratory personnel from Wuhan. The Chinese could put this theory to rest, and their refusal to do so is going to give rise to all types of speculation. The ball is in their court, and if they pick it up and go home suspicion will be warranted."

And when will Trump take it seriously enough to focus on it and get the testing done that makes the virus visible?"
2020-04-30 14:06,"Let us take the question to some kind of international or world court. Let us ask some questions about accountability:

1. What responsibility does China have for this pandemic?

2. Do people returning from China bear any personal responsibility for returning from China and not going into quarantine?"
2020-04-30 13:45,"I would imagine asking the appropriate agency to investigate is standard practice.  Due to the severity of the consequences, I do not blame Trump one bit for wanting this information and making it a priority.  In this case Trump is acting like Obama would."

All this so he find dirt on China to which he can then use as substance for his ""Biden/China"" ads during the upcoming election campaigns and shift blame away from his inept response to this crisis.

American consumers funding an aggressive totalitarian militaristic dictatorship is not part of our liberal agenda but we do fund an enemy. I lived in China. Americans are so naive as to the number of Chinese spies within US military, government, corporations, universities. For example, Via Technologies from Taiwan recruited Taiwan high school students toward Berkeley and Stanford Electrical Engineering. 10 years on they worked at Intel by day and for Via at night. Japan donated  3000 cherry trees to place around our National Monuments and then Japan built it’s US spy network. Wake up."

Just as bad as Cheney-Bush telling us to go shop during a war, is trump's sycophants telling us to do the same and buy into a collapsing market during this war against a deadly pandemic while forcing people back into their dangerous capitalist mine pits to toil in dangerous conditions to generate evermore wealth for their sheltered overlords binging on government cash giveaways. Indeed, all safety measures in meat plants and elsewhere are now optional."

2020-04-30 14:06,"Judging from these comments, I am really concerned that our domestic political polarization has really damaged not just our political discourse, but what reasonable, thinking people will entertain in their own minds regarding the origins of this virus. It is vital that we learn exactly where it came from to prevent a SARS 3, or worse. 

This article makes very clear that though unlikely, an accidental lab release is a real possibility and one that the Chinese govt itself explored. 

Their refusal to be transparent and collaborative in the face of a global health crisis is unacceptable and the fact that trump has not been the president they would like to have had does not absolve them of their secrecy. Nor does Trump’s clumsy pursuit of the viruses’ origins as a lab accident render that line of inquiry illegitimate."
2020-04-30 14:27,"Linking the virus to Chinese carelessness or inaction could be helpful to President Trump.  One can understand his motivations, here.

For that reason, I think it would be good for the press in the US to do some of their own research and investigation to help establish President Trump's innocence in all this.  Perhaps with some inquiries on their part they could help determine:

- How much golf was the President playing in February and March?

- How many daily briefings did he not read or attend to?

- How many hours were spent watching Fox News, who seemed to be informing that this wasn't going to be a problem?

- If tens of thousands of people flew into the US from China, and weren't quarantined or monitored in any way when they got here, does that really count as a ""travel ban"" for Trump to be proud of?

- Has Jared Kushner done anything?  Anything at all?"
2020-04-30 14:32,"""Any American intelligence report blaming a Chinese institution and officials for the outbreak could significantly harm relations with China for years to come. And Trump administration officials could use it to try to prod other nations to publicly hold China accountable for coronavirus deaths even when the pandemic’s exact origins cannot be determined.""

The really scary possibility is that such a report could succeed in getting Trump reelected."
2020-04-30 14:31,Blaming China has become a cause célèbre among Republicans.  They believe that it is a winning strategy for the November general election.
2020-04-30 14:13,Interesting how the Trump administration is now spending their time and efforts looking into how it began rather than caring about how to fix it in the country. It becomes clearer each day how much Trump doesn't care about the well-being of American citizens.
2020-04-30 14:13,"The key issue is not where the virus began, but why it was allowed to run wild in the United States. Everything else, including this misuse of government resources, is chaff aimed at diverting attention from the administration's unambiguous incompetence in dealing with the pandemic."
2020-04-30 13:03,"Gulf of Tonkin, Yellowcake, WMD...

Chinese people in China have suffered and died from this year's coronavirus and in the past from Swine flu, Avian flu, and Influenza.

The outbreak in Wuhan was initially not recognized and dealt with ideally, but after a relatively short delay, confinement and travel restrictions have reduced the number of sick and dead and prevented wider spread of the virus within China.

Chinese scientists have published the complete coronavirus genome and Chinese medical experts have published their first hand experiences in dealing with this new viral pathogen. Chinese physicians also published their empirical experience that Remdesivir showed some effectiveness against the virus.

Let's put the warmongering and blaming others behind us.

Cooperation, collaboration, and diplomacy is the better course."
2020-04-30 13:07,Is this really a good use of our national resources? Or is it an investment in alibis for Trump to use in the upcoming election?
2020-04-30 13:09,"Not only should our intelligence agencies resist efforts by the Trump administration to tailor their reports for his political ends, the heads of those agencies should resign en masse and expose what is going on. This makes it all the more imperative for a full-scale investigation of the denials, dysfunction, delays, malfeasance and incompetence of Trump's response to the pandemic, with all those responsible held to account for the deaths they caused."
2020-04-30 13:14,"The effort to shift the blame for loss of 60000 American lives continues.  Again we see the bigotry and Xenophobic effort to stir up hatred toward fellow Americans. The first case in Wuhan was recognized in mid December. The Chinese CDC reported the  outbreak on December 31 on their Website, warned American officials by January 3rd, identified and published the virus sequence by January 22. In just over a month the sequence of a brand new virus was made public to the world, incredible. I predict that if the first case had occurred on American soil, Dr Redfield's operation would have taken several months to get the sequence to Chinese Officials, or if he did report the armagedon without permission of the Acting Secretary of Defense would have been  fired by Trump."
2020-04-30 13:53,"""Trump has spoken publicly about the administration’s 'very serious investigations' of the virus’s origin...""

That sounds very reminiscent of another 'very serious investigation' Trump spoke publicly about:

""I have people that have been studying it (Obama's birth) and they cannot believe what they're finding..."" 

Asked if he has assigned people specifically to search in Hawaii, Trump said, ""Absolutely.""

""Was it a birth certificate? You tell me. Some people say that was not his birth certificate. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. I'm saying I don't know. Nobody knows.""

Nobody knows how long Trump will sink.

2020-04-30 13:59,"Trump may be disingenuously pushing the laboratory accident origin theory because he believes it increases Chinese culpability and distracts from his inadequate response to the pandemic at home. However, there is still plausible suspicion and the theory cannot yet be relegated to wild conjecture just because Trump is touting it.

Ironically, Trump doesn’t realize that the lab accident theory has farther reaching implications than the wet market theory. If the coronavirus entered the population due to a lab accident, it would be difficult to restrict criticism to only the two Wuhan laboratories of interest. Notable biosafety incidents have occurred at top laboratories around the world—including the CDC. The necessary response would be a much wider reassessment of biosafety protocols within the global research community (see <a href=""https://doi.org/10.5334/bci"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.5334/bci</a>)."
2020-04-30 14:05,"The Chinese mentality and policy of deliberate obfuscation is a strange concept to Western developed democracies.  It is a natural by-product of never having to explain or defend one's actions.  So ingrained is this mindset, that they have also chosen to believe their own lies so as to protect their system. It is galling then to listen to such curt nonsense.  We owe it to the dead as well as to the living to demand the Chinese co-operate in an international enquiry as suggested by Australia and New Zealand."

Does this administration really think that anyone, other then the Cool Aid Gang, would believe them even if they did find out ""a truth that Chinese did something"" they are fools. After Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, and 3 years of Trump, this old man, Me, cannot even be sure I could recognize ""A Truth"" emanating from the Federal government or military industrial complex.
Remember the quote from Bruce Catton about the Civil War: ""It began as men had wanted. It did not go as men had planned."" It will not go as Republicans plan. Besides how would we pay for it. Sorry I forgot, we always have money for war. No money for health care, education,  or any other of this country's other problems. But War always, always."

Now, let our spies get back to investigating how Trump managed to do nothing for 2 months while he was being told of the threat to America and American lives.  That would be helpful in exposing who is to blame for the fact that America has the highest case and death rate per capita in the world."

If the world didn't already have enough reason to distrust the US, given its past actions and the fact that the President is a pathological liar, this will not help things. However, I have to comment on this idea of holding China ""liable"" for the virus: does the US really want to go down that route? If China is liable for the disaster caused by the coronavirus, how much more liable is the US for the current and impending catastrophe caused by climate change? The US is historically responsible for the vast bulk of the greenhouse gases that have been pumped into the Earth's atmosphere. Even worse, however, is that American political leaders, parties and companies have led the obstructionist bloc at the international level that has refused to accept the reality of science and have done all they can to prevent the world from responding effectively to this existential threat. There are many millions/billions of people the world over who would love to hold the US financially and morally responsible for the unfolding climate catastrophe that the US has done so much to create and exacerbate. If the US can sue China, everyone else can certainly sue the US."
2020-04-30 14:06,"Start with the answer and work your way back to the question.  This, from the guy who was number one in his class at West Point, and former head of the CIA.  That's not very comforting.  Is it time to buy Chinese war bonds?"
2020-04-30 14:08,"Blaming China, day after day. I have to admit the first reaction in China was, blame the messenger. In style. After it was realized this was a serious virus China has been open towards scientists over the world. The WHO have been very clear in their warnings in an early stage.

However almost all countries underestimated the effect of the corona virus. You can't blame China for calling it just a flue, a democratic hoax, Europe's fault ot advising to inject disinfectant as a treatment."

2020-04-30 13:02,"Trump is behind in the polling in battleground states. His brain trust( if you will) will desperately try any narrative any theory to change the subject. What Maxwell Smart was to secret agents, trump is to leadership and diplomacy. Trump can only steal the truth. He cannot do much about anything except distort what we as a nation already know. Like most desperate despots, he needs people to adore him. I expect him to play the China card for all that it is worth. It makes good politics in his mind. His sycophants need this. Need him. 

When he is out of office I hope some one does a trump play. Theater. There is great material to work with on this one"
2020-04-30 13:16,"So far, the public knows he's a liar, many thousands of times over, but is not holding him significantly accountable.  The media, with rare exception, has been reporting each of his new lies and distortions without sufficient challenge, giving credence to them.  This piece in the Times is a cautious but welcome exception in suggesting his perfidy."
2020-04-30 13:18,"Trump, in an attempt to help win re-election, will lie, cheat and destroy our relationship with China.
I believe the science that says this was not made in a lab; however, I do think China has to take some responsibility and permanently close all wet markets and get a handle on animal agriculture, which has lead to COVID-19 and several other major viruses, including SARS and avian flu."
2020-04-30 13:20,"So much for Trump's ""great, great relationship with China, folks."" The substandard president is really kicking a hornet's nest here. If Trump feels so comfortable with his response to the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., then why is he enlisting spies to go on the offensive against China? He's itching for a war, and with Trump in charge, my money is on China winning this conflict hands down. God help us."
2020-04-30 13:30,"He won't accept credible information from his intelligence agencies if he doesn't like what it says, but he has no problem strong-arming them to reverse engineer evidence to suit his agenda. 

The origin doesn't change the fact that Trump and the GOP so incompetently mismanaged our preparation and response. As with all things in his pathetic life, it's not his fault and he's going to move heaven and earth to find a boogeyman to deflect away from his failures. It's darkly amusing that he's also looking into his other security blanket: lawsuits."
2020-04-30 13:44,I would peg the probability of the virus originating in a Wuhan Lab as roughly equivalent to it originating in Trump's comb over.
2020-04-30 14:30,"Whether it came from a lab or or the ""wet market"" is not as important as why they did not tell the world about the virus on January 1 when they found out about it. Also, why did they restrict travel within China, yet keep international travel open? N. Y. Times a little help here?"
2020-04-30 13:04,"There has been no reason to think that this virus was man-made. Only those with an agenda or those who are ignorant of the drive to mutate that is inherent in virus.

2020-04-30 13:27,This is similar to the Bush administration pushing intelligence organizations to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as a way to justify war.  That was one of America’s worst blunders.
2020-04-30 13:43,"It’s still amazing though not surprising that nearly everything about Trump is the opposite of the truth. 

It’s one (despicable) thing not to care about the truth — but to embrace and push for the opposite of the truth consistently is another (deranged) matter. 

...and of course the pattern emerges in all his behavior from the story outlined here about the source of the virus to his wealth and dozens or even hundreds of matters in-between.

I wonder if we can save his brain for science and compare it to another opposite — Einstein’s."
2020-04-30 14:27,"It doesn't really matter where the virus started. It's here, but there's a ridiculous and dangerous subplot with brewing conspiracies that China unleashed this pandemic on their people, a dangerous view shared on social media is dangerous.

Remember when he blamed Obama 'spying on him' as a candidate, with not one scintilla of proof? And if that were not enough to condem Trump as a vile charlatan, let's recall Trump's lying hysteria about ""Birtherism"": 'you won't believe what we are finding out' nonsense?

Who knows whether the virus originated in a virology lab in Wuhan and got out of control or it came from the wet animal markets in Wuhan where all previous epidemics in China started.      Live animal markets where bats and exotic animals are still sold for human consumption have been the source of previous outbreaks and the CCP is doing nothing about it and the WHO would not demand the Chinese to ban those wet animal markets either. 
   China could have contained the virus within Wuhan by banning international travel of its citizens outside China just like they banned domestic travel within China. The World Health Organization was complementing China and criticized Trump for the travel ban from China.
  It is also true that Trump did not take this epidemic seriously and was calling it just a 'seasonal flu"" and did nothing until it is too late.

The USA should not and does not care how COVID-19 originated from China. Trump did the right thing to restrict travel from China and much later from Europe. But the panic button pressing response has been cowardly and based on made up numbers by experts who did not know what the consequences will be of the haphazard shut down and lock down that has wrecked the once lowest unemployment, 2 months ago.

Trump officials would serve the US better, if they can refocus on the economy and brave opening of the businesses in America while still keeping safe distance from each other and following safety guidelines of the CDC. The current economy in shambles has taken place during the 1st term presidency of the 45th president, in sharp contrast to the best of times just 2 months ago before Trump decided to go along with the advice of panic stricken scare mongers,when he should have done what the brave Swedes did. Let the country stay open for business. Right now the only 2 positives during the past 2 months have been low crime or mass killings and cleaner air.

2020-04-30 13:56,"Trump and Co will stop at no expense to spew viral propaganda, but won’t invest in tests, PPE or sensible policies to protect human lives. It’s all about Trump the Trickster, 365/24/7 ... calling back West Point cadets and families to give him a photo opportunity, standing at the podium every day lying through his teeth, pushing the country to open too soon, refusing to wear masks because he and Pence think masks make them look silly ... vanity, venality, greed, and total disregard for regular people ... they’re beyond deplorable. They’re criminal."
2020-04-30 14:55,"We can solve this.  The French were all over the Wuhan Virology Lab’s design and operations and they’d know if the lab was a biosafety hazard.

French and international visitors to the WIV lab, people experienced in biosafety, can confirm or refute the U.S. State Department cables.  French witnesses include Ambassador Oliver Guyonbarch, Pierre Lemond, Yann Moreau, Rene Courcol, Philippe Maurin, and a Jean Michel Hubert.  The French were involved in the WIV lab construction and safety protocols.  

Mainstream media has belatedly implicated the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s (WIV) alleged poor safety practices. The lab did high-risk gain-of-function research into coronaviruses before the outbreak.  If the Wuhan wet market is not the point of origin but is an amplification site, reasonable suspicion points to the lab.  (The SARS virus escaped a Beijing BSL-3 lab twice in 2004).  SARS-CV-2 might have escaped the WIV lab unnoticed.  No scienter. 

In 2018 U.S. State Dept. cables raised alarms about the lab’s biosafety after U.S. officials visited it.   In 2019, two months prior to the outbreak, USAID funding ended WIV research due to risks of creating lethal coronaviruses that might escape the lab, causing a pandemic. 

It’s ironic that the WIV lab hosted an international biosafety workshop from Oct. 15-25th, 2018 which brought together 24 foreign scientists from 22 countries (“Biosafety Laboratory Management & Technologies”).  These attendees might be potential witnesses."

2020-04-30 14:58,"Doing this investigation as a spy mission sounds not only ludicrous but also working against scientific cooperation.

If US scientists want to collaborate with Chinese scientists on this matter that would be great and we could share information and insights. In fact they are probably doing that. 

It makes absolutely no sense that the virus was released purposely into China in hopes it would some day reach the US through tourists or visitors meanwhile killing many around the world.

Accidents are always possible and it sounds like the Chinese facility has conducted an extensive investigation on its own. 


Let’s put our valuable resources into finding a cure or a way to control the virus. 

It’s scary that the Presidents response is a spy mission rather than a collaborative one for scientists around the world to work together."
2020-04-30 14:56,"The intelligence community should do their jobs properly  in a non political, factual and objective way.   No doubt China has a lot to answer for in this whole Covid crisis, but do it properly, at the right time. Intelligent agencies are not there to do the President's political dirty tricks bidding. The President has Rudy for that!  No doubt as any future investigation should look at Chines actions or inactions, so to should the investigation look at the Trump Administration incompetence and not spray disinfectant on Trump hoping it cleans him up.  In the end Trump cares not a jot about what China did or did not do. It's all about Trump's re election prospects.  Given the chaos and mismanagement of Trump's Presidency so far, within the White House, within Departments and Agencies, within the economy, within the country and within  the world, why would any credible professional intelligence agency, except Putin's, want to manufacture evidence to assist Trump getting out of the hot water he largely created."
2020-04-30 14:49,"It's exactly this type of pure speculation, this type of a lie, that brings many people to wonder about this paper:

""Mr. Trump’s aides and Republicans in Congress have sought to blame China for the pandemic in part to deflect criticism of the administration’s mismanagement of the crisis in the United States,"" 

Is it possible that Mr. Trump and his administration are seeking this because they wish to find out the truth? Writers for this paper would never speculate that way, even though it's more than likely why they wish to pinpoint the origin of the virus.  This article feels much like the many ones that assumed Mr. Trump colluded with Russia, and we all know that turned out to be nothing but a vicious lie, intended to somehow remove an elected President from office."
2020-04-30 14:51,"China has not and will never allow a full and open investigation into this matter. Whether intentional or accidental, this was an act of war on our country. In absence of an honest and transparent investigation, we should use all means including our intelligence agencies and judicial branch to fully investigate the source of this virus. Every American should demand that we use all means available to find the truth so we can be better prepared for any future threats. Don’t let your hatred for Trump play in the hands of Chinese and help them hide the truth."
2020-04-30 14:57,"Another disgusting concept that I could easily see the ""brainchild"" of our current ""leader"".

2020-04-30 15:06,"So Trump and his minions are considering that the USA sue China for $10 million for each American who dies from COVID-19.  Right now, that would be $600 billion and counting.  As usual, Trump is using some crass attack to throw out as red meat to his base to show how tough he is rather than trying to take a more viable approach to a problem.  We need to find out what happened to cause and spread this virus, and I can think of nothing worse to make the Chinese continue hide the truth than to threaten to sue them like this.  I don't know how else we and the other countries of the world can compel China to cooperate in such an investigation but lawsuits like this will not provide the solution."

2020-04-30 14:48,"An investigation is warranted and necessary. Many Western nations are involved in this process. To think we have adequate data to determine C-19’s origin and spread is wishful thinking. I applaud the administration in its investigation as well as other countries who are also seeking answers such as Australia, despite threats from Communist China.
Let’s not make everything about Trump, please."
2020-04-30 14:51,"If the NYT is going to cite analysts who ""are worried"", then provide the names of the analysts or don't include it in the story.

In the referenced paper the authors say ""Although the evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not a purposefully manipulated virus, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here.""  Nowhere do they use the word ""astronomical"" to reference the odds of a laboratory accident.

Fact - the Wuhan lab was experimenting on the coronavirus, obtained from bat populations.  Fact - the Wuhan lab had a previous accident involving the SARS virus.  Occam's razor says that the the odds of the coronavirus escaping from the Wuhan lab with a history of such accidents is more probable than a ""wet market"" accident.

Trump officials are correct in looking at the Wuhan lab as a source for the coronavirus.  Calling it an unsubstantiated theory and shading Trump for investigating it is ridiculous.  It obviously can't become substantiated unless it is investigated."
2020-04-30 14:52,"Is it too much to ask for our government to stop the blame game and to focus on the needs of its own citizens?  The Trump administration could have followed the lead of other nations -- the Australians among them -- and, assuming the worst, shared information about the emerging virus and then looked inward to assess our supplies and our capacity to meet the virus.  

Most people don't care where the virus came from. They do care about their family members, friends, and neighbors dying, and they want to be and stay well.  If Trump wants political mileage, that should be his focus."

2020-04-30 14:57,"Trump was warned many times by his own intelligence team of the pandemic evolving in China. Had he acted earlier back in Jan/Feb thousands of lives could have been saved & our economy not so savaged. But he denied & deflected the truth for six weeks hoping to ""talk"" his way out of it.

The more likely origin of COVID-19 is the so-called ""wet-market"" in Wuhan. I am the first to admit that I do not always have an appreciation or understanding of other peoples' cultures. But the practice of selling live exotic and domestic animals, butchering them on-site and selling them for food needs to stop. While we're on the topic, China is destroying my environment through the large-scale burning of coal. 
I demand that China commit to closing all wet markets immediately and to reducing their coal consumption by 50% within five years. Mr. Trump, I am requesting that you impose import restrictions (not tariffs) on an ever-increasing list of products from China until we get those commitments. I understand that this will disrupt the supply chain for products made elsewhere including those made in the US. It will also result in higher costs for my iPhone, flat screen TV, and all the bits of injection-molded junk sold at Walmart.  We'll work that out later. But we're now seeing that our very lives depend on taking action."

2020-04-30 15:01,"Trump is failing America horrendously by pointing fingers at Wuhan lab without sufficient scientific/circumstantial evidence. China has already reciprocated the allegations on US military which is more of a tit for tat response. Trump missed the train by not listening to pandemic alarm in December forwarded by intelligence agencies. He was not only complacent but complicit to covid 19 spread due to his gross misconduct. Trump exerted all his energies to get rid of Biden in November elections. And impeachment trial by house and senate has affected him to the extent that he is vindictive against American folks. How callously he has talked about expected deaths in America while ignoring all experts advices in early stages of pandemic. 

During his presidential tenure he has always moved from one controversy to another; utter disregard for US constitution and isolating America from East and west. He can't be trusted, only option is to vote him off and save US from his transgressions!"
2020-04-30 15:03,"In America and the 'West"",  I'm afraid that policy drives intelligence.  This become more than obvious during the Iraq disaster.  I congratulate NYT for reporting on this, and earnestly hope NYT would have done so with  Democratic government in charge."
2020-04-30 15:09,"What difference does it make if the virus escaped from a lab, if the virus was engineered and and released or if this virus is yet another zoonotic infection? If Trump is saying he's not responsible for a virus due to China's malfeasance or negligence, then he is also saying he's powerless against China's actions. In other words, he can be excused because that's asking too much; he can't be expected to fight a virus that China is responsible for.  I guess that makes Trump a wimp.

Yet he wants to be seen as a war time president, making this virus the enemy that came onto our shores. But real war time presidents don't waste time screaming the enemy came from China, so don't blame me. This is the logic of a crazy man.

Whatever the source, just consider how well Germany, South Korea and Taiwan dealt with the virus. No wimps there.

A corollary of the blame it on China excuse is that Trump was misled by China's cover up of the full extent of the epidemic in Wuhan. So I would ask how many deaths in Wuhan would it take for Trump to pay attention. And since Trump is the ultimate decider of fake news from US media, can't he figure out fake news from China? So Trump not only can't fight a virus from China, but he also fell for fake news from China. As I say, what a wimp of a president."
2020-04-30 15:09,"Why are Americans -- and many NYT readers -- so eager for the simple story ?

Personally, I loathe Trump and his cabal.  Foolish liars without integrity or decency.  

That said, the NYT and its readers should broaden their knowledge with Josh Rogin's Washington Post articles on this.

Xi Jinping and CCP should be economically dealt with  . . . Europe and the U.S. must rebalance downward their import trade with China.  All essential items related to this current calamity should henceforth be manufactured within the EU, UK, Canada, USA, Mexico.  Pharmaceuticals, medical equipment & supplies, protective & safety equipment.   Authoritarian nation states like China cannot be trusted."
2020-04-30 14:52,"To fix this foreign relations nightmare, all Xi has to do is remind Trump that Chinese-controlled banks hold over $200 Million of Trump's business debt, and poof! problem solved! 
Then Trump will suddenly start making quotes about Xi like this again:

""He’s now president for life, president for life. And he’s great. ""And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll have to give that a shot someday.”

Then Trump can get back to his true talents: blaming Obama and Hillary for all his missteps. Only then can our spies get back to figuring out how Trump is colluding with foreign Oligarchs to rig our elections again. Win-win situation for all of us, if we want to avoid WWW III and an even more complete economic ruin by provoking China."
2020-04-30 14:53,How does this help anyone but Trump? Americans want cheap goods from China and do not want to spend our money on weapons. The only thing to focus on is that Trump's ineptitude and lack of will to prepare for this pandemic is killing thousands of Americans who should not have died.
2020-04-30 14:53,"There’s nothing Americans love more than a good conspiracy.

I’m a veteran of the US Army, OIF and OEF. It’s amazing the detachment from reality that many Americans suffer from.

The picture of a soldier that most Americans have in their head seems to be something like Jack Ryan. Explosions, secret government assassins, clandestine labs working on doomsday technology.

In real life, on a Friday afternoon in Texas part of the safety brief given by the colonel is to not get drunk and go boating on Belton Lake. In real life, the most excitement that happens in garrison is when the USO gets a group NFL cheerleaders to sign posters and take pictures at the PX. Even when deployed, the most intense and terrifying aspects of conflict only last for minutes. The rest of the day is spent trying not to get in trouble when not on mission.

It’s much more fun to believe that a secret Chinese lab let a bio-engineered virus escape and now Trump and his clandestine forces are engaged in a high stakes game of spycraft. It’s a Hollywood movie.

It’s boring and pretty sad to believe that as a consequence of inhumane treatment of animals in a market in a poor area of China, a virus broke the species barrier and now we are all suffering the consequences. That’s not a Hollywood movie.

Do we think that there are not similar virus samples all over the US in laboratories who are inundated with the task of finding a vaccine or a medicinal cure? If there are such samples in the US, why not blame the CDC for starting the virus?

We elected insidious clowns to run our government and WE need to get rid of them in November."

If you play back recordings of everything of import over the last 3 or 4 years, whether it be how effective our response to COVID-19 or the growth we'd experience after giving corporations a big tax cut, this administration adheres tightly to that behavior.  They're counting on a serious lack of curiosity or critical thinking on the part of the American people to sustain that strategy.  It's why the press' role is just as (if not more) vital as any branch of the government in sustaining this democracy."

Any evidence there might have been was removed by the urgent need to disinfect the wet market area.  The facts, however, remain that:  1) there was a Chinese Centre for Disease control laboratory within 300 yards of the wet market;  2) that laboratory was operating a a low biosecurity level (BSL-2);  3) that lab was conducting research into corona viruses endemic in the horseshoe bat population;  4) there are plausible reports of workers from that lab becoming heavily contaminated while gathering samples from bat caves.  There is no suggestion that the lab was manufacturing variants of bat viruses : it was merely studying them as found in the wild.   It is perfectly possible that the Covid-19 virus reached the market via an infected worker from the lab, rather than via an infected animal.  Ultimately, it makes no difference which was the source:  no malice was involved, just unfortunate lack of care;  the Chinese government was not involved in any way.  It is ridiculous to suppose that an intention to harm the USA was behind the outbreak:  the danger it posed to China was just as great as that it posed any other country in the world."

Claiming you weren't from Africa where it started isn't a plausible defense. 

Now how much will America pay in reparations for slavery and Jim Crow? That was completely man-made and intentional, and very well documented over hundreds of years. If a naturally occurring disease without any intent is worth $10 million, I say the slavery reparations start at $1 billion per black person?

He even used federal law enforcement to literally hijack PPE procurement by states and hospitals so that hard hit blue states would be ill-equipped to protect their citizens.

I do think Trump is trying to shift blame and the idea of trying to fit the evidence to a conclusion is troubling but the idea the virus originated from the WIV isn’t particularly outlandish.

And it gave the US the justification to invade the country of Iraq under false pretenses, which had the long term consequence of convincing the nations of the world (Russia and China in particular) that the global hegemon was now writing its own rules of conduct, regardless of the evidence.

That's what we need to watch for here: Trump setting up the US for confrontation with China based on 'fixed' evidence that could eventually spiral out of control, even after he's out of office, due to 'politics'.  The intelligence agencies need to stand up to this pressure.  This commander-in-chief has spent 3 years vilifying them as 'fake news', now suddenly he wants something from them: a potentially doctored intelligence product.

 Scientists Are Tired of Explaining Why The COVID-19 Virus Was Not Made in a Lab
JACINTA BOWLER
20 APRIL 2020

It's a rumour that just won't die. When asked whether the COVID-19 virus was genetically engineered in a lab, scientists have already said ""no"" rather firmly, but the matter of the new coronavirus' origin is unlikely to be put to rest so easily.

Discussions around this subject have become even more pertinent since US government intelligence officials are reportedly investigating the potential source of the pandemic, focussing on theories that it may have originated in a laboratory, despite all evidence pointing to SARS-CoV-2 not being human-made.

""All evidence so far points to the fact the COVID-19 virus is naturally derived and not man-made,"" explains immunologist Nigel McMillan from the Menzies Health Institute Queensland.

""If you were going to design it in a lab the sequence changes make no sense as all previous evidence would tell you it would make the virus worse. No system exists in the lab to make some of the changes found.""

We’re living with failed Trump-GOP leadership desperate to deflect and cover up their own malfeasance in dealing with Covid19.

Two facts reported today underscore the deplorable federal response to Covid19 in the United States:

1. While Europe’s economy has suffered, it’s unemployment rate is significantly lower than ours, because their stimulus packages focused on protecting employees - vs. our pathetic program that funneled paycheck protection funds through rich banks to well connected “small” businesses, showered more taxpayer money on large corporations with no requirement they use it to retain employees, sent checks held up for Trump’s signature that won’t make a dent in average living expenses,  and led by Moscow Mitch is refusing to help the multi-millions of state and city employees around the country.  

2. Republican governors are threatening to cut off unemployment benefits for any worker who refuses to return to work notwithstanding the clear health dangers of doing so.

No foreign enemy could have done the damage to our country that Trump and his enablers have wreaked in 3 years.  They govern based on delusion and corruption.  Vote them all out on 11/3/2020."
2020-04-30 16:03,"The Trump administration's only skill sets are blame shifting, scapegoating and misdirection.

2020-04-30 16:31,"Taiwan/Vietnam/SouthKorea/HK are close to China, and have extensive people exchange with China, yet none is severely affected as much as USA,  US has become arrogant and ignorant, it thinks such third world disease won' arrive here, but virus knows no boundary.  If countries with much smaller intelligence budget would see disaster about to happen, what happens to our intelligence agencies with hundreds of billions of budget?  Trump administration never trusts or likes international org such as UN and WHO anyway, However rosy the WHO initial report on the virus, i doubt Trump govt would take it seriously.  My point is, the bucks stop with this administration.   We need to stop the fires first and then ask for a post mortem."
2020-04-30 16:20,"Oh, NOW the president is curious about what happened in China.  NOW he wants our intel on China. 

Why didn’t he care when our intel agencies were warning him about covid in the beginning of January in his all important daily intelligence briefings? 

Why does Trump spend zero effort in heading off a problem and spend so much effort in shifting blame?  

Trump never cared about us, only about himself, that’s why."
2020-04-30 16:28,"There is proof that the cases that infected people in New York did not come from Wuhan, but came from Europe. China has become the convenient  scapegoat that Trump needs to show that he is not to blame for his incompetent response to a VIRAL PANDEMIC. The virus does not care who was first or last in the chain of infection. Unless, and until, political leaders use the best tools we have for human solutions to this dynamic disease: Cooperate. Share. Coordinate. 
Sadly, Donald Trump has no qualities that will bring leaders together. We have to most anemic federal leaders at the helm of an international disaster. There is one solution that will help to solve our problems as we move forward: VOTE!"
2020-04-30 16:34,"Well actually that would be the only decent right thing that Trump and his administration could do in 3 and 1/2 years. Chinese government is the only responsible for this world massacre. Don’t you think it should be held accountable for it, for how it started and it was clearly under covered for a while?? A part from lying to the world’s face regarding to the number of deaths and cases. 
It should be organised an international trial and deeply investigated all that happened about this virus, and make China pay heavy sanctions for what it caused. Also it’s important to know and get all the dynamics for future viruses and epidemics. 
On top of it China is aggressively blackmailing the countries which are trying to investigate it, many in Europe and Australia to mention some. UNBELIEVABLE.
Obviously Trump and GOP does it only to pretend they’re dealing with this pandemic in the right way, and they’ve done all perfect, which is absolutely NOT! they’re the first culprits for any deaths and infections in the US. But to investigate China is also a must for any country of the world."
2020-04-30 16:05,"By pushing his fantasy blame game against the Chinese in an effort to shift responsibility for his dalliance in addressing the pandemic directly and successfully in the US, it seems Trump Inc is willing to initiate a very dangerous and open ended contest with China. 

 Since as we know that preceding  WW I the use of chemical weapons was at first only a threat, but then when the Allies became concerned enough to begin stockpiling them, the Germans felt that they had nothing to lose to be the first ones on the battlefield to use them. And then historians tell us that once war broke out it became a race to develop and employ newer and more powerful chemicals that could kill or maine as many humans as possible, in as little time as feasible.

So what is to prevent the Chinese who ( because of their postcolonial experience with the Western Powers and with the Japanese Imperialists during WWII) are already extremely paranoid about the possibility of sneak attacks and being dominated by other more powerful countries from actually developing a horrific biological weapon that does not have an easy antidote, once released? Or for that matter what is to prevent the clown show that we know is currently running the US from ordering their supplicants in the military and bioweaponry from doing so themselves, and then losing control of the devil bug they have created?"
2020-04-30 16:07,"This is the same thing as pressing Ukraine to fabricate a story to sell to the Trump base to benefit Trump.

If reporters were to investigate Trump's business history, would they find he pulled this in his business affairs?

This is diabolical however, maniacally worse than playing with fire, playing with biological warfare."

2020-04-30 16:21,"The coronavirus pandemic laid bare so many deficiencies in the US health care system, social safety net, job protection, federal and state coordination and government as a whole. But instead of trying to fix those deficiencies the Trump administration is wasting time and resources trying to blame someone else for their failors - just like every loser in life and self proclaimed ""forgotten person"" is blaming immigrants or other people/countries for their misery because they can't accept that their failors are their own.

And then there are those calling for suing China for the coronavirus: Are you serious? For once a global crisis is not caused by US actions and the first thing you think about is suing the one supposedly responsible for it? How about the world came togehter and sued the US for the damages caused by the financial crisis of '08? I don't need an intelligence report to know who caused that! Or what about the war in Iraq and all problems (ISIS, refugees) that were caused by it?"
2020-04-30 16:06,"Yes, the cause should be determined to ensure it doesn’t happen again but whether it was an accident or caught directly from contact with an animal doesn’t change the woefully inadequate response to the pandemic on the part of many officials around the world nor does it divert the blame for not acting sooner and more aggressively to save lives.  If all the Trump administration is looking for is a way to point the finger at somebody else for their failures, then the results of an investigation can’t be trusted and it’s a complete waste of time."
2020-04-30 16:07,"Even if the virus did escape from a lab, what's the difference?
Trump bungled the response. The alarm bells were ringing in December/January."
2020-04-30 16:26,"Maybe the spies should talk to American scientists who have worked in that very lab and have stated publicly- as in public radio interviews- that the lab is run properly and all precautions taken.   The most striking statement was that while scientists are in caves collecting samples from bats, in full hazmat suits, tourist are trapping around in the very same caves in tee shirts.

It just has to be someone else’s fault with Trump.  No matter what the cost or how absurd the effort."
2020-04-30 16:17,"It's full-on erasure of history, a la Stalin, as so well told through Orwell's masterpiece : Trump is trying to change history and the present narrative and is engaging a veritable army to saturate us in lies. He's an turbo-charged engine of mendacity.

2020-04-30 16:31,"I have a philosophical question: if the buck only stops with Donald Trump during the good times, can you honestly call him a leader? This deflection-of- blame-and-responsibility game is getting tired. What in the world does WHO and now a random Chinese lab have to do with our pandemic *response* capabilites?

We were caught flat footed by a low probability, high impact event. It just so happened to be on his watch. The fallout from the financial crisis just so happened to be on Obama's watch. 9/11  just so happened to be on Bush's watch.  And so on down the line. 

Every president is tested with a crisis. This is a admittedly a big one. Trump needs to get over it and get on with it, but in my view he's not up to it, which is why he's trying to pass the buck."
2020-04-30 16:10,"The American government apparently thinks it can keep China down.

Let’s hope the situation presented by this virus will give us a solution and proper leaders are brought to the forefront."
2020-04-30 16:21,"Trump's perception abilities are nonexistent.  Why would he be poking China in the eye with a sharp stick?  What we're going through right now, in terms of economic fallout from the present pandemic, is exactly what would happen if China pulled the plug on America, albeit on a smaller, but still devastating scale.  So that he can push his insane agenda with China - pressuring them to stop growing their economy and their technological prowess, both of which he's failed at achieving - he's now trying to blame them for the coronavirus.  In the middle of a pandemic and economic catastrophe our stable-genius president is trying to start an economic war.  No novelist would have dared to think they could convince Americans to suspend disbelief enough to swallow that plot line."
2020-04-30 16:22,"What do we expect. 
The Ukrainian really didn’t have to investigate the Bidens, just the announcement on CNN. Similarly, “conclusion shopping”, the Trump administration just wants a report saying Yes, we concluded..., 
No need to show a detailed investigation. 45 takes it and runs with it, while death toll keeps rising, and the complete disinterest in dealing with a crisis. 

Of course this is like the house that caught on fire, owner, instead of calling the fire department, started going around the neighborhood, door to door, asking for information related to the arsonist, while his home is burning to the ground. 
Foolish

2020-04-30 16:35,"Dick Cheney is still around. If anyone can pry cooked intelligence from spy agencies, surely it’s him. Or maybe Jared can channel the former dark lord. 

And then Trump can use his patented get-out-of-jail-free card by suing the Chinese government. Never mind that we’ll probably need Chinese cooperation to help produce the magnitude of tests and PPE and medicines and vaccines necessary to deal with the novel coronavirus, not to mention controlling an increasingly dangerous North Korea.

Trump needs a major deflection from his inept handling of our epidemic and a final death count that could be multiples of our Vietnam Nam casualties. But an epidemic isn’t a business deal gone bad, nor is his daddy’s fortune available to bail him out.

I’d donate money to a new memorial wall in DC so future generations never forget those who died due to the ineptitude of our worst president, a man who will probably be responsible for more American deaths than we’ve lost in all our undeclared wars since 1945. I’d also welcome Chinese contributions if they also commit themselves to better pandemic prevention."

It's bad enough that we have to chip in to pay Trump's salary and subsidize his nepotism by paying the salary of his children and their undeserving spouses. Now we have to chip in to help him cover up his incompetence, complacency and utter lack of proactive response to the coronavirus. We have to aid and abet his efforts to blame the Chinese for his failure. 

This may be the very definition of adding insult to injury."
2020-04-30 16:19,"So now trump will trust the information he receives from intelligence agencies.  That's quite a turn around.  There is no lie -- no matter how many times repeated -- that will disguise the failure of trump and his administration in handling the Covid-19 crisis.  It's unfortunate that there will be no lessons learned from the many levels of failure he perpetrated.  The only surprise is that he has not yet silenced Dr. Fauci, the one beacon of light in that group."
2020-04-30 16:26,"It is abhorrent that the administration is pressuring intelligence agencies to come up with a conclusion that comports with the president's re-election campaign. We saw the hideous results of  such tactics during the Bush administration. This is even worse since the current president is a disingenuous demagogue who could not care less about any of the people suffering. Nevertheless, it is equally vile that the Chinese government (the CCP--not the Chinese people, not Asian-Americans) allows live markets of wild animals in a city of 11 million. Can you imagine such a thing in the middle of Manhattan or London. So even if the virus did not come from a lab--and it looks like it probably did not, according to scientists--the CCP owes the world an explanation of how the virus started and what steps they are taking to insure that such an outbreak does not happen again. One does not need to be a right-wing looney to be appalled by the actions of the CCP."

2020-04-30 16:33,"Tomorrow, when China reminds Trump that he personally owns the state owned Bank of China 200 plus millions in loans and the US as a country is indebted to China to the tune of 1.1 trillion of dollars, it’s back to blaming dark-skinned immigrants.

Trump was slightly mad the last campaign period.

Today he is totally bonkers."

2020-04-30 16:37,"Don’t tell me, let me guess:  the big “intelligence” report will come out in late September.  Trump will hold big rallies congratulating himself on standing up to China, while taunting them with ad hominem lies and distortions. 

Meanwhile, China holds (directly or indirectly) about ¼ of U.S. debt.  We are busy printing money like it’s going out of style, so need to borrow a whole bunch more. Like it or not, lots of what we buy in the US is made in China with no near term alternative.   China accounts for roughly 80 percent of the world's rare earth production, a critical element for most electronics. China has the largest army in the world, concentrated in one place adjacent to some of our most important allies. About 25 percent of the total US soybean crop finds its way to China; during the last Trump trade war lots of farmers went bust. 

So Trump decides to completely trash the U.S. relationship with China for the sake of some marginal help bolstering his re-election prospects.  What could possibly go wrong?"

It has also shown the world that once the genie is out of the bottle, the most powerful nation on earth can be brought to it’s knees. No doubt Mr. Kim and Mr. Khamenei have taken note."
2020-04-30 16:45,"Most humans look to the skies when they think about how far we might travel.  But Trump and the Republicans seem to move in the other direction--they sink lower almost every day now in their odious refusal to support the scientific research that might find a cure for COVID-19.  At the rate they're descending in their vile attempts to attach blame instead of supporting efforts to find a cure or treatment for the virus, they seem to be attempting to rival the Kola Superdeep Borehole.

In addition to eliminating the department established by President Obama to fight pandemics, both Trump and Republican members of Congress have cut funding to the WHO—probably $400 billion a year, thereby undercutting global efforts to combat COVID-19.  This President and the Republican party are a danger to the health of every American, and must be defeated in 2020."
2020-04-30 16:50,"Interesting, not seeing the usual Trump supporters commenting anymore.

They were ""rockin"" when unemployment numbers were down and Trump had yet to face a major crisis.  So much boasting about ""no collusion, no obstruction"" and ""the Steele dossier/her emails"" and ""the perfect phone call"".  They could hardly contain their glee at each attempt to make him follow the rules of the constitution that failed.

Now... crickets.

I guess Trump's inaction leading to the deaths of over 60,000 Americans and counting was enough to take the wool from over their eyes.  Kushner? Seriously? I didn't realize that ""Pandemic Response Expert was on his resume.  It must have been below ""Middle Eastern Peace Expert"".

Deception and deflection underpin the program.  Moreover, Trump's ""advisors"" and the media. which is playing an interesting double-intermediation role, are a bit careless over the actual source trail of the virus.  Trump's advisors--Mnuchin, Kushner, Miller, Berkowitz, Cohn, Neuberger, Carr, Friedman and others, serve a special-interest agenda that is serving a number of foreign policy objectives, including Mnuchin's carefully crafted $2 Trillion+ Treasury transfer, most of which has already left the country.    Why Biden is considered the even more perfect retail stage prop should be obvious."
2020-04-30 16:57,"If we are ever to find out the actual origin of COVID-19 and to have any confidence in its accuracy, this administration should back off.  Their demonstrated lack of truthfulness and willing to push fabricated stories for monetary and political gain will forever taint whatever story this administration decides to push. No one in the world believes American claims about the start of the Iraq War, and when Trump and company are done, no one will believe anything the American government says about anything.  In the end, perhaps this is Trump's goal."
2020-04-30 16:54,"Blaming bats is too easy, probably means nothing (as there is zero chance to make a definitive conclusion about that), and sounds like a joke, in addition to being the almost perfect outcome for China.

Truth will never be known since this is an obvious political issue.  Those who are benevolent to or trust the Chinese side are very naive.  However politically motivated the efforts on the US side are (and they certainly are), I would still pay much more attention to them rather than the findings of any other organization for a very simple reason that the key cooperation in any of this must come from China which, of course, will never allow any openness or honesty in this matter."

2020-04-30 16:57,"Fellow NYT readers may be interested in the April 15, 2020 Scripps Research Front Row Lecture given by Dr. Kristian Anderson, the genomic epidemiologist mentioned in the article. The lecture, “Outsmarting Emerging Pathogens in an Interconnected World”, is available for streaming online on the Scripps Research website. Briefly, it is a Scripps Research public community outreach lecture that discusses the work that is being done in Dr. Anderson’s lab regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the lecture, Dr. Anderson discusses the scientific evidence that the animal to human transmission of the virus likely occurred once sometime between mid-November and mid-December 2019. Dr. Anderson also explains why respiratory track infections from the SAR-CoV-2 virus in younger patients are less severe compared to the more severe infections seen in older patients. I found this lecture very informative and worth the hour spent viewing it."
2020-04-30 16:20,"The fixation on blaming China for the Covid 19 outbreak may be an emerging campaign strategy.  This potential strategy is in addition to deflecting attention away from Trump's failure to plan and respond quickly to the pandemic.  That strategy may be along the lines of:  (1) China can't be trusted because it concealed information and allegedly developed the virus;  (2) Joe Biden is a friend of China;  (3) Joe Biden went to China with his son Hunter, and Hunter made a lot of money from China;  (4) Therefore, you can't trust Joe Biden.  This scenario only succeeds as long as people ignore or are not reminded that Trump has repeatedly called  Xi Jinping a friend and Ivanka Trump does business in China.  Given that the economy is presently in shambles, Trump may be willing to risk demonizing China and destabilizing this country's relationship with China in a no holds barred effort to win reelection."
2020-04-30 16:50,"What is most disconcerting is that this subject has been politicized.   With Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo making public comments on this at this time with statements such as this:

-Mr. Trump has spoken publicly about the administration’s “very serious investigations” of the virus’s origin and China’s culpability.-

At this time what we need most is cooperation and not agitation.  If we are performing covert analysis, it should have been kept entirely covert.  With the cover blown, whatever covert advantage we may have had is now entirely gone.

The level of utter incompetence in the handling of such a matter should be self-evident.

Yes, we do need to understand if the CDC backed research that Fauci was involved with regarding Coronaviruses from bats is linked to the outbreak if at all possible.  We should acknowledge our own culpability.

We need cooperation with the Chinese.  The idea that they infected themselves through an accidental release is scary and it should bring pause to whether we shouldn't set global standards for safety for all research into highly infectious pathogens.   We don't get there by politicizing and finger-pointing. We get there by negotiating and listening. 

At this moment of great economic and social fragility, the last thing we need is a war or a lack of economic cooperation with China.   

We do need to hold China accountable.  We need to speak quietly.  We already have a big stick.  Diplomacy with authority."
2020-04-30 17:49,"This article presents this issue of virus origin as if it is a Trump vs. world or Trump vs. science issue and this is unfortunate. Because there are many countries in the world who are also somewhat or quite skeptical about the market origin of this virus. Australia has leading virologists and many are not certain that the virus originated in the live market.  And this: ""Analysis of the first 41 Covid-19 patients in medical journal the Lancet found that 27 of them had direct exposure to the Wuhan market. But the same analysis found that the first known case of the illness did not.""   That is from the Guardian from a few days ago on 27 april. There is a lot of uncertainty  around this issue.

Secondly, wherever it came from Trump (and the American Establishment) still did a shit job of handling it.

This run the risk of actually making the false Chinese narrative look better.

Be carful casting blame.  RNA viruses have the potential to change and dodge vaccines so it reinfects.  We have the largest infected population so a greater chance for it to mutate a s reinfect the world by our lack of action to deal with it.

Can we blame the wealthy capitalists flying around who spread it?  Or do you believe poor people spread it?"

It doesn't make a rat's hind end if the Chinese or WHO or anyone else were ""lying to the world"". Trump didn't need China or WHO to tell him what he needed to do ... every medical and emergency service professional in and out of the US government was doing that as early as December, even folks without access to Trump's resources ... like Biden! ... were telling him in JANUARY what to expect and what we should do before it got here.

If he thinks, as suggested by other articles, that China deliberately is trying to prevent his re-election and goes ahead not only blaming China for a delayed disclosure but also with suggestions that the virus was made in a lab in China, the racism against Asian Americans is going to get exponentially worse leading up to the November election, and continue for a long time after. There are 30 million new unemployment claims. People will be looking for scapegoats.

But since there are less than 50 BSL-4 labs and tens of thousands of wet markets, the probability that the lab is the source of an outbreak in a location with a lab and a market is higher than 90%. 

In other words: More people are bitten by dogs than tigers. But if you find yourself in a location with a dog and a tiger and you get bitten, I would not blame the dog (unless your pieces of your pants are still in his mouth)."

Now they're conclusion shopping a conspiracy theory bound to appeal to their base.

2020-04-30 17:02,"President Trump’s pivot toward the Chinese to place blame for the SARS Cov2 outbreak appears to be a classic play of disinformation, distraction and deflection. 

We know for this to work well there has to be a kernel of truth in the claim. And there is some truth to his complaint: there was a time delay, reports say the wet market was cleaned and scrubbed before independent forensic studies could be done, there is a history of mishaps at labs, they do study coronavirus; and the CCP muzzled a doctor who later died of Covid19. This doesn't look good for the Chinese.

But what the President and his people are silent about is the financial relationship of Americans in the research into what is really a “classified secret” matter: adding “gain of function” attributes to a natural corona virus so the virus can then be studied for its virulence; this is the dark secret that the president won’t talk about because Americans also engage in this kind of study, or may have financed the very leak, or “mistake” the Chinese made in losing control of a bug.

Finally, an international tribunal that can do a full blown forensic exam of the DNA of the SARS Cov2 is necessary; mention has been made by people in the know that this novel corona virus has snippets of HIV inserted into virus; is is assumed that inserts were bio-engineered to provide “gain of function” to enhance capacity to test for virulence and then research a vaccine: this is one story I have gleaned from the internet."

NYT and the WP have reported that many times the daily briefing books contained intelligence reports about the coronavirus in China and the threat it posed for the world. He did not pay attention then because he doesn't read? it was too complicated? did not conform to his conspiracy theory? This reminds me of the investigation into the origins of the FBI investigation of the Russian interference in the 2016 election. Investigate the investigators. All of this is an attempt not to take responsibility for the current carnage in America.

1 Corona virus first jump from animal to human in Wuhan market and created the pandemic.
2. virus created in the lab and that the Chinese scientist either deliberately or inadvertently release it to the public.  
3.    Non-symptomatic carriers of the virus could have brought the virus to Wuhan and infected others through human to human contact. 
4. At this juncture,  one cannot exclude the possibility of human to human transmission as the origin of the virus epidemic in Wuhan, but there is no question of the accelerating spread of the virus is the result of human to human contact between asymptomatic individuals with others who are more vulnerable to the virus.  This is the lesson worth remembering as we reopen  the States and develop procedures to limit or control further spread of the virus in the US."
2020-04-30 17:05,"No country would deliberately release a deadly virus in their own country.  With no vaccine available, and no human engineering of the virus it was clearly an accidental release.

Ah, China.  Reporters, please keep an eye on this but don't let it distract from what he is doing besides trying to ble others and shock people. I don't doubt labs have accidents.  But given the studies so far and their results, this smacks of Iraq and WMD all over again, as the authors note. And trump's idea seems to be that you get a lot of money and things are fine.

This President doesn’t want to take the blame for anything. I’ll acknowledge that it is really not his fault that COVID-19 exists. 

But his response, and our federal government’s response, full of denials and wasted time, was, and is, in his control. He can rail against taking the blame for his response to COVID-19 all he wants. It doesn’t change that HE was in control of his response. The media wasn’t in control, nor the Democrats, or the governors. He was in control of his response. He owns how he responded, whether he likes it or not.

There is no court with any authority to adjudicate the matter.  Any 'damages' the US wants to attempt to impose on China through whatever means available, the US can do whenever it wants regardless of facts.

Bending intelligence to indicate error on the part of China whom he could then feel justified in punishing (let's sue China) would be useful to Trump in his quest to deflect  criticism of his own egregious negligence domestically, while contributing to his  fiction which he expects will win over popular opinion and propel him into a second term in office. Never one to play the long game, he seems unconcerned with the danger of engaging in a frightening conflict with a nuclear-armed economic giant. What madness this?

Why even try to get agents to find a connection at this point? Why doesn't Trump just do what he always does? Which is to go on television, lie through his teeth, and at the end say, ""Who knows? No one really knows!"", and call it a day.

2) violence against Asian communities in the U.S. - then ten years later a great book illustrates how 1) intelligence agencies were pressured to reveal info they didn't have, and/or 2) the virus transferred from bats to people elsewhere long before Wuhan had a single case"

Making broadcast statements that ""China has raped..."" the US during MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN campaign speeches was just the beginning. 

Trump has killed the best means to partner with any country - diplomacy. 

Frankly, as a critic of China (genocide against the Tibetans) I am impressed with their management of the virus, more than their failures.  However, they could have gone to the press to get out a message to the people of the world as to how  SARS-CoV-19 virus is extremely infectious."

Yes, Trump is nuts, and yes, scientists are in broad agreement that this was a zoonotic virus that jumped to humans, but can we not (readers, and editors, of the NYT) hold two concepts in our head at once?

Trump's entire life is filled with lawsuits against anything he can dream up.  He will figure out away to benefit from this even though it's not a personal or business lawsuit.  

It is also evident that this is politically motivated to keep his cult voters happy.  It is fuel for continuing racism and and anti-immigration and their love of conspiracy theories.

Even more specifically, they feared that such research might unleash a form of coronavirus, and even cut funding.
Now those dire predictions have come true, and we know we can't take China's word for what happened.

Given all that, can anyone give a good reason why we should not investigate this ourselves? Without resorting to saying ""Trump is bad"" or ""I hate Trump,"" what's wrong with the president suggesting an inquiry?"

We must hold those accountable, whether they are from China, Russia, Iran, or the country whose ruling party lifted its moratorium on bioweapon development in 2017, the United States.

It appears that Trump hopes that by finding that the Covid-19 pandemic is the result of a bioweapon, he will be absolved of responsibility for his late and inadequate actions in response to the virus and the deaths of over 60,000 (and counting) Americans.  He should not underestimate the American people and understand that if a bioweapon were involved, we expect an even more timely and more robust response that even his scientific/medical advisers recommend, because the use of a bioweapon would be an act of war.

Scientists  who are looking at the virus' genome can't determine where the initial infection took place.  They can conclude it's highly unlikely to be engineered in a lab, but they can say nothing about weather a naturally mutated virus first infected humans in a lab vice the wet market down the street, based on the genome of the virus.

That something came from a lab doesn't mean it was modified or engineered intentionally from humans.

Who is surprised? Who isn't appalled? Trump botched the pandemic, and his botching of the pandemic has deep-sixed the economy. He quick needs to find some un-white people to blame. Or he might get indicted not reelected. What good are independent and nonpartisan intelligence agencies if they won't join the Trump toadies?"

2020-04-30 17:51,"The White House's response to the pandemic has been staggeringly incompetent. Meanwhile, Trump is forever obsessed with finding scapegoats. When you are a citizen in Trump World, there's no leadership, no hope, no compassion for the scared, sick and dying. There are only enemies to blame (China, the liberal media, Democrats, immigrants)."
2020-04-30 18:03,"This report only covers a tiny corner of the anti-China campaign. Notwithstanding the initial Chinese Party connivance for several weeks, the exploitation of this event by Trump-Kushner is far more devastating than the event itself. Currently, the Falun Gong cult seems to be the chosen agency. They're printing and distributing (door-to-door, by millions of copies!) the Trump talking points detailed in this report. In a ""newspaper"" format, 4-color no less.
Imagine the money being poured into this campaign. By the Trumpers? Times, get on the story please. At the very least, it's a suspicious 'shiny object' to deflect from the Kushneri Regime's & its growing isolation abroad."

2020-04-30 17:34,"If the virus is indeed a Chinese plot, it will reveal the most serious failure in the Trump Presidency: failure to protect the country from an invading foreign enemy. A particularly incompetent and egregious failure, because protecting the country from the ""invading foreigners"" has perhaps been the hallmark commitment Trump has made to his base as well as a great victory he has been claiming."
2020-04-30 17:42,I thought we weren't supposed to trust the deep state.
2020-04-30 17:18,"IF this is a ""Chinese Virus"" ( and a very big IF), who can really blame them?

Trump has been poking that hornets nest since before he took office. Name calling, provoking, lies, trying to make Americans think he made such great ""deals"" ( where are those sales anyway? Why doesn't the NYT follow up on that great trade deal?)

China is going to  run out the clock on Trump. They don't care about his silly theories about where Covid started....they have about 6 months to go til our election, and this nightmare will be far from over by then,especially if Trump enacts reckless ""reopening"" strategies ( Although I think we CAN reopen, with careful precautions and testing to monitor)...

Trump thought that he could gibberish his way into making China bend to his will. Didn't work. Now, WE have to pay for his BIIIIGGGG MOUUUUTH.  And China will wait. They are patient. They can read, and can see Trump's popularity sinking by the hour.

So they hold back on purchases. Drag thier feet. Quietly wait.

And Americans will go right back to buying boatloads of Chinese made stuff because...it's cheap, and they LIKE it. They really don't want expensive ""made in America"" goods. They SAY they do, but Walmart, Target, Costco wouldn't be here, stronger than ever, if that were true.

And now, thanks to Trump, that's the only places most can afford to shop. What's next? School clothes in 3 months... 

Trump better do something beside bray ""Jina did this"".

 That same old song won't play this time."
2020-04-30 18:02,"The US is simply doing its job. Since China is hardly open about how this virus originated, then the US, as the only country with suitable resources, is quite right to try to find out how this outbreak happened.

But the NYT as ever loves to blame Trump, even when any US President would have agreed to such an investigation."
2020-04-30 17:26,"Let us assume that Trump is smart and realizes that he cannot keep China down in the long run. So what is his strategy? If leaders feel that they are cornered, they often seek an external enemy so that their followers have something to unit against. A year ago I would have bet on Iran. Now it seems to be China. I seriously hope America will not be stupid enough to follow him down that path. That would be a powerful argument against the idea of democracy as the best system of government."
2020-04-30 17:42,"Under the Trump regime, we no longer expect our government to tell the truth.  Trump himself is on record has having told over 18,000 public lies since becoming president.   The third world sycophants he has surrounded himself with on his Cabinet are to a man and woman all unethical grifters.  Every day we read how: the EPA, OSHA and the CDC are being diminished; Inspector Generals are fired for doing their jobs; international treaties like NATO and international organizations like WHO are disparaged.  So today we read how our intelligence agencies' finding are being distorted and politicized by Trump's toads.   The Trump regime is corrupt and inept from top to bottom."
2020-04-30 17:42,We have a President who thrives on conspiracy theories to obviscate his incompetence at handling the crisis. Quite frankly it makes no difference bat or lab.  Thousand of Chinese people died and I doubt that they were used as guinea pigs in some Stalinest like medical experiment.  Trump's ego is so fragile that he can never take responsibility for anything that happens that doesn't reflect well on him.  He briefings let the world see how truly pathetic he is.
2020-04-30 17:32,"What will proving that change?  Or is this Trump's way of distracting us from the real issues?  He does put on a good show.  But that show doesn't change the fact that he dithered, continues to be a hindrance, and that the country is going into an economic tailspin because of his administration's incompetence."

 ""A group of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) has been identified in horseshoe bats. SL-CoVs and SARS-CoVs share identical genome organizations and high sequence identities, with the main exception of the N terminus of the spike protein (S), known to be responsible for receptor binding in CoVs. In this study, we investigated the receptor usage of the SL-CoV
S by combining a human immunodeficiency virus-based pseudovirus system with cell lines expressing the
ACE2 molecules of human, civet, or horseshoe bat.""

2020-04-30 18:03,"OKAY, let's do a small exercise.

We will ask the following question to a College Entrance Exam, largely based on critical thinking -
1. An outbreak starts in a city, which also houses more than one lab doing extensive research on very pathogens that caused the outbreak. 
2. A number of papers have been published by researchers at these labs about the class of very pathogen which caused the outbreak.
3. The initial samples of virus and records from the outbreak have been destroyed. And no investigation team has been allowed to the hospitals or the labs.
3. There were reports filed two years back by some unbiased agencies that bio-security of these labs was far from satisfactory.
4. The government of this place has indicated the pathogen has started in a wet market, but has allowed no investigators. 
5. The government has massive interest in not admitting any 'industrial accident' as that reflects poorly in front of both its domestic and foreign audience, which have been told it has become a 'superpower'. 

Given all this please provide probability of the outbreak starting -
a) in one of the labs located in the area,
b) in the wet market, 
c) elsewhere

It doesn't matter that there is no evidence whatsoever that SARS-COV-2 originated in the Wuhan lab. All evidence is precisely that it did not. This is simply a diversion from the criminal ineptitude of the US government and businesses, and just another angle to ratchet up the anti-China campaign as Wall Street engages in a turf war with the Chinese capitalists over profits.  The Chinese didn't throw tens of millions of American workers into unemployment. These Chinese didn't convert old age homes into death camps. No, that was Wall Street and Washington. Trump and company want us to blame the Chinese for that. No. I blame US billionaires and their servants in Washington."

The latter explains the WIV’s gain-of-function research, creating deadlier chimera viruses in the lab, just like this virus, and the high risk of it starting a pandemic.  The co-authors from China, Harvard and UNC Chapel Hill were very clear that it was extremely dangerous work with significant risks of worldwide contagion."

This is, of course, no matter at all to Trump and his cronies, who live in the world of alternative facts. Instead of actively working to achieve the testing numbers we so desperately need, and instead of encouraging the social distancing history teaches us actually works, this administration, as always, is playing the blame game.  Same old, same old--if he could perp-walk the virus out of the WH as he did Vindeman, a true American hero who testified at his impeachment  (along with his uninvolved brother), we'd see the Secret Service marching the virus away in lockstep.

Having said that, I think China should be held accountable whether the virus was created in a laboratory. The Communist party has taken away all rights of Chinese people. But for some reasons, the CCP can't stop people from eating wildlife that can cause the type of catastrophic situation we are in now.
How many of those coronaviruses originated from China in the last 20 years? What has China done to stop it? Nothing.
But the CCP goes all the way to stopping and controlling Chinese people live but not when it comes to things that can actually cause damages worldwide.
 
I'm not a scientist, but why did the virus originate from the city where China has its virus laboratory? Is Wuhan the only region where wildlife is consummated in China? 
 
Seriously why would anyone believe what China has to say? The CCP only cares about the CCP and its dear leader Xi. They've lied in the past, why should we believe them now?

How about reporting that the intel services were looking into the origin of the virus and how it spread through and beyond Hubei province? 

How about reporting on how intel services were looking to determine if the Chinese knew of the virulence of the virus even as they were allowing international flights from Wuhan?

If Trump were smart-we would be sending as many of our scientists as they think they need, and study the bats and other wildlife around the world to become more familiar with the vast variety of potential threats. Also to study the animals that seem to be completely immune and how we might simulate those properties for humans.

In our rush to condemn Trump on this issue, we do ourselves an enormous disservice. When unbiased scientists from around the world are permitted to conduct their investigations unimpeded by and without fear of coercion from the CCP, then the administration’s concerns can be chalked up to bad faith politics. Until then, let’s demand the CCP be held to account.

Meanwhile, US ""spies"" are exposed to risk every day, regardless of whether there is a pandemic, for the benefit of US national security. This pandemic has forced us as a society to consider how we weigh human lives, whether they are medical workers or vulnerable populations like seniors. Can we not spare the same consideration for the brave men and women of the US intelligence agencies (who, like medical workers, should only ever be placed in harm's way when it is absolutely necessary)? Does pursuing baseless and/or debunked conspiracy theories rise to such a standard? I think not."
2020-04-30 18:38,"The CIA should just torture someone and get the investigation over with. As Trump says, ""Torture works""."
2020-04-30 18:44,Nonsense.   We do not need this disinformation.
2020-04-30 19:20,Sounds like Weapons of Mass Destruction redux. Maybe Trump can get Colin Powell to come out of retirement to make their case.

2020-04-30 18:45,"1. Lets (assume and) go by the theory that the Coronavirus originated from a bat and then moved to pangoline and then to man.

2. As per China's official reporting in January, there were 80K people affected and 3-4K people died. This was prior to the time the virus spread to other countries.

3. 80K cases do not happen overnight. It would have taken at least 1 month from person 1 to person 80K.

4. Within that 1 month, the Chinese government should know very well about the Coronavirus, how fast it spreads, death within 2 weeks, etc.

5. Having known the details it is the responsibility of China to alert the world community about the Virus so the rest of the countries will be protected.

6. China did not do this. Evading responsibility is a crime. As a result the world was not prepared and virus spread to the entire world and crippled economy of most countries.

7. China should be held accountable for the crime and pay the price.

8. Finally If the virus originated in Shangai or some other chinese city then it is a different scenario. The virus originated from Wuhan; right where the Virus research laboratory is; it is very possible the Virus escaped accidentally from the Wuhan labs that should also be investigated. 

9. If the virus originated naturally why would china hide the information from the international community. They'll show proofs by allowing the international investigation.

10. for the sake of 200K people died worldwide by the virus an investigation must be made."
2020-04-30 19:17,It is just a matter of time before Trump starts to walk around the White House in the early hours of the morning muttering to his predecessors.
2020-04-30 19:04,"""The effort comes as President Trump escalates a public campaign to blame China for the pandemic.""

As I understand the facts, the Pandemic is very likely either a result of negligent regulation of a dangerous wet market with conditions supporting cross species virus transmission or poor regulation of a virology lab.  Either way the CCP, in my opinion owns the origin.  After that there was the harsh treatment of life saving whistle blowers one of which died of the virus and the other that was reported missing (Dr. Ai Fen).  The there was the Jan 14th WHO tweet about the most contagious devastating virus the world has seen in 100 years reading "":

""World Health Organization (WH0)
@WHO
Jan 14
Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China""

If the Chinese Communist Party shut down domestic travel with Wuhan as those same people traveled from Wuhan throughout the world.

The Pandemic, in my opinion seems to have happened as a result of CCP negligence.  Much of the worlds response was blunted by minimizing reports to the world including discipline of whistle blowers.  I have heard Taiwan was warned by Whistleblower and as such was well prepared and has z very low per capita death rate. 

Lastly the article opens with preassure to ""to hunt for evidence"".  What's wrong with evidence."

2020-04-30 18:55,"A few questions to keep freedom of thought and opposing opinions alive. 

Why do people keep saying we need to cooperate with China instead of blaming them? Doesn’t everyone understand that China will NOT allow cooperation? Multiple countries have tried to send teams into China to help figure this thing out and they aren’t allowed. NYT should know better... even they WERE KICKED OUT. 

How does genetic makeup of a virus proving it isn’t man made eliminate the possibility it was released by a lab? If a bat with this virus is in a lab, then a naturally occurring virus would also now be present in that lab. Which could easily be accidentally released from said lab. 

How does China’s culpability remove or cover Trump’s culpability? Even if China purposely caused this to happen, NYT won’t allow China to rule the news. Trump’s errors will still be front page. It is delusional to think Trump could change the story when every news outlet but FOX will disregard China’s culpability in that case.

It is NOT the knockout blow to the lab leak or lab tweak hypotheses that the authors claim. Nonetheless, I concur that a direct jump from bats to humans is still the most probable origin.

A full investigation into the origins of SARS-CoV-2 needs to use all our tools of science and of spycraft.  It is axiomatic that the CCP (the Party) will deny and cover-up any involvement of the two national virology labs in Wuhan.  Furthermore, they reprimanded Wuhan ophthalmologist Li Wenliang for raising the alarm in December, 2019. He died soon thereafter at age 33 from the virus.

To be realistic, the Republicans are pragmatically looking into a lead the may or may not prove correct. The only thing politicized here is this news article headline. I'm sure Trump isn't pressuring anyone to fabricate a link between Wuhan's lab and the virus: he doesn't have to since it could well exist. Either way, China hasn't (1) taken political responsibility; (2) paid for the billions of dollars in lost business; (3) paid for the months if not years of unemployment problems. No matter how cynical Democrats are, Trump didn't start the virus, and the people who did create the virus and covered up the virus should be held accountable. Democrats are twisting this argument to hold Trump accountable, but if they were lawyers, they would recognize the difference between an original cause and a subsequent cause. Trump is just a messenger and a middleman. The Chinese are the origins of the virus."
2020-04-30 19:28,"I offer that rather than ordering US spies to seek a link that shows a lab in Wuhan, China , was the origin of the Covid 19 virus, it's not what this is about.  What we see clearer every day is the abysmal response of the President.  Nearly two months (Jan-Feb) were lost on his constant denial's of the approaching danger that we were walking into.  Failure to read daily intelligence reports, failure to heed warning by our Healthcare advisor's and his constant nearly daily happy talk, that all is well and I know what I'm doing.  This is the indictment that he will never be able to walk away from.
Let's just say that we are very unfortunate to be living  through such a dangerous period being led by the most incompetent President in our history.  President Trump is proving everyday that is not as smart as he thinks he is, rather how dumb he his.  November cannot arrive soon enough."

2020-04-30 18:42,"Trump has faith in what Putin and Xi says than what our intelligence agencies say, because he believes the existence of deep state in our intelligence agencies threatening his authority. That is the reason he denied the presence of threat to our nation due to Corona virus despite the fact our intelligence agencies warned the threat back in December. Now, he wants to sue China for keeping the threat secret and make China the scapegoat. Trump can try all the tricks in his bag, the fact that he is responsible for making things worse is pinned on him firmly. Presidential leadership is completely missing. He may do better if he tries to explain the reasons for his delayed response to the threat."

There is factual data on how Trump ignored and down played the virus (such as ignoring the intelligence, countless statements such as everything is under control, 15 cases will go to zero and so on ).

His actions are no different from the alleged actions of China he is complaining about."

2020-04-30 19:28,"Deeply ironical that Trump, who expended so much effort to conceal his misdeeds with Ukraine and our nation's ambassador, will now suddenly conduct an extremely thorough and scientific investigation of the origins of this deadliest of viruses. While many have cited the obvious farce peddled by G.W. Bush and his team of warmongers at the UN, there's an illuminating event told by Tacitus (Ann. 16.1-3) of the emperor Nero, a gilded narcissist and lover of spectacle, who zealously launched a serious state mining expedition to North Africa to find the legendary gold of the mythical queen Dido. The theory of the gold's existence came to Nero from the dream of a charlatan. Predictably it all proved an abject failure and something of a humiliation for an emperor who was adept at concealing his failures and crimes. And while the emperor punished his source, it seems that not a few of our liars and perjurers, particularly highly placed ones, ever need answer in our empire - I mean republic!"
2020-04-30 18:50,"Trump has never had a problem with fabricating evidence. One thing that would give most of us pause is how embarrassing and incriminating it would be to get caught, but Trump knows the GOP has his back and there is absolutely nothing below their ethics."
2020-04-30 18:36,"This is a important piece of information that we all should pay attention. 

By now it’s no secret that our current president is skilled at crowd manipulation and likes to resort to hate. He is likely to inflame the frustration towards the virus and China to assist his campaign and redirect how he mismanaged the Corvid-19 crisis as it is currently unfolding in the US.

Some people may not be fond of China, either out of convenience or from the negative depiction from most of the media, big or small (just learned that the free Epoch Times for example are funded by group with the main focus to portray China in a negative light anyway possible).  But the chaos we are facing now from the virus and the economic misery we will be experiencing soon in the US can only be attributed to Trump and his administration. 

The press, NYT included, and anybody who would like the US to have a more functional government and a moral president in the White House comes November, should all be aware of the false China conspiracy theory, and vigorously deflate the agenda that Trump is pushing on us."

2020-04-30 19:02,"A very useful article. The fact is that NOTHING the Trump administration says about this pandemic is the truth. EVERYTHING it puts out there has been refuted by the entire world scientific community. Of course, some Democrats and some media have been lying too. It is fundamentally  a very bipartisan thing. Pelosi & Co. could convene hearings to expose all the lies and sink Trump's ship, but there is a problem with that. Pelosi has been conducting her own anti-China crusade for decades, so it is not in her interest to expose Trump's lies. There would be a danger that her stock in trade lies could  suffer too, so best keep quiet. If this means giving up the best bludgeon to beat Trump with, so be it."
2020-04-30 19:10,"It is an entirely scientifically plausible theory that the Wuhan lab was studying the novel corona virus, which they discovered in bats, and leaked it intentionally or unintentionally into the community.  It is right that our government officials should be concerned about this possibility."
2020-04-30 19:15,"This is not an ""unsubstantiated theory.""  There is substantive evidence that bat viruses were being investigated at this lab.  There was no evidence that bat viruses were at the marketplace near the lab.  The claim that the virus came from the market has less substance behind it than a hypothesis that it was inadvertently released by the lab.  

Occam's Razor is instructive in this instance.  A virus that originates between 500 and 1000 miles away is found in Wuhan.  People brought some of it to the lab a couple of hundred yards from the marketplace.  That is known.  How a bat might also have infected an animal at the marketplace is unknown.  It is much simpler for the virus to merely have escaped from the lab than for the virus to have travelled to Wuhan on its own by some other means."
2020-04-30 18:48,"What possible purpose, other than political theatre, would any investigation by politicized U.S. intelligence agencies serve?  Any finding will be suspect for the most obvious of reasons.  It is useful to note that while the Titanic was sinking, while thousands were struggling in the icy water, rising and sinking, then rising and sinking again, the Captain was not screaming about needing an investigation.....his concern was for his passengers and crew.  There will be time enough when this is over for organizations like the Red Cross, the WHO or some ad hoc international panel of investigation to dwell on this pandemic, it's origins and the different, fatal errors made by governments around the world in response.  Inquiries however, by the suspect intelligence services of a nation that shuns organizations like the ICC out of fear its own criminal activities would be exposed, has absolutely zero value."

I did think he would grow into the office of President. Instead he has lowered the office to his level. He bullies people, nations, even leaders of nations. He lies almost daily and dismisses science. He promotes conspiracy theories and quack medicine. Now he blames anyone he can for a pandemic instead of working day and night to mitigate harm to us, the American people.

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.

Of course, Trump never said as much about the person responsible.

Now, as Trump has failed to defend us from the pandemic, despite repeated warnings, he fails to call himself out and state that he doesn't ""love us.""  Instead, he rewrites history, bragging about the great job he has done, and goes after someone (China) who he believes is responsible for this tragedy. 

Trump's ability to take no responsibility for anything is second only to his willingness to focus blame on whoever it is that will do him the most good politically at the moment."
2020-04-30 19:00,"Why seek to punish China for something it probably had no control over.

If anyone should be punished it should be our Nation's leadership for waiting too long to plan its strategy to protect us and the constantly promoting half-truths regarding the inherent risks, the ability to provide PPE for healthcare / essential personnel, the availability of tests, promoting treatments that have caused the deaths of many of our citizens, etc.

In my opinion, we were so much better prepared for a nuclear war than for a pandemic.  Too bad we closed down all of the fallout shelters and tossed the survival supplies stocked in the shelters.  Who knows how much stocked PPE was lost?

Frankly if we punish China, then anyone who goes to work or uses public transit with a ""Cold"" should also be punished.

It just seems to be another ploy to shift the blame from the Administration which bears the ultimate responsibility to provide for the ""common defense""."

To my knowledge, Trump is the only President in recent history who even bothered to strike a trade deal with China, given the lopsidedness of the prior trade situation.. the deal could be improved, but no one else ever bothered to look at that angle.
I really appreciate how at least someone is being vocal about looking after American interests.. it may not be done in a perfect way but it does seem to me that folks have been taking undue advantage of our generosity.

If we want to get tough on China we should start with how local officials treated Dr. Li Wenliang when he first warned people about the disease he saw in his patients and the consequences that resulted from suppressing and ignoring his warnings, not taking him seriously, and not being transparent and sharing information with scientists throughout the world from the beginning. We can then expand our credible investigations from there. Concocting stories only diverts attention and focus from what we really should be investigating and also gives China a cover. 

While it is a theoretical possibility that SARS-CoV-2 spread from the lab in question, there doesn't appear to be any credible evidence to support that assertion. There are simpler paths of transmission that are more likely. And BTW, there are government labs in the U.S. that research viruses.

He reported that the later small outbreak was tied to a safety accident at a Chinese lab. Verified?
Now Pottinger has been the force behind the administration's hard line on China per virus spread. His brother is a virologist he is close with.
Ok, I get it. He is the guy with the sour taste for China and has his reasons. Whether or not now politically motivated who knows.

But there is thing that just bugs my rear a little bit. This whole time since 2017 when he came on board why was there NO oversight or review of any updated pandemic protocol plan in place as done previously and why was the preparation for Covid-19 a complete failure? Considering Pottinger's China expertise and his being appointed director at NSC ASIA especially being the WH DIA office is now said to have had earlier warnings on Covid-19 and the possibility of it's danger(spread) to the US something seems amiss here.

That should do absolute wonders for Donnie's ""very friendly"" relationship with Xi Jinping.  (Another ""win.""  BIGLY.)

Even if such a suit could be brought successfully, and assuming that payment was actually made, neither of which is guaranteed, WHO GETS THE MONEY?

Does Trump think the $10 mil per life belongs to the US Government?  If that is what he thinks, he is mistaken.

Any money that is collected should belong to the heirs of each person who died, as would be the case with a life insurance policy.

If such a suit is filed, one defense the Chinese will undoubtedly present is that the US failed to control the spread of the coronavirus once it entered the country, and the Chinese are not responsible for that, or for the victims beyond the very few who actually might have been infected in China, so at $10 mil per victim, the maximum exposure should be a few times $10 mil, providing the US can specifically identify those few victims."

2020-04-30 19:59,"Why are the services of the CIA or its equivalents required to determine where this corona virus  started.

It is crystal clear that it started in China regardless of whether it came out of a lab or some animal and ended up in a human being. It is also clear how it ended up in the USA and all across the globe. Chinese people traveled everywhere and brought this with them and infected everywhere. So, we can task the CIA to doing other things.

The proper question is what is the rest of the world going to do about the stuff that is coming out of China and spreading like wild fire. People of the world do not have immunity (neither do the Chinese for that matter) to the ""stuff"" that the Chinese eat. 

The equivalent of what is happening now is the what the British colonizers brought to the new world (USA now) or South America and decimated the local populations because the local population did not have immunity to all those diseases.

My solution is that we repatriate many of the economic functions we have outsourced to China (and India for that matter even though we are not getting diseases from there-yet) and start becoming self reliant. This will keep our economic base strong, keep us away from unnecessary viruses or other diseases landing on our borders, ad infinitum."
2020-04-30 19:46,"There is no outcome of the attempt to link the virus to the Wuhan labs - even an implausible potential finding that the release was deliberate, that would lessen the stunning failure in our response to a frequently fatal pneumonia-causing virus outbreak in Wuhan which we have known about publicly since January 31st.

In fact, since we supposedly prepared for bioterrorism post 9/11, an attack that would most likely have no advance notice instead of the 2+ months for Covid-19, we have learned just how unprepared we are for deliberate events, given that we can't cope with an act of nature."

It was obvious at the time (at least to me) that the WMD justification for the Iraq War was a lie. However, it is equally obvious that there is a nugget worth investigating in this lab theory. I don't trust the current US government; neither do I trust the more authoritarian Chinese government. The truth matters; don't settle for the Wuhan market theory that has no evidence to back it up just because it is what you want to believe. And don't throw up your hands and say the origin doesn't matter. We may never know what the origin was but that doesn't mean we should not try to know."

Everything we touch is made in China. Heck, the flag of the USA that we waved decades ago when we became proud naturalized citizens, was made in China. The active pants a zillion folks wear is made, yes you guessed right China. Every plastic box, every envelope, all made in China. Most every generic medicine, made in China. We have not even entered the world of electronics and cool gadgets. Order organic spices, oh yeah, China.

2. The irony is rich that trump has spent much of the last three years castigating the intelligence community. Now he needs their help. Presumably they will be objective, but wouldn't it be fitting if they didn't dig as hard as they might to come up with inculpatory evidence?
3. If any such evidence is found, the damage to US-China relations might not be as long-term as the article suggests.

2020-04-30 20:24,Sounds a lot like what Cheney did when he manufactured evidence against Iraq. He and Bush abused and misused the intelligence services. They can be bent with enough pressure.
2020-04-30 20:31,"The thing about the current status of federal governance in the US is that nobody takes the Trump administration seriously. Americans join the rest of the world in realizing that, whether or not US Intelligence finds any link between a  Wuhan lab and Covid-19, the Trump crowd will claim a connection and try spinning it for Trump's re-election. 

That is what Trump does. He lies, and when he tires of it he lies some more. More than the world has ever seen in history. Tremendous lying! You wouldn't believe it."
2020-04-30 20:42,"The U.S. intelligence, and intelligence services around the world for that matter, would have to answer that question regardless of administration or governmental disposition. And China must answer for China in terms of global relations. The immediate threat to American security is this U.S. Republican administration itself. In this case it  ( Trump administration) is trying to distract from the complicity of its own policy and inaction contributing to an underwhelming response That especially considering it's at the controls of the richest and most able Nation in the world. We're taking a punch to the teeth from a haymaker a lot harder than we ever should have. A Democratic administration would have ducked a lot better."

2020-04-30 20:12,"Once again our performance artist, master of misdirection President has our government expending taxpayer dollars on creating and fomenting a new, bigger and better lie to direct attention away from the lie of his masterful handling of the Coronavirus pandemic. It's all China's fault! Should we strip China of sovereign immunity, stop (default) paying interest to China on America's debts, sue China for damages,  force all Chinese restaurants to close? No stone will be unturned and no Fox News interview declined in addressing this matter, at least until the media stops reminding people Trump suggested injecting disinfectants into their bodies to fight the Coronavirus. At least Trump finally used the Defense Production Act to order American industry to take needed action regarding the Coronavirus. Ok, it was just to order meat-packing companies (aka Coronavirus petrii dishes) to stay open. And, OK, he forgot to order the meat-packing companies to comply with CDC and OSHA ""suggestions"" for employee safety. (CDC and OSHA used to deliver ORDERS, but so much anymore. And, at least the meat-packing companies will be able to operate until there is a shortage of employees. This is all so unbearable."
2020-04-30 20:23,"The Trump administration is about to sue China for damages.

I doubt China will pay anything.

And will probably stop exporting masks and other items to the US. Has Trump thought about that?

He is merely obsessed with his reelection."
2020-04-30 20:33,"Unfortunately for us, we will probably never know for sure. The politicization of the idea has made it virtually impossible for objective analysis. 

The mishandling of a WMD could be seen as an act of war, inadvertent or not. It’s a rabbit hole that neither country wants to travel down so let’s just get on with dealing with COVID-19 and move on. Adding a war to this already horrible situation would be catastrophic for China and the U.S.A."
2020-04-30 20:33,"The source of the Cov-2 virus is most likely the Wuhan lab which is in close proximity to the food market. I am a scientist and, in my opinion, sloppy safety procedures have most likely caused, in one way or another, for the virus to lick out from the laboratory at Wuhan which is engaged in genetic manipulation of corona viruses.

2020-04-30 20:08,"It is wrongful per se for a president to pressure for any particular intelligence finding.  It casts a cloud over the credibility of any finding consistent with that pressured for.

However, the deep suspicion that China cause this virus is not limited to Trump.  Australia and many European governments share that deep suspicion.  The real question is whether China caused the virus by a government lab letting it out among the population or whether China caused the virus by its embrace of a cruel and inhumane practice of capturing wild animals, keeping them live in inhumane conditions, bringing them live into the population midst, then butchering them and eating them.  Either way, China has since the beginning efforted mightily to evade responsibility.

I suspect that the more likely cause this time was the latter since China has caused previous deadly virus tragedies in that manner.

Trump's motivations to find evidence of China's responsibility for this virus are undoubtedly selfish and political.  But China's responsibility in some manner is the truth.  Many partisans who predominate on these pages refuse to acknowledge that truth because it is asserted by a partisan opponent that they hate.

But truth is truth.  I am a non-partisan who opposes Trump's re-election and favors election of Biden.  But the truth should be acknowledged by all.  And China should be held to account in some meaningful manner that reflects the magnitude of the deadly harm they imposed on the world."
2020-04-30 20:24,"The Covid-19 case total just went to 1, 059,000.  It just reached 1,000,000 on Tuesday, April 28.  So in the last two days, there were 59,000 more cases.  And Trump has allowed the advisory to distance socially to expire.  So in other words, it appears as though the Republicans are just going to pretend that it's all over.  Go back to work, forget about Covid-19.  If you get sick, don't call."
2020-04-30 20:34,"There are a lot of unintended consequences from Trump's actions.  He is now talking about suing China and canceling the debt they bought from the U.S. as damages.  

With a 2 trillion plus deficit who does he think is then going to finance his spending?  

Plus China will shut off all rare earth minerals to the U.S. (and they pretty much control Africa).

  Since China produces and ships an estimated 80% of all medical drugs and equipment to the US (including intermediary parts assembled in the US)  I can easily see a 300% export tax on all shipments to the U.S.)."

I smell a setup in which China will be blamed for something that was probably an accident, if it even originated there.  Trump is doing his best to deflect any and all negative press away from him and unto to others.

How can the administration possibly pressurize the intelligence officials to concoct this thing about it being created in a lab. Wouldn't the genome analysis reveal if it came from an animal or was created through a different set of pathogens in a lab? This is intellectually dishonest and lazy reporting. Come on NYT - did one of our intelligence officials say so?  NYT loses credibility day by day because of its blind hatred of Trump.

The fact that “the Chinese ... considered whether the W.I.V. was, in fact, the place where this came from,” if true, shows that China was thorough in its exploration of possible origins.  They would have been remiss not to consider the possibility when nothing was known about the disease.  It gives zero support to Pompeo's and others' attempts to blame a laboratory.

I don’t believe Chinese people in general are responsible whether it was the market, the lab, or anything else. 
Transparency and open research on behalf of Chinese government does help. Not starting with financial claims on behalf of US government also helps.
Waiting too long with independent investigations hardly ever helps."

As far as I know, this is the only U.S. administration that tries to make itself look good by manufacturing its own set of facts.  Every federal agency is under pressure to produce the outcomes Trump wants, regardless of the truth.  It's not just a matter of telling the truth or not.  Trump has taken steps to prevent our fact-finders from finding facts he doesn't like -- about issues that affect our health, our national security, our survival."
2020-04-30 20:54,"Madness. Utter madness. The evidence strongly suggests that Coronavirus is originally from a bat. The Trump administration is flailing around looking to blame others for their abject incompetence in managing the epidemic. 

If China really wanted to attack us, and we believe it, we should be -- right now -- preparing for conflict. 

For one thing, we certainly need to stop--right now--working to get our pharmaceutical supplies from China and our protective masks and gowns. If China really wanted to introduce new diseases to the US, they would target our doctors and hospitals with contaminated gowns and masks.

Trump's freeze on travel to the US to China allowed 430,000 to travel to China and back after the ban. This is not the sign of a response to an actual threat. It is more of a political stunt. 

Pompeo is either deranged or playing a cynical political game--or both.

Why would China test their attack on their industrial and technology heartland, killing multitudes? 

Pompeo has no interest in actually doing anything to stop the epidemic. He just wants to blame somebody for his own administration's appallingly poor response."
2020-04-30 20:55,Here we go again... it’s shiny object time. What purpose does it serve to blame China for the virus?  Trump is desperately trying to distract and cover up his epic incompetence in handling the Covid-19 crisis. The American economy is in a catastrophic free fall and Trump focuses on blame for the pandemic and how soon he can have a “huge” rally.

Trump needs an excuse for his incompetence and it cannot be China. This did not have to happen and should not have, as far as spreading like fire in this country.

It is an animal virus that jumped from animals in the wet market in Wuhan China to Chinese people at the market. Chinese public health negligence by not closing down these wet markets after the SARS epidemic and numerous influenza epidemics that originated in China caused the pandemic. Furthermore, China covered up the threat of COVID-19 until it was too late to contain the virus in Wuhan thus causing the Worldwide spread of the virus. The Chinese coverup delayed the global response to the pandemic. 

The Trump Administration's incompetence caused gross mismanagement of the pandemic in America. Thanks to Trump America is the world leader in patients infected and deaths due to COVID-19. 

Trump and the Chinese Government have ""blood on their hands"" from mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic. Will the Chinese care? No, because the loss of life is trivial in a country of 1.3+ billion people. Will psychopath Trump care? No, because he only cares about himself.

There has been much pressure on the 23rd Amendment from both sides of the aisle historically.  I’m sure Trump would only do a sort of Putin/Medvedev swap with his Vice if the Supreme Court or Senate is unable to assist in nullifying the 23rd amendment.  A fall back could be Senate supported “War Powers” act or reinterpretation to help in gaining him a 3rd term or an extended second term, more certainly additional powers ceded by the Legislative branch.

While possibly far fetched that the virus originated in the lab it’s well known that communist party concealed the initial spread of the virus as not to disrupt the economic spoils of their popular lunar festival. Furthermore the communist party has suppressed the voices of heath officials and even actively lie about domestic infection/death rates. The communist party may not have created the virus but their handling of the situation amounts to a Global crime against humanity one the global community should be rightfully outraged over. This pandemic highlights the Chinese communists willingness to enforce whatever narrative they please and lack of regard toward the global community as a whole."
2020-04-30 20:53,"We need to look at this objectively (pretend for a second, the origin is from an unknown country, to curb any pre-existing biases); consider the initial patients that have been recorded having had no contact with wet markets. What does that imply? Early proof of human-to-human transmission. Either that information was *also* suppressed, which contributed to early exponential growth, or it did not come from a wet market. Furthermore, if one can look up ""Gain of Function"" and Animal passage lab research, where accidental outbreaks have been known to occur, lab accidents are entirely within the realm of possibility, regardless of country of origin. 

Do not let Trump's incompetence and ignorance of science goad you into a contentious stance out of spite, especially without considering the entirety of the pandemic's timeline. Would Trump will take any opportunity to deflect from his blunders? Of course. BUT, that does not mean the virus origins are clear cut. Far from it. My fellow NYT readers, please recognize what some of Mainland's own disappeared citizens saw (and what Taiwanese and HKers, who never wholly trusted Mainland china, who correctly recognized the outbreak as SARS redux). One country's incompetence does not cancel out the other."
2020-04-30 21:15,"So, every day I read something more about Chinese scientists sharing their knowledge with us. Meanwhile, Trump pulls American researchers out of China, stopping their joint ventures to learn about a disease that scientists of both nations are working to defeat. 

And just when we need leadership by real grownups with sound judgment, Biden jumps in, charging Trump with not being tough enough on China. 

This is like a bizarre satire. I flash on the world leaders in ""Dr. Strangelove""  --  except this is even more bizarre. And unbelievably, it's what really is happening."
2020-04-30 21:04,"I'm a microbiologist, I don't doubt for a second that SARS-CoV-2 is the result of a zoonotic event.  It wasn't man made.  However, I think it is highly plausible that this virus was isolated in nature, taken into the lab, and an accidental infection occurred.  It's just human nature.  Additionally, the Wuhan BSL-4 facility is indeed the first BSL-4 lab to open in China.  This alone makes it all the more suspicious.  We have a lot of experience in the US with BSL-4 labs and we have extremely strict protocols and oversight for them.  Who was overseeing the Wuhan facility?  The very government that literally has no experience with BSL-4 facilities?

Alternatively, this scenario could be dubious because if true the first cases would have emerged around the researchers friends, families and places that researcher visited after they accidentally infected themselves.  This should be relatively easy to compare to the first known cases where the open air markets were.  Or so I think.

In conclusion, I think it is indeed reasonable to be suspicious that is was an accident."
2020-04-30 21:14,"Here is probably a more successful approach. sue the CCP itself.  They claim that they are no part of the government , a separate entity , since CCP can't claim sovereign immunity they case has a good chance of getting to trial.  At trial the CCP will have to admit that they are not part of or run the country or they do. either way the CCP and Communist party loses."

If you pick someone without the qualifications and he bungles the surgery, blaming the nurses and hospital equipment; you have yourself to blame.  This was a great human tragedy with more lives lost than Korean War, Vietnam, Iraq, 9/11.  After all the lives lost, the White House response was that it was ""a success story."""

They should have closed their own borders much earlier and admitted to what was going on instead of covering it up. Are people forgetting that China denied that this virus was a serious concern until that poor whistle-blower doctor's message got out? It may be politically convenient to believe that China is blameless in all of this, but the reality is not that simple."
2020-04-30 21:44,I wonder how the current outcome would be different if Trump's administration hadn't removed the American scientists that were going to work on viral research and pandemic response in China?  That's a sincere question.
2020-04-30 21:05,"By all means do an investigation, but why not wait until the facts are in before you start casting blame on another country?  Sadly I suspect this investigation may be conducted to a preordained outcome."
2020-04-30 21:56,"These are the times when it becomes a problem having a leader with a troubled history and often unethical behavior. How much can he be trusted? I am like many other Americans. I don't automatically believe what Donald Trump says or does.

A country needs a leader that it can trust if it is going to grow, prosper and stay on an even keel. Presently we don't have such a President and we will pay a price. Hopefully the price will not be a serious conflict with a major Power over a nonexistent issue.

I am not disputing the fact that when it comes to China we must be on our guard. The problem is with Trump we also must be on our guard over what he says and does.

President Trump is no more trustworthy than the leader of China and in many ways he is more dangerous.  Around the year 2014 there was a book titled ""The Danger From within"", which was a discussion about how the biggest threat to the cyber security of a company may be an employee or vendor. This also holds true for nations.

Tell me something worse than having a President who is not trustworthy. This is where the United States is today. At least we are on guard with Russia and China. It is not  tenable to have a President who is not trusted by a near majority of a country's citizenry. A change is needed."
2020-04-30 20:19,"It is from Wuhan! It was deliberately done! Why are we dodging that? Why are we covering up for China, when it has just unveiled this Dong Feng 41 to kill us all?

Why can’t liberals see this or are they in cahoots with China. I wouldn’t be surprised!"
2020-04-30 20:29,"Let’s say Covid19 was created in Wuhan lab, as conspiracy theorists would have it. Why on earth would China unleash this virus on their own people and decimate their own economy first? 

An accidental release is another possibility, but why would the largest cluster of initial infections be at a wet market instead of among scientists and workers at the lab? 

The simplest explanation - zoonotic origin - is the most likely. At this point, the resources of our government should be focused on testing, tracing and treating Covid19 and working on a plan to restart the economy. We know from bitter experience what happens when the White House meddles in intelligence gathering. We don’t have another $2 trillion to waste."

There is no doubt China unleashed the virus in Wuhan - whether a lab or a wet market.

With a history of now, 3 viruses - it's hard to believe folks below think it is is this POTUS who is complicit.

Folks may want to remember all kinds of rumors about how US intelligence agencies had given a date and a time of 9/11 attack and W - deliberately brought this about do as to launch another middle east war.

Heck, Russia even produced a video in how CIA detonated explosives in the WTC to bring them down - many believed then and probably including some below believe it now.

The COVID virus originated from the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. The virus has since spread to over 200 countries and territories, causing more than 61,000 deaths in the United States alone.

China officially confirmed that the virus could be transmitted between humans on Jan. 20, when top respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan made the announcement.

China is guilty of lying if not worst and if you think giving a pass to China is going to get you votes than the liberal elite are just  more out of touch with reality. Like most elites you have little sense of what working class people living in your own city think because frankly most of you could not find your way into the working class sections of Queens or anywhere else. Opposing everything Trump does or says exposes just how intellectually limited you are. It is the way children think. You did not get your way and now have to throw a fit. Why do any of you think that the working classes are going to look at your behavior and conclude that you are to be listened to or followed. But again the attack on Trump has always been an attack on the working class. Never trust an elite New York liberal who goes around speaking in the name of the poor. These people are speaking not for the working class but in place of them. For liberals the poor are to be used not helped. Your I hate America but love China and internationalism is not going to get you anything--go back and look at how elite 19th century Americans thought and behaved and you will find you fit right in. All you liberals should really read your Marx."

Is he looking for a reason to simply place more sanctions on China?

Or, more ominously, is he looking for a reason to strategically attack them? Trump is stupid enough, and is certainly arrogant enough, to do so.

None of the toadies and sycophants around him will be brave enough to tell him it's a dumb idea, and America won't win, that they will be alone as the Allies will stay out of it if they can.

Trump will do anything - anything - to stay in power, and if it means a war, he will do it.

It is an option for him, along with Covid19, a rising up by his angry gun nut followers defending their 2nd Amendment rights, another excuse to call out ""his"" military and declare an emergency.

If the virus was naturally occurring, was created in a lab, or was unleashed on the planet by space aliens, the response from the Trump administration should have been the same.  What possible difference could the virus's origin make?  Is a lab-created virus somehow able to outsmart prudent and established protocols that a naturally-occurring one wouldn't?  The propaganda angle here seems to that Trump's response would have worked against a naturally-occurring virus, but since it was supposedly lab-created then he's not to blame.

Ludicrous."

Yet if that were the case, it's perplexing that China has so far refused to allow the US access to those labs. Unless of course they're hiding something. And if it started in a ""wet market"" as they claim, why haven't they provided some documentation to back up their claim?

What we do know is that Covid-19 did indeed start in China, as have a multitude of other virus outbreaks, including the Asian Flu in 1956 which killed between one and four million people worldwide. SARS in 2002 and H7N9 that killed four out of every ten of its victims. In this latest epidemic however, China was more than willing, some might say adamant that its progeny be shared with the rest of the world. 

From the outset China has lied. They told the world that it wasn't contagious among humans. They lied about its capacity for exponential spread. They locked down Wuhan yet allowed infected citizens to descend upon Europe, America and other parts of Asia to insure the rest of he world would be infected. China chose to weaponize Covid-19 to weaken its global competition and they need to be held accountable. Anyone who denies the catastrophic impact on our economy wasn't intentional is a fool and anyone who abets them by imposing endless restrictions on our commerce is an accomplice."

The precise nature of the information, based in part on intercepted communications among Chinese officials, is unclear.""

It is ""unclear"" because those ""career officials"" with access to it have decided that it is too sensitive to release to the press.

People do not realize how vast are US collection capabilities.  An NSA colleague once told me that only a small fraction of what they collected was actually translated and disseminated to the intelligence community, my employer for nearly 45 years. 

It might take another few months for analysts and linguists to pore over the millions of intercepted messages from the Wuhan area from late November through early February that are currently stored, in raw format, in US computers.  If the incriminating information is there, it will be discovered.  Maybe its as simple as a text message from a Chinese scientist to a colleague expressing alarm at having knocked over a vial of genetically modified COVID-19.

2020-04-30 22:29,This sounds like a familiar story.
2020-04-30 22:30,"There is a fair amount of circumstantial evidence that the BSL-4 lab in Wuhan was the source of the virus.  It bears looking into.

But even if true how can it matter?  The same outbreak could have happened at any one of our 13 BSL-4 labs or at any one of the thousands of lower-level critical containment labs around the world.

If there was a life-threatening containment breach every government would initially lie about it hoping they could contain it, including ours.  

Over the years we've had a couple hundred security and policy breaches but nothing, they say, has escaped.

The only reason for these labs, despite what they say, is for bio-warfare weaponry. That's why they engineer in gain-of-function qualities to increase lethality.   

Level four facilities are licensed for monkeys so they can test vaccines.  But monkeys are notoriously hard to handle and if you get scratched with a virus that takes two weeks to show symptoms, what do you do?   You might go home not knowing that you were infected.  If you suspected, but did not know, you might not mention it because you'd lose your job.  

If this is a laboratory containment breach it's a Chernobyl with global consequences.   There is no reason to have these dangerous labs in any country."

He ignored his own experts until he couldn’t any longer. No, Trump is not responsible for covid-19, but he could have saved a lot of lives by acting much sooner."

NY Times reported (Aug-25-2019) on the shut down of research involving dangerous microbes like the Ebola virus at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, in Fort Detrick, Md. It is a bio-defense center.

The 2019 Military World Games was held from October 18–27, 2019 in Wuhan. American athletes participating in the Wuhan Military World Games. No question their performance was disproportionately below average.

Medal standing as the military game concluded: China total medals win is #1, Russia #2. USA is #12, behind Ukraine #10 and Kenya #11. China won 324 gold medals, Russia 294 golds. USA, 20 golds.

The American team's place of residence during their game in Wuhan was indeed close to the Seafood Wholesale Market where the first known cluster of cases occurred. Most likely not the more desirable hotel location in Wuhan. 

All these facts allow various factions to weave their version of source of the pandemic."
2020-04-30 22:57,"From the article:

""Mr. Trump’s aides and Republicans in Congress have sought to blame China for the pandemic in part to deflect criticism of the administration’s mismanagement of the crisis in the United States, which now has more coronavirus cases than any country.""

This is an opinion! Not a fact. It is not attributed to anyone (but the person who wrote it.) I see that the story came from Reuters but the Times could correct it. Your newspaper loses credibility when it prints opinions as facts."
2020-04-30 22:56,"Perhaps the message to our intelligence agencies would be to provide the most factual, provable information in their reports that they can.  Being spying is what it is, there will never be 100% certainty, but given that, to have anything but the best most reliable information is a recipe for enormous disaster.

And it is all driven by Trump and his grasping at straws.

And is it too much to expect that our president and higher leaders actually accept and believe what the hard working spies find out, and with great risk and expense rather than discount it or refuse to read it?

On the other hand, to have a senior advisor (Jared) give a statement without breaking into laughter that our nation handled this so extraordinarily well sets the tone for all watching our administration."

2020-04-30 23:07,"Not only is this a red herring, what more damage would it do to China if true? Can the US or other nations have any more influence over the monitoring and control of Chinese labs than their open air marketplaces?"

Very few. Even our drugs are made overseas. And those tariffs completely backfired. They destroyed the farmers and other businesses and Trump still got us trillions in debt. Our intelligence agencies need to be focused on Trump and family. That's where they will find crimes committed.

  1. The virus mutates very slowly
  2. It wasn’t engineered, so it had to have gradually evolved 

3rd, no one does more genomic sequencing – of anything – than does China…

i.e.: info is out there somewhere – unless someone deliberately destroyed it…

PS

If you’d asked four years ago, if game-changing intelligence could be sequestered and obfuscated for four years, would’ve said no…

Four years later – two words:

Michael Flynn

PPS

On the assertion that it wasn’t engineered, am beginning to wonder about a grey area…

If there were some place along the strand where more repetition of a short sequence expressed as longer spikes, that length might be tuned – to where it latched on more to some type of (human) cell, vs some others…"

Furthermore, if anyone is responsible for looking into whether the pandemic originated from the lab in Wuhan, it should be China, not the US.

But the final paragraph of this article notes that a state run newspaper ran a piece on ""chronic inadequate management issues"" at biological labs including problems with biological disposal.

In this case, thought one is that Trump is a buffoon whose conscious downplaying of the virus for six critical weeks left the country woefully unprepared for the virus and dramatically exacerbated the human and economic cost. Thought two is that it is we don’t know the exact origin of the virus, and it is not China-bashing to suggest that it might have originated at the level 4 virology lab a few hundred yards from the Huanan fish market. We simply do not know for sure. Our HUMINT in China was decimated a few years ago so the CIA is flying blind. We do know that China is ruled by a brutal dictatorship whose number one priority is maintaining order and total control, and which will tamp down on any information that suggests otherwise. It is journalistic malpractice to simply take the CCP at its word, especially on a topic of this importance. Chernobyl comes to mind. Scientists and forensic specialists from around the world should be clamoring to get access to the lab. 

Either way, China needs to take primary responsibility. If it did originate in a market, then the rest of the world needs to demand a system to monitor prevent the sale and consumption of bats, pangolins, and any other animals whose consumption might result in the next pandemic. This isn’t about culture. It’s about preventing a global meltdown. These viruses are the 21st century’s weapons of mass destruction and need to be treated as such."

Let's consider two incessant talking points put into play before this latest wild goose chase;

1) 'I totally shut down travel from China and saved millions of lives.' What he did was stop Chinese citizens from entering the US. Almost 500k US citizens and nationals still entered the US after 'the ban' and were never tested or even screened.

2) 'I totally shut down Europe and saved millions of lives.' The European 'ban' covered less than half of Europe, excluding among others  England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, and allowed travelers from anywhere in the world to enter the US by transferring to US--bound flights from these 'unbanned' countries.

3) as he golfed and ignored CDC, WHO, and NIH warnings of a pandemic, the East Coast was already infected by travelers from Europe, and the West Coast had already been infected by travelers from China.

But why do the five scientists (and others) believe it is implausible. As recently as 2019, the Army's bio-defense (and defense can so easily be switched to offense) lab in Fort Detrick was shut down due to safety concerns, as reported by the NYT among others. It's not the first time.

In December 2017, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) lifted a moratorium - that had been put in place in October 2014 - on ""gain of function"" research on flu, SARS, and MERS viruses specifically. ""Gain of function"" research and experiments, simply put, seek to make deadly pathogens even more virulent, so as to study them and find countermeasures against and cures for these *man-made* super-deadly pathogens.

So this research was being conducted, before Oct-14 and after Dec-17 (and perhaps even during the moratorium, if conducted in Waived Unacknowledged Special Access Programs), and specifically on coronaviruses - as SARS is a coronavirus. 

Several Chinese scientists who have worked at the Wuhan virology lab had also worked on this gain of function research at US labs and universities.

2020-05-01 3:18,"I have to say I was amused at Trump saying that 'he was not allowed' to release information.  When, in the history of his administration, has Trump ever said that he was not allowed to do something?

He cleared Jared & Ivanka after they couldn't pass the requirements for a security clearance.  He declassified intelligence for political purposes.  He even accidentally release classified material because he didn't understand how the system of classification worked.

It isn't even coy for Trump to say something and then pull it back for some perceived advantage.  He is not pretty enough to be a fan dancer.

When he starts attacking China for political purposes he is literally playing with our lives.  He has done a lot of nasty stuff that I don't agree with.

2020-04-29 11:17,Who would voluntarily install any tracking app on their phone? I do not see it happening. At least with the Google and Apple solution the data is not stored centrally. I doubt that is the case with these homegrown apps the states are creating.
2020-04-29 11:35,"The great irony is that Americans have far less privacy than many other electronic citizens of the world.  The weakness of our privacy laws in the realm of cell phone and internet communication is readily apparent.  Information on your whereabouts is out there in cyberspace if you used your cell phone or your computer so to claim you can stop it now is closing the barn door after the cows have bolted.  To say there should not be apps to overtly use this knowledge is to deny using this information for your personal benefit while allowing corporations to use it for their own corporate gain, cutting off your nose to spite your face."
2020-04-29 11:55,"Why does the article not detail the systems used in South Korea and Taiwan? A previous article in the NYT focused on South Korea and that tracing there  seemed to work extremely well. And given South Korea's success in dealing with covid 19 there is an argument for simply copying their tracing approach. It does require a lot more openness about data, but it seems to me that clearly defined legislation with a watertight sunset clause, at which both the app and the stored data are removed, should allay most privacy concerns. Such a sunset date could be the date of the first certified vaccine, or begin of vaccination in the country. It seems in the trade-off between privacy and a tool for substantially reducing the impact of the pandemic on society, a temporary! suspension of privacy is a no-brainer."

Working in the public sector we always assume the poorest areas, often with elderly residents (one of the most vulnerable groups to covid) don't have access to technology or know how to use it."
2020-04-29 13:10,"We need to be clear that there's a whole range of what  contact tracing apps around the world are doing.  In authoritarian places like in China, or in places with high trust in government like Norway, or in the case of poorly thought out implementations like North Dakota, the apps pretty much do track you and pick up your location data based on GPS, cell tower pings, etc.  A second class of apps like the ones pioneered by Singapore are govt apps that exchange encrypted tokens based on being close enough via bluetooth and store the data on user's phones.  Only when a user gets a positive test and agrees to release the encrypted info to the health authorities, can they decrypt that information and use it to reach out to people who have been in contact.  Finally you have the decentralized solution Google and Apple are working on.  This is similar to the Singapore solution using bluetooth beacons, except that a user if they get a confirmed test can choose to upload their anonymized ID to a network of servers, that other users apps regularly check.  Other users can then know if they've run across some positive case sometime while the person was infectious and then go get tested or self isolate.  This system actually cut out government health authorities altogether.  Governments actually are not super keen on this solution as it leaves them kind of blind to seeing trends and location hotspots, but this is the most privacy preserving contact tracing design."
2020-04-29 13:13,"Great article and obviously contact tracing is a key strategy in next phase to keep infection rates down. Larry Tribe has already come out against most of the type of options offered here. Evidently these options are a greater civil liberty intrusion than general shelter in place orders?
Voluntary options will be less effective for the general population and will be more effective protecting the affluent, and non-minority (for a variety of reasons). To some that's a problem in the usual after action hand wringing and virtue signaling. Americans of all stripes should be concerned over enhanced government powers in ""extraordinary times"" - we've seen the left and right abuse those powers in our recent past. However, contact tracing leveraging technology has been effective in less privacy focused cultures...is it worth a look?"

2020-04-29 13:29,"I have seen numerous NYT commenters across multiple stories cite a need for tracking.  Whether a laid off worker enlisted into the new army of trackers, or an app monitoring you on your phone, these proposed new tracking regimes are going to fail.  Someone that you don’t know calls you on the phone or approaches you on the street asking where have you been and with whom?  Really?  Expect a lot of clicks or mind your business at a minimum.  Other responses would be less polite.  

What kind of mechanism somehow automatically transfers info from infected person to his phone number to all other phone numbers supposedly touched by that phone number?  Those systems do not exist.  People that think they do have seen too many Bourne movies.  Then the so-called positive hits get sent where for what purpose?  The electronic portion of the process is the smallest concern in the process development.  Human interaction will be spread throughout this proposed process and countless errors will occur."
2020-04-29 13:45,It's actually laughable at this point to even suggest that we trust the private sector and government with our health data. We know that they make money off our data and we're certainly being surveilled. As a citizen I'm quite disturbed by articles like this because it looks like suggestions of biometric tracking are becoming normalized. It's concerning when I see that authoritarian countries have that much data and control over their citizens. Why should we think our country should follow that same path? We need to think about the long term implications of something like that vs short term gain.

If you insist on real privacy, stay off the network, by phone or internet, and don't go to a physician.  Otherwise, accept the fact that you are, essentially, a public citizen.  That's not a reason to give away the farm, but don't be surprised if somebody you don't know knows you."

2020-04-29 15:56,"The Australia government has developed a contact tracking app based on Singapore's.  3 million Australians--12% of the population--have downloaded it in just 3 days.   High participation rates are only essential in high population density areas, where viral transmission rates are high, to flatten the epidemic curve.    

Achieving high participation rates is likely to require a governmentally endorsed and coordinated campaign to encourage use.   Americans, both right and left, will fret about loss of privacy with a governmental contact tracing app.  In the meantime, we have almost no limits on use of our data by banks, credit card, telecommunications and tech companies (relative to countries that have not sold their democracies to corporate interests).  

Traditional contact tracing is difficult and labor intensive, used for slower moving, less prevalent diseases like TB and syphillus.  It is also much more intrusive than an app.  If you are concerned about loss of control of data about you, the horse left the barn long ago in the United States.  And it isn't the government you need to worry about."

The argument that corporations already are running rough shod over our digital privacy is not justification for letting more fingers into our files.  Too many of us want to stop the sale of our data already!

So glad I'm not surgical attached to my phone.  I've got no problem consulting a paper map for directions and putting my cell phone in airplane mode when leaving home.  If they find a way to still ping the phone, I'll simply leave it home rather than allow it to become a human LoJack."

If individuals can trigger the notification of others as described regarding the Google/Apple app, what stops an individual from going to a grocery store, being in proximity of dozens of people, and then two or three days later falsely entering that they tested positive for the Coronavirus?  Those dozens of people will be notified, will fear they were exposed, and will most likely spend hours or days being tested and awaiting results. 

App developers, please consider that there are people out there who seem to delight in deliberately creating havoc and ensure your apps can’t be intentionally misused."
2020-04-29 17:30,"I anticipate the next big game will be individual evasion of testing and isolation.  Carefully listening to the daily addresses of the NY/NJ/CT governors, there has been a subtle enhancement of messaging around ""testing, tracing, and isolation"".  There is going to be significantly large cohort of younger, healthy, low-risk people who will see nothing but downside of being isolated for 14 days plus.  What will happen if the government gets frustrated with people who say ""thanks for letting me know"" and then skip the self-quarantine?  What happens if an individual is identified as contagious, skips self-quarantine and infects others?  Could the data captured on their phone be used as evidence against them in a civil or criminal proceeding?  I recall hearing people being upset when the computer data from their car's black box diagnostic computer was being pulled to use the record of speed, acceleration, and brake application against them in motor vehicle cases."

2020-04-29 18:56,"Disease is tragic, but we need to stop devaluing everything we care about, and adopting authoritarian measures of tracking the population, on top of all of the other ways that we are trashing the lives of hundreds of millions of people, is simply too much.

The premise of ""contact tracing"" is that we can neatly identify where the virus is and contain it. That seems delusional. Community spread started months ago. The virus often causes no symptoms so we'll never detect most cases that way, and nobody thinks there will be enough testing to test the whole population at any point in the foreseeable future.

We should be trying to reach population immunity before the next flu season hits. An identifiable 20-25% of the population experiences virtually all of the mortality associated with the disease. That group should be limiting contact with others, and should get generous public support, and the other 75% could be developing immunity to this now that would save us all a lot of pain later in the year. Instead we have 95% of the population hiding at home with no gameplan other than hoping for a vaccine in a couple years.

Other pieces in the NYT's opinion pages in recent weeks have discussed this approach. (See Thomas Friedman's recent column.) Our leaders need to start thinking about how to use basic herd immunity to end this more quickly, rather than stringing things out indefinitely in hopes of a miraculous breakthrough.

Planning on miracles is not usually a good gameplan."

2. Hotspots of the disease (nursing homes, prisons) are not mobile populations.
3. Enforcement to carry phone and of followup is intense use of public resources in an emergency.

Many of them are using pseudonyms when downloading to add a layer of privacy. Notifications won't say where you had contact because there is no GPS tracking. You can delete the app anytime, and of course can always turn bluetooth off if you want a break for some reason.

Despite the tree-hugging, vegan-driven nonsense that powers The New York Times, most people in the nation consume meat as a very nutritious, affordable source of protein and other key nutrients.

I despise Trump, but in this case his general direction is correct: food producers MUST stay open or the rest of us are in big trouble. Our society revolves around specialization of labor, and people who currently work as office workers, sanitation workers, police, and on and on, do not have the means to begin to farming their own produce and animals. Food is SURVIVAL, to a much greater degree than avoiding the coronavirus. Despite the Times' desire to keep pushing vegan agendas, this is not the time for a lofty debate on leftists' imagined evils of eating meat.

Here's the middle ground part: for goodness sake, just give the workers what they need to stay safe, like masks and gloves. 

Can a food producer, who is trying to feed people in a time of high crisis, actually be SUED by the people it needs to make that food? Of course not. But can they provide workers with PPE? Of course they can."

This administration first priority seems to be massaging the ""dear leader's"" ego."
2020-04-30 13:38,"Meat processing is critical infrastructure.  We can't all be cossetted vegetarians.  I'm usually one of the first to call lobbyists out.  But in this case they weren't distorting the truth. Protein is not the same in plant foods.  And plant foods have no collagen for healing.  Nobody had to ""lobby"" for the basic fact that food is critical to people who need to eat. 

They need to pay adequate attention to the meat industry and if you're going forward with the insanity of factory farms, then you will need to think about how to run a ""critical infrastructure"" element properly.  

Meaning, in September, the speed of meat processing lines (definitely pork processing, but maybe others) was increased and the density of how close people stood was increased - just before the pandemic.  

The government should take note that a critical infrastructure like meat processing shouldn't be done in a way that encourages the spread of illness.  Right now we have a robotic view of meat processing, but we're not robots and the meat didn't come from a robot.  

With ICE raids on meat processing plants, we saw that those workers are often immigrants.  Unionize them and give them a voice in how it's done.  They know what is safe for them.  It should be part of the conversation. 

One of the biggest bungles of this pandemic is the shutting down of meat plants. But the second biggest bungle is factory farming and high speed processing in general. This is the first time I agree with big ag lobbyists."
2020-04-30 13:42,It is inspiring to watch trump choke back his tears for the tens of thousands of dead and for the great unwashed plant workers who don't live in gold-leafed towers but must endanger themselves and their families to hack slabs of beef and pork.  How does he do that?

2020-04-30 13:46,What is wrong with you people? You test everyone then wait for results and open slowly . All workers have to maintain safety measures at home . Difficult yes but it will work . This slow process could have begun a month ago . People not wearing masks in public are the problem . Go into Kroger and three fourths of the customers are not wearing a mask so what else are they not doing when they leave the store or their home . Get a grip people because if you are not practicing all safety measures then you are part of the problem. I personally don’t want the death of health care workers on my hands . They are in an over exposure environment but are working day and night to save those who are not following the rules . Shame on you !!!!

Foreign ownership in an oligopolistic industry (the result of lax and misguided antitrust and merger policy by both Democratic and Republican administrations) would seem to be a pertinent fact in a news story about meat shortages, plant closures, and political influence.  But Chinese and Brazilian ownership of Smithfield and JBS is not mentioned in this article, and has rarely, if ever, been mentioned in news articles.  Given the Trump's administration's narrative about the virus and China (and Brazil has association with a loose anti-virus policies too), I am very surprised."
2020-04-30 14:02,"The administration got it backwards re: the process of deciding that meat processing is a crucial industry. The very first priority should have been to establish the health and safety of plant workers, by passing regulations--not suggestions--for management to implement and provide proof of.
Now I'm just waiting to see busloads of 'scab' workers to roll through the gates of these plants.
The workers will suffer greatly, and so will the general communities they live in and are part of. A plant worker is married to a nurse at a local hospital. They get infected; five other people then are infected. 
The initial wrong decision, at the federal level, got the entire project off on the wrong footing. Wait until the spike if infections, hospitalizations, and deaths happen. Then some bright thing in the administraiton may realize what the top priority is, and always was."
2020-04-30 14:04,"Although I am a vegetarian, I understand that some people choose to eat meat.

That choice should be informed by explicit videos of the conditions in which meat is “manufactured” in huge closed buildings with no fresh air or sunlight and animals packed in so tightly they can’t move.

This is not your old-fashioned farm with pigs and chickens roaming freely. 

There should also be videos in news articles right now showing the working conditions in meat processing plants, and the many health problems the workers suffer.

The reason we do not see these videos on a regular basis is because we don’t want to think about such horrors being associated with our food. Just like we don’t even consider what work is like for an Amazon warehouse worker.

We all need a better understanding of how our consumer choices affect the lives of other human beings...and animals.

We don’t know what’s happening behind the scenes of modern capitalism because the capitalists know they have something to be ashamed of, or at least they know if we saw the truth we might make different choices."

There are other foods than meat."
2020-04-30 14:39,"Much like any of these situations, it will be the customer that is ultimately the final arbiter of whether or not the plant stays open.  The reality is even if only the ""perception"" of the meat coming out of these plants ""might"" be an issue, customers will pass on buying it."
2020-04-30 14:38,"So I was thinking about the modern world of meeting packing...it’s complicated.  NPR has a story that noted that with restaurants closed there was an over supply of some products...that got me thinking, particularly with chicken, why is so much cut up.  have e we forgot how to take a whole chicken apart? And what;s the deal with boneless breasts of chicken...maybe part of the new normal is less processing.  Yea pork, beef and other larger carcasses require processing but wasn’t that done locally? Remember the local butcher? We have imposed vertical integration to the supply chain in ways that may make some sense in the past but less so moving ahead.  Perhaps it’s time to rethink ‘efficiency’ in the old model and think quality, local, service... could be a good lesson. Oh and how much of this meat is for export, to whom and are we asking workers to pay a price so other countries will pay less?  Another question to ask as we mover forward...if they want the product they will pay the price. Keep it safe, keep it sane."
2020-04-30 14:49,"If the pandemic has taught us one thing it is that the essential workers are NOT the CEOs and bankers and politicians who run the country. It is the men and women, often working for a minimum wage, in our basic industries.

2020-04-30 14:53,"Two of the least-reported yet crucially important aspects to the federal rule adopted last September with pork production is that this rule started as a pilot program way back in 1997! And that the USDA is looking to apply it to beef production, too.

The USDA has gutted required inspection on a bi-partisan basis for decades now, in the misbegotten notion that somehow deregulating how food is processed will somehow insure the safety of the citizens who eat it.

One conclusion I came to long before this crisis, however, is to just stop eating any and all kinds of animal meat, given the  deregulatory regimes across, and spurred by, the agribusiness industrial complex. The health and climate benefits of my decision to not eat meat have been great, too!"

Americans might boycott companies that force employees to work regardless of the risk to their health and lives.

Cold, moist raw meat might be revealed as an ideal medium for carrying coronavirus to buyers. 

Consumers could start worrying that, even if they don’t get coronavirus, they might get other pathogens and diseases from processing plants that have abandoned their OSHA and USDA rules.

It was especially telling to read that by slowing down the speed of the production line social distancing could be increased and thus the health and even the lives of the workers would be better protected but that this was not acceptable to the companies because it would lower their rate of profit. Trump was more than happy to listen to the CEOs who wanted him to order the reopening of their plants so they could have an excuse to justify not providing the protections demanded by the unions before they could be back to business as usual.

Maybe hospital execs at the highest level don’t care about the risks? 3M and others cannot be expected to expand their plants and workforce for a 1-3 year crisis without government funds and guarantees. Meat and testing are all valuable. But older people who work, people with inserting health issues (even unknown) should not be working without N95 or maybe P100 masks! Gloves we can find.  Many of us cannot go out safely without protection.  And those on the front lines: medical, janitorial, grocery, delivery, ... all need it for them and us.

This is outrageous and criminal as it amounts to state-sponsored ""reckless endangerment"" of their very citizens. You would hope that The United Food and Commercial Workers Union would resist this and defend their workers by calling strike and a boycott of food produced by companies with what amounts to slave labor.

They promote competition among line leads and shifts and the dial gets cranked up to high speed. But since the machines are half broken, there's always the saving grace for a break on production when the worker gets a small rest. Food production is also gross because there is no time to take care of personal hygiene when one has allergies or is sick. I'll never work in food processing ever again.

Their primary customer groups were schools and restaurants, and they are having a myriad set of challenges, finding other distribution channels. This is a massive disruption that I’m afraid will be felt for a very long time!

An excerpt:

“I think people are scared now because plants have had to shut down due to the high rates of COVID-19 among employees,” said Jodi Gauker, a beef farmer with her husband, Lee, at Gauker Farms in Richmond Township.
She maintains a social media presence, keeping customers informed of porch sales, where ground beef is a fast seller.
“I’m out of beef because these USDA plants are pretty much at capacity trying to keep up with increased demand for local meats,” she said Wednesday, noting that she’s been relying on local butchers Smuckers Meats, Mount Joy, Lancaster County, and Lehigh Valley Meats, Nazareth, Northampton County, to process her steers.

We've known this! Many have struggled against Republican intransigence on many levels - within and outside government.

Many among the desperate bought Trump's populist lies. They may still be blinkered by their beliefs and misplaced loyalties.

Remember--this state went blue and has a democratic governor. The bottom line is that we have zero federal leadership and all funds for public and state services have been siphoned off to line the pockets of Trump and his corporate cronies since he took office.

Most in America were already in crisis or on the edge.

There are also police cruisers parked outside some grocery stores.  Also in Florida gun stores are considered a necessity and they're selling lots of guns and ammo.  First time buyers who have never owned a firearm but now fear civil unrest, are very disappointed when they learn of the ID requirements and back ground checks that are required. Also, if they do not have a Florida driver's license and a Florida permit to carry a concealed weapon, they cannot take a pistol home the same day. There is a two-three day waiting period.  All of sudden they're learning that gun control laws exist and do work.  They are strictly enforced.
But, yeah, there are lines down here for everything.  Toilet paper is the same as gold currency.  
This morning at Publix there was some beef and poultry. Eggs were sold out.  No paper products.  The Walmart neighborhood grocery was cleaned out last night and had no beef, eggs, and two packages (4 rolls in a pack) of toilet paper. You may buy only one pack.  Soup and dry foods were also low in stock and at Winn Dixie the soup aisle had empty shelves and there were no beef or chicken products. Frozen food was almost gone.

But America doesn’t have a savings culture; we’re consumers.  When workers are being paid too little to save, as is the case for many, higher wages is the solution. When those who can save but don’t, then the problem is something else. This crisis should motivate us to address both."

I love this beautiful much-maligned state, with its tough people, malls, diners, Shore towns, and the gorgeous northwest of Sussex County. I long ago lost the ability to cry---too inured to personal hardship---but if I still had it, I would now, for New Jersey. I remember, with unspeakable fondness, Washington School and Roy W. Brown Jr. High in Bergenfield, NVRHS at Old Tappan, where my class was the first to be graduated, and also the friends and teachers we left at Demarest.

So I am forced into taking risk. Either my wife and kids starve, or I risk our health and find whatever work I can get. I choose to work and wear a mask as much as possible but reading the news, I believe the federal government failed me and millions of others. Los Angeles claims that anyone in their city can be tested for free. Why isn't free testing available in every city across America? Florida claims they have enough medical equipment to handle the crisis but other states have almost nothing. A face mask is nothing more than fabric sewed to a rubber band. Why is there a shortage of something so simple? Older airplanes use vacuum pumps, a technology that dates back to the 1940s. Ventilators use ""reed valves"" that are similar to vacuum pumps. How can there possibly be a shortage of equipment so primitive whose technology has been in use for 80 years in aviation?

Please remember, however, that NJ is in one of the most geographically advantageous locations in the entire world. It has many successful communities with schools that are consistently among the best in the country. Part of the state succeeds - always has, always will.

However, the state govt (and finances) are a debacle. It is all man-made. 

The solution to every problem is higher taxes. Who likes this arrangement? The public sector, which is the main beneficiary. What does it cause? Net migration out of the state. Where does it lead? A downward cycle of higher public sector demands, causing higher taxes, causing net migration out (lower potential tax base) and a non-business friendly environment. This is a continual loop over time.

It is incredulous that NJ can't manage a successful state government given its geography. Who's fault is that? The elected state government (governor and legislator).

Let's hope that the brainstorming session at the White House with Governor Murphy can produce some ideas that can help NJ break this unsustainable cycle.

In the immediate crisis caused by the economic shutdown, there should clearly be federal assistance. However, the big win is to finally set NJ on a sustainable path forward."

Well, one shock to the economy in the form of the Coronavirus Pandemic shows people that we need universal healthcare and better wages for people so they can start to save more for a rainy day.

I can never understand how regular people ( the 99%) would ever vote for candidates that openly push the interests of the 1% over their interests.  As far as I am concerned, the Republican party should be a party that is supported by no more than 20% of the population.

I advocate for universal healthcare and a higher minimum wage.  We need to decouple healthcare from a job.  A higher minimum wage and higher wages in general mean that aggregate demand would increase.  Yet, companies are short-sighted, failing to see that that would mean more revenues for them that would yield even more as their operations operate with better economies of scale.  It is not rocket science to see that.  But which company will make the first move?  That is where governments come in: they need to raise the minimum wage all across the country.

But we won't see that because people are mostly concerned with themselves.  Only a crisis like this exposes the fallacy of that mindset."

Why is somebody with a newish, $50,000ish car/truck/suv in line at a food bank. Are people misappropriating their funds? Are our priorities not in the right place?

I was recently able to buy a house (had I known COVID-19 was coming and what it would do with my job, I would have stayed home with my parents) and took advantage of some $0 down long-term payment plans to furnish my home. Those plans are nice, but at the end of the day it’s a payment that prevents us from saving and it masks the truth: That we’re all buying things we can’t actually afford, funding middlemen and women, and placing too much faith in an economy that really hasn’t been great for a majority of people."

That was how it was done in the 1930's but instead all of the money was given to large businesses.  

Almost every nation in the world is concerned about citizens that may die while in the United States the federal government is only concerned in having businesses companies making money so that there is a chance Trump will wind a election.  So much for the insanity of the United States."

Food pantries don’t operate themselves. If you’re not high risk and are looking for something to fill your time, please reach out to a local food bank and see how you can help. Many take small donations of extra food and other essentials (toilet paper, toothbrushes, etc.) and rely on entirely volunteer labor to unpack food from boxes, check for safety if consumption and then repack for distribution."

If ever the illusion of American democracy working to protect it’s people was in clear focus it’s now."

In theory we pay taxes so our government can payout for the things we can't do as individuals not so a handful of individuals can become billionaires.

If people aren’t buying, our economy shrivels up. It’s not just companies plying their wares, it’s a financial system that makes borrowing so easy, and rewards you for buying, buying and buying some more, and even a healthcare system that is based on people taking more drugs and having more procedures. Companies aren’t keeping people employed, consumers are. Which may be ok if we’re also willing to invest (ie, be taxed for) the safety net we need when a pandemic hits. If not, it’s like we’re relying on people spending and then pulling the rug out when the economy tanks."

I’m sorry, but part of the answer lies in the poor financial management and lifestyle choices made by people who thought a new car, expensive vacation, and other toys of consumer culture were more important than a savings account with a year or two of living expenses.

Look at the cars in these pictures - this might be the first bread line in human history populated with brand new SUV’s and designer clothes.  

No one expected the financial collapse we are seeing today. But everyone needs to fund their own savings with a year or two of living expenses - and fund it first, before that vacation, new car, or $150 football jersey with a millionaire athlete’s name on it.

New Jersey may be the 2nd wealthiest state in the country, but there are major regional differences.  New Jersey's wealth is concentrated in the northern half of the state.  

Excluding some of the Philadelphia suburbs, South Jersey is a rural area, with much of the land reserved by the Pine Barrens.   There are serious issues with chronic, entrenched rural poverty in this region that should not be papered over.  Egg Harbor Township, where this food bank is located, is not a wealthy area. The per capita income is $32,000; that's less than half the average per capita income of the state.  And Egg Harbor isn't doing that badly, compared to other parts of South Jersey. Things get worse as you move away from the Shore; the per capita income in Vineland is $25,000, and only $14,200 in Bridgeton."

The Coronavirus/COVID crisis continues to worsen, not only in America, but across the world.  American leadership could make the difference, but not with Trump at the helm.
Future historians will regard this as the Trump Plague and the Trump Global Recession.  The millions of deaths and the trillions of dollars lost worldwide will be due largely to Trump’s narcissism and obsessive hatred toward Obama.

This can mean 1 meal a day, or one meal every 2 days. That's hunger. If you were really really hungry, trust me, you wouldn't be putting gas in your car before you put food in your mouth."
2020-04-30 18:37,"Can the Times please use more specific headlines before declaring a nationwide food shortage in front-page headlines? ""Food bank lines"" would be more accurate in this particular headline. And they're really a crisis for those relying on food banks.

Food shortages, however, are not the case at supermarkets, whether one uses cash, credit or what used to be called food stamps, but which states have largely renamed (SNAP in California).

Food stamps are barely mentioned in the article, and then only to mention one food bank client who'd been turned down for them. Do we need to expand eligibility for food stamps during the current crisis? 

The supermarket-based distribution system seems to be working better than the food bank distribution system at the moment. The lines at the food banks are coexisting with crops being destroyed for supposed lack of customers."

It looks like the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program is a mirage for me and all of my fellow business owners / self-employed who are closed now.

If NJ and NJ would actually sort out how to put the PUA program into action it would help greatly. I know about six people, including myself, who do not qualify for regular unemployment and tried to apply for PUA instead. The process is a huge mess in both states...thus far no response to anyone in NY or NJ that isn't a regular W-2 wage earner. At this point I think that the PUA program will never actually pay a cent to anyone. Those food lines would reduce greatly if they got PUA in order!"

Imagine the unemployed paying their stimulus check for rent to a landlord who is doing just fine (not assuming all landlords are doing fine). The best we can do now is that if you get stimulus and don't need it, look for a local or national charitable group.

While my Governor is given plaudits for his leading role and candor I give more credit for his calling out the media, the NYT, WSJ, CDC, NIH; in other words just about everybody. My opinion, for what little it's worth, is that a failure of leadership in these two states amplified by a failure of leadership at the critical early moments and amplified by a failure of national leadership by the President, the Speaker, the candidate opposing Trump have all contributed and in populous states failed leadership leads to catastrophe.

30million people have applied for unemployment. Think about that for one second. If you think these people are “profligate spenders” because they couldn’t survive a couple months of no income, then what must be said of the companies who have thrown them off their payrolls in less than a month despite a record economy and record profits for most industries? 

Most of us in the middle have recognized for a long time that this economy is all smoke and mirrors. Wage stagnation, increased costs of living, fewer worker protections, higher health care costs, and the destruction of the social safety net, combined with the “disruptive” technologies that created the gig-economy, created this mess. It’s just taken the virus to show how awful it really is."

We currently have a governor who never saw a tax he didn't like, and NJ residents pay in aggregate some of highest tax rates in the nation. The infrastructure is a mess, and more NJ residents move out of the state than move into it every year. Businesses are fleeing the state for lower tax jurisdictions. I was laid off, not due to Covid, but because my former employer chose to relocate to a southern state with much lower tax rates. NJ's municipal bonds are saddled with a high degree of credit risk meaning they must pay high rates of interest. What we do have is a governor who is in love with spending hard earned taxpayer money. As just one example, I previously learned that our current governor decided to provide college tuition assistance to illegal aliens. So, if this article surprised you it shouldn't have. It's not your fault that you couldn't put money away for a rainy day because the governor is too busy spending it on his pet causes."

I see processed foods flying off the shelves. 
Maybe more people have to learn to cook while they are sheltered-in-place and learn to eat things that were considered fine fare in the past.
Hopefully, some how, we will all get through this and will never ever again look down on those needing well fare. Maybe we will learn some new things about ourselves and have stories to tell generations who are born after the crisis what it was really about.

2020-04-30 22:04,"Does nobody see the glaring questions this column refuses to address?

First of all, everyone who has lost a job is eligible for unemployment benefits.  And these are not ""the usual"" unemployment benefits--they are supplemented by an additional $600 per week under the PPP program.  That means, the casino employee who was surviving on a $12.50 per hour job ($500 per week) is now receiving nearly $1,200 per week as am unemployed person.  For most folks,  unemployment benefits now exceed what workers were receiving in their paychecks.  For a working couple, both losing their jobs, unemployment benefits alone will provide $114, 400 in benefits--for staying home!   There is no mention of this anywhere in the piece.

Secondly, miss 2 paychecks and then drive to the local food bank because you can't afford to put food on the table?  Really?  

Thirdly...while there is no doubt there are homeless or underemployed folks in the country who need to turn to food banks for help, are we to believe that laid-off employees, with the benefits that are available to them, go hungry a few minutes later?  Does financial mismanagement come into play here---given we have had several years of a booming economy?  

I find this piece to be completely disingenuous, biased and exaggerated.  It's also lazy.  Near as I can tell, it serves only one purpose--to slam capitalism and our current president."

Food banks are equipped to serve about the number of people that they have been accustomed to serving.  As a distribution medium for an additional client base measured in the tens of millions?  Not likely.

The normal distribution network for food, in the US is severely strained due to supply chain stress.  Half of the American food budget has been spent on food away from home.  <a href=""https://www.fb.org/market-intel/u.s.-food-expenditures-at-home-and-abroad"" target=""_blank"">https://www.fb.org/market-intel/u.s.-food-expenditures-at-home-and-abroad</a>.  This is, of course, a measure of cost not quantity, but it does show that more food must wind up in grocery stores that was originally intended for restaurants and fast food.

However, the only practical way to get food to the current number of financially distressed Americans is through food purchased at regular retail outlets.  Food stamps must be expanded greatly, nothing else will satisfy the current need.

It is time for the only entities capable of responding to the current emergency to step up and do so."

One day, waiting for the train from an interview, he noticed the grocery store near the station throwing away the day old food. Long story short, our local Food Bank was born. 
His lesson to my young twenty something self was profound on many levels. First, that anyone can be out of a job for any reason and it often has nothing to do with your knowledge and abilities or hard work ethos. Second, that there are truly amazing, selfless people all around us living ordinary lives. My friend, at the depth of his despair, was thinking of others￼ first. 
I hope we can all do that in this time when we are all affected by the financial retraction of everything, our own loneliness, and our own sorrows. There are many who need our help. On your way out of the grocery store, put some food in the bin for the local food bank, send a check to them and/or to the Salvation Army who feeds millions daily.

But they can be blamed for doing nothing to slow it down, and in fact weakening the country’s ability to deal with possible pandemics (eg disbanding the pandemic team).  They can also be blamed for exacerbating the economic woes in the wake of the pandemic:  the corporate tax break handout that further strengthened inequality at tax payer expense, and doing absolutely nothing to buttress a spiraling economy as a result of the pandemic, except calling for a reopening.  So yes, Trump did not start the pandemic—but how bad the country suffers due to the economic and social response (or lack thereof) to the pandemic he does own."
2020-04-29 13:28,"Speaking as a millennial, I thought that 2008 was a “once in a lifetime” event and that at the earliest I would see something that bad again only in my old age. It is staggering to see something worse happen again so soon. I m sad to say that I now expect to see 3-4 more events of this sort in my lifetime, with climate change delivering the final knockout punch. This has had a concrete impact on the family I plan to have, where I want to live, etc. 

It would be interesting to see what percentage of the population sees an event like this as an aberration and the number for whom this is just the new normal."

Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin irrationally said that he expected the economy to “really bounce back” this summer.

Most independent economists are much less optimistic. 

Almost everything that comes out of this Administration's mouth is fantasy, fiction or fraud.

We are in a Deep Depression.

And the Republican Party, which is historically inept at public policy and economics, has no idea what to do or say about it.

What this Administration should be doing is talking about food bank and soup line management, infrastructure investment and aid to cities and states to get America through this.

2020-04-29 13:46,"There was a disparity during the great recession in what type of jobs were created coming out of it. Most of those jobs were in the service industry. The gap between the very wealthy and the poorer became greater. More of Americans were working for minimum wage than ever before. The middle class was becoming an endangered species. 

Let's move on to today. Service jobs were the first to go. Close to 50% of Americans do not have enough savings to make it to the next month. The sector of the economy that helped lift people out of the last recession has collapsed.

The tax circa 2017 has reduced government coffers to a pittance. Large Corporations and the very wealthy no longer pay their fair share or much of any share- just ask Trump- about how smart he is. So, not only are 50% of Americans on financial life support, the American government cannot collect enough taxes from those who can afford to pay taxes to underwrite what the pandemic is going to cost us. 
Oh, I forgot, our taxes, those for the bottom 98% of us have been deferred until July putting states and local municipalities at severe financial risk. I don't see most people's situation getting much better by July.

 Kind of makes one wonder, who do we want leading this country. Someone as smart as Trump, who doesn't pay income taxes and makes sure that none of his cronies do either, someone who runs financial scams and takes pride in it? They call it the Art of the Deal."

It needs to ramp up testing and test everyone, trace everyone who is infected, isolate them, and then let everyone else get a test and go back to work if they are clear. 

Repeated testing will be necessary and highly advanced centralized tracing/tracking information technology systems will be needed.

To get to five million tests and accurate rapid results we need the Federal Government, i.e., The President, to provide the leadership.  We need a testing, contact tracing, and associated advanced information system Manhatten Project level operation.   We need it yesterday.   

If you speak with people who know, they will tell you that there are shortages of reagents, swabs, and many other essential materials, manufacturing, integration, information sharing, etc.    We need to put DARPA or some combination of federal resources together with a contract and logistical management between all the germane corporations, academics, and so on and we need to get the testing required to test everyone. 

As I've said and will repeat.  We know that up to 50% of infected carriers do not have symptoms (asymptomatic) and thus they can spread at much higher rates.   Thus, we need to test everyone and then send healthy people back to work, to shops, to restaurants, to movie theaters, etc.   

This can be done and save the global economy.  So, Mr. President? Faster!"

Now to use Trump’s term, there is “nothing in the cupboard”, when money could be eased into the system.
I don’t think it is the place of the Fed Chair to bolster the President.  His job is to bolster the interests of the taxpayer.
That would exclude Trump and much of big business, since they don’ pay taxes."

North doesn't understand the Fed can print trillions.  The economy is backstopped. It's the dismal science for a reason, and the Fed is distorting regular economic laws right now.

Most small mom/pops will come back slowly. There will be a large switch to digital for a bit until there is a vaccine, and the economy will continue. People will slowly be hired back up once the generous $600 a week is pulled.

These are actual, word-for-word responses: ""People are going to have to adjust their priorities."" ""There are many better things shop clerks and restaurant servers could be doing than selling us stuff and food we don’t need.""

Worst economy in my 75 years for sure.  This is another example of how statisticians simply hide reality with a flick of the wrist.

Imagine aliens orbiting the earth and studying how we do business. Here is the report of their science officer:

“Captain Blorg, I  have traveled among the Homo Sapiens who live in the United States. As we observed in the 1950s, they continue to sprawl outward from their cities, destroying perfectly arable land and building facilities called ‘strip malls.’ But they have changed since our ‘flying saucers’ visited. Now in these marketplaces, you will not find a single location that sells a durable good, except perhaps for a mattress store. 

“Everything else is dedicated to food, fitness, or fun. There are also emporiums for buying addictive devices with small screens, or large fortress-like vehicles intended for off-road recreation or tradesman work but never used in that manner. Before the virus, they would go to these facilities In the fortress vehicles, instead of walking or riding bicycles, as sane beings would do.  Sometimes they would pilot the vehicles while staring at the small screens, resulting in much death and injury. 

“If the virus had not  collapsed their economy, I conclude that some other event would have done it. They are fragile and doomed. The poor believe in a god called Lotto, while the rich or aspirational worship a god called Market. Their common Deity? Celebrity. I recommend no contact, as they are contaminating other nations with their stupidity and shallowness.”"
2020-04-29 13:10,"There will be many structural changes in our economy as this virus lingers maybe for years?  Companies who fail to change with it will fail.  We won't be returning to the retail binge economy.  We won't need as many cars (working from home and not traveling will negate the need), oil demand will stay down, travel will be greatly curtailed. We will learn to live more at home (not a bad thing).  But you are kidding yourself if you think our former lives will return. They won't."
2020-04-29 13:15,"I honestly thought the retraction would have been over 5%. It's just an opinion since I've never seen every single aspect of life shut down along with record unemployment claims. That said, it will continue being a rough few months. We'll likely see at least another quarter or two of retractions leading into a recession. 

Then on top of that, there will be a global recession. Almost all of the G-20 is shut down now, and even in places where the virus is under control like South Korea or New Zealand, they can't lead the global economy if everyone else is shut down and not moving. It's a global trickle effect with the lack of demand all over the board. My only hope is we get a better handle on how to co-exist with this virus which includes better treatment to building up healthcare systems around the world to be ready for another wave."

Each Governor therefor is going his or her own way, there is no national conscious, some state are open, but if you try to fly to California for vacation, we are closed.  People are not sure what is going on so they are being conservative, and that is going to hurt the nation.

Third - we need to institute a federal tax plan that taxes the rich at much higher rates and eliminates tax breaks, e.g. tax breaks for hedge funds.

That one was actually entirely Trump's fault, partly because of a rash action that he took in spite of dire warnings from his advisers as to how bad it could get and how long it might last.  He ignored all that because he didn't want to hear it and thought he could 'will' the outcome he wanted.  Sound familiar? They were unprepared for what happened next, just as they are now, constantly caught off guard by the cascading consequences of not understanding what vital services would be affected, what public reaction would be and painting an unrealistically rosy picture.  Then, as now Trump increasingly declared certain classes of workers ""essential"", forcing them back to work without pay.  Now he's beginning to force workers he deems essential to his re-election bid back to work in an environment that may very well end their lives while pressing for liability protection for employers who don't take proper measures to protect them.  Unbelievable that Trump has been given a second opportunity to make most of the same arrogant blunders and once again bring the nation down."

    Without testing we still have these two problems ; the economy will completely free-fall if we don’t open soon , and if we do open soon I believe that might cause another COVID outbreak with just more deaths .  
     Thank you Mr. President for ignoring your intelligence briefings and ignoring the numerous phone calls to you in December and January telling you that this pandemic is for real . Thank you for doing absolutely NOTHING about this and instead relying on the Chinese to snuff it out against the advice of whatever experts were left after you tore apart the Pandemic Readiness Task Force .

It will take more than Trump's bravado and alternate facts to bring this economy back.

The market crashed 27% in one month after that recommendation before recouping much of the losses (but it is still down 5%).

2020-04-29 15:05,"At this point I feel like the only hope many people have is that the financial wipeout will be so great that the systems -- bankruptcy, mortgage foreclosures, etc -- will actually be able to strip people of their property.

And even if they do, short of segments of residential real estate, the repossessed assets will have so little near term value due to so little potential market of buyers that it won't make any sense to repossess them."

Personally, I will have to live a lot mean  leaner to be able to pay the most essential of bills  And as I'm sure this is shared by the many, the true barometer of our economy - discretionary consumer spending - will sink to almost zero. You can open up, but that doesn't mean consumers are ready or able to spend.  Rising food bank need  and unemployment, these are the things, I think, will unfortunately shape our summer, Be compassionate. Help out where you can."
2020-04-29 15:06,"So America, there you have it. The economy has tanked and the nation is gripped by governance paralysis in a global pandemic. This morning, for balm, I was reading President Kennedy's eulogy of Robert Frost in Amherst, October 1963. Somehow, I realized how much 45 has degraded America. He has invited the fate, as Kennedy said, quoting Frost of [making America] have... ""nothing to look backward to with pride, and nothing to look forward to with hope."""
2020-04-29 15:07,Even the health and economic catastrophe of this magnitude keeps Trump and his business cronies smiling with trillions of dollars of the bailout package in pockets while leaving millions in tears and worried for the future. So much about the contraction in economy of the decade.

2020-04-29 15:10,"So, there is the real economy and the market.  The real economy has had a shock like it has never seen, it has gone into a catatonic state and will not recover until there is a vaccine.  The market is a different matter, it is propped up by the Fed, by the Treasury.  So, when Mr. Mnuchin says there will be rapid recovery, he is thinking of the market.  For that matter, the  market has already recovered, gaining back some 30% within even less time than the real economy to implode."

Besides, it's the states' responsibility. The whole thing? It's Chinas fault. Hydroxychloroquine is the cure. See, this science stuff is easy.  The President gets to decide when the economy reopens, Its the Democrats who spent $2 trillion on handouts. They tried to close our churches and take away our guns. And that's what's important, because prayer is what will defeat this silent enemy. And everything was opened in time for Easter, just like the President promised. From the Fox News view point, what did I miss?"

2020-04-29 14:48,"Granted Trump's incompetence made a bad situation even worse, but he wasn't hired to be a phenomenal statesman; his job was to weaken government, enrich himself and his cronies, and humiliate liberals. So far, very good indeed. Our government is in disarray, and I worry that it can't be rescued by anyone now.

But every honest and objective person knows and sees that.

So I want to move on to China's great guilt in this epic mess, the coronavirus. It came from there, yet they haven't uttered one word of apology that I've heard. They need to own up to that fact and, most importantly, beg the world's forgiveness over and over. For shame, China. Your shabby behavior created a pandemic that will kill who knows how many and has all but destroyed the world's economy. In fact, how can that be forgiven? People's lives and dreams are now in tatters.

And, oddly, most world leaders don't seem angry at all at Covid-19's perpetrator; they just overlook it as if to say, Oh, well, stuff happens.

I don't believe that I have to say that the world should demand that China dismantle and destroy its wet market. It's killing us.

From what I can learn so far, though, it's business as usual in China's wet market. Am I wrong? Have they cleaned up their act? If so, that's the least they can do.

If China were responsible, they would help pay for the damage coronavirus has done. It wasn't any other nation's fault, which, of course, doesn't forgive Trump's lousy handling of the situation."
2020-04-29 15:03,"The degree of harm caused by this viral pandemia has been enormous, in life and economy, due to the by-choice negligence of Trump/Pence/Mnuchin/etc, their indifference to all the 'alerts' sent to them when there was still a chance to make a difference. What were they thinking, if any? And the worse, no apologies for the thousands of deaths under their belts, no contrition for their incompetence in listening to the concerned voices of health experts? What a sham!  And demagogue Trump, a cruel bully who maintains his innocence in this mayhem, remains shameless while blaming others of his glaring ineptitude, and shooting his own foot in the process. And all at our expense!"
2020-04-29 14:30,"I want to forget Donald Trump for a moment. Now isn’t that pleasant?

Imagine aliens orbiting the earth and studying how we do business. Here is the report of their science officer:

“Captain Blorg, I  have traveled among the Homo Sapiens who live in the United States. As we observed in the 1950s, they continue to sprawl outward from their cities, destroying perfectly arable land and building facilities called ‘strip malls.’ But they have changed since our ‘flying saucers’ visited. Now in these marketplaces, you will not find a single location that sells a durable good, except perhaps for a mattress store. 

“Everything else is dedicated to food, fitness, or fun. There are also emporiums for buying addictive devices with small screens, or large fortress-like vehicles intended for off-road recreation or tradesman work but never used in that manner. Before the virus, they would go to these facilities In the fortress vehicles, instead of walking or riding bicycles, as sane beings would do.  Sometimes they would pilot the vehicles while staring at the small screens, resulting in much death and injury. 

“If the virus had not  collapsed their economy, I conclude that some other event would have done it. They are fragile and doomed. The poor believe in a god called Lotto, while the rich or aspirational worship a god called Market. Their common Deity? Celebrity. I recommend no contact, as they are contaminating other nations with their stupidity and shallowness.”"

That was the stable genius re: his 
administration's response to the pandemic.

Can't wait for his response on the impact of his mishandling of the economy.

Oh, and what about the USA's national debt? 
Silly me, I forgot that the GOP are only deficit hawks when they are not in power."
2020-04-29 15:08,"When will a vaccine be administered to everyone so that there will be confidence in traveling about and the economy will have the chance to function like it used to? Mid 2023.  Vaccine production will begin in 1Q21 then it has to be distributed AND ADMINISTERED to every person in NA, SA, Europe, China, Australia, most of Asia and the Middle East and many parts of Africa. Then, and only then, will the world feel comfortable to get on airplanes and travel and then and only the will governments feel comfortable allowing planes to land without threat of Ubering the virus back. The time to distribute and administer vaccine (that has to be kept refrigerated) to every person in the planet, far exceeds the time to develop and manufacture doses. I’m sorry"
2020-04-29 14:58,"I'm not overly religious, but I still think the coronavirus is a divine intervention because humanity was doing such a poor job of dealing with Trump.  It's really bringing out the worst in the Trump government and it's testing people on a day-to-day basis, so what happens to the economy remains to be seen."
2020-04-29 15:11,"The president will assume full responsibly for what he perceives as a good economy. For anything other than that, it is the burden on someone else. This rule can be applied to anything you look at. Good = takes full responsibility, Bad = someone else’s fault. Would he ever admit to being wrong, or at fault, under any circumstances? I suppose it’s possible, if he knew ahead of time that there was something in it for him."
2020-04-29 15:11,"One thing I can hope is the US has a serious discussion about what constitutes a 'great' economy.  One which vastly enriches 2% of the population, leaving the other 98% barely managing to save (as is evidenced by the simple fact that only 6 weeks in, most people are out of money entirely), or one which enriches everyone?

As some of the business owners in the article realize, the economy is based, not on hedge funds, or banks, or the richest among us, it's based on ordinary people buying stuff - the very same people who never really benefitted from the economy.  The actual job creators are not and have never been those rich we coddle, give huge subsidies to, and provide national debt crushing tax cuts for, but those self-same ordinary people buying stuff.

The economic impact will be directly proportional to the health impact, meaning that so long as the vast majority aren't buying (either through stay-at-home or simply fear of getting sick in those places that are 'reopening') because of Covid-19, we will not see the economy 'bounce back' as this sorry excuse for an administration likes to delusionally believe.  Indeed, as business owners understand, if we reopen and there's a 2nd wave of infections, there's no coming back except through a decade of suffering similar to the Great Depression.  Except this time, we're unlikely to have a political environment that feels that investing in the nation and not its richest is the best course."
2020-04-29 15:17,"Just hope Ben, after witnessing the installation of our current Fearless Leader  behind the desk of the Oval Office on January 23, 2017 that more people like myself managed to read the tea leaves and remembered that the last several Recessions were instigated during the previous three Republican Administrations. And then realized that it would be foolhardy not to prepare for the worst, since this fellow we have have now leading the parade had a much worse past as both a business man and a human being than his past three GOP predecessors . Unfortunately for our country, our economy and the world at large, the readings of the tea leaves and the profligacy of the GOP are proving right- And In Spades."
2020-04-29 14:40,"Consumers are justifiably spooked about returning to retail, restaurants, workplaces  -especially on the word, guidance and exhortation of a staggeringly ignorant and lazy president who wantonly neglected the fact that a devastating plague would strike our country and then lied through his teeth and promoted snake oil when it did. The smartest way to restore confidence and get the economy moving again is to throw the GOP out of every office possible."
2020-04-29 14:43,We have the worst president and worst administration at the worst possible time.  Our only hope to recover from this is to remove those that literally allowed this catastrophe to balloon the way it has because of their continued ignorance and incompetence.

      What was he thinking ? That the experts were wrong and he’s such a stable genius that he knows better ?? 
     This is so disastrous on so many levels . Trump couldn’t even successfully use the Defense Production Act to instruct manufacturers to produce PPE !! He has done Nothing ... 
    The irony is that if he had acted early upon the advice from his intelligence team , utilized the Defense Production Act and had the Pandemic task force intact so they could act on day ONE back in December or January ,it would have been an easy win for himself . Easy . And it would have raised his chances for re- election. 
     He’s one big FOOL . This man has got to go , but if Justin Amash runs as a Libertarian, then he’s only giving his nemesis ,Donald Trump , a much better chance at winning . How selfish can Amash be . He’s only out for himself ."

Good news is - Biden will not defeat Trump."
2020-04-29 15:22,"The formerly powerful Western nations are at a turning point today.

Today's unprecedented global health crisis exhibits the inherent weaknesses of the free market system responsible for sending millions of former middle class citizens to the ranks of the indigent.

Jeff Bezos and his peers may not enjoy hearing the fact that universal basic income has come of age because most of us are fed up and resentful with having to accept a rigid dualistic society compromised of 'winners' and 'losers'.   Let us aim for a fairer and more humane society where everyone has decent access to the most basic needs without excessive frills."

Otherwise, let the younger people and businesses to open and get back to work if they wish to get the economy going and generate tax revenue needed to sustain our fight against the virus.

This across the board one size fit all shutdown is not a solution and needs to end now."

2020-04-29 15:28,"I'm not sure it's a bad thing that there will be fewer restaurants, fewer car trips, and less buying of cheap goods. Maybe we can use this pause and retool the economy to put more effort into green industries, i.e. recycling centers, solar power, and start-ups that can harness other forms of energy. Maybe we can use the pandemic crisis to push for universal healthcare and better educational opportunities so people don't have to settle for minimum wage jobs in the service industry all their lives. Maybe we can rework the tax system so that some of those billions held by the 1% could be used to support the 99%. Oh well, I can dream, can't I?"
2020-04-29 15:28,"So I guess when we all get back to work and the economy starts to hit on all 8 cylinders again, the stock market will nose dive? 

Is it just me or is there a total disconnect between the stock market and the economy? 

Why is it skyrocketing with bad news, horrible news, and with even worse to come? 

I guess it is because with bad news comes more stimulus.....but that cannot last forever. At some point the markers come due........

Yet wall street is acting like there will be unlimited resources to prop everything up. Following that philosophy, it is not going to  end well for anybody."
2020-04-29 15:28,"So Trump and various members of his administration are going to talk about an amazing recovery that will start in the third quarter.

At least every one hundred years;
That rampant contagions endure to the last
When we have surrendered to tears                   
Or had ourselves vanquished by fears.

Bubonic plague, cholera, then Spanish flu,   
And now we have Covid-19,
Another invisible killer on cue
Has caught us betwixt and between
The public or mass quarantine.

How long we will frantically oscillate
Before safely making a choice
Depends on astuteness deciding our fate
With one uncontested voice:
Now that gives us pause to rejoice."

Divisiveness is ubiquitous and it is leaving us rudderless at a time when all that matters is the next step we take. Great leaders know that the solution and hope is found in a united people, encouraged and pointed in a common direction - without which we will remain rudderless in a stormy sea."

There will be some opportunities for those who can adapt or start relevant necessary businesses.  But overall I think that people are going to say ""Do we really need to buy this?"" Do we really need to do this?"".  Want will be superseded by need. And the truth is, we don't need as much as Madison Av make us think we did."
2020-04-29 15:50,"How I wish anyone in or near the White House had an iota of the intelligence and good sense of Nadar Masadeh (the businessman quoted in this article)!

Thank you for two articles today that counter Trump-Mnuchin-Birx-Pence-Fox-GOP spin with cold facts and voices of reality like Mr. Masadeh’s.

This article makes clear what everyone other than our national leadership has been saying since the pandemic took root: fixing the wealth crisis first requires fixing the health crisis.  

Mass testing, contact tracing, social distancing, masks, adequate medical equipment and PPE, law enforcement of public health measures: these are the tools of bringing confidence to consumers and businesses that resuming daily commerce is safe.  

This is where Trump et al. have utterly failed. 

The second article shows what’s also become clear: we don’t know the real impact of the virus because of grossly insufficient testing and contact tracing, but mounting factual and anecdotal evidence shows the rates of infection and deaths are much higher than officially reported. 

Net net: this is a lethal and highly contagious virus.  Most Americans didn’t vote for Trump and his minions.  The GOP can suppress the vote and win elections by cheating and lying, but they can’t make most Americans risk their health to revive the economy.  

Fix the health crisis first, the economic rebound will follow."
2020-04-29 15:50,"There is no magic bullet or elixir to fix the current mess.  It calls for sustained improvement across several levels including :

1.  Holding our leadership accountable for better, calmer and consistent messaging and management during a crisis

2.  Electing people who are, to put it simply and mildly - better than the current incumbent and his toadies

3.  Enforcing rules and regulations via international bodies on countries like China which pose a systemic risk of exposure to dangerous pathogens

4.  Adding capacity and slack to our supply chain and bringing more of it into our own borders so that we can mitigate the disruption to the supply / demand equilbrium

5.  Improving the state of our healthcare to ensure that we don't leave our needy citizens lurching in the dark to fend on their own.

6.  Redirecting our spend resources to enable heath services to be at the forefront of our sciences and technology as opposed to current state."
2020-04-29 15:51,I have always thought that no matter how Trump and a lot of the Republican governors huffed and puffed about opening the economy up only when people feel safe will they come out and spend money again.  I am optimistic about things for the first time in a while hoping that the virus might give us a breather during the summer and anti viral medicine and vaccines might bring some hope soon. Lets cross our fingers.
2020-04-29 15:54,"And yet the stock markets go up 2%. Why?

My guess is that the speculators figure they will be able to get out at a profit next time we spend a trillion in newly printed dollars.

2020-04-29 15:56,"I am actually pretty hopeful.  We have completely flattened the curve and the medical system has not been overwhelmed.  As we start re-opening, more people will get sick, and if we don't re-open, more innocent lives and families are guaranteed to be economically destroyed.  Nothing is black and white in these situations, and life is full of risks by definition.  An estimated 88,000 people die from alcohol-related causes each and every year (more than died during the entire Vietnam war) - including both consumers and a whole lot of  innocent victims.  This is a price that we are willing to accept, and we ask people to take personal responsibility with their behavior.  As with booze, not everyone will behave responsibly, but hopefully most will.  Wouldn't be betting against the US economy even in these most dire of circumstances."

And oh yes, a progressive tax structure similar to the post World War II era and an end to the trickle-down economics that benefited the rich almost entirely.

Will we do it? Of course not. We're all champing at the bit to get back to our profligate ways and an economy that treats the 1% like royalty and the bottom 80% not so well.

I don't think the bounce-back will be total, however, for years  or even decades to come. Millions will change their spending habits, some out of fear of contracting the virus, others recognizing the need to stash funds away for the next catastrophe, whatever form it takes."
2020-04-29 16:00,"If Trump had an once of empathy for others we might been able to do much better. There is such a disconnect with trump's leadership. To open the economy we needed business leaders of different industries to meet with the country's top health experts. Let the health experts dictate to the business leaders what health precautions you need to take to keep workers safe. Business leaders will then devise a strategy within their industry to satisfy the healthcare experts recommendations. These actions must be in coordination with OSHA and teams of health inspectors making sure that the businesses are following the regulations or face huge fines and be held ""libel"" for keeping those safety protocols religiously in place. These actions could have been in place a month ago, unfortunately there is no empathy in their planning coming from the president or his administration regarding the working man and women in America.

It is shameful the administration is still preparing to admit 85,000 Chinese and Indian citizens on H1-B foreign worker visas for 2020. This adds to the 1.5 million who are already here. 

Our government should have an immigration policy that supports sourcing workers from our population and our educational system. In contrast to stimulus checks, it costs next to nothing for the U.S. government to stop issuing foreign worker visas. 

When we bring in foreigners to work, we are really offering them the right to take one of a limited number of jobs in our economy, taking jobs that would otherwise go to unemployed Americans. The pitchforks are coming."

2020-04-29 16:02,"I predict that the American economy will be part of a very deep global depression. Unless there is political change with total control of the government given to progressive Democrats, the Federal response as we are seeing will be inadequate, delayed, and reactive and most concerned with the interests of banks, corporations, and the wealthy elite. This will lead to a very prolonged and painfully incomplete recovery with even greater social and income inequalities and threatened cuts to the social safety net, healthcare, and local and state governments in the name of fiscal austerity. If the Democrats get total control of the government, they will renew Roosevelt’s New Deal and have massive and generous Federal spending programs of infrastructure, renewable energy, job retraining, healthcare, aid to embattled State and local governments, and make fighting the Pandemic, testing Americans,and creating expeditiously an effective vaccine our foremost  priorities.

The drop is real but rather than a free fall with no bottom, there’s is an elasticity that is not being factored in....it doesn’t make the crisis any better but it makes it *different*. If there Is a
sudden cure, or of it passes relatively quickly, the economy has more inherent fuel sources than a recession caused purely by economic drivers.

It's curious that the stimulus bills have provided relatively small funds for increased testing, which along with quarantines and contact tracing, is what we need to rebuild (not restart) the economy.  This is the first economic crisis that is really a health crisis, and unfortunately we're still fighting the previous war, using the same monetary and fiscal tools when we really need an effective, coordinated national health policy.  The administration can make all the happy talk they want about V-curves and pent-up demand, but the election is not until November and it will be obvious they can't deliver prior to voting.

When workers don't compete for jobs, jobs compete for workers and the result is an unmotivated worker that drags the company down.  We need more people on welfare and fewer people working at jobs they don't do well, if the economy is going to be healthy.  Never mind the people.  That's not the economist's concern.

Alas, we're looking at over $50,000.00 borrowed per taxpayer this year.   Mor debt, to prop up the debt pyramid. 

Wework is the best example I can think of.  Trump being Softbank, pouring $15 billion into a Company that, if they pour $5 billion more into, will still be worthless.

That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome....

""With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch,
They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch;
They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings;
So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things....

And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true

2020-04-29 17:34,"As bad as this is, I mean the deaths and losses of work and small enterprises, the only silver lining is the possible end of the trump debacle. Nothing symbolized it more than pence at the Mayo. We will pull out of this but we need the democrats to now Shepard us forward. Otherwise the republicans will do their best to grab more power for their country club cronyism. If you look at what happened to real estate before during and after the great housing debacle, real estate just became another form of oppression going forward. Those same republicans will try to grab as much as they can when we emerge from this, the great pandemonium. Greed is spelled with a capital R."

I don't even dare to imagine Mr Trump in charge of ""The worst economy in our lifetime""..."
2020-04-29 17:50,"This is simply the beginning of the end of the ponzi scheme that has been in place in American capitalism since the 1950s. The older you were the better the deal you got - especially with wages and pensions - and debt and other obligations have been passed along to younger generations. There's going to need to be a lot of restructuring. Maybe some will need to agree to reduced pensions.

On the bright side, younger people who have been shut out of the more traditional professions or were stuck on the lower rungs of the corporate ladder should find that many baby boomers have chosen to finally step aside. They will be able to ride-up the inevitable boom that always follows a bust. Something they couldn't do after 2008 because of entrenched power."

We really have no other choice."
2020-04-29 17:54,"The so-called ""greatest generation"" was born during the ""1st world war"" lived through the ""Great Depression” and followed up with the ""2nd world war"".
Given the size of the global population the Crusades (1096–1291) and Mongol Conquests (1205–1312) were far larger wars (The siege of Baghdad in 1258 killed over 1 million people in 11 days.)
So now we have something looming with a lot of people running around trying to figure out if what's happening. Basically, they are trying to explain the coming economic event with a single word followed by a Roman numeral. So we have the ""D""pression word or the ""R""ecession word. Either one is bad and running around trying to name it is a distraction from containing it.
The attempts by the Trump administration to contain the economic problem are looking more like what we saw in the Weimar Republic following WWI in Germany and less than what we saw from FDR.
Now, the foundation of the new economy is, in its simplest terms, a choice between a guns and/or butter economic solution. Guns have been proven to be effective medicine for economic ills, but can we use guns to duck an economic pandemic and not have it called ""The Last World War""?
The current administration clearly does not have the skill to manage us through a “butter” solution without risking a fall into a Weimar situation.
So, what do we do?"

2020-04-29 18:01,"So, it's about time we added a 'quality of life' metric to come before GDP. Additionally, we should amend all corporate charters in the US to place this metric before profit.

Using GDP only means we are basing the meaning of our lives as a nation on our consumption. How wrong!

Ever-increasing GDP also means we want to get back on track destroying the earth and its atmosphere. How wrong! Remember Global Warming? It's still there, and we've just had a taste of what awaits us if we do nothing.

Notice how clean the air feels now? It's great. Why do we want to go back to living in a pollution soup? We don't.

Ever-increasing GDP means we want to get back to exploiting the working class as exemplified by meat processing plants. How dare the super-rich demand that these workers 'get back in there' and 'take one for the team' without proper PPE or giving them full rights as citizens? Many are refusing as the measly minimum wage isn't worth dying for."

The second-largest economy in the world, the largest purchaser of our commodities, and the workshop to American companies will have a great big say. So, it's time for Team Trump to stop antagonizing China and place the U.S.-China relations back on track for the short term. In the long term, it makes sense for the entire world to diversify its supply chain, but this is not the time to gum up the gears of the global economy: the U.S. labor market is looking at 20 to 30 percent unemployment, and any building up of supply chain is a years-long process."
2020-04-29 18:13,It’s time for this country to rethink the type of capitalism that has evolved since the “so called” Reagan Revolution.  It has led to a few Americans becoming very wealthy and a few companies becoming huge monopolies.  While the rest of us are just treading water and fewer and fewer start ups and innovations.  With climate change heating up and the potential for more Covid-19 type pandemics we cannot continue down this path.  Unless we are okay with the collapse of our entire system.  These are the kind of things that can lead to violent revolutions.

Apparently the top 10 tech stocks account for some 27% of the S&P 500.  Somehow that more than compensates for all the businesses (some quite large, such as fossil fuel and airline related industries) that are crashing bigly.

2020-04-29 18:17,"Trump may not have initiated the Coronavirus but he certainly is responsible for delays, bad planning, poor judgment, and diversionary and unproductive fighting and blame-shifting. 

For example, Trump repeatedly says “the cupboard was bare” referring to the nation’s strategic reserves of medical equipment like ventilators, and personal protective equipment. 

But Trump seems to ignore or is ignorant to the fact that under Obama -- who Trump has openly despised to the point of unwinding all of his predecessor's initiatives) -- they had to deal with epidemics that included SARS, H1N1, EBOLA, and others, all of which taxed U.S. reserves.

Then Trump also ignores the fact that Republican Senate under Mitch McConnell limited what Obama administration could spend to restock reserves, forcing Obama to make very surgical and precise decisions on what to buy with limited federal money. 

Then Trump conveniently ignores the fact that for the three plus years that Trump has been in office with a Republican Senate, the Trump administration failed, utterly failed, to “restock the cupboard.”  Trump could have restocked reserves of personal protective equipment, failed to build up a reserve of ventilators, failed to provide other strategic supplies. 

Finally, Trump conveniently ignores the fact that he dismantled the one vital organization that Obama administration set up to deal with pandemics and biological epidemics under the National Security Council."

These gaps are filled in by statistical estimates. The gaps are largest in the small business and service sectors which are most impacted by the virus. They don’t get filled in until tax return and industry surveys are conducted and analyzed. This can take years. A good guess what this quarter will look like in the summer of 2023? -8%

They will gladly resume normal life when it seems right to them, not to please people given authority either formally or informally. 

For now, there is a pandemic which is clearly a threat that can only be controlled by limiting personal contacts. If people ignore that, the volume of people needing medical care to survive will make medical care scarce and inaccessible for all. 

Trump is acting like a Civil War general sending troops into a frontal assault knowing that many will die but that enough will likely survive to achieve success. Americans are not obedient subjects of anyone."

This is a very difficult time for laid off workers and equally for investors... and we can't really be savers with 0% interest rates, can we?

Everything Trump and Congress have done so far seems to be directed at inflating the stock markets and not directly helping workers or local governments.  Notice also the stock markets rising as things get worse for everyone else.

Then we have daily reports of possible treatments... the latest merely showing a small statistically relevant shortening of disease... driving markets higher and possibly creating false hope for investors and the public.

And we certainly don't have the competent leadership that we need to make sense of it and get past it smoothly and with the least human suffering.  Just the opposite, I am afraid.

Where, exactly, will the demand originate in the U.S. economy if  people have to tighten their belts or simply quit spending because of this disruption? Is the administration going to force people to buy stuff, stuff they simply cannot afford or discovered they never needed in the first place? Even before this crisis, Americans were up to their necks in debt. What now?

Of course, while this contraction is endured by regular folk, Market World (i.e. venture capitalists, private equity, the banks and billionaires) will pay fewer or no taxes and purchase even more of the government."

Republicans have failed us decade after lousy decade."
2020-04-29 18:52,"Layoffs and lack of demand are bad enough.   But there are other salient factors.

40% to 50% of the population live hand-to-mouth in near penury.    They don't have money for rent or a mortgage.   In many cases, the people holding those contracts are investment bankers or hedge funds who loaded up on real estate during the recession of 2008-2009.   They won't have patience.   Landlords need to service their debt.

With Reagan's financialization of the economy, and blithe offshoring of jobs in the name of creative destruction, we now live in a service economy.   The virus stops the flow of these services.   Even if the economy is opened up, demand will be tamped down by wary patrons.

Most of these successful big businesses don't have cash reserves.   They are leveraged to the hilt and run on other people's money.   Hence, even though they show a profit, and pay executives a score of millions per annum, they need a bailout from the government.   Many will not make it through bad times because of excessive debt.

In short, there are too many pitfalls on the road to recovery.

The administration likes to hide bad news behind, ""Fake News"". That won't work anymore, or will it?

With 22 million+ relying on unemployment, the bigger question is what percentage still has some health coverage? 

Economic recovery depends upon people. Healthy people.

The resurgence and resilience of a workforce depends upon the health and well-being of people. That consideration escaped those who battled against the Affordable Care Act. 

Had the Senate taken a peek around the corner and did some basic risk assessment, more could have been done up front to anticipate where we are now. We could have easily had more tests, more ventilators, more resources in place.  

Closing the gap on healthcare will accelerate economic recovery.  When people have the reassurance and confidence that the administration has their well-being covered and secure, they will work toward recovery because they have skin in the game.

But the administration has done just the opposite and used  ""Fake News"" to confuse and disregard the importance of people."

A citizenry fearful of the future and unwilling to spend will mean a much more anemic recovery than will a citizenry eager to get back to normal at the local mall or restaurant.

Next, no investor worthy of being called a serious investor mistakes two to three weeks in the stock market for a long term trend. The plunge in corporate earnings, which will become painfully clear as more quarterly reports are issued,  will turn the stock average sharply downward.

2020-04-29 20:00,"There is really no way to model this.

Let's take health care.  While the coronavirus has driven up utilization of medical wards and ICUs, the overall impact on the entire system (surgery, rehab, workers comp, pediatrics) is a significant drop in utilization and thus provider revenue. 

So we are in a situation where the entire medical economy, despite the virus, may actually see a large reduction.  Health care employment has been one of the biggest factors in GDP growth for decades.  With 22 million likely to lose employer coverage, the covid revenue problem will be doubled or tripled.

Other OECD economies will see revenue reduction from the temporary utilization shift, but because they have universal coverage, but not for people losing coverage.

Health care alone could drag down GDP by 4 or 5 percentage points.  

Will this finally put the nail in the coffin of US profit-driven approach to health care?  I hope so."

It is the worst economy in a century. People lost their jobs and getting hungry. On the other hand, China became a second most powerful economy in the world. Is China deserve to be a powerful economy? China and her communist leaders are the most selfish people on earth. They keep everything secret. Everything under the control of the Chinese Communist Party. It may take another century for America to rebuild and regain her superpower status. This makes me feel depressed. Even this coronavirus pandmic is over it will take a long time to rebuild a strong America. Mr. Ben Casselman is so over optimistic about our future. Hope better than no hope. I will be too old to see that day happen again. But I wanted thank this country to allow me to fulfill my American dream. I will tell me grandchildren they should always appreciate this country's opportunities and democracy. China should not keep this coronavirus lab as a secret. Now it is too late."

And, the Dow ticks back up - because the boys in the Corner Office kept their jobs and full pay/benefits - while their workers filed for unemployment - but couldn't - because the Government Website crashed.

So, with the unemployment website crashed, workers can't pay their rent or buy food, but ... the Dow goes up.

I didn't because I can't continue to work at home.  I don't have the space and it's not comfortable for me.  

But I do know this:  it's not just employees who are not comfortable.  Some employers aren't comfortable with the idea of inviting all their employees back to work without taking significant precautions.  Everyone I've spoken to has been very reluctant to consider going to malls, to concerts, into smaller stores, back to cramped workspaces, and more.  Then there is the small factor that bathrooms aren't always kept clean enough or supplied with enough paper towels.  

All the public spaces we share are a risk to our health.  If ever there was a time to invest in upgrading public and private communal spaces this is it.

The cost for medical care now and in the future is also incomprehensible because people will be living with the damage for decades. 

But to say ""lockdowns or deaths"" is a false dichotomy. There were other choices.

Had the administration responded promptly to warnings in early January, using the pandemic playbook that they threw in the trash as soon as Trump was sworn in, covid-19 could have been contained. We are already seeing that masks and social distancing are reducing the spread significantly..

Instead, warnings were ignored, testing was botched and is still inadequate, N95 masks and PPE were sent from America to China in January, and N95 manufacturing was not ramped up until recently and is still vastly below needs. 

Instead of offering funding in February to Mike Bowen to increase N95 production at his Texas firm Prestige Ameritech, Trump gives his campaign buddy Mr Pillow a no-bid Defense Production Act contract at an exorbitant price.

The wholesale price of N95 masks is less than $1.

We’re way behind on testing, contact tracing, clarity and honesty of information, the spread of rate of the virus and other stats. It’s a floating target what the key symptoms are and we’re about the economy. This could get much worse.

In the times of such unprecedented economic distress and uncertainty about how long it will continue, and whether it will become a cyclic revisit pattern, the most vulnerable are the ones living paycheck to paycheck. May be the question What's next for them has an old answer. Negative taxes.

Milton Friedman is the one who worked much on it, but Republicans of the new genre are not concerned much about it. They cater to super rich, and the markets driven by the rich spills over to benefit the secure middle classes, and this is enough to fetch a reasonable majority for them.

Negative tax would address the needs of those for whom Bernie was most concerned. In the 5G digital economy, it would help cut much of flab in welfare administration, thereby partly pay for the measure. There is perhaps no better way to create market demand for SME sector.

This combined with a commitment to moderate tax policies could help reduce the sugar in the economy and lower  ballooning government deficits. 

Believe such a bottom up approach to fund the economy is inherently less inflationary and is likely to be more efficient in generating long term growth than the top down approach being practiced by the current administration.

Here is a different perspective, I think the Fed pumped two TRILLION dollars into the economy in MARCH.  Still the GDP fell almost 5%.  This quarter will be very bad."

That is what five weeks at home does to someone. It makes you realize how much money you have saved, in current hard times where we need to save, by not buying disposable stuff.

Rather than shopping for yet another blouse or sweater I don't need, I would rather spend that money on a teacher or an assistant that will show me how to produce maximum results from my first real vegetable garden. 

Also, we will try to ensure all of our appliances last longer so I will be on the lookout for some good fit-it men or women to extend the life of what we have.

Social distancing will also be applied to the casino floor resulting once again in fewer patrons and fewer employees. Guests arriving at the resorts will have to submit to a temperature check. Sounds like fun, right? It will be even less fun for the hospitality workers who will scramble for the reduced number of jobs.

Then Wall Street and other exchanges trade the stock for their clients, the original buyers of the stock, betting on the economy and company's growth potential. That is all there is to it.  

the growth we see today is betting on companies who will come out winners from the pandemic supply demand - so pharma, tech, health products, food.  Also companies that have lots of cash on hand, so won't be in debt when economic activity returns to more normal levels, their stocks prices are going up. 

it is all betting on parts of the economy growing even if other parts don't do so well. 

Public companies benefit when their stock prices go up because it increases the equity on the balance sheet which in turn makes the company worth more so it can borrow money to continue to grow, provide value to the C suite and satisfy the egos of traders, CEO and board. The company can also sell the stock it holds to raise more funds. however, that dilutes the value so most companies borrow on value rather than sell off.

stock value can reflect the health of the company assuming traders don't go on emotion but analysis to buy and sell.

These are the same conditions that lead to the global depression in 1929, and we should not be so optimistic/narcissistic as to believe we will be the only ones affected, or that we're going to pull out of this all on our own.

We may be out of the initial phase of the global depression by 2022 as Mr. Glazer hopes, but the economic fallout from this is going to last for years.  I would be surprised if things 'got back to normal' before 2026 -- and when they do, it will be a new 'normal'."

The normal summer jump in consumption just won't happen this year. No outdoors this summer. No throngs of tourists incoming or outgoing. No back to school mania. No big or destination weddings. Oh, and very few sports events.

Considering the fact that it damages the lungs, liver and the heart and more we need to quarantine the old and those with problems with health. All others up to the age of 60 must be put back to work. 

The best vaccine is to let some of the healthy get sick temporarily

But rather than trying to go back to the old consumer-first ways where we  could not plunder the natural resources  and pollute the world's  air, soil and water  fast enough, should  we not take advantage of this crisis to think abut what sort of future we want for ourselves and future generations? A lot of people should have plenty of time to think while confined at home.
We can consider ourselves lucky that Covid is not as lethal as Ebola and also that we got a pandemic instead of some large meteorite impact /nuclear winter. I do not want to minimise the suffering and large number of death, but it is a given that we as countries/economies/ the human race will recover from this pandemic.  But it is not so sure that  we will recover from our own vandalising of natural resources and defacing of our planet and increasing economic inequalities.

God sent Jonah to that ""World City"" Nineveh some 3000 years ago, to warn them if they did not change their corrupt ways, they are on the Path to Destruction. 

The World did not notice the significant Sign when Pope John-Paul I abdicated the Throne and Crown, ending a 1000 year Roman Catholic ritual and tradition.

2020-05-01 0:25,"I can't understand why America thinks it can reopen over the next 2 weeks.   Just Thursday brought over 2200 deaths and 31000 new cases.  If only 2 % of those die, as predictions reckon, that will reap 600 new deaths  to report.  These numbers are not going down; in fact your biggest day, 28000 dead, occurred only 10 days (?) ago.   You're identifying 25000-30000 new infections daily, a count minimized by continued lack of testing and at 2% a conservative 500 of those infections will cause a death.    And all this with a nationwide lockdown in place.
I think its important to note who's pushing to reopen quickly:  Trump and Fox News.
Consider what a second mass quarantine, even just in hot spots like cities, will look like."
2020-05-01 0:34,"Funny, I thought they were out of business years ago.

As Mark Twain remarked about people thinking he had died, “Rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated”."

2020-05-01 0:58,"Considering their sales associates are scarce, when you need help, they shouldn’t have any trouble adhering to social distancing guidelines. 

That being said, one of the last stores I visited, before we were all put on punishment, was Macy’s. I bought a food processor to make homemade hummus, which I have yet to do. Too busy baking cookies. 

Just about all my furniture is from Macy’s, and I find lots of great deals for my college age son.  I am happy for their employees, and hope this is a sign that our economy will be resuscitated. 

We have to find out way back, albeit safely."
2020-05-01 0:58,Mr Applebaum sounds like a great business partner. He is already coming at this from a point of negativity without knowing the facts. No wonder non-unionized Amazon is running circles around them.
2020-05-01 1:01,So soon?
2020-05-01 1:24,Seriously? Macy’s was dying before the virus. Everything has a life and the life of department store like Macy’s are simply over.
2020-05-01 1:41,No thank you.
2020-05-01 1:47,"And... I’ll not be there. 
I am looking forward to not to have to buy a stitch of clothing for the next year at least. Done. Perfect excuse to get out of the wear and throw away ethos. 
For the growing grandkids it is another issue.  Still things an be ordered and returned."
2020-05-01 1:53,"Shopping in stores isn't going to go away entirely.  At some point people will need new clothes and shoes, and most of us need to try things on.  Short term you can order an extra of something you already have but that probably won't meet your needs indefinitely.

But Macy's?  It's a wreck."
2020-05-01 1:56,"My daughter and I were just talking about retail stores today as we drove past a shuttered TJ MAXX. How can you try things on? Will they have staff in masks and gloves handing you things? Will they arrange things in smaller displays so you can see it without touching? What will the return policy be? Will they offer more essentials, like underwear and work boots and more household items? How could you possibly try on clothes then return them to a rack? Will they allow just a few shoppers in at a time? Will there be more emphasis on concierge/personal shopping? 

I fear that in the beginning, people may go just out of curiosity or out of sheer boredom.  Many shop as a distraction. But unless people are buying, the stores, any stores, won’t make it. It’s a sad realization, but these department stores have had lower sales for years before this happened. And now with the unemployment rate, losses in retirement funds and people worried about the economy in general, I just don’t see how it will work."
2020-05-01 1:57,Shopping is supposed to be fun. Nothing about what was described in this article appeals to me. I won’t be risking my health for such an experience. Sorry Macy’s.
2020-05-01 2:29,"In the late 1950s-early 60s my mom took me back to school shopping at Macy's 34th Street.  Macy's has changed a lot...tops on the list of bad management is the sorry state of their try-on rooms...always dusty, stained carpet, dirty walls.  I would not trust Macy's to clean the fitting rooms, much less remember to keep certain clothes off the racks for 24 hours."
2020-05-01 2:16,My wife is waiting for some stores here to open in order to return some things she had bought from them online.
2020-05-01 2:38,"Good luck to Macy’s. It’s an icon, and magical when you go in Xmas in NYC.  The store, it’s displays, the fireworks, the parades add to NYC and American culture. More so than a cardboard Amazon box anyway. 

I’ll go shop there just to support it. If it’s crowded, I’ll just go back some other time to ensure social distancing."
2020-05-01 2:40,"Retail success for the most part is based largely on those ten weeks leading up to Christmas. Movie theaters and restaurants because of weekend business. Airlines? Well they just pack us in like sardines, but how on earth will these businesses survive if they are only doing a fraction of the business but are still paying the same price for rents, wages etc?

Macy’s will be swamped these first couple of weekends not because people have the money to spend, it’s more like people like to people watch. By Memorial weekend many doors will be ordered closed because humans are incapable of this type is social distancing, just like the beaches in California. 

We are going to have to learn to do less and a lot less before this pandemic is over."
2020-05-01 2:59,Hoping that all turns out well for Macy's and its thousands of employees. I was a foreign student in NYC in 1969 when I first encountered Macy's. I have always identified it with good things in America. Good luck.
2020-05-01 3:09,"Shouldn’t Macys be asked to follow re-opening regulations for banks?
After all, everyone knows it’s not a department store; it’s just another bank.
Even Chase has closed 1000 branches."
2020-05-01 3:16,"""Some consumers may find it difficult to imagine shopping at a department store without touching, feeling and trying on everything from apparel to makeup.""

Drop dead Macy's. I know COVID-19 is a concern, but if I can't try on clothes and makeup before I buy it, I'm just not going to buy it. There is no reason to go to your store now now that these experiences will be taken away.

And if any other store's go Macy's route when it comes to things like trying on clothes and makeup, I just won't consume these things as much as I used to if at all. You want a failed department store business? This is how you become a failed department store business. 

Before this whole virus thing, I only went to Macy's for my Shiseido makeup. I'm afraid outside of the Shiseido makeup counter, this millennial customer does not care about Macy's at all. Rest in Peace, Macy's. This will be the final nail in the coffin for that department store."
2020-05-01 3:36,"But the entire staff AND customers are not going to be required to wear masks? Even Costco is now requiring customers to wear masks. No thanks, Macy’s, I won’t be shopping."

This linguistic sloppiness is rivaled only by ""dispel with"" (as in Marco Rubio's repeated utterances during various 2016 speeches and debates of ""Let's dispel with the rumor...""). One either ""dispels"" (no preposition) a rumor or ""dispenses with"" it.  
How does anyone get a law degree or become a CEO without learning basic English?"
2020-05-01 4:11,"I used to love Macy’s, but in recent years the clothing quality has deteriorated while prices are higher than warranted.  If I wanted junk from China, I would go to a discount store.
I do need some housewares I may buy from Macy’s in the next month or so.  I can do that online"
2020-05-01 5:09,"Every single red state on this list has a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. 

I hope the lowest paid workers at these shopping centers can choose to stay home rather than risk their lives, but that’s likely not an option for most. As for these companies providing PPE and expensive disinfecting procedures? I’d bet heavily against it.

Cases will soar over the next two weeks, and the poor will continue to bear the brunt of it, not the republican governors and their families.

I’ll never spend another dime at Macy’s."
2020-05-01 4:35,"Well, no one's going to be holding a gun to my head to force me back into a Macy's. I hope no one is that stupid, including the workers, even as they are placed under duress."
2020-05-01 4:19,I'll just order all my clothes and shoes online.
2020-05-01 5:08,Stopped going to department stores 25 years ago.
2020-05-01 5:37,"IN my opinion, it’s irresponsible for Macy’s to rush to reopen so soon.  By demonstrating what may be inadequate regard for both their employees’, suppliers’, and customers’ welfare, they risk losing me and my extended family as customers, and not just of their brick & mortar stores, but online as well.  

We’ve found that signage reminding people to maintain 6’ distance is needed but nowhere near sufficient to actually keep people apart.  Both physical barriers such as cordons or, if having people wait in line, chairs, and proper spacing of displays etc. are needed, as are handsantizers inside dressing rooms and throughout, and many, many other protective features.  Meanwhile, Macy’s has a history of disregarding the needs and rights of people with disabilities, including health vulnerabilities, and it took a major class action lawsuit before Macy’s saw fit to make changes. In our shopping experience since then, Macy’s has unfortunately reverted to some of the problematic patterns, but with noticeably lower staff levels on the floor and hence fewer people to help make things right even when pointed out."
2020-05-01 7:04,"Article should note that the July 4th Fireworks and the Thanksgiving Day Parade take several months of planning. The union and several socialists on the NYC council tweeted out some nasty comments - very Trumpian conduct. But if Macy's doesn't do the work now, neither event will occur if the public health situation permits. Most fireworks are shipped from China and assembling barges with the custom displays can take over a month.

The comments by Stuart Appelbaum and the union also aren't occurring in a vacuum. They're currently engaged in contract negotiations with Macy's. The union is just being obtuse. Macy's needs the publicity from the fireworks and parade to drive sales. And they need sales in order to avoid bankruptcy. Macy's is one of the few large retailers with a union workforce. The union should constructively engage management on safe re-opening. I don't understand why the union is badmouthing and seeking to destroy Macy's. Do they want to work instead at non-union Amazon, Walmart, Target, etc.?"
2020-05-01 8:45,As a physician I would advise Macys to cancel the parade and fireworks.  They need to conserve money and both will lead to crowds.  There is simply no upside and only downside virus risk.  The thought that it would be a psychic lift makes no sense until we have a vaccine.  Macys needs to consider its real threat.....Amazon.  Encouraging laws that enable Unions would be a very wise strategy.  Unionizing Amazon can level the playing field to a degree.  Just as initially Amazon built its business on being tax free Amazon is maintaining its business by being Union free with casual employees.  The only way retailers in the US have any chance of survival is to kill that business model.  Unions and full time work with benefits for all the workers would even the field for Amazon.  As long as we have a gig economy I would advise speculators to buy more Amazon stock and unload every other retailer.  My sense is a Biden presidency is being favored by big finance.   Trump has no policy and is twisting in the wind....   So stock up on Amazon stock.
2020-05-01 9:55,"I loved Macy's and even worked contingent back when it was Hudson's. I have so many great memories from the time I was a pre-teen, caught up in all the glamour of the brightly-lit make-up counters and jewelry; to when I was in my late teens and aspired the lifestyle the sophisticated clothing suggested; memories of eating in Hudson's restaurant with my grandmother and great-grandmother, and later with my girlfriends while on shopping sprees. They used to have such classy stuff, and money really flowed in Detroit in the '80s.  Macy's was a pleasure.

But times have changed. I'm pushing fifty, more globally aware, and much more environmentally concerned and less aspirational than I used to be. I have enough clothes to last for the next two decades. I've come to be a little ashamed of all the shoes I own.  Coats, so many coats and jackets.  Who needs more jewelry?  I periodically need new socks and underwear -- they're the only thing I wear into holes.  I. Don't. Need. More.

This pandemic is a hard, loud wake-up call. It's time, for me anyway, to ignore the siren call of consumption. I'm eating less, I'm buying less, I don't drive. Aside from my serious concerns for others' well-being, I don't mind the solitude, the quietude, and the slower pace of life that I've been forced into. I'm a little thankful, when I'm looking for a silver lining. By the time we get beyond this into a new reality, I will have recalibrated my habits, wants, and ""needs."" No more shiny distractions."
2020-05-01 10:36,"Pandemic or no pandemic, the department store no longer makes sense as a retail model. It turns out that the essential tools for successful navigation of a global health crisis range from mobile phones and laptops to toilet paper, hand sanitizer, affordable food, soap, running water, and cloth masks. Unless Macy’s is selling any of those items, boldly and safely reopening its fleet of stores is unlikely to dramatically change or improve an economy that already feels incapable of simply snapping back to a now woefully outdated version of itself."
2020-05-01 10:20,"Long a shadow of its former self, Macy's is, at best, ho-hum mediocrity forced to change, keep up and continuously innovate
simultaneously.  As did Sears, JCP and countless more.
Good luck with that."
2020-05-01 6:19,"If I did from this, it certainly won't be because I caught it at a retail store or mall. I hated them B.C. and I certainly have no plans to go A.C."
2020-05-01 5:50,I love going to the mall and always check out Macy's when I do. I can't wait to be able to go and do a bit of shopping and enjoy all a typical mall has to offer. There is nothing better then mingling with other human beings and getting a bite to eat at the food court. People should stop being so scared. Life if too short so enjoy it. If you happen to get corona you will most probably survive it. Most people have already had it but don't even know.
2020-05-01 11:59,"They can open (the stores) but it doesn't mean that I have to go.

2020-05-01 12:29,"Macy’s will not survive this long shutdown and the reluctance of many shoppers to return to the Malls and even Herald Square.
The reality is that the Macy’s business model isn’t valid anymore. They have way too many underperforming branches.
Also their product assortment is so much Private Label and the incentive to buy is driven by deep discounts."
2020-05-01 13:16,"The quality of Macy's merchandise has been mediocre to poor for many years, especially women's clothing. Therefore, their re-opening plan holds no interest for me. In addition, not being able to touch or try on clothing in the store, which does make sense because of the virus, begs the question of why we need these brick and mortar stores now or ever. Our world is going to be changing around all of us and at breath taking speed. My prediction is a world where there will be more white collar working from home, entertainment streaming, online shopping and online education. We have the technology to do this. As a senior, I am glad that I  will likely not experience the downsides of a world without a sense of community."
2020-05-01 13:46,"Regarding the fireworks, we saw how people didn't socially gather during the flyover earlier this week and there's no reason to expect anything different during Macy's fireworks show.  And as far as their national televised broadcast, NBC could take highlights from previous years and have a great broadcast without a new display.  That would be the safer and wiser alternative."

2020-05-01 14:53,"Reading through the negative comments about department stores makes me think of Mark Twain's quote - ""The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.""

Remember when no one would give 10 cents to live in any downtown in America?  Wow, definitely not true today.

Regulators will get around to regulating online shopping and thus remove its inherent advantage over brick-and-mortar stores.

People will get tired of spending so much time not being with other people.

I just all this happens in time for Macy's, JCP, Sears, etc... Ditto for movie theaters.  Otherwise, they will have to be 'reinvented' when that time comes.  Hey, just like we are doing across the USA with streetcars."
2020-05-01 13:47,"So, Macy's will be ignoring any governor's orders preventing their stores from opening? Is this corporate civil disobedience?"

2020-05-01 16:38,"Cooperation from the public will be key and is certainly not guaranteed. A whole segment of the population, including some in the administration, seem to have taken that attitude of ""ok, we're done with this, so let's just open up and move on. We need to get back to normal"" as if we can just return to the way things were before (and as if the virus will be done with us because we've had enough of it).  Maybe folks will behave better than I expect (I will not be shopping any time soon), but I'm not holding my breath."
2020-05-01 20:28,I love going to Macys.  I can't  wait for it to open I hope their furniture store in North Brunswick  New Jersey opens soon  I purchase a sofa and paid for it. The sofa went on sale two times since the store been close. I would like to get the chair or the love seat now. I can afford the other pieces now  I really hope they open soon I just can not imagine  New York without Macys.  I always love shopping there at Christmas time. It completed Christmas for me
2020-05-01 20:36,"I only know Macy's at Herald Square cant comment about the other stores.   I have confidence that the sales representatives will be in protective garments, including masks and gloves because we are talking Macy' not Target or the warehouses that support Amazon. 
This pandemic has been a life changing experience for everyone and I believe that people when shopping will conduct themselves in a  dignified and professional manner.  Following the guidelines of the CDC.  the store is big enough to ensure 6 ft apart in standing on line to pay ..
I believe everyone knows now how be safe and conduct themselves not like the people in Michigan but as tough New Yorkers  the words that Governor Cuomo repeats every day during his daily news update.
Enough New Yorkers live in the city who can walk down to Macy's get some fresh air and get off of  Amazon who doesnt care about their employees.  The employees are still waiting for their protective gear. 
 Amazon in France still has not reopened because the government in France states that their  employees are not safe.  Wouldn't that be nice if Jeff Bezo's thought enough about American employees to make sure everyone is safe."

To those of you working remotely; you work remotely.  You work.  Let's hear your tune when you've been fired with no prospect of employment for months while the bills pile up and then tell us to wait until the virus is extinguished.

2020-04-28 16:46,"For Republicans it seems all things are personal. There are no systemic problems, only individuals failing to be responsible or gaming the system. Naturally then, the first thing Republicans want to do is strip businesses of any personal responsibility by eliminating the normal deterrent to bad behavior, the ability to sue, in order to encourage them to open up. Also, let’s give them a lot of taxpayer money. This is the kind of rugged capitalism we like. Workers and customers however need to take personal responsibility."

You don't want to discourage people from visiting the doctor, but at the same time medical professionals are already taking on great risks by treating patients in this pandemic and deserve not to be forced into financial ruin.  I doubt malpractice insurance will cover exposure in medical waiting rooms, etc.  

I am concerned about schools and colleges as well.  While young people do not seem to suffer, what about teachers and support staff who may be older and have underlying conditions?  At the same time, keeping kids home in the Fall semester seems like it would have enormous financial repercussions as parents are forced to stay home with them.   Colleges are already in financial trouble after having to cancel classes this Spring, and the potential liability has got to be a big consideration about reopening in the Fall.

2020-04-28 18:33,"As far as employees that contract the virus at work, they should be covered by workers compensation laws which already prevent workers from suing their employers for injuries or illnesses contracted at work. As for people who contract a virus by coming into a business, it seems to me that this would be a duty argument. I have not heard of a mass of influenza law suits and I am just not sure that there exists a duty to protect people from naturally occurring viruses. I guess if a business did something to make the virus worse than had it done nothing at all it could be held liable, but otherwise, I think there is an assumption of the risk that you could contract the virus every time you go out. Thus, I am not sure there is any need for any governmental intervention to protect from liability at least for non-health related industries."

So this blatant disregard of protocols instituted for both patient and employee safety would be exempt for legal liability?  Any incentive to protect third parties would vanish if such shields were put in place.  Gun manufacturers were protected from third party liability.  How did that work out?"
2020-04-28 19:11,"Businesses bear the burden of proof here. Take as an example the outbreaks that have swept through food processing plants. In some cases literally hundreds of employees have been infected at work. Clearly, some major employers have continued operations with a casual disregard for their employees' safety. They don't deserve a get out of jail free card for doing little or nothing to protect people. 

I think the liability fears are overblown. I live in Minnesota where winters are long and ice and snow are on the ground for months on end. You would think the courts would be swamped with slip and fall lawsuits. They are not. 

Businesses have to clear their sidewalk and parking lots but everyone acknowledges its winter and nothing will be snow and ice free. Any plaintiff bringing a slip and fall suit in January has a very high bar to clear. The pandemic is an analogous situation. Everyone knows the virus is present and there is no perfect protection from it. Businesses that take reasonable precautions should have nothing to be afraid of."
2020-04-28 19:21,"I'm not a lawyer, so perhaps one can comment here.  

The concluding paragraphs of this article seem to be misleading.  They state ""Under current law plaintiffs have to prove the target was negligent,” and proof of causation “is going to be daunting if not impossible,” he said, adding: “You never say ‘never’ in the world of liability, but the idea this is a looming tidal wave of lawsuits that are going to succeed seems to me overstated.”

The term ""proof"" in these paragraphs is, I think, very misleading to most readers.  When most people read this word they think of the legal standard used in criminal cases, in which proof means ""beyond a reasonable doubt.""

But this is NOT the standard in civil cases, which is what this article is about.  The standard of proof is most civil cases is ""preponderance of the evidence.""  A plaintiff needs only to convince a jury that 50.1% of the evidence (or more) favors the plaintiff to win enormous damages.  And, in practice, that is not a high bar.

Which is why we need tort reform."

 If 20% or more of employees commute by mass transit, each member of senior management shall also travel the average commuting distance, twice each day, on mass transit, until such time as a vaccine is made available; and

Government wants to reopen and get people off unemployment, thereby making people go back to work in potentially unsafe conditions and when they get sick they have no recourse against their employer, nothing about that is right.  Also, this would be businesses saying to customers come shop and eat here but don't blame us if you get sick.  Operating a business comes with risks and rewards but those rewards do not come without responsibility.   If businesses have no accountability then what would make the public believe they have customers best interest in mind and are taking precautions and following CDC guidelines, nothing would indicate that so why would an intelligent person patronage such businesses."
2020-04-28 19:26,"at the end of the day, the litigators will probably pick up some more legal work as there is not clean, 100% proof way of either legislating this or addressing it in the courts.   Because Covid is almost invisible, if a customer or employee of a buisness gets sick, how do they prove it came from that business, and not from their interaction outside of the business?  It's not like a car accident,  customer slipping on the floor of the business, etc.   The best we can do is a little bit in all areas----some legislation that balances worker/consumer rights vs businesses ability to operate;  agencies like OSHA providing guidelines;  business industry groups coming up w standards;  insurance companies looking at new policies to cover certain activities;  and the courts getting their footing on the litmus test for what constitutes negligence, etc.   Coming out of Covid and settling into a new normal is going to take quarters if not years."

2020-04-28 19:38,"There is one aspect of liability which this article doesn't cover, and which is perhaps most important of all.  This is the need to provide legal protection for pharmaceutical companies.

There is only one way this pandemic will come to a graceful end, and that is through the development of effective treatments or vaccines. Such scientific breakthroughs are possible but difficult, and will require synergistic work by government agencies including the NIH and FDA, academia, and drug companies. Only pharmaceutical companies have the resources necessary to develop, test, and manufacture drugs and/or vaccines in the quantities necessary.

Prior to the pandemic, multiple drug companies have been driven to near the point of bankruptcy by lawyers. Many of the verdicts have been for literally billions of dollars. Most verdicts seem unjust, and to be based on junk science, sympathetic plaintiffs, and the manipulation of juror's emotions by well practiced lawyers. Many verdicts do favor the companies, but a few do not. It only takes a few billion dollar verdicts to bankrupt even a large company, and tens of thousands of suits are pending.

During the 1970's and 1980's trial lawyers nearly ended the availability of vaccines in the US. Only an 11th hour no-fault liability law (the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act allowed vaccine manufacturing to continue in the US.

One option to consider is replacing the financial liability which capitalists fear with clear criminal penalties if a person is sickened or killed as the anti-capitalists may be imagining. For example, if one person is sickened, society would apply the death penalty to the biggest stock-owner, while if the company causes one death, the top ten stock-owners would get the death penalty.
If that is insufficient to protect everyone, we could extend the death penalty to all the top executives. We will need scientists to watch the statistics closely to see if any business is a hot spot.
Some might find this alternative insufficient to protect society. If this proves inadequate, in addition to the criminal penalties, we would then reapply the money damages retroactively in every case.
Since we all want to prevent any avoidable infection, sickness or death, let us endorse this compromise. But, let's not demonize all capitalists, although some just might be imperfect."

If the state and federal governments set reasonable standards for employers to follow, based on the best scientific and medical knowledge, then businesses that comply with those rules could have a safe harbor for protection against liability.  A problem here is that (1)OSHA, USDA and other agencies have failed to establish or enforce appropriate standards, and (2) too many employers have failed to take reasonable precautions in the absence of such regulations.  If the best scientific and medical knowledge were to dictate what those standards should be (rather than the dictates of powerful interests), we could establish appropriate standards that reasonably protect all of us – business owners, employees and customers."

After a while noticing that he is dry in spite of the downpour, he throws away the umbrella because of “hey I am dry I don’t need the Umbrella anymore.  Got it?"
2020-04-28 16:58,"Protections are needed, but a blanket shield from liability will surely promote risky behaviors. 

They need to clearly define a standard for businesses then protect the businesses that meet that min standard from liability.  If they are sued, and the victim can show they did not adhere to minimum standards then they should be held liable."
2020-04-28 16:44,"We are a small physician office. 
We want to open to serve our patients.

On the other hand, we are concerned about liability if an employee ( e.g. medical assistant) gets COVID. What if her mom gets COVID and and has a poor outcome?  What is the risk of getting sued? 

Need a clear protection from liability, before we can serve our patients, in the office ( this is what I want to medical school for) 

An executive order with clear protection from the Governor would be helpful."
2020-04-28 19:05,"If the businesses get to keep all their profits, why should their risk be on us? There should be no liability protections for businesses. If they’re not confident they can conduct business profitably without infecting customers or employees, they should not re-open. If they gamble on re-opening despite the risks, it’s on them."

2020-04-29 0:30,"They’d better not try to take away my right to hold a business liable for negligence, nor restrict product manufacturing regulations, etc. What is going on? This seems to be turning into a giant, chaotic free-for-all, from previously unimaginable sums of money slipping through the government’s fingers to failing to protect us from the virus at a basic public health level, to destruction of protective regulations, to a president actually inciting Americans to riot against public health policies and inject household disinfectant and take unproven and untested pharmaceuticals...something is really wrong here. With us, that we aren’t working to invoke the 25th. I had hoped the virus would remove Trump and Pence so we could have Pelosi at the wheel, but so far no luck."
2020-04-29 0:34,"NO!

2020-04-29 0:59,"Business should for sure provide employees with the kind of healthcare that doesn’t discourage them from seeking treatment; paid sick leave; masks and sanitized workplaces.

But even in the somewhat unlikely scenario that the business dies all this, there is STILL no guarantee that it will not become a virus hotspot.

We as a country have to fix the healthcare and sick leave issues that are an underlying cause of disease spread. But we also have to accept the capricious nature of this silent virus. If a business has actually done what it can to protect customers and employees, then there should be no lawsuits."
2020-04-29 1:06,"I've been wondering when politicians and business owners would realize that they need to start figuring out how to deal with these issues before they rush to ""reopen.""

What happens if the governor of my state ""reopens"" the state, and my employer calls us back into work.  But let's say that my elderly mother lives with me, or that my husband is immuno-suppressed, and I don't want to risk their lives by bringing home the virus.  Can my boss demand that I return to work, and then fire my?  Do I then lose eligibility for unemployment insurance?

Shielding businesses while nickle-and-diming workers is wrong!

At times like this, I wish that were were more like Norway."

1.  Big businesses got the loans while small businesses dangle. 
2.  Big businesses want to re-open so they get back to what's most important - making money!  They must justify those loans.
3.  Big businesses love our current president.  They fund his re-election, and he doles out all the goodies to them.
4.  Big businesses have deep pockets for lawyers.  So why are they worried about liability issues?"
2020-04-29 1:29,"Since Trump has mandated that meat processing facilities can reopen without liability, does that mean that the Federal Government will assume liabilities that should have been the responsibility of Tyson, Smithfield and others?  Or does it mean that poor workers, often with inadequate protective gear, insurance etc., will lose their ability to receive compensation if they are hurt by dangerous working conditions."
2020-04-29 1:33,"They should be held liable for outbreaks, if prevention measures are not adhered to- and given the legal tools to enforce customers social distancing and masking.  And if necessary, assistance to hire bouncers to help enforce."
2020-04-29 1:42,"Everyone needs to get to work.  Can't we all just get along?  If businesses have to provide extra safety measures, they probably get to deduct it as a cost of business, and if employees need to buy extra safety equipment, they should be allowed to deduct it too without a threshold and maybe the businesses can chip in and offer a fed backed before tax deduction for COVID-19 prevention.  But there also needs to be frequent compliance inspections of workplaces and various government agencies will have to shoulder that for the well being of the tax base."
2020-04-29 1:47,This reminds me of the solar tax credits President Carter brought into existence. They were eventually rescinded because big businesses abused the program. I guess one could glean is greed is still rampant.
2020-04-29 1:51,"It is amazing to see this discussion happening now. The issues being discussed should have been addressed and codified years ago. In virtually every aspect of this pandemic, the administration has been totally unprepared. We appear to be coping and learning on the fly. Meanwhile, the death toll continues to climb with nothing but happy talk and empty promises coming from Trump and crew. 

This really must be an eye-opening revelation to our adversaries world wide. We are now the emperor with no clothes on."
2020-04-29 1:54,The party of responsibility strikes again:  The buck stops somewhere else.  If businesses endanger the lives of their employees and customers they should pay the consequences.  No one should be allowed to make profits by destroying other people's health and then just walk away.
2020-04-29 2:00,"The first case which will reveal how far the Trump administration will go to provide liability protection to its corporate overlords is the meatpacking industry.

They are already having major outbreaks of COVID-19 in many plants.  So what is being done to assure worker safety?   CDC has provided SUGGESTED improvements to safety, which are not mandates, and which can be ignored or minimally complied with - at the operator's discretion.

On top of that, Trump has directed that the plants that have closed be reopened under the defense production act.  This will also provide liability protection to the operators so that the employees who get sick or die will have no legal recourse!"

2020-04-29 2:03,"I cannot imagine Speaker Pelosi ever signing off on such a travesty. The only leverage that non-union workers have is the threat of lawsuits and compensatory damages. 

Union-represented employees, however,  have much more leverage through their collective bargain agreement (CBA) and the  National Labor Relations Act. 

As a retired NLRB field attorney (1995-2010), I would argue that these employers, who  force its Union employees back to work at a workplace with unsafe and unhealthy working conditions, would have an obligation to bargain with the Union over this unilateral change to the CBA . 

Failure to do so will leave the the employer subject to  an Unfair Labor Practice charge and a subsequent investigation that might result in the issuance of a Complaint and Notice of hearing."
2020-04-29 2:24,"This type of discussion would be disgusting enough (in terms of not letting employees sue employers for not taking protective measure, including ""tiny thing"" like a mask! ) in a country where healthcare was accessible and a right covered through single payer systems. But when the employee or customer bears all the risk of financial ruin as well as death - let's be clear - this is potentially death and not one employer knows who will die, it becomes criminal."
2020-04-29 2:33,"Of course, the logical outcome of businesses putting employees at unnecessary risk, just to save a buck, is that folks will simply go postal. Tragic and inevitable."

2020-04-29 2:46,"I don't really understand the opposition to this.

The threat of getting caught in an endless litigation would have a chilling affect on opening.  A better approach would be to have guidelines for operating and full transparency and public awareness raising as to what the standards are.  Consumers could then enforce those practices by choosing which businesses to engage with  based on perceived safety.  Endless rounds of legal filings would support the litigators but is a poor way to secure better health outcomes. By the way, I am generally a left leaning lawyer..."

As a medical provider I'm of course liable for harm that comes to folks from my advise, procedures or therapy.
Should businesses be liable, of course. However they can avoid this liability by getting a stamp of approval to open from someone with expertise, i.e. medical professionals."
2020-04-29 4:06,"Blanket immunity won’t help those looking to reopen. 

Employees will seek safer lines of work if employers cannot be sued no matter how irresponsible they might be. Why would anyone work in a meat plant that is already risky? Blanket immunity would only disincentive employers from taking any further safety actions. 

And customers will be even less enthusiastic about visiting such establishments. 

You say I’m at my own risk? Fine, I’ll stay home and shop online and order takeout, thank you. 

The smart businesses will WANT to promise safety and not try to avoid liability. They will mandate masks (see Jet Blue) and go above and beyond their competitors. 

Anyone advocating blanket immunity is shooting the recovery effort in the foot."
2020-04-29 4:13,"Republicans can’t have it both ways. They demand a private healthcare system where many workers are on the hook for costs and then want to allow impunity for businesses. Perhaps there is a compromise to be had where a limit is placed on damages beyond immediate healthcare costs. However, we cannot just waive responsibility for businesses, especially large corporations. Then what incentive do they have to offer any protection for their employees."
2020-04-29 4:17,Of course “due diligence” is necessary for every business. But the pragmatic problem of causality with viral infections is insoluble. How can anyone prove where and when they were infected? Circumstantial correlation is not causality. The problem is compounded by the fact that asymptomatic individuals may be infectious. How can a business reasonably be expected to know which of its customers or staff are “silent spreaders”? I can’t see such suits getting any traction in court.
2020-04-29 4:24,"I am listening, on CSpan and NPR, to governors, state CDC chiefs, Chamber of Commerce officials, Small Business Administration officials, and all sorts of small business owners and workers. All of them are frustrated by the lack of clarity - primarily from the Trump administration. 

The enormities of understanding the science and situation, and translating it into policy and legislation pronto is hard enough. (Especially with Republicans ideologically opposed to 'government providing for the general welfare of the people' and fighting tooth and nail to preserve their business as usual system of political patronage.)

But in an administration where what Trump says goes, and Trump says contradictory things, while knowing nothing, and not really caring about anything but public relations - yeah, every one gets hung out to dry and twisting in the wind. 

The Art of the Deal was ghostwritten to make Trump look successful. The Apprentice was edited to make Trump look masterful. Now it's clear in excruciating real timebdetail how Trump went bankrupt 6 times."
2020-04-29 4:33,Sorry but you can't have it both ways. You can't push people back into the world because you want our money and then expect exemption if someone gets the virus. If companies want to put profits before people they need to do that at their own risk. Congress better not approve this.
2020-04-29 5:16,"Multiple states have granted legal immunity to healthcare providers and facilities so it was only a matter of time before other businesses demanded the same.  I don't think anyone should be granted immunity, instead let the courts sort out what is and is not bad behavior.  Malpractice and business insurances exist for a reason."
2020-04-29 5:17,"Under state workers' compensation laws, yes, employers will be liable for such an injury arising out of and in the course of employment.  The burden of proof will be on the employee to show that the infection occurred at work."

2020-04-29 5:28,"Ah, the New Normal.

I suppose you'll have to sign an assumption of risk waiver before entering a store now.

Discontinue funding for The CARES Act. let State unemployment programs run out of money, and finally, most likely, once States have ""reopened"", discontinue any legal claims for unemployment due to the pandemic.  The icing on the cake is limiting employer liability.

Americans will be forced to go back to work, and keep the infection rate at high levels.  Wonderful."
2020-04-29 5:11,"No, NO, NO and NO! If these businesses are dumb enough to open up because Trump wants them too, because the Tea Party and the conspiracy theorists want him to push opening, they should be subject to lawsuits if they do not enforce social distancing and use of masks"
2020-04-29 6:09,"Don't worry, Market World (the banks, the corporations, private equity,  etc.) owns the government, therefore, businesses have nothing to worry about. They will be shielded faster than a New York Second and the workers will be left to winds."
2020-04-29 6:22,"The CDC issued instructions for the meat plant in South Dakota. But all the instructions were followed by terms like ""if feasable"" In other words, it's up to the plant. Even for something as simple as masks.
   trump is using his powers to open up the meat plants. The plants will use that order to shield them from lawsuits. Employee's who refuse to work will not be eligible for unemployment benefits.
   In other words, the workers will have to risk their lives no matter how weak the safety standards are. Trump has made the choice that these workers will have to risk their lives so he can be re-elected. Fox news calls for people to open up, ignore the risks while many of their own workers are working from home, not risking their lives.  None of them will spend 8 hours  with hundreds of other people in close quarters, some less then 3 feet away. Fox pundits or Trump will never take the risks that they are calling on the rest of us to take."

2020-04-29 8:58,"It would be much more palatable if Mitch and his mean-spirited cohorts had not spent the last 3 years routing the ACA, which at least provided a minimum of health care.

Even as a stockholding, fiscal conservative, I find that hard to take."
2020-04-29 8:59,"If businesses are excused from the responsibility to ensure safe conditions for workers and consumers, and workers are forced to return to unsafe conditions to feed their families, then we effectively refute all of the principles of the Enlightenment, upon which the USA was originally founded.

2020-04-29 9:20,"This is a corporate ploy to re-start their businesses, without taking safety precautions or protecting their workers from Covid-19, and without accepting financial responsibility for the illness and death their negligence will cause.  

They take their cue from Trump, who says he's not responsible for the rise in U.S. Covid-19 due to his 6 weeks of inaction from February to mid-March. He also takes no responsibility for those that ingested dangerous chemicals, at his suggestion, to kill Covid-19. 

These corporations want to be able to offer death or firing to employees, with no consequence to them. 

Employees, especially low-paid service and meat plant workers, are trapped.  Right now, if their employer calls them back to work and they refuse for fear of catching the virus,  they're fired and cannot receive unemployment benefits.  

Employers at meat packing plants now do not protect workers, have social distancing or plastic guards  between worker stations. These plants are coronavirus hotspots, are a source of contagion, and they want to be exempt from lawsuits arising from not protecting workers. 

No!  It is their obligation, by law, to protect workers.  Congress, by horsetrading over worker lives, treats them as sub-human."
2020-04-29 9:43,"If the government and entrepreneurial classes cannot manage against the virus with testing, a vaccine etc , well then simply put the onus on the folks who work. This demonstrates the intersection of Republicanism with big and small businesses (be they right or left leaning owners). When it comes to money (taxes) and moral hazard (social responsibility) the capital class sells out to its worst instincts and leaves employees with the deficits of shoddy, spotty health care, no sick pay, expensive education and with this no means of redress."
2020-04-29 9:57,"We have a collective challenge.  Of course workers need to be in an environment that is safe as possible.  Of course, there is no way for an employer to regulate every worker's comportment, hand washing, and external contacts.  Of course workers need paychecks.  Of course businesses need to operate effectively to serve customers to receive income to pay workers.  There are reasonable environmental safety measures to expect and reasonable expectations for employee comportment, but fault finding and liability claiming  are the last thing we need in a collective emergency.   It's sad to watch our politics of finger pointing and greed."

Just as I thought it unprovable to say that voters got the virus in Wisconsin recent specifically while voting, I don't think that we can say that some who was a customer at a business contracted the virus there. 

I support workers' rights, therefore think that they should be able to sue. That said, it does seem to me that companies should have at least some protection from folks simply seeking to blame someone for a virus which is ubiquitous in the society.  It does also seem that workplaces, in order to protect some workers, will need some way to determine who is fit to work (though temp taking and symptom checking is of limited value because asymptomatic ""carriers"" can spread the virus, but have no sign that they have it)."
2020-04-29 10:32,"We are not living during a bad outbreak of the flu. This is a new strain of a virus we were blind-sided with. Covid-19  still holds many unanswered questions and information we are receiving is wide opened to subjectivity.

 Liability goes both ways. 

I care about the performance of the company I work for and always strive to give my best for their win is my win. An open invitation by trump and company for an employer mandating a return to work is a liability to me and my family's life. 

How about this; I will return to work if my employer can assure me that all  proper protection protocols are in place and  compliance of  every single employee is strongly enforced."
2020-04-29 10:34,"If companies fail to meet OSHA and state PPE requirements and an employee gets sick, the company must be held legally liable. Customers choose the businesses they patronize so I would not hold companies responsible for the customers infection unless the company fails to provide proper PPE to the employees. 

As for people in general if you have symptoms and/or tested positive and are out running around without PPE and contact tracers track infections back to you, you need to be held legally liable. 

Pretty much this needs to be treated like a very dangerous chemical in the workplace. Prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you protected humans to the best level of technology or you pay dearly. 

Actions and choices all have consequences. If you don't like the consequences do take the action or make that choice.

Privacy is a luxury. If a worker is sick every employee needs to know. If the sick employee is in contact with human beings, the humans have the right to know; needs of the many trump the right to privacy.

Discrimination: since antibody tests are not accurate enough to be believed AND there is no factual evidence that people have immunity employers will need to be careful. The old discrimination law are in effect, not that they are enforced."

The virus itself is the third party here.  It makes its way through simple breathing, DIY face masks and fecal matter in shared restrooms. 

We need science based laws and protections for individuals and businesses alike, recognizing that we can achieve tremendous risk reduction but not total risk elimination. 

There’s a big difference between shoulder to shoulder meatpacking plants and small businesses who want to do the right thing and re-open as safely as possible without fear of liability.

I am hoping that the organizations who spread disinformation and helped this administration effect the needless deaths of thousands of Americans will be held accountable."
2020-04-29 10:24,"This approach is so Republican; privatize the profits while you socialize the expense.   The move to shield businesses of liabilities related to knowingly spreading a fatal disease, coupled with the declaration that meat packing businesses are critical, is a cynical statement to all those blue collar Trump voters; your turn to be the president's 5th avenue murder victim.  
It is my sincere hope that this president gets back on the campaign trail as soon as possible. Then, he can explain, in exceedingly close proximity to his adoring crowds, why the fact that he is a cynical, incompetent, deeply disturbed, mentally and emotionally crippled poor excuse of a human being should be over looked in the next election."
2020-04-29 12:25,"I wonder what percentage of these businesses provide ALL of their employees with health insurance, adequate paid sick time, short-term disability and a living wage regardless of full-time or part-time status, and while they're at, put some safety nets in place to assure businesses can't resort to ""contract employees"" in order to avoid those basic and vital necessities. Consumers, too, should not underestimate the influence of their buying decisions. Consumers can offer a unified show of support for ""essential workers"", many of whom will be the victims of McConnell, et al , if these ""protections"" come to pass."
2020-04-29 12:55,"After a career of supervising Workers’ Compensation claims for a major reinsurer, there is no doubt in my opinion that the plaintiff’s bar is salivating over this opportunity to do what it incessantly wants to do: circumvent the exclusive remedy of statutory Workers’ Compensation and directly sue employers for damages. That said, even with statutory Workers’ Compensation, there would potentially be TWO claims: first for indemnity and medical benefits for a work related disability claim for the work related virus, and the other for possible lifetime death benefits to the survivors (depending on state statutes) should the disabled employee die from the virus. All presumptions favor the  disabled employee in statutory Worker’s Compensation claims."
2020-04-29 12:26,"Could you people get out of your own way? 

I know people who are so paranoid about this virus that they won’t enter a restaurant no matter how safe it is. Their choice.

We are watching the collapse of our economy."
2020-04-29 12:44,"If McConnell is for it, I'm against it. What are we talking about here?"
2020-04-29 13:21,"I don’t agree with this rush to open businesses at the risk of people’s lives. 

But if one is REALLY looking at the economic impact, the longer this virus sticks around, the more it will hurt the economy and the more people will die. 

The pragmatic part of me says if someone is so stupid that they want their nails done when almost 60,000 people have died, let them do it. But make them quarantine for 2 weeks in a “shopper’s zone” so they can’t spread the virus. And to enter the “shopper zone”, one would have to sign a waiver preventing them from taking legal action. We should each take responsibility for our own decisions.  This sounds ridiculous. 

But so does putting economic concerns ahead of human lives.  We don’t need all the material things that modern capitalism tells us we can’t live without. But we have less chance of living by prioritizing economic over science. This is a monumental time in human history, and requires monumental response if our species wants to survive."
2020-04-29 13:31,"Please Congress, prevent this entire episode from becoming a bonanza for lawyers. Contracts, real estate, torts, and who knows what else will create an infinite amount of litigation.
A fair, efficient, and cost effective dispute resolution system must be established external to the current system of litigation which is run by the lawyers, for the lawyers.

Of course, our method of resolving disputes within the legal system must be changed in toto--but for now stop this national tragedy from becoming a gold mine for lawyers
and stirring up even more adversarial contentions. 

Prepare to strictly prevent barratry--and anything approaching this practice."
2020-04-29 13:33,"This issue reveals some important aspects of our economic system. Remember the big deal about Obama saying that you didn’t build it your workers did. Now businesses want to open but they have this problem about having to reasonably protect their workers. Our system provides no health care access or very expensive health care for many of these workers. Employers are lobbying to lower their liability which means they do not have to worry much about protecting the health of their workers. Workers are disposable to them and with millions out of work and desperate to earn money to put food on the table, pay rent and services and cover health issues if family members they are going to have to expose themselves. I hope unions put their guard up and people start demanding what is necessary really for a business to operate which is to be sure the workers have the same quality of life provisions as the owners and investors. What does it really take to run a business if your workers can not be considered disposable?"
2020-04-29 13:26,"McConnell wants to immunize companies from liability when they make their workers go back to work, and those workers inevitably get sick or die.

A journalist asked  Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds whether or not employees could refuse to go back to work out of fear of contracting Covid-19, said no. “If you're an employer and you offer to bring your employee back to work and they decide not to, that's a voluntary quit,"" she said. ""Therefore, they would not be eligible for the unemployment money."" Same for Republican Governor Greg Abbott who called for retail establishments to reopen. To collect unemployment benefits in Texas, a worker must be “willing and able to work all the days and hours required for the type of work you are seeking.”

To save lives, the Democrats should absolutely refuse to entertain even the idea of a broad liability shield.  It's abundantly clear that Trump and many Republicans are willing to try to re-open the economy on the backs of thousands and thousands of dead Americans."
2020-04-29 14:15,"Businesses need to be shielded from accusations of liability from Covid. The best way to do this is to make it optional for workers to return. Those who refuse have made a personal choice so give them a good reference and start doing business for the overall good of our economy! Put out bleach and water spray bottles, have them wear masks, and require they wash hands every hour. Remind them that tossing garbage and leaving our wrappers spew virus! Put these requirements in writing and have them sign a waiver. Businesses need to put it on the worker to make an individual choice. Post the dangers, put in mitigations and make it their choice. If they choose not  to come do not dismiss them but give them time when virus is declared controlled and if they still choose not to come then terminate them with a good reference. Workers in this country do have a choice and a voice. Employers are to accommodate during a crisis but when it is over or waning and controlled then it is reasonable to expect workers to return or to make a choice to quit!"
2020-04-29 14:16,"We have lost more lives in two months of this pandemic than in twenty years of the Vietnam war.

The businesses are behind the scenes trying to get opened up but want limited liability. 

I am sure employees want to open up as well, but do they want to come back to unsafe conditions.

Why don’t the federal government establish self funded health insurance policies and six figure life insurance policies for all these essential workers while waiving OSHA standards?"
2020-04-29 14:35,"As noted in the article there is no way to prove in court where anyone infected by the virus acquired that infection. So, let’s stick to the standard of employers providing employees with appropriate PPE , social distancing guidelines and work station barriers as appropriate. Opening up the barn door for unethical businesses seems like a bad idea unless of course you want to stymie legislation for recovery from this viral scourge."
2020-04-29 14:59,"Is it all that hard?   Legal liability limits plus a commercial practices code.   If you follow the code, then you legal immunity.   Yes, writing the code will be a challenge, so let's get started."
2020-04-29 15:00,"One of my biggest concern regarding reopening is that there are no clear guidelines regarding best practices to protect employees and customers.  Hospitals are still reusing single use masks and gowns. There is basically no appropriate PPE available to the general public.  I feel it is immoral to give companies a liability waiver that they will then use to compel their employees to return to a potentially unsafe working condition under the threat of being fired for cause and losing the ability to claim unemployment.  This needs to be a two way street where we recognize that there will be a risk of contracting the virus until a vaccine is available, while also doing everything possible to ensure that employers protect the health and safety of employees."
2020-04-29 15:04,"The party of the oligarchs should be careful about what they wish for. Under Trump, protections for American's health and safety have been rendered ineffective before, and remarkably during, the Covid pandemic. Our litigious society exists partly because the government has failed to ensure the safety of our food, water and pharmaceuticals. Absent any sense of safety, and with a food supply network forced by Trump to produce regardless of its widespread Covid infestation, the public is unlikely to rush back to consume at pre-pandemic rates. And, how eager will restaurants be to reopen if they have no assurance, and no recourse to assure, that their supply is untainted? The repercussions of allowing businesses to shirk liability for irresponsible practices reach far into the economy."
2020-04-29 15:31,"Unless businesses follow and implement accepted and approved standards for insuring their employees are not risks to infect their co-workers, they should be held responsible for ordering employees back to work."
2020-04-29 15:33,Two things I know about a Republican bill to shield companies from liability. It won’t be limited and it won’t be temporary. The corporate dream of workers having no recourse would be coming true.
2020-04-29 15:45,"From the article: ""Administration officials have said they are examining how they could create some of those shields via regulation or executive order.""  
So once again business gets the upper hand. 
Having worked in insurance for over 20 years I am all to aware of lawsuits & while I agree that there are way too many frivolous lawsuits these could be eliminated or never really started if companies & employers showed at least some awareness that their employees are important. Large corporations especially say that their employees are so important but we all know that that is a huge lie. There may be a few businesses & companies that do the right thing but they are in the minority.  Can't stop the lawsuits when employees are exploited, especially in the large corporations where the employees see that their CEO's gut the company & get huge bonuses."
2020-04-29 15:48,"No, sorry.  Businesses that chose to open must ensure safety of workers and customers, and it's on them.  Businesses are getting assistance for rent, staff costs, etc. (although slow for many).  

More importantly, there is no way to prove where someone caught the virus - it can be from many sources/locations.  And businesses can only control what workers or client do in their place of business, not outside.  

But, we cannot allow someone to sue a business because they catch the virus.  Any of us that catch it could sue anyone.  We don't sue when we catch the flu or pneumonia, or any other infectious disease."
2020-04-29 16:18,"If businesses are given protection from liability, what incentive do they then have to take reasonable measures to protect employees and customers.  Trump has ordered meat packing industries to reopen, but what protection is he offering for employees who are required to work.  It seem that the these employees should be prioritized in testing along with health care workers. Likewise employers should be required to see that social distancing is practiced, masks are required and sanitary measures rigorously used.  While employers should be protected from unreasonable suits, they should also be required to take all reasonable measures to protect employees.  I don 't see that priority in these discussions."
2020-04-29 16:25,"Democrats should never grant blanket immunity to businesses. Look at the immunity for gun industry which has shielded them from lawsuits and liability for the damage and loss of life their guns case. If businesses are given the immunity they seek, they will have zero incentive to provide safe work places for their employees. If they receive immunity, workers will be forced to return to work without any assurance that all possible precautions from Covid 19 virus are in place. The whole notion of immunity runs counter to the notion of persinal or corporate responsibility. Where there is shield of  immunity it also voids my opportunity to have my day in court. Immunity is a typical Republican response rather addressing underlying issues."
2020-04-29 17:11,"I manage a long established employee-owned cocktail lounge and we're not planning on reopening anytime in the near future; we're more financially secure than other businesses because the building and equipment is ours and paid off.  We're letting our friends at a local non-profit food bank use our walk-in cooler and a neighbor who went out of business use our floor space for storage. 

I have been going out of my way to shop at a larger grocery store because they have a hand-washing station out front, provide disinfectant wipes for wiping down baskets, require customers to wear face masks, have one-way aisles and 6-foot markers at the check-out line whereas my corner market provides no such protections.   If someone catches C-19 going to either of these markets, I'd say the bodega is way more exposed to lawsuits than the larger store.

Stay safe and be nice."
2020-04-29 14:08,"Thought experiment. Movie Theaters are being opened. Some say it's not safe. How can it be made safe? 
Only allow 25% of the seats to be filled so there is the six feet social distancing. All customers must be wearing masks and gloves. All seats must be disinfected between each show. This would make the venue safer but not completely safe. 
   So problem solved, right? Absolutely not. That 
'safe opening' scenario I described would cost too much to implement. They would lose money on each show. In other words, a stupid idea.Barbershops, chiropracters, massage therapy. Unless the workers are wearing full medical gloves, robes, masks and face shields as seen in ICU wards then there business becomes a transmission zone. Their equipment would have to be  cleaned, medical quality disinfected, between each customer. chairs ,tables, clippers, files etc. Simply a simple chemical swipe would not due. Once again, too expensive to make a profit.
  These places will open, the virus will be spread."

Our world, shaken as never before, at least since the Spanish Flu 100 years ago.

Humans are incredibly resilient as our history has shown, bouncing back from pestilence, plagues, world wars, and economic disasters, all of which have built in most of us the will to do better; the fact we are are still trying in the face of this latest threat means we are all heroes.

In any crisis, large and small, leadership decides what the outcome will be, and this latest worldwide crisis mandates that we, that humanity, sees its responsibility in this regard, and make certain that we choose at every opportunity, individuals and groups who believe in doing that which benefits all of the people, instead of a select few.

Here in America, the nation which has always been the beacon of hope for mankind, competent leadership has never been more critical, not just for we Americans, but for every  nation; we now have the opportunity to rise again, to do as we have often done when hope was dying, be that battlefield hero that everyone knew was there, head to the front, be fearless and lead as never before, lead our world, our home, out of the darkness of despair, back to hope.

Meanwhile, Trump’s base is marching for the so-called re-opening (which should be called re-infecting) because the delays have starved them and they believe the lie that the government has no money to help them and they need to work or die. 

I never imagined America would crash so completely - in morals, democracy, compassion and basic decency. The worst part is that by voting Republican we did it to ourselves from Reagan onward and now we watch it, immobilized."

2020-04-30 13:45,"The number of unemployed miss other effects of the pandemic which could be economically catastrophic. First, people were locked down and did not venture out to ""shop"" as they normally did and discovered they could do with less.  Second, everyone is in save mode because they see how close to the financial edge they are or have no desire to be anywhere near it. Since our economies run on consumption, the back-to-normal-lets-get-working contingent forget that somebody has to be in the mood to buy all that stuff they churn out. I have a salary and am still working, but my husband works in renovations, and business in tanking. I dusted off my sewing machine and am clearing out a spot under my mattress to hide my gold."
2020-04-30 13:45,"Gotta say this - When Trump was commenting (actually lying) about the unemployment rate during the previous (wink wink nudge nudge) admin was actually 25-42% (depending on what day of the week it was), maybe he was actually predicting what it would be during his OWN administration.

He may yet finally get his wish, trying to oversee the running of a country with a truly dismal economy.

All I can hope is that we finally have a conversation about what constitutes a good economy.  It clearly isn't one where only the wealthiest 2% get any actual benefits.  In a truly good economy, the average person wouldn't have run out of money after only 6 weeks, putting pressure on anyone to 'reopen'."
2020-04-30 13:50,"The government policies on lockdowns and social distancing arise from state law, and state governors, much more than from Washington. Thus, Trump's decision not to extend them will have only limited effects.

The lockdowns have succeeded, at least to some extent, in flattening the curve, and it seems fair to say that our health system did not become truly overwhelmed as many feared.  There were many deaths from Covid19 to be sure, but these were from the virus, and, by and large, not because we didn't have enough ICU beds or ventilators.

The lockdowns do not allow immunity to develop, and there will be many more cases, and more deaths.  Lockdowns can delay these, but it's not clear they prevent them.

The lockdowns caused much of the economy and world trade to collapse. In  a country as dependent on foreign manufacturing as the US, and much of the west, have become today, the dramatic decline in trade will have catastrophic effects on life in America for months and perhaps years to come.

Both looking back and looking forward, we need to be asking ourselves where the line between flattening the curve through lockdowns and a collapsing economy should be drawn.  I'm not sure we got it right; no one is. 

But it remains a crucial question on which millions of lives and trillions of dollars depend, and we need to ask it, as objectively and independently of politics as possible. The crucial question is not whether you like or respect President Trump, it's what we should be doing."
2020-04-30 13:45,"We have plenty of examples of good and bad governance during this pandemic (and the one in 1918).

In 1918, California escaped waves one and two because they took effective action. They let down their guard in the third wave and got hit. Compare this with Philadelphia that did nothing and got slammed from the start.

Fast forward to 2020. Again, CA was prepared. Their public health saw it coming (with help from bluedart.com and others). Compare this with NYC, who got slammed.

Tragically, many GOP governors have chosen profits for the super-rich over public health.

As for our Federal government, we would have had less deaths if they had done nothing. Unfortunately, Trump is actively working AGAINST public health. (Don't get me started - things like snatching PPE orders from the states, lying, refusing to set effective standards, reducing CDC budgets, unfunding W.H.O. ...)

Scant, late sheltering guidelines were little help, as most of the labor force was thrown into lockdown without any public health preparedness. The Pence task force has been shadowed by Kushner, but which group is in control? Then, Trump blisters the public with lies and revisions.

The blue states holding the shut down a little longer will all have to allow this as well. They will look better when looked back on, but will allow the masses to end the isolation or not in their own personal way.

1.  Pre-empt any criticism by blaming others for the immoral or unethical things that you are doing.  Gaslight.

2.  Viciously attack the character of individuals or political entities to take the focus off of issues.  This conveniently shifts focus from facts to someone's to divert spotlight from your own failings.

3. When you are caught red-handed, immediately shift the attention to something that a previous president or political candidate did long ago, whether it is true or not.  

4. When you are caught doing something really bad, do something or say something that is so outrageous that it shifts the focus of the media and news that is reported.

5. Deny everything, even those things that you have said on camera.  While some will call you out, others will either not be aware of what you previously said, or not care.

6.  Utilize troll farms of people on various social media platforms to direct narrative in the U.S. and to sow discord.  As long as people are arguing with one another, they are less likely to notice what you are doing.

What else have I missed?  Be familiar with this list and the rot and sleaze that is to come between now and November.  If you are disgusted with the republican party now, you haven't seen anything yet!"
2020-04-30 14:56,"Re-opening if done with the utmost safety precautions is desirable.

Those new employees will be in charge of keeping the lines outside the stores well organized, with each customer mandatorily having to wear a face covering and staying six feet apart from the next customer (or been asked to leave if that customer refuses to comply). At the entrance and inside the store those new employees will guard that all customers comply with all safety rules instituted by the store. Another “new” job could be for these new employees to go around the large store parking lot taking orders from customers that prefer not to go into the store and stay in their cars and have their purchase delivered to their cars."

Just this morning on ""Democracy Now"" Thomas Piketty in speaking about his newest book ""Capital and Ideology"" addressed the dramatic change since 1980 (under Reagan) in the level of Inequality.

But Piketty, in his newest book ""Capital and Ideology"", went even further than his ""Capital in the 21st century"" by starting to describe the history, methodology, and political Ideology that underpins (or under lies) the ability of a political/economic & social system to so dramatically loot from, and yet not be seen by, 'we the American people'.

""These rules govern forms of political participation and specify the respective roles of citizens and foreigners as well as the functions of executives and legislators, ministers and kings, parties and elections, EMPIRES and colonies.""  [Caps Added]

They might want to rethink that and especially the US Companies just maybe, should prudently run it by their General Counsel and attornies plus some Federal Judges too---- 
Regarding monetary risks and liability associated with opening during a Pandemic and jeopardizing the lives of our workers in America.

Costco and Norma Rae - come to mind today

Costco's announcement that everyone in every store must wear a mask May 4th

Norma Rae- well she stood up for suffering workers literally.

The folks at OSHA and all the Companies and their Lawyers and GC's who brazenly risk American worker's lives during a COVID-19 will pay.   The Federal Judges will hear case after case.   Precedents will follow and it will not be pretty for the Companies.   $$$$$.

Interesting to recall a very sharp WH Reporter who asked President Trump if all this liability risk for companies was taken into consideration when the WH established the Guidelines.   I do not recall the exact answer - someone might have the transcript but I believe he answered they had not, but they will now.    That was a couple of weeks ago.

Even though Nixon had his bad days @WH he did have something to do with the creation of  OSHO in 1970."
2020-04-30 15:03,"I'm sick of the Federal gov't picking winners and losers. It backs Wall St. and big business and ignores funding the States who pay for frontline and essential workers. I get angry when I see people being forced to re-enter the workforce knowing that the government has no intention to perform the testing and contact tracing needed beforehand, and is ready to accept elevated death rates dictated by tax revenues instead of compassion.  I'm angry to read about corporations who are seeking blanket immunity from any liability for people who may become infected with the virus effectively guaranteeing a profitable business model at the expense of health and safety. I'm angry when I hear Trump push to reopen schools because I know its not about education but a means to remove any obstacles to returning to the workforce. I'm tired of the hypocrisy that flows from Trump's mouth every night when he claims 1 death is one too many when he really means the loss of one vote is one too many. This is no longer a government of, by and for the people unless you rich, powerful, or connected. Maybe when enough Americans become tired and angry the government will begin to listen.  Until then......"
2020-04-30 15:18,"We cannot possibly be astounded that many U.S. people are breaking stay-at-home orders.  People are mostly driven by fear...fear of losing jobs, healthcare, and fear of finding another job amid the worst economic climate in a century.  Other countries adopt wage subsidy approaches to ensure employers retain their workforce, and they feature public healthcare systems.  The U.S. implements its survival-of-the-fittest approach with unemployment and SBA loan applications, and it vigorously defends its cobbled-together private healthcare system that the WHO ranks 37th in the world.  I find it shameful that a country of such wealth refuses to do better than that."

How is someone supposed to calculate what they’ve made on average over the past six months, year, whatever, when they’re living on money they made, say, 18 months earlier? When half your payment comes 6-8 weeks after the job is finished?

2020-04-30 13:29,"I guess we are destined to repeat the same mistake made during the Spanish Flu. By reopening too early, and our so-called “leaders” waffling and giving mixed and confusing messages (i.e. Pence visiting hospital without a mask, even though people have been advised to wear them, and Trump and Kushner with their revisionist “news” briefings—just making up their own reality that has nothing at all to do with the world the rest of us are living in) we are undoubtedly going to have a second deadlier wave. This virus is so highly contagious that most people who go back to normal life are going to get it and we will be right back where we started with hospitals overwhelmed and businesses are going to end up going under anyway. 

The only way to get through this crisis is strong leadership to create new connective pathways that can quickly connect the unemployed with necessary income, food and medical care. Unfortunately we don’t have that leadership in America. At all. Instead we have a “president” who courts divisiveness and has pitted states against one another and deflects responsibility at every opportunity. What a sad and dark time for our country."

It's been rather like our pandemic mitigation effort over all. We're quick with historical analogies, usually the wrong ones, once it is too late but when events occur we behave as if this is the first time in world history that a society has had to deal with some threat. The unemployment wasn't an unintended consequence, it was a choice, or rather a series choices, that we made without giving the matter too much thought. Nevertheless to express surprise at the nature of the bargain we made seems strangely disingenuous."

This belies Trump’s claim that he built a great economy; rather, the economy was on a glide path rebuilding itself when he became POTUS."
2020-04-30 15:38,"Let's not forget that above all else, Trump is a member of the GOP. The political party whose primary interest is serving the interests of the 1%.

Once shops, factories, offices etc. officially ""re-open"" the employees must report back to work.  If they do not do so, they will forfeit future unemployment benefits.

Vulnerable employees will have no choice but to go to work.  They will not have the option of collecting their benefits while caring for their children or other loved ones; nor for themselves if they have complicating health issues.

When you hear GOP ""leaders"" call for re-opening what you are really hearing is that it's time to crunch the workers -- even if it costs them their lives.

But I only feel half-sorry for these workers.  After all, they keep voting against their self-interests and electing GOP ""leaders"".

Trump boasted to journalists years ago that he likes to lie, then attack the credibility of anyone who calls him out on it.

What is a game to Trump is now a matter of life and death. It's also a matter of Trump wrecking our economy. The reason we still have a grossly inadequate supply of tests for the virus is that Trump falsely boasted weeks ago that we had plenty of tests. Believing him, the companies that manufacture the tests assumed some other company had already made enough, so they failed to step up their own production.

This is how Trump makes America weak again."
2020-04-30 13:59,"Good luck to anyone that filed an unemployment claim. My office shut down March 23rd, I filed the next day and every week since, and  have not received a dime. I also applied for the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and it's the same story. While Trump pats himself on the back and brags about what a great job he's doing, the rest of us are just hoping we'll get some help with the bills that are piling
up. I've stopped listening to Trump altogether. He just makes up fairy stories and thinks they are true. Millions of Americans are like me, or in worse shape. At least I don't have hungry children that I can't feed, nor a loved one who's sick."
2020-04-30 14:00,"Are there any statistics that show the make-up of the unemployment figures? Who are these 30 million people that are now out-of-work? I know it might seem to be a harsh question because when you're not working, it's not a good thing but I think it might add some clarity to the situation if we knew  what sectors have shed workers so quickly. Are these all high-paid, engineering and technical people or are they lower paid, non-professional/labor jobs? Manufacturing? Food industry? Retail?

Even before this crisis, I always had a sense that the ""unemployment"" numbers in the U.S., or at least the government spin on it, was never reported in good faith. Nor did I ever believe that Americans were being told the truth. I think the notion of ""full employment"" that the administration was so proud of was and is an illusion. If people are working for sub-standard wages or for companies that are just barely holding on in the good times, this reflects something fundamentally wrong with the economy. It took an incompetent administration and a virus to bring the U.S. economy to its knees very quickly. Something is terribly wrong in all this. 

Anyone care to speculate?"

I don't want to file a claim because funds are limited and millions of people are desperate for that money, like getting thrown out in the street desperate.  But this is where I am today.

What happens if the economy continues to deteriorate and in a few months that cash reserve is gone?  This could very well happen.  Then I start getting desperate.  But by then, the aid will all be used up.

Point being, millions of people may not be unemployed or even qualify for assistance, but their incomes have been severely curtailed.  There is reporting that white collar incomes are starting to be affected.  

Everything is slowing down.  Myself, I am just buying food, a bit of OTC medicine, and home maintenance items.  That's it.  I'm certain that millions more are doing the same. 

We are entering a downward spiral after the initial crush of the shutdown.  This thing is nowhere close to being over.  The economy is going to need help for the foreseeable future.  We need to implement some kind of long term recovery package to carry us into next year to prevent widespread economic calamity."
2020-04-30 15:33,"The unemployment numbers are irrelevant at this point and certainly have no correlation to previous economic downturns such as the Great recession or the Great depression. Never before in modern history has the government order an economy to shutdown on a dime. That is what we did in March. The people were ordered to leave work and shelter in their homes. Every aspect of modern American life was altered literally overnight. The story is not were we are today, the story is to be written in the coming months when the people are released back into productive work. Not every business or industry will make it, but most will. The government has soften the blow with a $600.00 a week payment on top of unemployment and $1,200 check. These monies will catch up in the coming weeks many people will be ahead financially, others will have a hole to get of. The part of the future that is being written now is when do we get back to work."

I don't see anything, however, where he expresses a similar concern that my civil and constitutional rights are being violated by people who refuse to abide by these orders, orders that are based on the advice and knowledge of medical and scientific experts. People who threaten my health and well-being by refusing to wear masks, refusing to accept social distancing, refusing to not gather in large groups, and running an extremely high risk of re-igniting the pandemic.

Those of us who are complying are now being held hostage by those who refuse. We cannot risk going out, even more so now than before, because so many people are violating the orders we cannot safely assume that the virus is receding as it appears to be. Within 3 weeks --- the incubation period --- we could see a complete reversal of the gains we've made.

So, I'm left to wonder --- but not really --- where Barr's concern is for my civil rights, my right to life, to safety, to be free from the threat presented by a collection of citizens who  obviously care about nothing other than their own comfort and well-being.

Of course, I know the answer to my question... it is disheartening to think so many people are embracing Barr's and Trump's thinking."

If more people are out of their homes there will be more (potentially infectious) interactions between carriers and unaffected recipients.  So to keep infections from running amok we have to ensure that these interactions are less likely to result in infections.  

As we are opening up businesses and other activities, the social distancing and masks becomes critically important.  In order to compensate for more people being out, we should increase demands and enforcement of rules such as masks and distance."

But Piketty, in his newest book ""Capital and Ideology"", went even further than his ""Capital in the 21st century"" by starting to describe the history, methodology, and political Ideology that underpins (or under lies) the ability of a political/economic & social system to so dramatically loot from, and yet not be seen by, 'we the American people'.

As an educator, I agree that there is much inequality in education in the US. But the answer is not to ease students’ passage through the system. On the contrary, it is to divert resources to education so as to level the playing field for all students regardless of social class or identify. And to bolster educational systems  as a whole. Unfortunately, for a host of ideological and historical reasons, this has never been a real priority and it might be too late.

But firmly in our minds as we all debate over the future of education should be the image of so-called leaders who have been trafficking in lies and misinformation, worsening an act of nature and its impact on the population as a whole. And this by “leaders” who have had all sorts of educational advantages in the world, yet have no qualms, for their lack of a moral compass, to inflict death and suffering on the very people they’re called on, by their offices, to protect.

America, Stockman argued on the show, can be divided into three cohorts or “nations”: 60 million kids (under 16); their parents and teachers, i.e., 215 million working adults (16-64); and their grandparents (65 and up) who number 52 million. 

The virus only significantly affects the last group, as the CDC’s latest (April 28) data show. 

The youngest “nation” suffers 44K deaths annually, but among them have been exactly five COVID-19 deaths in the whole country.

Of the “middle” population, the disease has killed 3.6 per 100K, or “1.0% of the 350 [per 100K] normal deaths in that age group.”

This applies to every worker in every "" essential, store. factory and Hospital  and (**nursing homes- the absolutely most vulnerable patients with the largest death tolls in most states.)

I recall Trump did not wish to do so in FEB and stated his rationale for not ""fully enacting"" the DPA ACT was to avoid Socializing business in America.

Our Farmers are supported directly by the Government in a socialized manner.   Back in Feb 2019 Farmers were caught in the trade war and have become dependent on government payments.  $28 Billion dollars of payments from President Trump.

2020-04-30 16:02,"As one piece of bad news after another comes in, it’s clear that we are in for a reckoning that we haven’t seen in our lifetime. In terms of our economic future, the greatest challenge is not the lack of capital nor opportunities for growth nor lack of entrepreneurs or hard working people: we have all of these in abundance. What we lack in the economy is faith and trust. Americans have no faith that the people in charge—both in government and in the private sector—are fully taking the well-being of Americans into account in their decision making. Reopening the economy when metrics such as the number of new cases of Covid-19 do not meet already published guidelines or ordering workers back to meat processing plants without certifying workplace safety are but two examples of authorities putting political and financial interests ahead of the lives of American workers. The current patchwork of opening of businesses and public facilities across the country are without any basis apart from the bravado of governors or mayors. On what basis are we allowing restaurants to open in Atlanta while keeping them shut in Philadelphia? The Trump administration has made predictions, plans, and promises that have been proven false, scuttled, and unfulfilled. We’re still unsure on what scientifically grounded basis we will step-by-step emerge from this crisis. We won’t have an economy until we restore the faith and trust in the authorities. After this mess, they need to regain it."

The image of their collective boot on the necks of the American worker would have been what is now known as a meme.  What a difference a hundred years makes.  Now the wealthy have legions of admirers and supporters who gain little themselves but have been deluded into thinking that the only other choice is communism, bread lines, and a class of people who get paid to do nothing.  The belief is that people like Warren Buffet earned success all by themselves rather than by benefitting from a rigged system.  This strongly implies belief in a natural order where such alpha males (and females) SHOULD, in fact, rule their worker drones.  This despite the evidence right before their eyes that the wealthiest country in the history of the world has 30 million or more unemployed in a few short months. Apparently WE were never the wealthiest country, but rather only about 350,000 of us were (0.1%)."

Estimates were up to 30% unemployment (out of a total labor force of ~160,000,000 would be about 48,000,000). In many places we are flattening or reducing the curve, so hopefully we can start easing restrictions responsibly and stop job losses short of 30% unemployment. Hoping for the best."

Now that the initial surge seems to have flattened we should adopt a measured approach and gradually reopen our economy including schools, with those people most likely to recover from an infection and thereby develop immunity while continuing to isolate and protect our elderly and vulnerable.

One example of such technology I've recently discovered listening to an NPR piece is that made by Sense Biodetection Limited. 

An article in the AP on March 31st states: Sense’s VerosTM SARS-CoV-2 is a simple disposable test that uses a nasal swab sample to give an ultra-rapid result without the need for any instrumentation. As a molecular test its performance is equivalent to Gold Standard laboratory tests but it is easy to use in any setting and results are available in under 10 minutes. The test is fully self-contained and can be widely distributed to wherever it is needed, overcoming the logistical and contamination problems associated with machine-based testing.

Harry Lamble, chief executive officer at Sense, commented:

“Our VerosTM COVID-19 test product can allow infected patients to be isolated sooner whilst providing reassurance to uninfected individuals including healthcare workers that they can return to work without infecting others. Due to its flexibility, speed and accuracy, the test can be deployed for rapid patient triage within hospitals as well as primary care practices, pharmacies, and community centers and even distributed for use by individuals in isolation who suspect they may have COVID-19.”

It  has already been reported that businesses are concerned about lawsuits from customers who may claim they were infected by visiting a restaurant or getting a haircut.  

So now businesses need to worry not only about going bankrupt from lack of customers but getting sued by those who do show up, not to mention their employees.

And do you think it will even be affordable? The current unproven drug they are pushing, resmedivir, happens to be made by Gilead Sciences, and on March 23, 2020, Trump gave the drug “orphan” drug status which patents the drug exclusively for Gilead for 7 years and no generics can be made. Back on March 23rd, when this was quietly done without notifying us clearly, the stock value of Gilead shot up. Now, why do you think Trump is pushing the FDA to approve this drug without real testing or science to prove it works? In fact, several other studies around the world found resmedevir ineffective whether given early or late in the disease process.

Another ACA problem, and it's going to hit people now, mostly unaware, is that in about 10 states, including blue ones like MA and NJ, benefits paid out under ACA expanded Medicaid are subject to estate recovery for people 55 and older.  

(Expanded Medicaid is what people with income to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level get under the ACA, and oodles of people are being switched down to that right now.)  Affected people don't have insurance like they think.  They have just a loan for medical expenses until death.  A nasty COVID or other hospitalization, with $1,000,000 in bills, will destroy their ability to pass on assets.

(For details, see the Wikipedia article on Medicaid estate recovery.  Wikipedia is not, in itself, a reliable source, but there are sound references.)"

Yes there were unfortunate 2200 + deaths of Swedes 97% of persons over 45 with a weak immune system not very different from 97% of the 60,000 deaths of persons over 45 in the USA.

The terrorist mass killer COVID-19  coronavirus killed those among US with the weakest immune system many of whom were already in nursing home bubbles glued to their bed with poor air circulation. The rest of the country did not need to stay in the bubble sitting at home destroying their own lively hoods because their civil liberties were stolen and their businesses shut down. The responsibility for the colossal unemployment rests on the shoulders of govs. who panicked and ordered businesses to shut down and forced employees to stay at home and then tell them not to worry uncle Sam will pay you from tax payer revenues to stay at home. Well uncle Sam has deep holes in his pocket and is dead broke with a 25 T dollar debt.

Limiting the number of people allowed into any establishment, staying away from anyone with symptoms, etc.  Stay at home may be well advised in cities like NY and Los Angeles, but not for the entire country.

2020-04-30 14:29,"Trump's disjointed response to this pandemic has exacerbated its duration but people should NOT establish a recovery timeline based on the present chaos coming out of the admin. At this moment, every drug comp and lab is working on some form of covid mitigation strategy. With so much effort, breakthroughs are inevitable. Had they worked together with better coordination, breakthroughs would come sooner but that's not Trump's style. For the drug companies, the rewards are billions, for Trump, the reward is reelection. 

The second factor impeding progress is the haphazard production of medical equipment. Trump's resume does not include an understanding of supply chains but his constant intrusion into the normal workings of established departments derailed their standard procedures. If I help my mechanic fix my car, he charges me extra.

Third, and most important, is the chaos exemplified by the fracas with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. One minute Azar is going to be fired, the next minute he's not. Important members of his team have been denied access to critical data they need. It's difficult to create solutions to complex problems amidst bedlam.

Bottom line: When America needed a leader with strong organizational and leadership skills, it got the opposite. Therefore, mitigation will take longer resulting in more deaths and an exaggerated impact on our economy."

Why can’t we be getting a package every 30th of the month of the stuff that probably costs as much to make? We are citizens and COVID is not our problem to tackle, despite the efforts to convince us otherwise. Our overall protection from global, uncontrollable events is the responsibility of our elected leaders and a fundamental right of every taxpayer going back to Roman times.

2020-04-30 14:57,"This entire crisis has been mishandled.  All Trump and his administration of incompetents have done is use it to help their cronies line their pockets.  There hasn't been any leadership from the president, the vice president, anyone in the administration, Jared, the senate majority leader, and so on down the line.  Whatever the Democrats have tried to do has been watered down to the point of uselessness by the GOP in its zeal to both punish the blue states and keep government intervention to a minimum.  

How dense is McConnell?  Is he so insulated from the rest of us that he doesn't see what's happening in front of him?  Trump hasn't had contact with reality for decades.  McConnell is representing a poor state.  He, at the very least should understand that crises like these spawn more crises and are not easy to recover from.  If any state representatives should be complaining it's those that represent states giving more to the federal government than they get back.  

Trump, like Hoover, is going to go down as the president who presided over an economic downturn and failed utterly.  He will have failed to lead, to ease suffering, to respond to the people's needs instead of his own.  McConnell and the rest of the GOP ought to be impeached for their betrayal as well."
2020-04-30 15:53,"Of course unemployment claims are surging.

When the government is paying a $600 a week bonus on top of the regular unemployment payment that's over a thousand dollars a week.  Many of the unemployed were minimum wag earners and now they have a windfall and they're not going to want to go back to work for peanuts as long as they can milk the system which was stupid to begin with at taxpayer expense.

Fed Chairman Powell and task force must stop immediately the $600 a week bonus payments and bring order to our unemployed who should be encouraged to go back to work even at minimum wage which now has been destroyed.

I don't know if the Democrats are responsible for this blunder but it destroys the motivation to have a job and the pride of a job and the need for a job.  It's like a guaranteed payment whether you want to work or not.

In 1968, for example, Nixon and Wallace got 60% of Texas votes, but Humphrey's 40% was higher than either one's, so he got ALL of the Texas electoral votes.

In 2020, this is especially relevant if a third-party candidate runs -- for example, Justin Amash of MI. Amash will take most votes away from Trump, but if Trump still gets more than Biden -- even if that's less than 50% -- Trump will win MI."
2020-04-30 18:47,"There is something called ""short-time work"" in several European countries. It means that in a temporary crisis, a company can reduce the working time of the workforce and lower the salary accordingly. The employees are partly, but not fully compensated for the financial loss by the social security system. 

This was introduced in Germany in the financial crisis of 2008 and has allowed the German economy to quickly bounce back afterwards. It was good for the companies, because they saved the tremendous costs of replacing their workforce and training lots of new employees. And it was good for the workers, because they kept their jobs. It also saved the social security system a lot of money.

No one’s livelihood (and therefore effectively their life) should DEPEND on a movie theatre being open. Or a coffee shop. Or an ice cream parlor. Or a spa. Our economy is built on so much that is so utterly unnecessary, and the house of cards is crumbling. I don’t mean that as an insult to movie theatre managers, etc. And I’m not saying we shouldn’t be able to ever have those things. But no one’s life should DEPEND on a theatre or mall or dog groomer or nail salon. The very idea is bananas. “Reopen the malls! People need to work!” protestors howl.

No. People don’t “need” to work at a mall or movie theatre, etc. Clean air, clean water, adequate food and shelter, medical/dental care and waste treatment/removal... these are actual needs. We can meet these needs by splitting up actual essential jobs, but the work week would then need to decrease to less than 40 hours. And people like cashiers in grocery stores would need to be respected and understood as having solid middle class jobs, not be looked down upon and given minimal salary/benefits.

*I understand the fact that, in our current system, people do need to work at unnecessary jobs in order for them to buy necessary things. What I am saying is that people should not have to work unnecessary jobs in order to buy the necessary things. The system is garbage. UBI would help with this."

2020-04-30 18:12,"The labor market is far more dynamic than the headline suggests. As of the week ending April 18, (one week before the most recent claims data) the number of people receiving jobless benefits was 18 million. In other words you can't just add the weekly numbers up and get a sense of what things look like. It seems a number of people who originally filed have found other work, or possibly returned to their jobs. 

A more complete picture will be forthcoming with the April employment report due out May 8. This counts people not receiving benefits as well as those who do. This is tricky too. People not working who don't receive benefits may not actually count as ""unemployed"" if they are not looking for work. Such numbers are likely larger than usual out of caution regarding the virus. So if the unemployment rate prints at say, 10%, the labor market condition might well be worse as millions of people drop out of the labor force who don't want to run the risk of infection in the workplace or while commuting. 

Going forward, the data will reflect the rate of reopening that occurs around the country, the extent of additional infection (not whether it will occur), and the confidence the population has to both work in, and go out to participate in the activities provided by the newly reopened enterprises. It's virtaully impossible to assess the outcome at this point with any confidence."

I do not see ANY significant decrease in both in weeks. Of course, some hot spots have different trends (New York), but if the increase is constant other places should be increasing to make it up.

There was a trend to improving survival by about 3% (8% in placebo vs. 11% remdesivir), but this was not statistically significant, meaning we can't confidently say this was no better than a chance to get these results. Also, none of the data from this trial has been made public for many doctors and scientists to review. 

What you probably didn't hear was that during the same time yesterday, the Lancet published the first placebo-controlled randomized trial of remdesivir in COVID19 patients. Remdesivir did not have any clinical benefit.  Moreover, 2/3 of patients had adverse even because of the drug. 

These are desperate times for the U.S. government, and pharma knows this. Remember, remdesivir is a failed Ebola drug that Gilead created back in 2013.   Gilead offering 1.5 million free drugs to the FDA if they approve the drug for COVID19 seems like a noble thing for them to do or a way for them to entice a desperate FDA to approve a treatment for COVID19 so they can profit off a previously failed drug.   Either way, this drug seems to have very modest effects at best, and at worst, it may not have any clinical benefit but with many side effects and higher costs.  It certainly doesn't seem to be a gamechanger some are boasting about and nowhere near a cure that we so desperately need.

2020-04-30 20:48,"There is supply and there is demand. They do not depend upon each other. There can be demand with little or plenty of supply. There can be supply with little or no demand. People have a great deal of difficulty appreciating what this means. It means that even if people have the means to buy, they do not have to. If people have priorities which make buying minimal, economic demand will not exist. Under such conditions, fiscal stimuli are irrelevant. 

People are afraid of suffering or causing severe harm, they are not buying as a result. They are not earning as a result which means what little that they are buying is depleting their wealth. 

Fix the problems that are keeping them at home, then the economy will recover. Meanwhile people need help with getting their material needs satisfying until life returns to normal. 

Of course, there is the right wing solution, risk your life to eat or starve to death in safety. One can always rely upon the right to seek to kill off the competition, all people except themselves—and not all of them."

The state health department’s statistics are DAYS behind the daily county reports. Stop with the Keystone Kops management of this crisis!

2020-04-30 20:57,"Who's cooking the books?

If a person dies from a heart attack consequent to COVID-19, some places will record the cause as the COVID-19 and some as a heart attack.

Statistics for confirmed cases of COVID-19 are highly dependent on the varying numbers of tests in different states and communities. Consequently, one would think the most accurate and, therefore, relevant statistic available for comparison purposes would be the deaths per number of residents. However, if you look at the state by state comparisons, some seem to make no sense, inasmuch as states with significant numbers of cases and/or deaths have very different fatality rates.

Different states and different localities use different criteria for attributing cause of death. I expect politics as much as medical protocols play a significant role. Responsibility, accountability, and image undoubtedly are factored in to some states' reports of deaths. Is it coincidence that, even pulling out the sparsely populated high plains and mountain states, you still pretty much see the states with Democratic governors reporting higher death rates than states with Republican governors?

For instance, Florida with 1088 deaths has a fatality rate of 5/100,00 while Louisiana with 1740 deaths has a fatality rate of 37/100,000. Texas with 666 deaths reports a fatality rate of 2/100,000 while Connecticut with 2012 deaths has a fatality rate of 56/100,000. These differences cannot simply be attributed to a difference in medical care."
2020-04-30 21:08,"This is not classic unemployment. It is not people left out or expelled from an economic system that is out of order in its economic basis.

It is a deliberate shut down, with medical rather than economic causes. It is similar to the European vacation month of August, in that it is a decision, not an economic breakdown.

It could become classic economic disarray, if we try to reopen and discover we are unable to do so. However, so far, it is not.

It could get even worse, if a lot more people die. This could be a disaster that defines the early 21st Century, the way the world wars defined the 20th. But we don't know that yet. We can still hope to do better."

 We need confidence to interact normally in public.  You need to be confident that those with you on the subway and theater and plane  and restaurant have been tested negative.  Otherwise the economy will be anemic in its recovery.

Now more than ever we need steady, bold leadership and a forward looking plan for the country that preserves life and allows the economy to recover. The history of other lethal viruses teaches us that opening up too soon will worsen our long-term economic prospects and health.

 Now, question we need for Trump to answer is why he did not better prepare the nation to deal with the outbreak here.  So, what do we have now, other than 61 thousand Americans dead from Covid-19; and depression-levels of unemployment. 

 Trump, his is lame attempts to shelter himself from any responsibility for the carnage in America we are not witnessing is quick to make promises he can not keep.  
One promise is a vaccine to prevent the virus. And another promise is he will rebuild the economy like he did before.  Neither promise can be kept. A safe vaccine that actually works will take years, not months to develop and distribute to the nation, let along the world.  As far rebuilding the ecomomy, Trump had very little to do with developing the expanding  economy inherited from the previous administration, he simply claimed total credit."
2020-04-30 23:01,"In place of the false hopes and accusations from the WH where Trump has deserted his duty, I wanted to offer a few reasons for some optimism before a warning.

The American society is stronger on the ground than it is given credit for. After Trump deserted his post, the governors and the people in most states have stepped up. This includes many Republican governors. It is thank to most of us that the death toll is not already higher. The economy is not doing well but that is not surprising in a lockdown. The stock market, however, is relatively stable for the time being and there is good reason to believe that unemployment will drop once the economy begins to reopen. 

This is to say that we will survive, but on one condition. Trump cannot be re-elected. He is on the ropes now but he is not out. They will fight dirty and that may work. The prime target, obviously, is Biden, but there will be others too. Many scandals will be brewed and amplified by Trump allies. They need to be ignored. People are not electing a man but an administration.  

I hope everybody is ready. This won't be easy. There is a price to pay for the failure of electing Trump in the first place."

These workers would take a burden off of workers trying to do their jobs and report problems to managers and perhaps in some cases to state agencies.

2020-04-30 23:06,"The rising death toll in New Jersey, even as you report that newly diagnosed cases there are declining, give rise to a serious query.

As NJ's daily death poll eclipses that of neighboring NY:  

1) How much is due to simply a lag given the proximity of the two states; or,

2) Is NJ's rising number an indication that the contagion and death toll rates first experienced in NY are now spreading outwards first to adjoining locations, and then perhaps, beyond?

If the answer is #2 than the re-openings going on beyond the NY/NJ/CT region may be very premature and indicate a serious ""second wave"" has already commenced in the overall toll.

Hopefully, the epidemiologists and other serious analysts are considering this despite the political noise and ideological blather going on."

Younger people today are upset for frivilous reasons like bars are closed, they can't get a tattoo and they can't go to beaches and valid reasons like they won't have the internship they were counting on this summer and college classes are up in the air for this coming Fall. My grandparents left a Europe that was in turmoil just before the world war. Things were better for them at first but then the Spanish flu hit America. Just as things became somewhat normal the depression came and life was far more disturbed than it is now. Then the second world war came. Life was a relentless rollercoaster ride.

is that in all but about 7 states, food stamps cannot be used for on-line grocery purchases.  (Obviously, saving a trip to the grocery store is considered a luxury by the 43 state governments, which is probably a reasonable rationale as it affects most people most of the time.)

However, now, during covid, certain people getting food stamps, with medical problems, are highly likely to get really sick, or die, from any covid they might catch at the supermarket.  Apparently, states have not acted quickly enough during the crisis to stop this requirement."

If a person dies from a heart attack consequent to COVID-19, some places will record the cause as the COVID-19 and some as a heart attack.

Statistics for confirmed cases of COVID-19 are highly dependent on the varying numbers of tests in different states and communities. Consequently, one would think the most accurate and, therefore, relevant statistic available for comparison purposes would be the deaths per number of residents. However, if you look at the state by state comparisons, some seem to make no sense, inasmuch as states with significant numbers of cases and/or deaths have very different fatality rates.

Different states and different localities use different criteria for attributing cause of death. I expect politics as much as medical protocols play a significant role. Responsibility, accountability, and image undoubtedly are factored in to some states' reports of deaths. Is it coincidence that, even pulling out the sparsely populated high plains and mountain states, you still pretty much see the states with Democratic governors reporting higher death rates than states with Republican governors?

For instance, Florida with 1088 deaths has a fatality rate of 5/100,00 while Louisiana with 1740 deaths has a fatality rate of 37/100,000. Texas with 666 deaths reports a fatality rate of 2/100,000 while Connecticut with 2012 deaths has a fatality rate of 56/100,000.

Seriously!!!"
2020-05-01 2:36,"You are all very focused on the numbers but I wonder if all get the facts right when you constantly switch between cases, tests and persons. Trump said the US performed 5.5 million tests, fine! But when I look at the infections and at the deaths it leaves you with roughly 1 million people who have recovered within the last 10 weeks or who will recover soon. When the US followed WHO rules these 1 million people would have used up 3 million tests (remember: 1x positiv, 2x negativ = recovered)
Considering this the US has tested 1 million + 2.5 million (5.5 tests - 3million) in total 3.5 million people which is roughly 1 % of the population. 
Now everybody should know that the models and advices are all based on 1% of data.

I think that's a pretty bad basis for any kind of decision."

Bear in mind, wages are low, the work environment at the best of times grueling, and many workers are undocumented (and not eligible for any disaster relief funds) and you have a script for slavery.

However, I never thought that I would see in my lifetime some of the same dynamics playing in America. I always had the theory that what really moved the North to react to the actions of the South was more the outrage of the Southern bullying than really the disliking for the Southern slavery based socio-economic system. There were, of course, very committed abolitionists in the North, but those were a minority. I think that the fugitive slave law, with Southern sheriffs roaming the North and terrorizing free blacks and white alike was the single most important factor. You may forgive my cynical nature, but for me, these actions were more important for the average inhabitant of the free-states than their rejection of slavery. Are we witnessing something similar? Are these armed protesters going to produce the same reactions? What about if somebody armed reacts by shooting the protesters? Is this not playing with fire?

The wealthy professional class, many of whom are still being well paid, feels little immediate pain, except in their stock portfolio.  These people, many of whom would call themselves liberal Democrats, are far from the front lines of the crushing economic misery. Trump's comment that the cure is worse than the disease has a modicum of truth.  But finding a middle ground is politically unhealthy.  So the perfect turns into the enemy of the good.

My impression, from doing my layperson's best to understand what is happening, is as follows. 

The evidence is abundantly clear that density is a key issue. This is suggested by the cruise ships, prisons, nursing homes, choir practice (the Seattle superspread), business meetings in hotels and more.  The meat packers worked elbow to elbow in cold rooms -- and cold preserves virus. 

It is less clear that transmission is likely in a sparsely populated and/or well ventilated area. 

Say this is right, for the sake of discussion.  It then follows that re-opening can occur as long as it doesn't result in a crowd of people breathing the same air.  

Patio dining, beaches, parks, backyard bbqs etc, all may be reasonably safe.  Elevators, subway cars, nursing homes, crowded indoor bars, all  likely unsafe.  

Offices would require adequate ventilation and, if possible, decontamination of the air in the ventilation system.  I don't know if that can be done. 

Overall, I think the emerging transmission data must lead the way towards a safe opening strategy."

The self discipline which people have been showing for seven weeks have become habits but habits if interrupted can be abandoned. The people who go to the beach and mingle and exhale profusely are not going to feel like they have become infected if they have for about ten days. By then they will have begun mingling elsewhere and not feeling ill. A large proportion of people, a minority but large one, are going to stop taking care in a few days. Then the spread of the infection will proceed and proceed exponentially, doubling and tripling and even higher, every day until the first display symptoms and hospitals begin to see increases of people admitted. 

There is little that can be done to assure that people remain strong and diligent during this crisis. Public officials who try to use the laws to assure compliance need to understand that our society can remain civil only as long as nearly all cooperate. If a large proportion refuse, the will not be compelled by legal sanctions. 

Many people want to believe that liberty means no constraints, legal or natural.

The President and his Administration have been and still are relaying false information almost daily which has been hampering state, national and global consolidation of pertinent, perhaps life saving information about this virus.  

There seem to be no federal standards for testing, reporting or even diagnosing of cases.  Some states report all cases while others only report cases sent to public health or the CDC.  

I would have never thought that American lives could be so politicized.  Every day I have to readjust my views regarding America’s capacity to monetize human life.  

2.2 trillion dollars was approved by congress and I cannot see how that money saved any lives.  Apparently I’m not alone.

What this pandemic has proved to me is that politics, dividends and economic status are more important than human life, as long as that life is not one of my donors, not running a company whose stocks I own nor just a wealthy sycophant.

My infectious disease doctor will call again tomorrow to check up (he is pretty certain I don't have COVID-19) but in the meantime, I'm not allowed to leave my apartment.  Which is fine, I don't want to risk infecting any of you.  But if our ""leaders"" can't lead by example, we need to get new ones.

The ""affordability crisis,"" whereby core goods and services such as child care and education and transportation and housing compel many households into deb, has also raised its ugly head.

If we want to continue to run the world on an economy based on ever-increasing consumption (which itself needs to be rethought in light of climate change and other pressures), our legislators need to do something about the fact that even as we're increasingly better educated as a society there are fewer and fewer ways to get paid.

And this has happened before!  Which is why we should consider the lessons of history and think seriously about the social and economic innovations that took place in the 1930s with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal.   

The W.P.A. employed millions.  And it not only put people back to work, it restored confidence and faith in a broken system; it restored trust in a deleted and outmoded social contract.  

The W.P.A. built schools and hospitals and recreation centers and government buildings -- all projects intended to have the greatest benefit for the rest of the economy -- what economists refer to as positive externalities.  Travel anywhere in the U.S., and you're bound to find enduring examples of the work of the W.P.A. -- buildings, trails, roads, bridges, dams, campgrounds, and civic infrastructure.

The W.P.A. also employed artists and writers and theater people and cultural anthropologists.  The W.P.A. put thousands to work on travel guides for the national parks.  

Through the Civilian Conservation Corps, hundreds of thousands of young men built campsites, trails and parks that still endure today.

As some commenters have indicated in response to other articles, many European countries have a direct link to each citizen’s bank account. This is how the brunt of the problem could have been avoided, at least on the $600 per week. There should have been a quick approval of unemployment set up through all employers providing a list of laid off employees and their socials to the IRS into a data base, which then should have been automatically matched up with the  bank account numbers.

It may have been for the few percent at the very top of the money chain who enjoyed the benefits of a dozen years of artificially low interest rates that propelled the stock bubble. And even when it looked like that bubble burst, the Fed came to the rescue again and essentially declared that it would do whatever it took to prop it up again. Thus we've had a 30% stock rally this month, the best single month in decades while the 30 million newly unemployed desperately wait for some help.

Surely, after some lengthy delay, many of them will receive UI benefits under the CARES Act.
 To qualify, you must certify that:

you are providing care to a family member with COVID-19
you have primary caregiving responsibility to a child that is unable to attend school due to COVID-19

you became a breadwinner after the head of your household has COVID-19
you had to quit your work as a result of Coronavirus, or
your work location was closed as a direct result of a COVID-19 public health emergency.

Before the pandemic, I had options, I was going to enroll in a state certification program for a back flow prevention valve inspector, every commercial and even some homes have a back flow prevention valve. But now, I have zero income, and zero options. It seems that there are governors that are forcing a binary choice for workers, either go back to work, or starve, go back to work, or be homeless, this shouldn’t be about life or death for just working people.

But I’m also supposed to risk bringing Covid-19 home, and infecting and killing my mother. Maybe some of these red state politician, or politicians in general, should put their money where their mouth is, and risk not only their lives but the lives of their families, and themselves.

First, it was only a week ago that my state (WA) got its computer systems upgraded to allow people like me - the self-employed - to apply for benefits at all. It's reportedly been very difficult to get through (though that's not entirely the state's fault - they are clearly trying to cope under massive volume). 

But secondly, and more importantly: like millions of other small business owners) I've applied through my bank for a [tiny!] PPP loan from the SBA. If I get it, I don't qualify for unemployment, which is completely fair. But I have no idea if my application is going to be approved - or if approved, whether it will be before or after the program's money has already run out again. If I apply for unemployment in the meantime, I run the risk of getting both, and having to go through the messy and legally-fraught exercise of trying to undo part or all of one of them. So I've elected not to try to apply for unemployment in the interim, until I can be sure.

And please, can we stop using the ""unemployment numbers"" as a meaningful indicator of how workers are doing? Even before the crisis these numbers didn't give a true picture of how badly workers are doing because they don't count anyone who has given up looking, or who has even a part time job, or a gig-job, or a tips/commission-only job, and these represent a substantial number of people who would love to hold a FT job that paid a living wage.

And now once again Congress has made sure to take care of the oligarchy and Corporate America while paying scant attention to the people who make the economy function - workers. a.k.a. consumers. Once again they have it backwards: you need to make sure consumers have money if you want corporations to profit. That seems to be a mystery to those in charge. But here's a clue: When you're heading towards a collision, reverse course."

People have been desperate for weeks now, and I fear, from the stresses and strains of it it, they might harm themselves (or others) if this unconscionable delay goes on much longer.

Now facing a far harder environment in which to find work, they've been completely forgotten by our federal and state governments. There is no aid for them.

2020-05-01 0:57,"Yes, our systems are showing, and will further show, their weakness.

My own area of knowledge is our health insurance system. Besides the well-publicized 9% of people who don't have health insurance (owing to 14 blue states not expanding Medicaid, as well as ACA defects like the ""subsidy cliff"" and ""family glitch""), there are yet other problems lurking.

Fairly unknown is that, in about 10 states, many blue ones such as MA, NJ, and MD, ACA expanded Medicaid ""coverage"", which is what people get from the ACA if their incomes are up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level, for people 55 or older, will get a person's medical bills paid for them now, but everything paid out is subject to Medicaid Estate Recovery.  

So, lots of people are being switch down to expanded Medicaid right now, as incomes drop.  (MA reports  11,600, here: <a href=""https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2020/04/29/coronavirus-layoffs-furloughs-prompt-45k-to-change.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2020/04/29/coronavirus-layoffs-furloughs-prompt-45k-to-change.html</a>)

Well, for many, who intend, like many of us, to pass on assets, kaboom!  That expanded Medicaid is a financial bomb.  They don't have insurance in any sense of the term.  They have, precisely, ""a loan until death for medical expenses"".  (And the false reassurance has kept them from getting real insurance.)

(For people interested in this bomb, only relevant in maybe 10 states, see the Wikipedia article on Medicaid estate recovery.  Wikipedia is not a reliable source in itself, but in this case, reliable references make everything verifiable.  )"

2020-05-01 1:17,"A Primer:  PUA vs. Regular State Unemployment Insurance (UI)                 

Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) is for the self employed, independent contractors, and others, i.e., basically those who file their own paperwork to establish income and taxes (less expenses).  While traditional regular state UI is for wage slaves (earnings reported on W-2s).  Regular state UI operates as an 84 year system which state's primarily administer under their own rules in accordance with basic federal oversight.

Regular state UI is designed to be difficult to navigate as a sop to employers who mostly pay the UI taxes; it always took weeks before the unemployed applicant received benefits, if deemed eligible; but the PUA program was rushed through with ground up computer programs laid atop the states' old UI systems.  However, PUA applicants with good tax records will have their claims processed in a couple of weeks!  Not only will PUA be processed faster than regular UI, those claims can be backdated two months further back than regular UI.  Many glitches with PUA  are due to applicants used to being the boss, and impatient, but just as incapable of following bureaucrats' confusing directions as wage slaves.   Between PUA and the pork barrel program known as the Paycheck Protect Program (PPP), in combination with the 2017 Tax Reform Act,  PUApers get less sympathy from me, than the wage slaves who have been abused by state UI offices for decades... because IT'S DESIGNED THAT WAY!"

Instead we should accept existing limitations, move forward with reform and begin the journey in developing a new economic system.  Slowly and prudently is fine, as long as we use our best minds.

A framework based on our best economical\social knowledge and starting with the best intentions: humans stand side by side as equals, regardless of class, local, and race.

Covid19 has demonstrated that bailouts and stimulus money is not the economic cure, it's a stop-gaps until our next crisis.  

Did we apply lessons learned from Katrina?  How did we look after the victims then and where are the victims in the economic spectrum now?  Everyone references the 2008 Financial Crisis but Katrina should be referenced.

But NOT for lack of money.  When I think of how much we spend to keep agencies going and staff in place I do wonder if government is EVER held accountable.

2020-05-01 14:05,"What the federal government should have done was guaranteed peoples paychecks without having to go to unemployment.  If you had a paycheck you would still continue to get it & medical from your employer.The Fed knew that a number of people applying would totally overwhelm state unemployment agencies & I think they wanted this so the number of claims paid would be less. Therefore, the unemployment numbers would not have been as bad as reported. the trump administration is obsessed with getting low numbers. Remember they didn't were pressuring states not to release numbers to the Fed. 

I think a lot of states are going back to work so they will reject people from receiving unemployment & thus their unemployment numbers decrease.

Has anyone noticed it's primarily the red states that are going back to work? Why? Because this is primary trump country where they want the president reelected.

The Fed should have paid firms directly without having to enact PPP- we know the money ran out early in this program & the Fed knew it would. But trump wanted to say he ""did"" something. For shame on this administration.

Another thing the Fed should do is make COBRA more affordable so the average person could afford it if they are laid off. Currently COBRA is cost prohibitive to many unemployed due to the extremely high premiums."

My daughter clocked more than 100 hours trying to speak to someone as she was having issues making it impossible to apply online. I didn't have as much trouble. However, I often wonder just why it is so difficult. I work in a business that may have 4 - 8 employers over the year. All are legal, huge businesses with HR departments, lawyers, etc. Why oh why do I need to tell UI where I have worked and how much I have made? All of my employment figures are calculated and sent to the state and federal government weekly by the huge payroll departments where I work. Why is it that UI can't pull up these numbers when I apply for benefits? Surely they have access to all sorts of personal information - especially income and employment figures! For god's sake - it would save countless hours, headaches and aggravation if all one had to do was make the initial claim (I'm unemployed) and send my benefits to this location.

Anyone employed is mostly still getting paid, but not spending as much on commuting costs, travel, restaurants, bars, gyms, etc. (but just as much on elective medical due to paying premiums, even if the medical providers are not booking income, the medical insurers are booking the income).   

So some of the lower GDP is discretionary loss from 30M unemployed, as non-discretionary still buffs the GDP.  That implies that those that are getting paid, are not spending (i.e., saving) and not immediately helping the GDP.  This is another adjustment, a lot of that savings will contribute to the GDP later-- after all, one can't safely travel, can't buy a car since they stopped making them (only weird dregs on the dealer lots now), maybe could buy a house if you have 50% down and 800 credit score...

Yes, many of our systems are getting their stress tests.

In our health insurance system, besides the well-publicized 9% of people who don't have health insurance (owing to 14 blue states not expanding Medicaid, as well as ACA defects like the ""subsidy cliff"" and ""family glitch""), there are yet other problems lurking.

Fairly unknown is that, in about 10 states, many blue ones such as MA, NJ, and MD, ACA expanded Medicaid ""coverage"", which is what people get from the ACA if their incomes are up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level, for people 55 or older, will get a person's medical bills paid for them now, but everything paid out is subject to Medicaid Estate Recovery.  

So, lots of people are being switch down to expanded Medicaid right now, as incomes drop.  (MA reports  11,600)

Let's think about this a moment, shall we?

Because what you're saying is ""the worst drop in economic output since World War II"" is a goal of the Trump administration, a desired outcome for the Republican party.

There is no other way to look at it.

Every move, every decision, every action of the Trump administration has been to make certain the middle class, the working class, the poor run out of money as quickly as possible and have no recourse to replace it.

The administration desires that rents and mortgages go unpaid, that restaurants and markets close, that take out stores and fast food franchises see vast reductions in volume.

How do we know this?

Because this administration chose to make endless trillions of dollars available to the least time-sensitive, least relevant part of our economy: large corporations and the rich.

As Trump tosses trillions over and over at the big boys he makes it as painful as humanly possible for individuals to apply (apply?!) for the money that would allow them to rescue our economy.

The one common factor among agencies and states is to prevent as many individuals as possible from receiving funds and to assure they receive as little as possible.

 Trump chose to ruin 66% of your economy to please his own prejudice and salve his ego."

One wonders if what is termed investor confidence is something closer to fools money, thrown down to net a temporary gain. Perhaps these are atypical investors? They certainly do not align with the talk I hear from even my brokers.

And you'd think we'd have learned after Enron, the Keating Five, the 2008-09 crash, Black Monday, etc. that that is no foundation on which to build social --not personal, social--stability.

In all of my reading on the 1918 pandemic, I've never come across much about the financial aftermath, but the very fact that it didn't demand attention suggests it was a relatively smooth reentry. My sense is that jobs hit a pause and then people went back to work. I want to find out more about that, but it seems very clear we will not have the same trajectory.  

Ironically, all of that braying about the new Flat Earth Economy will live up to its name...and flatten us. Roiling markets, compromised supplies, issues with delivery of goods, and the ongoing panic these mini-crises engender will ensure that this virus has a long half-life.

Our politicians unfortunately tend to displace the data with their optimistic expectations that soon all will be well. The stock market is an indication of expectations more than of present reality.

 But the real world eventually intrudes and the pandemic may prove insurmountable as it spoils too much of our  economy and too many of our jobs. The Fed cannot create money forever, nor the Federal government flood our world with stimulus indefinitely.  There is a limit to money inflation. If unrestrained it creates  damaging price inflation.
  I would hesitate to invest in the present market, although for a while it probably will not tank.

2020-04-30 22:47,"This is such an irresponsible framing of the stock rally.  It's not just the NYT that are doing this, but it's frustrating to see it echoed throughout the news outlets.

What the past few years, and especially the past couple months, have lighted is that news outlets don't know how to talk about market volatility.  If stocks go up 25% in a single month, it may be tempting to talk about it in glowing terms.  But if that increase only happened because the market fell 35% the month before, we shouldn't call that an unequivocal win.  Yes, it's better that the market rebounded than if it had continued to plummet, but that doesn't make it the ""best month since 1987"".  

What we have now is a lot of uncertainty.  Both large drops *and* large increases are a sign of this.  Stocks aren't *supposed* to move this rapidly, and it's a big problem that they are - it signals a lack of stability and an increased vulnerability of the market to news events and reckless enthusiasm (not to mention algorithmic trading).

The next time we have a month without 5+ percent daily swings in the Dow, then we can celebrate.  For now, let's try to keep these things in perspective."

There’s no acknowledgement of those workers possibly putting their lives on the line.

For example there is little to no positive correlation between low PMI (less than 50) and ensuing stock market returns (1 or 2 month returns).  Same with short term GDP shortfalls. 

The market is simply remaining hopeful that the stimulus and Fed asset purchase measures are adequate to mitigate large scale damage.  They may be wrong but at least that is why the market is rallying.  It is not due to some profit taking or ulterior motive.  It is because people think that asset prices of some really well placed companies with a lot of cash and investment have been beaten down.  So they are purchasing it.  Smart or not, only the next few months will tell. 

However, markets do reach a local bottom during any recessionary period and they mostly happen just before the recession ends.  Your guess, regarding why, is as good as mine.  And the current recession just started !"

1. You're member of the financial elite who can afford to hole up in a penthouse or an estate and have everything you need delivered to you while you enjoy your pool and your yacht; or

The epic loss in March was required for there to be a rebound in April, but there is still a massive loss since before the COVID-19 crisis began. That anyone would call this ""good"" is just foolish. It appears that there is a degree of volatility here that will go in any direction depending on the next shoe to drop. It is likely that when Florida and Georgia and midwestern states have runaway outbreaks after ""opening"" that this will trigger another massive drop.

I said to myself-boy am I glad I don't own any stocks-I only owned a heavy interest in real estate-but I felt that I was next in line. Sure enough in the next few months the real estate holdings hit rock bottom. I have the same feeling now-the market is just not acting logically.

The key question going forward will be will people return to buying things at stores and going out to perform activities that violate social distancing to spend money - eating in restaurants, going to the mall or the movies, etc.

Where the pandemic has been the worst people will be rightly scared to do this and demand will not return quickly.  Where people return to quickly to these activities there is likely to be a second wave of infections that either creates another lock down, or unofficially people will just do it on their own regardless.

Without this return of demand, the supply side will not sell as much, will not need to rehire as many workers, and those still out of work will not be spending any money keeping demand at a permanently lower level for a while.

That stock valuations are at a higher valuation on a P/E basis than they were before COVID19 implies no economic impact from the pandemic.  Which is magical thinking of the highest order or the part of Wall Street.  Everyone wants to believe in the V-recovery bounce back.  The market is pricing that in and then some.

That is not to say the next time a crisis occurs, people won’t step up, because they will, just as they have throughout history — but we are like immune systems — we as people kick in when we need to as a community or even as a country.

2020-04-28 12:12,"The Wisdom of Fools?

Last week researchers at one of the top virology centres in the world, the Pasteur Institute (discovered HIV), suggested a primary pathology of COVID was to disrupt the signalling between nerves and muscles effected by acetylcholine.

This would explain the suspected role of nicotine in mitigating the disease, as the primary receptors for acetylcholine are 'nicotinic' (so named because they are also targeted by nicotine - whence the attraction of tobacco).

In the early 60s, the coal tar derivative phenol was found to be effective in modifying acetylcholine nerve-muscle signalling, and phenol injections are standardly used to treat muscle spasm.

Phenol is the active ingredient in tar-derived Dettol, and complications associated with acetylcholine signalling, identified last week, are probably responsible for several primary severe complications of COVID.

The interaction of acetylcholine signalling and ACE2 receptors, to which Coronaviris binds in order to hijack cellular nucleic acid replication, is not fully understood, but central to COVID pathology, as explained in the new French paper.

So *don't try this at home*, but the suggestion of injecting a disinfectant is not actually *completely* crazy!

And by the way, the great philosopher Berkeley (after whom the university is named) claimed in 1744 that phenolic 'Tar Water', now known as Dettol, drunk in dilute quantities, was a universal panacea, especially useful in pulmonary diseases."

The Op-Ed piece doesn't say don't test. But it warns that the science behind the tests is still quite primitive. Many testing kits are shoddy.  Some give false positives, others false negative.

Even those that give reliable results offer a number that might be misleading. Depending on what stage we are at with a Corona infection our bodies may have more or fewer antibodies.

But the real problem with testing is that politicians will use them to make the policy decision to reduce restrictions or continue them.

The facts as we now them as of today tell us that the infection rate may have to get worse before it can get better. This means that as the disease spreads and infects more people herd immunity will occur.

The risk is that this is a new disease and it may not behave that way. And the other real risk is that while 80% of those affected recover and don't require special medical attention, about 20% will require hospitalization.

And within that 20% group the elderly and those with other health issues face an increased risk of dying from Covid-19.

The missing piece of this puzzle is how can we expand that 80% to maybe 90%? If we can collectively strengthen our immune systems this might happen.

If it does, it means our hospitals can cope with the 10%."

In April the administration, in particular Trump, whiffed on providing leadership and comfort to a frightened American public in the form of daily briefings instead focusing on attacking the media and blatantly lying on basically everything. ""If you want a test, you can get a test"".

2020-04-28 13:36,"As a former Georgia resident and someone who wants as many Georgians as possible to stay alive, I’ve been tracking what’s going on in Georgia with the testing. 

A big part of the problem is that the county public health departments lack the capacity to test as many people as needed. If your county can’t test you, you have to drive to a “Specimen Point of Collection” (SPOCs) for a swab. These are located in 42 out of 159 counties. Or pay for a commercial test.

The testing process is NOT simple, especially for a rural resident. While they claim the test is free to anyone showing a specific list of symptoms, “free” doesn’t account for this added hassle of driving to a SPOC.

Additionally, Georgia fails to disclose WHERE the tests have been administered. They update the total statewide tests every day, but which counties these tests have been administered in is anybody’s guess. 

On top of that, the number of tests run by commercial labs (as of yesterday at 12pm before they overhauled they website to make it even more difficult to get key data), was 117,758. The number run by the “free” Georgia Public Health Lab was 9,411. Huge discrepancy. Kemp falsely claimed yesterday that the GPL has run 32,000 tests. Nope. So they have stopped showing this statistic. Problem solved. 

12 counties with NO CHANGE since 4/20: Clay, Stewart, Schley, Irwin, Crawford, McIntosh, Quitman, Wheeler, Montgomery, Treutlen, Taliaferro, Glascock — Are they even being tested? WHO KNOWS!"

With the crisis still roaring, our primary task should not be on assigning blame, and in any case  hindsight is always 20/20.  Nonetheless, the question is well worth asking, and answering. In January, everyone’s eyes were focused elsewhere; specifically on the impeachment of President Trump. A strong case can be made that this was a distraction which seriously delayed recognition of the pandemic then brewing  in Wuhan.

It does appear that the liberal media played a major role in diverting attention away from the storm clouds gathering in China.  The progressive echo chamber devoted great attention to the  importance of impeachment.  A case can be made that as a consequence the media, the leadership of the House of Representatives, and the government as a whole, paid too little attention to other events in the world.

Perhaps the emphasis on impeachment was appropriate, but many of us believe it was overdone. Given the makeup of the Senate, the outcome was a foregone conclusion.  Also, President Trump will face the jury that matters come November.

2020-04-28 13:38,"Liberated from the negative-reality vibes of his healthcare professionals, Trump has been able to focus on his election winning coronavirus strategy. Downplay testing which will mask the extent of the rate of infection, and make the deficiencies in testing a state problem; rely on the demographics of the contagion which indicate that the virus is most lethal in congested cities,which melds perfectly with Trump’s blue state bashing; use Federal funds to support companies who will send in their CEOs to praise Trump (instead Dr.Fauci’s warnings that bury him.) 
Trump has always wanted to go the herd immunity route to save the economy first; if most of the casualties of this strategy are in blue state metropolitan areas, there is a political benefit.
Trump is hoping that the herd mentality of his flock will follow him to the polls in November, and that the virus and voter suppression will give him another Electoral College win. 
History has proven that Trump’s master plans don’t always work out as he dreamed; he bankrupted a casino empire taking lenders, investors, employees, contractors and suppliers with him. Trump’s pathological ego demands he fight for his survival....even if it means that we may die for his trying."

I'm not a medical professional; however, logic tells me that these official okays are dangerous -- very dangerous.

2020-04-28 14:00,"Because the CDC and FDA failed in early testing, we lost any chance of initial containment and essentially flew blindly into the Covid-19 storm.

Had we tested early and adequately we might have contained the virus to a limited region, with minimal impact to the economy.  In the absence of adequate testing, we have had to rely on the sledgehammer of social distancing and shelter in place in order to keep Covid-19 from overwhelming our health care system.

In order to safely come back to normal, we need a vaccine, successful treatments, and/or sufficient testing so that we can isolate, trace, and quarantine.   The vaccine and successful treatment are months in the future.  So our only alternative for safe reopening is testing, isolate, trace, and quarantine.  

No one thinks we are doing adequate testing currently.  No matter how many tests we have conducted to date, it is still not adequate.  It doesn’t matter that we have tested more people than other countries.  We are still way behind where we should be.

If safe reopening is what is needed to bring the economy back, then it seems that the Federal and state governments’ number 1 priority should be testing.   Both groups should be working in tandem to ramp up testing.  Instead, it seems that Trump wants to  sit back and watch the governors fight each other, FEMA, and other countries for needed supplies.

Since school aged kids are the most likely 1) to have mild disease that will remain unrecognized meaning they will go to school sick and contagious and 2) the most likely to share foods, toys, saliva and snot with each other, sending kids to school is the worst thing any state can do during the COVID pandemic--unless the goal is to spread the disease quickly."

2020-04-28 14:04,"There are two kinds of testing. 

Testing those who have symptoms tells you about those individual patients, but it doesn't tell you about how the virus moves through the population.

To understand how the virus moves through the population, you need random samples that are representative of the whole population, and subgroups of the population (by geography, sex, age, race, ethnicity).
Those with symptoms are not a random sample that represents the population, because most of the population does not have symptoms.

It may be that we are all already infected, or that only those with symptoms are infected, or somewhere in between, but without randomized tests designed to represent the entire population, we can't know that.

Trump and the Republican Party are refusing to do the random representative testing that is NECESSARY to safely reopen the economy. They are too busy using this disaster (which Trump let spin out of control by calling it a hoax) to give corporations they have shares hundreds of millions of dollars, and firing Inspector Generals, to spend a few million on good testing for enough people to understand the threat.

What better way for Republicans to crush voter turnout than to  let a virus spin out of control?

We are flying blind through uncharted mountains because Trump and his party refuse to turn on the radar.

Instead, there appear to be two driving forces behind most of his actions during this crisis that filter through his narcissism:  (1) his obvious inability to reason and analyze in any meaningful way -- or put less politely, his shocking lack of brain power; and (2) his fear of powerful Republicans.  On the latter point, although the press reports Trump to be in complete control of the Republican Party, in reality the situation is more subtle.  Trump knows that the political support actually keeping him in power (the support from GOP leaders, not from his rabid base) would evaporate if he departed from Republican orthodoxy -- i.e., (1) the unwavering desire to drown the federal government in the bathtub rather than show that the federal government is best equipped to handle national crises, and (2) tax cuts and other means of slurping down money from our treasury to feed the rich."

Otherwise all the pain and suffering would have been in vain. We can re-start our “economy” exactly as it was when we stopped or we can make use of our imagination, intellect, ingenuity to start a different “economy” that will be much more strong should a new catastrophic situation arise in the future. One way to put very rapidly large numbers of people to work would be to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. That not only will create needed, profitable businesses, and therefore well paid jobs, but also improve our quality of life with cleaner air, safer water, etc. which in turn should enhance our health and our resistance to these “invisible enemies” like the one that forced us into the current situation.

“Austria has been gaining experience in the economic easing of lockdown for two weeks. It is  confident.”

“The Austrian experience  shows that the opening works. According to the Green Minister of Health, Anschober, the number of infections has not increased. The so-called number of reproductions in Austria is still well below 1 - namely 0.6.  This prevents a second wave for the time being”

Rest assured, the gang that can't shoot straight is on the job. They botched the response to the virus and the virus testing. And they are botching the economic aid to the small business victims of their botched virus debacle. Big, publicly traded companies like AutoNation and Penske took the money. (Which is a grant so long as they put it for a proper use, e.g., salaries.) Many banks gave the money only to their own privileged customers. Big hotel and restaurant chains like Shake Shack took the money. Doctors in surprising numbers took the money. And we might never know the half of it, since the information is secret and so far we only know about the companies that have told us they took then returned the money. Moreover, the process was marred by technical glitches, the loan site went down completely yesterday, and Mnuchin's Treasury Department has by all accounts given little guidance to banks and borrowers as to who is eligible.

They’re now about living in a 19th century alternate reality where science is just an opinion. This is why smart millennials don’t like you. Science is not an opinion. Never has been, never will be! It’s cold hard fact. If you don’t like a  cold hard fact, you can’t change it. You can only lie about it or try to hide it. Don’t you realize that we see what you’re doing?

The fact that you cannot accept that science is fact is why we are where we are today with the testing. Science shouldn’t be political. It’s not political in Great Britain or anywhere else conservatives have power. So I really hope that just ONE smart conservative will stand up and demand that we follow the science. Science should not be a wedge issue. Lives are at stake!"

Trump has failed as a national leader.  He could have responded quicker and gotten tests, PPEs and all the equipment hospitals and first responders needed, but he didn't.   Now it is coming slowly, and for many too late. 

Trump pretends that the states are in charge of their programs and that is why he didn't need to act, but what about the military.  Who was in Commander in Chief when the military couldn't get the equipment and supplies they needed?  Where was he when the military ran short of masks, and equipment?

Yet, she has always been optimistic about our (the People's) ability to win control of the country from them again in spite of how dispiriting and dire our circumstances feel right now. It's energy we need in leadership to buck up and fight back at the ballot box to rid ourselves of this ineptitude and cruelty we're living under currently.

This is an assumption given that Florida was getting requests for PPE filled 100% within days, while Michigan, NY, Illinois and others were getting 5% to 20% of their requests filled.

*Executive order to 'fix' food supply chain by removing liability from meat packing plants (think Tyson, Smithfield) so that they can order vulnerable, mostly immigrant and refugee workers to work without adequate protection and without responsibility for their welfare. The hot spots in Iowa, 100s of new cases each day, are centered in and around meat processing plants.

2020-04-28 18:06,"If a person dies from a heart attack consequent to COVID-19, some places will record the cause as COVID-19 and some as a heart attack. While true with foreign stats, it's also true here.

Statistics for confirmed cases of COVID-19 are highly dependent on the very varying numbers of tests in different states and communities. Consequently, one would think the most relevant statistic available for comparison purposes would be the deaths per number of residents. However, if you look at the state by state comparisons, some seem to make no sense, inasmuch as states with significant numbers of cases and/or deaths have very different fatality rates.

Different states and different localities use different criteria for attributing cause of death. I expect politics as much as medical protocols play a significant role. Responsibility, accountability, and image undoubtedly are factored in to states' reporting of deaths. Is it coincidence that, even pulling out the sparsely populated high plans and mountain states, you still pretty much see the states with Democratic governors reporting higher death rates than states with Republican governors?

For instance, Florida with 1088 deaths has a fatality rate of 5/100,00 while Louisiana with 1740 deaths has a fatality rate of 37/100,000. Texas with 666 deaths reports a fatality rate of 2/100,000 while Connecticut with 2012 deaths has a fatality rate of 56/100,000.

2020-04-28 19:03,"One-million diagnosed cases in the U.S.

Let's look at that number and do some back-of-the-envelope calculations:

It was reported last week that in NYC there was an estimated 10,000 unconfirmed cases by the time the first case was confirmed.  A 10,000/1 ratio of unconfirmed to confirmed cases.

Let's discount that ratio by a whopping 90%, due to the ""crowded"" NYC setting and some more testing, and assume that the ratio is more like 500/1 country-wide.

That would translate 1M currently confirmed cases into 500M unconfirmed cases.

And at a death rate of 2-5% of the cases, that will eventually translate into 10-25 million deaths due to Covid19.

But here's the rub -- ""only"" 20,000 - 50,000 will be ""official"" deaths based on the ""confirmed"" number of 1M cases.

Any question why Trump and the Republican governors are resisting more massive testing?"
2020-04-28 19:08,"From Massachusetts:  I feel for the governor, Charlie Baker, who just had to act to close non-essential businesses for another 3 weeks.

According to the Globe, he just created an advisory board on reopening.  It has a lot of business executives, a few people from municipal governments, and a few medical people.  (I, myself would have hoped to see some economists, judging them to be the most equipped to understand the whole problem.)

Otherwise, we'll have here the usual problems from the complexity of our health insurance system, on a multiplied scale.

The state has reported switching tens of thousands of people from employer plans and ACA on-exchange plans down to expanded Medicaid.  (The latter is what people get under the ACA if their incomes are under 138% of the Federal Poverty Level.)

The switch will cause numerous people to have to re-explore provider networks, and perhaps change providers.

And, I note that people who are downswitched to expanded Medicaid, if they are 55 or older,  will be getting, probably unknown to them, a financial bomb.  Medical bills will be payed for them now, but under MA law, their estates will have to pay it all back.  They don't have insurance--they have a loan until death for medical expenses!

(This is the situation with expanded Medicaid in many states, but not all.  If interested, see the Wikipedia article on Medicaid estate recovery.  Wikipedia is not a reliable source in itself, but tracing refs shows the information is sound.)"

In just 11 weeks and 5 days we're already at 57,862 deaths and will pass Vietnam either tonight or tomorrow.

Of course I'm being sardonic.  It's INSANE that this do-nothing and do-worse-than-nothing President has allowed 58,000 Americans to die in 3 months because he played favorites, PR games, bragged, attacked, stole critical supplies for ""warehousing"", and pitted the states against each other, favoring those with governors that didn't confront him with facts.

At this rate (and I'm sure the positive rate much higher), death per infection in US is .05 % and we now have ample evidence that this virus is killing the most sick and elderly among us, which is exactly what nature has done for millenia.

Meanwhile, we willingly accept about 10% plus death rate among humans due to diet, environment violence, gun violence, pollution, farming & fishing practices, pollutants to our food stream, killing of the planet, killing of each other due to simple ""otherness"", killing of environment due to comfort, wealth and the chemicals we use to develop and use weapons of destruction of our ""enemies"" and to ""farm"", meanwhile, not only killing ourselves, but our one planet as well.

There is truth to the fact that our children are spoilt and self entitled who go running to helicoptering mommy and daddy for everything. 
Well, our children are learning the hardest lesson life has to teach. Sometimes things are out of our control. Sometimes our future plans are shattered and the course of our lives changed forever and there is nothing we can do about it. There 
is no choice and no one to blame. 
As traumatizing as this will be for them, it’s a necessary life skill easier borne when younger. My hope is that some of them (likely the privileged) will sit back at 40 and say, “I’m glad I learned that lesson young. It has served me well.” 

But they can’t get there by themselves. They shouldn’t have to. The parents of the world, the adults need to step in. 
Put the belligerent toddler in the White House in a time out.

2020-04-28 18:15,"If a person dies from a heart attack consequent to COVID-19, some places will record the cause as COVID-19 and some as a heart attack. While true with foreign stats, it's also true here.

Statistics for confirmed cases of COVID-19 are highly dependent on the very varying numbers of tests in different states and communities. Consequently, one would think the most relevant statistic available for comparison purposes would be the deaths per number of residents. However, if you look at the state by state comparisons, some seem to make no sense, inasmuch as states with significant numbers of cases and/or deaths have very different fatality rates.

Different states and different localities use different criteria for attributing cause of death. I expect politics as much as medical protocols play a significant role. Responsibility, accountability, and image undoubtedly are factored in to states' reporting of deaths. Is it coincidence that, even pulling out the sparsely populated high plans and mountain states, you still pretty much see the states with Democratic governors reporting higher death rates than states with Republican governors?

For instance, Florida with 1088 deaths has a fatality rate of 5/100,00 while Louisiana with 1740 deaths has a fatality rate of 37/100,000. Texas with 666 deaths reports a fatality rate of 2/100,000 while Connecticut with 2012 deaths has a fatality rate of 56/100,000. These differences cannot simply be attributed to a difference in medical care."

So. What do you do? What do you tell the family with bare cupboards? What do you say to the small-business owner facing the end of a business that supports herself and a dozen other families? What do you tell people in regions of the country, not all rural and remote, where case numbers have been consistently and demonstrably low? How do you show compassion in a pandemic with strong variances in infection?"

The fact remains that very few healthy people died and most of those who did die had another major condition (immunocompromised, respiratory ailment, kidney disease, heart disease, obesity, diabetes, lung disease, liver disease, etc.).

I don’t think we have sunk to this point without Trump’s help.  First, his own values have been consistently pointing to risking our health to protect the stock market and his own re-election.  Second, Trump fans reflexively define their goals down to whatever it is that Trump is trying to do, which in this case is nothing but blaming others and letting it happen."

Trump can sign an order, but it will be unenforceable in court.  Immunity is only accomplished through legislation.  Moreover, it might be split, with Congress (federal) declaring immunity for industries engaged in interstate commerce, and the states addressing local businesses. 

While it would sound good to businesses scared to open, how would you feel about businesses which engage in gross negligence--Are you OK with a restaurant with workers not using face masks and allowing sick employees to work while cooking having immunity?"
2020-04-28 19:48,"The new, post-Coronavirus Pandemic of 2020 America must be a socially responsible one. Our government and our economy must prioritize social responsibility and make it a top consideration in every decision that must be made. The economic inequality gaps must be closed for the good of all Americans as impoverishment causes severe social and economic problems for all of us. Our government must work together with the private and public sectors of our economy to facilitate livable wages and income support. If America believes in capitalism, it must develop a form that is realistic. The only way to save capitalism and truly create a broadly prosperous America that is true to the ideals set forth in our Constitution is to ensure that every American has enough money to live a happy life and cease from being a potentially expensive and hazardous burden to our society. It’s about the money, stupid."

And if our workers make you sick, because we can't test them, that's not our problem, so the government better gives us special dispense or we shut down our plants etc. until you guys can count your rips in a mirror...""

That's the game that's currently on the field, together with A LOT of other games. 

It's no wonder the SBA computers crash. After the last ""stimulus"" ran out within days everybody is trying to be first in line. And that's the criteria if your business dies or survives? Some pacing and queuing mechanism in some computer code?

It's also amazing how many people suddenly need a helping hand. Mnuchin was miffed about the Lakers applying for help, and rightly so. But EVERY business and interest group in the U.S. is currently looking the get theirs. ""Hey guys, look! Trump and the GOP are in trouble and throwing money from the heavens in order to buy the election! Get an umbrella, quick, and hold it upside down!"".

I also have a request:  please add the number of new tests conducted per 100,000 residents for each week to your reports and overviews.  A lot of the information of ""new cases"" is potentially misleading, as that frequently just reflects how much or how little testing is done.  I also hope that steady reporting on this helps to hold our elected officials to account.  Without sufficient testing, we continue to fly blind on decisions such as reopening businesses or schools."

His need to open businesses and schools without knowing the full extent of this spread is both reckless and extremely dangerous to all students and employees who do not have the luxuries that he, his family, his wealthy friends, and donors enjoy the question needing to be asked is why? why so soon, why now. yes, no one can stay isolated forever, but when you see the number of cases increasing and you see that the Trump Administration has not provided adequate testing, Personal Care Equipment to the States when you see him spewing damaging remedies and propaganda who and what is really behind this.

One of the frustrations of You Tube is that the date of the presented segment is always put in terms of the uploading date, and usually not the date the clip was made. In recent weeks I find myself sadly ascertaining the date of the segment by looking at the death count. If I see 48000 deaths, I think oh that Maddow show was about 5 days ago. That is what it tragically has come to. I am outraged by the number of deaths but as with everything during the Trump era, I sense some people are getting desensitised to how appalling it is. It seems that no matter how tragic it is, there is a tendency for it to be normalised, as has been happening since Trump's election. It disgusts me. Go back a few years and visualise how 57,000 American deaths would have looked under Obama, Bush or Clinton. It would have been unthinkable.

As if the massive public subsidies to perhaps the most despicable, gruesome industry on earth were not enough, now the president wants to distort the market even further, calling this ""essential infrastructure"". ""Essential"" - people that don't consume animal products not only not die, but also tend to be healthier.

This is an industry that lives off the lack of widespread knowledge about its treatment of animals (blatant euphemisms such as ""humane"" and ""ethical"" treatment/killing of animals), heavy pollution, huge emissions and the links between factory farming and higher likelihood of pandemics and antibiotic resistance.

In a twist of irony, the administration is now running an industrial policy, as if I needed a paternalistic state to define what is ""essential"" and to tell me that out tax money should go to an industry whose ""technology"" to ""produce"" food hasn't been updated in centuries (raising and killing animals).

Concentration and the labor intensive nature of this work (cutting carcasses, gutting, deboning) is a competitive disadvantage in covid times vs companies such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, which invest in innovation and have a small fraction of the environmental impact and resources.
Let meat production slow, the meat price go up and the market decide which companies survive. This administration only believes in the markets when it doesn't affect its voter base."

(The CDC estimates flu killed 61,000 during the 2017 to 2018 season.)  

The CDC’s hard count, which is based not on estimates but death certificates, attributes 31,587 of the 693,128 deaths that have been reported to the CDC’s National Center for Heath Statistics since the COVID-19 outbreak began, so the virus accounted for about 4.5 percent of deaths. 

The initial projections were that COVID-19 would kill 100,000 to 240,000 Americans, provided mitigation efforts were successful . If total COVID-19 deaths fall within that range, mitigation   efforts will have to deem successful. If COVID-19 kills fewer than 100,000 Americans, mitigation efforts will have to be judged highly successful.

More significant than the moving the goal posts is the first admission that the issue isn't the virus coming back. “In my mind, it’s inevitable that we will have a return of the virus, or maybe even that it never went away,” Dr. Fauci said. 

It isn't going away. Further, this whole concept of reopening when the curve is downward for two weeks is absurd. The risk isn't gone because NY now may only have 5,000 new cases versus 10,000. The risk is that there may still thousands in the NYC area who are still contagious, even if that is less than it was two weeks ago. This whole pandemic started from a patient zero.

But...he said, over and over...he and his cronies said things were under control...nearly airtight...(which by the way isn't a thing, near airtight, is NOT airtight!)

He may wish they would open as would many parents and children but he will never put their lives at risk.  If it is too dangerous, the schools will remain closed and the children can continue to do remote learning.  Hopefully, the schools will be ready to open for the 2020/2021 year.  By then, the pandemic should have been curtailed and the cases considerably lower."

Millions of people who've been told to stay-at-home because they are ""non-essential"" workers are unhappy because they cannot go to work.

Meanwhile, millions of ""essential workers"" who've been told to report to work are also unhappy because they cannot stay-at-home.

It's appears that the only commonality here is that the American people are simply ""unhappy"".

I have wild guesses why this is -- but no data to support it.  So it's just an observation.

We have heard that the biggest epidemic of our age is wide-spread depression.  Perhaps Covid-19 is further revealing this fact to us?"

Well...

I'm no doctor, but I read reports from South Korea that a certain percentage of people, who had been tested negative,  caught the virus again within days or weeks. That's bad!

If there is no long-lasting natural immunity there can be - IMHO - no long-lasting artificial immunity, no vaccine.

But we're actually used to that. There is no vaccine for HIV/AIDS, for example, either. Modern medicine has made AIDS survivable (although still miserable), which is a huge relieve for those affected. And one day there may be a vaccine, hopefully. But it's tough.

Even tougher is a virus much closer to Corona: the common cold! During one of the Apollo missions (I believe it was 14) one of the astronauts developed the symptoms and was VERY unhappy (Ground Control had to reign him in several times). Yet here we are, 45 years or so later, and STILL no vaccine for the common cold!

I wish somebody could explain this fact to Trump: You can wish and pray and hope and talk all you want - sometimes it just doesn't happen. It's called life. Deal with it!

Maybe then he would be able to do his job in the way the American people want him to do it. But I doubt it. You can't talk to ideologues, they never listen, they never learn, they got their mind set up and if you confront them with the truth you become their ""enemy"".

He says he is tested all the time, but the test only says he didn’t have it at the time of the test, not that he wasn’t carrying it today. 

Personally, I’d say the photo op would have been better with him wearing on. It would convey that he sees himself as in it with us all.

It is ridiculous that living in Silicon Valley, the schools here have a singularly poor presence and infrastructure online. I don’t see a lack of material online. And there is some fantastic stuff for those in school districts that are financially less supported. Perhaps online is the best way to equalize the playing field for all public students. Best to utilize this time to get input from teachers and have them get comfortable with online resources. 
Schools need to be reconfigured. The bathrooms need no touch faucets and flushes. PE needs to be scrapped altogether. For those who play in sports, they just need more patience. And really, from shelter-in to let’s get 3000 kids together? This when everyone knows no medicine or vaccine is forthcoming by July. Stop scaring parents.

I know someone who works at a bank and was forced to work overtime on evenings and weekends without extra pay to process the applications. So the companies and the banks both were in on the conspiracy to defraud small businesses.

Also, the people currently in federal “leadership” positions didn’t live through the Great Depression, when circumstances overwhelmed local and state resources and a federal response was required. They clearly didn’t listen during history class and their parents were too well off to have suffered personally, so their was no wisdom to pass along.

Yes, they are having problems with already dying people in nursing homes. But everybody else is out and about, eating in restaurants and drinking in bars. And they are well on the way to herd immunity. Other places like the Czech Republic are heading that way. 

The right thing for the USA to do is quarantine the New York and Chicago metro areas, and perhaps a few others, and to a great extent open up the rest of the country. Start up professional sports like golf and baseball, just with limits on how many people are in stadiums; in the biggest cities with the big problems, that means at least for while, zero.  Restart things like NASCAR. Do set some limits on density in restaurants.

In Los Angeles, the homeless population has been leaving temporary shelters and are back on the streets again. In much of small-town and rural America, people are still on the upward trajectory of the curve even as their state authorities are dead-set on loosening restrictions.

As things are now, Americans are going to have to brace for an unprecedented wave of physical segregation between people of means and people without. People of means will not take public transit if it means that you're risking your life. Will middle-class families allow their children to go back to public schools with children whose parents work low-wage yet high-risk jobs? As disturbing as it is, I think we will look back to 2019 as the time when we had the least amount of class-based segregation. Going forward, in a country without universal health- and mental-care and without the right to housing and with 20 to 30 percent unemployment, we are seriously on the verge of dystopic reality between gated citadels and dispossessed masses."

Another thing to pay attention to with the tracking is you will notice Sundays and Mondays usually being a lighter count.  And then Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays being far heavier.  I think that might have something to do with reporting staff being off over the weekends - And then scrambling over Mondays to catch up the reporting of these substantial increases.

This is a bad disease and there is no cure except the prudent plan of distancing.   What part of this don't people get?  This thing will kill you or someone you love dead.  Now grow the heck up.

For instance, if, as Gov. Andrew Cuomo suggested earlier today, around 30% of New Yorkers already have COVID-19 antibodies in their blood, should New York State not also mount, concurrent with its antibodies testing drive, a massive blood drive from those New Yorkers tested positive for the antibodies but healthy enough for blood donation? The collected convalescent plasmas can be transfused to treat patients suffering serious cases of COVID-19, and the various antibodies to be collected from the plasma drive can screened, catalogued and analyzed to assist in the development of other potential treatments and/or vaccines. Given how seriously this virus has affected New York and that 30% of New Yorkers would mean millions of potential donors, perhaps thousands or tens of thousands would volunteer for such a drive, thus vastly increasing the supplies of convalescent plasma in our hospitals and potential sources of helpful antibodies."

I keep in mind Governor Cuomo's point about not doing a post-game analysis during half-time.

Via the lockdown we have so far been successful to a considerable degree in ""flattening the curve"" from what were the dire forecasts of eight weeks ago.  

Those forecasts were predicated on the presumption we did nothing and thus enabled the contagion to spread uninhibited.

But we did so something.  We locked down.  We avoided partaking in congregating activities and adopted social distancing.  Many of us donned masks when in public and some even took to wearing disposable gloves etc.

Now, however, we seem to want to celebrate this initial success by returning to the lifestyles we were leading before hand.

But the stark reality is that the coronavirus remains out there.  It has not mutated into being ineffective.  We have not found a ""cure"" for those who get infected.  And we have not developed a vaccine to inoculate those who haven't yet been infected.

It's an undeniable fact that if we lift all restrictions and re-open unwisely, we will create the very environment upon which the virus thrives.

I imagine there's a way we could wisely do a partial re-open.  But doing so would require mature leadership that would heed expert advice.

No mask, on the other hand, suggests a lack of concern and, hence, strength. A Trump supporter might reconcile the cognitive dissonance of a CDC advisory as egghead scientists being overly cautious.

2020-04-29 0:42,"By ordering all meat plants to stay open regardless of any Covid findings Trump has cast suspicion on all of them.

We know that some meat plants have been found to have a number of employees who have tested positive for Covid-19.  This has already led to many consumers now avoiding meat purchases.  

In addition, due to restaurant and other food vendor closures, overall meat purchasing had plummeted.  This, in turn, has now led to herd culling as growers experience plummeting demand for beef, pork and poultry.

Now Trump's Order insisting that all meat processing plants remain open leads consumers to fear that any meat they purchase may be infected.

An intelligent POTUS instead, would have ordered the USDA meat inspectors to redouble their inspections and immediately close any plant with a high employee contagion rate.

This would have had the effect of strengthening consumer confidence that any meat making it to the end buyer market was therefore safe.

I cannot fathom why Trump is doing what he's doing.  It makes no realistic sense.  It seems driven by an ideological hatred for critical government services such as USDA meat inspection.  

But the real effect will now be to cripple the meat industry that the USDA fosters via its inspections.

This Order is bad science and bad market economics.

We are in the middle of a viral pandemic. Plentiful PPE is absolutely essential. Meat might be nice, if you're a meat-eater (I'm personally not, but I get that some people are), but it's not essential.

Even if restrictions are lifted, they will be lifts slowly, with people hesitant to go back to normal and with reemergence of the virus and going back on lockdown.  It would be one thing if the federal government guaranteed salaries and housing until coronavirus had truly passed, but instead they went for the $1200 a month and the rest of the stimulus, which was a mere drop in the bucket.    The grand plan of the commentators and well-educated is to have mass testing, but not only do we have testing on that scale, I don't think we even have the resources for testing hundreds of millions of people on a regular basis.  Even if we did, the tests are not perfectly accurate.  It seems that the only plan for the moment is to be on lockdown indefinitely, see how things go, and expect people to stay on lockdown with no real support.

It's time we realize that for the moment, normal is gone.  Really gone.  It will be gone for months.  And we need a real plan to manage that.  Because indefinite lockdown or mass testing or the many other non-plan plans don't work.  Not beyond a month."

What a joke.

When I watch Trump's responses to questions in TV interviews, again and again I wonder why anyone bothers to ask him anything.  He never takes any action for getting tests, masks, support for hospitals and health care workers.  He has nothing to offer but uninformed opinions and empty promises.

They are willing to put people at risk so Tyson and Smythfield and other meat companies can make a buck. But their workers can’t even slow down enough on the line to cover their mouths and noses when they cough or sneeze.

There was no plan for that either. You might recall the more recent  Executive Order banning Chinese citizens from entering the country? No plan led to at least 40,000 Chinese entering the country after the order was put in place. 

Recognizing those past goof-ups, I'd like to make sure that no shortcuts are made in processing the food that comes to my table. Further, I'd like to know that no plant employee is put in harm's way because no plan accompanies your order."
2020-04-29 4:12,"'In an executive order, Mr. Trump said recent closures of meat processing facilities “threaten the continued functioning of the national meat and poultry supply chain..'
Only because he needs his daily Quarter Pounder and fries."
2020-04-29 3:47,"A little research on Open Secrets disclosed that, for the 2020 election cycle, Tyson Foods has donated $82,884 to Republicans, accounting for 67.66% of the company's donations. 

From 2000 through 2012, Smithfield Foods' donations vastly favored Republicans. Smithfield Foods operates the Sioux Falls plant where over 800 people have tested positive for COVID-19.

Since 2013, Smithfield Foods is a wholly owned subsidiary of WH Group, a Chinese company formerly known as Shuanghui Group."

2020-04-29 4:45,"If this virus does anything of value, it will be to galvanize 
the notion we're all in this together. Except we're not.
The very rich are not in this with the rest of America.
Americans not rich need to realize their needs are their neighbors needs regardless of their color, religion, country of origin.
We are not each other's enemy as hate radio and Fox and Trump and republicans need us to believe. The virus pays no attention to political party, skin color, religious orientation. Neither should we."
2020-04-29 5:32,I am so ashamed of the USA right now. Trump's latest statement about Meat Packing Plants is unconscionable. People's lives are at stake. He needs to fix the problem not force people to risk their lives for Meat. No one needs meat that badly. And for goodness sakes pay the workers who choose to stay home Unemployment!
2020-04-29 5:52,How is this getting better in the US? Let me guess the stock market is rallying. Really the US is just plateauing and now we are re-opening.
2020-04-29 5:48,"Ahh yes… the delusional bubble that most of us have been living in just went  POOF!  Such is the way of things.

2020-04-29 7:26,"Why cannot people understand after six weeks of continuous repetition. This is a novel virus and because there is only sparse and biased sampling is largely moving and spreading out of any systematic means to detect. We are guessing and because we cannot acquire good enough data the wave will have waxed and waned still barely recorded. In the fall, we could still be unaware of what is going on until the hospitals start filling up."
2020-04-29 7:52,"Due to heavy lobbying pressure from various multi-million dollar sectors which stand to lose ""bigly"" if the accurate death toll is uncovered, the COVID-19 death toll in nursing homes or long term assisted living facilities is currently UNDER COUNTED. GOP states, in particular, with over-represented populations of senior citizens (e.g. Florida, Arizona, Georgia, Alabama, etc.) are hiding behind HIPAA laws to avoid disclosing the exact number of elderly people's deaths in their states. This leaves states like Florida to boast about their supposed success stories in containing COVID-19 through their (hard to believe) low statistics. It will take extraordinary pressure from Democratic leaders, journalists and legal experts to coerce the GOP governors to release accurate death toll numbers to the public in order for the nation's citizenry to truly understand the magnitude of the threat of COVID-19 to the entire population, especially in red states that are advising businesses and public services to open back up prematurely before statistical data supports their leadership decisions on the public's future health."
2020-04-29 7:37,"I do not really know why Trump (or Cuomo) complain about not being warned adequately. I seem to recall that the administration was warned repeatedly in January and February by experts. They dismissed the warnings and called them alarmist. Do not let them rewrite history. This is actually personally painful for me because I have written here against stay at home policies myself when I did not yet understand what kind of virus we are dealing with, partly due to the mixture of confusion and misinformation out there in the public discourse. I am man enough to admit that I was wrong. Trump is not and nor are his supporters."
2020-04-29 8:07,"So the stable genius is helping his fellow entrepreneurs by forcing the meat packing workers to endanger their lives and that of their families. He is protecting the owners from future lawsuits. Yet he hasn’t mandated that other companies making PPE. I wonder which business is more profitable. 

Oh and BTW I for one am not going to be buying any meat in the near future. How can anyone guarantee that meat being prepared by infected workers is fine for the consumers to eat without getting sick?"
2020-04-29 6:05,I guess it is time to STOP CONSUMING MEAT - another reason to go vegan.
2020-04-29 7:52,"I'm wondering how deaths from the seasonal flu and pneumonia are differentiated from deaths that are definitively shown to be caused by COVID 19. I also wonder how our inability to test as widely as needed impedes our understanding of the extent of the virus in the general population. 
Hindsight is 2020, but I especially wonder how much better we could have addressed this pandemic had not Trump eliminated the pandemic response team. But, of course, he ""takes no responsibility."" Pathetic. 
Thank you healthcare workers. I hope one result of this tragedy will be for us to better appreciate and compensate our front-line healthcare professionals."
2020-04-29 8:51,An ironic side effect of this pandemic could be the planet’s and the people’s overall health could have improved - less meat consumption and less carbon waste produced.  Perhaps we should think about a one month stay-at-home every year except for essential but minimal production.
2020-04-29 8:49,"the headline to this story suggests just how little we really know about this disease, how it works and it's after effects. schools are closed for a reason, our children are precious and need to be protected, the malls will be there when we get back, sports isn't going to go away. what good is opening these venues if there aren't people to support them. the meat packing plants are closed because most of the workers are too sick with this thing to work. i'm not sure what trump thinks he's trying to accomplish by forcing them to re open without testing or protective equipment, workers won't return until it's safe, neither will the consumers.  maybe he thinks the cows will process themselves."
2020-04-29 9:19,So President Trump has decided to use the DPA to force Meat Processing plants to stay open. Sounds great. One minor detail though. WHO is going to replace the workers that are infected with Covid-19? Do you think that companies like Tyson want to close their operations? Of course they don't. If they had enough qualified workers they'd stay open.
2020-04-29 8:46,"Trump uses his position to force workers in the meat industry to work in unsafe conditions. 

Trump's campaign is primarily a populist ticket because he claims to understand and empathize with the 'little guy.'

And his supporters don't see that disconnect?"
2020-04-29 9:23,"Isn't the reality that because this is a novel virus, even the best experts could not have known (or made any viable predictions) so they really did not know anything until data began being gathered? 

My guess is that many of the early ""facts"" and ""expert predictions"" will be proven right and/or wrong and we will only have any kind of real understanding in the months/years to come. 

Speculation can have serious side effects too. The worst one being immobilising fear.

A little honest humility and doing the only things everyone knows work against the spread of any virus (hand washing and not touching one's face), with or without confinement, might be better for the time being. No?"
2020-04-29 9:18,Factory slaughterhouses are cauldrons of disease and the world needs to redefine its relationship with eating meat. Animal agriculture is ruining the planet and vegan diets are on the rise for a variety of positive reasons. There are better ways to get protein despite Trump’s proclamations.
2020-04-29 6:08,"People are ignoring symptoms such as chest pains or internal bleeding, and not going to Hospital because they are scared of catching Covid in the UK.  The same seems to be happening in the USA, although they are also probably avoiding the Hospital because they lost their job and cannot afford medical care in the world's greatest country."
2020-04-29 8:29,"Meat per se isn't critical. Food is generally. To single out meat processors is typical Trump. I'm sure he has well-heeled donors among members of his clubs, etc.... oh wait... it's obvious... he does.

This would actually be a great time to reduce meat consumption which uses a tremendous amount of damage to the environment. Not to mention suffering of animals."
2020-04-29 8:22,"The forced reopening of meat-packing plants is merely the latest chapter in a book that Upton Sinclair could still be writing.  Hard times reveal the best and the worst in people, and Trump is failing all of us.  

Nobody wants perishables processed in a plant whose oversight has been - you should excuse the expression -  gutted by decades of Republican hostility to anything that protects us from corporate greed.  I predict an epidemic of vegetarianism.

And greed it is. Nobody knew governmenting could be so complicated.  Funny how when you let a pandemic rip, it topples everything from health care workers to our ability to pull together as a nation to the safety of our food chain. 

Trump has trampled the last vestiges of American decency that have been withering since the WWII armistice."
2020-04-29 8:32,"• a few seconds ago
Again Mr Trump is lying about real facts in the conference press.
He continue to say that they have done more test than adding the other countries in the world. False.
It´s not true. And the fact is that tests per million people is very low compared other countries.
Yoh have the real data by Johns Hopskins, worldomweters , OCDE, etc.
Moreover Total of millions tests is not the figure that matter. instead percentage done by each country for million people has to be the proper data. Usa is far below other western countries in the world.

Usa tests done 5,823,807 per million people.- 17,594
Germany test done 2,072,669 per mill people.- 24,738
Spain tests done 1,345,560 per mill people.- 28,779
Italy tests done 1,846,934 per mill people.- 30,547
Switzerland tests done 256,500 per mill people.- 29,637
Russia tests done 3,139,258 per mill people.- 21,511
Portugal tests done 360,155 per mill people 35,321
Canada trests done 740,859 per mill people .-19,629
and many more countries that has done per mill people more than in Usa.
So the fact is that Usa 17,594 far below per million test than the other countries."
2020-04-29 9:31,"We wear masks at hospitals to protect our coworkers, our patients, the public and ourselves. This is not just for the moment we are at the hospital but to protect others who we might encounter after we leave the hospital. Pence saying he doesn’t have to wear a mask because he doesn’t have covid (at that exact point in time) doesn’t mean he didn’t carry covid out of the hospital with him.  He visited patients on a covid floor.  Ignoring hospital rules isn’t logical, is disrespectful and could expose others to covid. Also, Mayo shouldn’t have allowed Pence to walk around their hospital on patient floors “unmasked”."

Imagine thinking that social distancing doesn’t apply to him and all the others with him. Even if he is getting tested every day, there is no guarantee that he isn't infected and can infect others. What a role model! He is just as clueless as the stable genius. 

And why is it that Pence and others in the administration are getting tested periodically when there are no tests for ordinary Americans, healthcare and other essential workers?"
2020-04-29 3:47,"If you made this pandemic into a feature film with the right actors, writers, director, it would win all Oscars in all live action categories. It's surreal...
We're seeing body bags stack-ups on the level of zombie movies, thousands of unprotected front-line workers sacrificed as essential fodder in inherently unsafe industries, a food supply chain based on torture and brutal slaughter of innocent animals under gruesome conditions, and political leaders who use crisis to loot the Treasury, print stacks of new money, and give it to themselves and their cronies. 
The death rate has in three months surpassed that of the ENTIRE VIETNAM WAR! 
Trump and his administration have to be held accountable and banished from government. I'm sorry, but what they've allowed to happen due to their negligence is a dystopian carnage."
2020-04-29 4:39,"Certainly the meatpacking industry is critical infrastructure so an executive order issued under the Defense Production Act can be a reasonable measure.  But there are no protections for workers in the Executive Order, presumably because many meat packing workers are immigrants and the Trump administration hates them.

The memos about safety from OHSA et al are mere window dressing, without force.  Essentially the President has ordered the plants to open and the owners get to decide, without federal supervision, how much protection they want to give to workers.   On the record. the answer is likely to be near zero.  

The Governor of Iowa, a singular humanitarian, has told workers that if they stay home to protect their health, they won't get unemployment compensation.  The proper news headline for the Governor's charitable gesture is GOVERNOR REINTRODUCES INDENTURED SERVITUDE.  

Presumably, the order's lack of protection for endangered workers will be challenged in court.  But a Supreme Court which ordered Wisconsin voters to endanger themselves is not a good bet to tell major businesses to protect the health of their employees.  I would be delighted to be wrong.
___
Re the unmasked Vice-President. He revealed himself to be uncaring of the health of Mayo Clinic health care heroes.  Sure it's unlikely Pence, who gets tested every so often, is suffering from corona virus but it's a distinct possibility. Arrogance, plain and simple.

2020-04-29 9:49,"When the administration strategy of discounting the virus failed, the foot dragging on testing continued.
  Now the administration is counting on a restart of the economy followed by a new surge in infections.
 Those new infections will again be dismissed by trump.
Apparently nature has a plan to deal with trump."
2020-04-29 10:01,"It is sad that a country with such immense scientific, medical, logistical and financial resources should become the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. The failure to protect so many lives in the US is the result of pathetic ignorance on the part of the President and a White House that puts political interests way above the lives of its citizens. And every day we see how Trump cannot resolve his need to be seen to be strong and in charge with his cowardly rejection of any fault on his part or acceptance that the buck stops with him. This is hardly a 'great' America."

You will be trained and an apron provided for your safety.  As you seem to like gutting and eviscerating, I’m sure you’ll love the work.  America’s meat eaters appreciate your efforts and for finally finding a way to contribute in a positive manner.  Now get to work!"

Maybe it’s a coincidence."
2020-04-29 5:55,"Another bad example from the head of the Coronavirus Task Force. Pence's defense for not wearing a mask shows that he is woefully and wilfully ignorant of the CDC guidelines. The CDC Web site says, ""If you test negative for COVID-19, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. It is possible that you were very early in your infection when your sample was collected and that you could test positive later. Or you could be exposed later and then develop illness. In other words, a negative test result does not mean you won’t get sick later."" Of course this is the same man who explained today that when he promised 4 million tests seven weeks ago, he was just talking about tests being available, not the ability to actually process the tests.
 
Pence's disregard for the health and welfare of those inside the Mayo Clinic was both shameless and shameful. Likewise, though, the Mayo Clinic leadership should be ashamed for letting obsequiousness trump the good sense to deny the maskless Pence entry in order to protect its employees and patients."
2020-04-29 5:40,"When I read '13 meatpacking and food processing plants closed at some point in the past two months' resulting in 25% capacity in pork slaughter what I hear is monopoly and poor oversight.

A few big companies have been getting rich pimping out our cheap meat addiction and now their complaining about the system they setup not working out. Sadly, we'll capitulate."

2020-04-29 6:41,"If Trump wants to insist that the meat plants stay open and this leads to the problem getting worse...workers testing positive for coronavirus, he should be asked to work there.  I would not.  As to not wearing masks, Trump & Pence show just how pathetic they are as leaders.  They think they are above us all.  The answer is clear to all those blinded by loyalty to these 2, stop your support."
2020-04-29 3:44,"Since Trump and Pense are disease free and are ordering the workers back to work at meatpacking plants, Trump and Pense should take a place on the assembly line and cut up pork.

2020-04-29 7:19,"I was listening this morning to the Times podcast about the problems with the testing; these involved supply chains, the fact that our health care system is patchwork - they NEVER mentioned that it is for profit - and idiotic details like the biggest swab factory is in Northern Italy. Really? REALLY? Why is that?

Yes, Trump and his administration are a band of crooked thieves who just want to profit or take political credit. That's why we have virus profiteers acting as middle men, getting states to bid against each other for PPE. We know he would fail, criminally and on an epic fail.

But don't let the American health care system off the hook. Don't, to be honest, let American society off the hook. In East Asia people naturally wear masks. American's refuse to,  and die.

But really the failure is of the American health care system. From the CDC botching the first test, from the failure of producing PPE, to the shifting guidelines - ""experts"" in March we're saying you don't need to wear a mask. I was PULLING MY HAIR OUT. At the very least a mask keeps you from touching your face.

Trump is the first, most egregious failure. But the fact America elected him is why America will have a lot of death. This isn't over."

I am a Mayo patient, it concerns me that they let Mr.Pence into their clinic without a mask.  Mr. Pence knew that Mr. Trump would not like the optics of him wearing a mask. The Vice President should remember that the American people are his boss, not Mr. Trump.

2020-04-30 12:34,"As I read this article, I can help reflecting our own relationship with our president Mr. Trump and his cabinet.

These excerpts are ringing a particular resonance with our government and the handling of internal affairs.

“people are not going to rise up in revolt,” he said — but a “decay of legitimacy.”

 “as an excuse for everything that has gone wrong at home,”

“Mr. Putin doing what he likes most: demonstrating Russia’s indispensable voice in global affairs.”

“Putin’s biggest vulnerability: a pronounced lack of interest or success in tackling intractable domestic problems like dilapidated hospitals, pockets of entrenched poverty and years of falling real incomes.”"

I can't imagine this guy being afraid, every nerve in his body has fought against fear his entire life, that fight was a fight to channel fear into others, to appear larger than his diminutive stature would indicate.  Remember we are talking about a graduate with honors from the KGB .

But afraid, no ."
2020-04-30 11:43,Americans had their plans dashed and are now forced to sit around at home facing family issues that they were able to avoid or deny when their lives were filled with endless activity. Pretty much the same problem Putin has.

“By contrast, the pandemic has only highlighted what has always been Mr. Putin’s biggest vulnerability: a pronounced lack of interest or success in tackling intractable domestic problems like dilapidated hospitals, pockets of entrenched poverty and years of falling real incomes.”

In fact the people were extremely friendly in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Sochi and the Krasnodar Region. Everywhere I visited was beautiful and there were no problems. I’m from NYC and ride the subways often and there are criminals everywhere and the local leaders are indifferent and the homeless and criminals are everywhere.

And the ones that often were seen as uninspiring or excessively thoughtful and nuanced (I'm looking at you, Ms. Merkel!) proved to be the most able and dependable.

Both Putin, Xi and especially the Donald revealed they are completely unable or even unwilling to show anything remotely resembling empathy, warmth, concern and courage...

2020-04-30 13:20,"“Lets others act against the Coronavirus”
Hmm...now, where have I heard that before?"
2020-04-30 13:26,Those last words are some fo the most famous last words ever spoken...
2020-04-30 14:03,"He's just a little old man. He only maintains power because he is willing to kill and his people are natural serfs bred for the situation. He likely is in a foul mood because people are dying and he isn't even really involved.

Also, does anyone really believe any of the reported numbers coming from Russia? That would be like believing Trump."
2020-04-30 14:18,"Putinism confirms a historical truth
from tsarism to Stalinism and onwards: that Russia can be a big power only by keeping its people poor. And it can only afford wars and weapons by sacrificing the standards of living of its people."
2020-04-30 14:36,"The key statement of this article is the one under the first picture: ""...from his country residence outside Moscow.."".  Putin is avoiding being in Moscow, because he is afraid of getting sick himself.  People aren't stupid, and know what that means; this pandemic is dangerous, and they have been lied to about it by their leader.  Which is a common theme these days."
2020-04-30 15:21,The same strategy would have worked much better for Trump.  He should have known better to fight a virus pandemic and the liberal media at the same time.  He knew his clumsy musings would bite him.
2020-04-30 15:25,Putin = Paper Tiger.
2020-04-30 15:34,"Don't worry about Putin. One party rule, ruled by one man. And don 't worry. Republicans, and Trump have almost got that covered."
2020-04-30 15:38,"Ah, but how do you wrestle or threaten a virus? You cannot even send troops against it. All you can do is censore the casualty numbers..."
2020-04-30 15:39,Vlad and DJT are so much alike. They are like brothers.
2020-04-30 15:04,"Putin's despotism may look benign but it has been a catastrophe for the need to diversify the Russian economy and allow breathing space for dissenting voices, and allow social justice...instead of the current pluto-kleptocracy and glaring cronyism, a situation Trump seems to want to emulate. Putin is not dumb, and likely tired of clamping down the Navalni's of this world, decent leaders trying to do their best to help their fellow compatriots...and yet torpedoed by the very one that could be transformative towards social justice and a true renaissance of Russian ingenuity, and inventiveness, Putin. Putin's Trumpian non-policies are a 'sore loser'."
2020-04-30 15:14,I'd like to know WHO has verified those covid numbers? what are the chances that Russia has been under testing?
2020-04-30 15:38,"Only if you lived in the former Soviet Union area in 1990s you would understand why the Russians still entrust him with their state. He made enormous strides and a country that is functioning. But it is not Switzerland yet still Putin made Russia into a functioning state. 
The western media including NYT and politicians have been praying for Putin’s demise the same way the Christians have been waiting in the return of Christ. May happen but not likely."
2020-04-30 15:43,"Putin can be subjected to criticism of course, as all leaders the world over, but by and large he has been good for the Russians. Comparing where that vast country was under Yeltsin and where she is today, he's done quite well.
What he has been terrible at was his inability to cower before the US, refusing to accept American overlordship.
Just as China did too."
2020-04-30 15:45,"A couple things. Stop saying Putin was elected by 80% of voters and talking about his approval rating.  When the consequences of opposing him are so high and his opposition has been systematically crushed these numbers mean nothing.  Also, he doesn't care what his people think of him.  He isn't going anywhere and everyone knows it.  He's acting like Trump, if he makes no decisions then he can't be wrong.  To paraphrase Stalin: ""One death is a tragedy, a million deaths a statistic.""  Russians are culturally and historically conditioned to expect and survive the worst.  They've been doing it for hundreds of years."
2020-04-30 17:47,"There is no question that stability has improved under Putin and the economy is somewhat stronger.  However, the growth has been relative to an unprecedented trough and, given Russia's intellectual capital, natural resources and a word wide commodity boom, we need to be careful about giving Putin too much credit.  Meanwhile, Putin's obsession with proving to the world that he isn't a nobody has made the world and Russia less prosperous and secure than it needs to be.  Picking a fight with the Saudis that has only accelerated price declines is a classic example.  

What makes Putin so dangerous to himself, his country and the world is a jealous, zero sum worldview that makes it hard for him to distinguish Pyhrric victories from real victories.  His focus on ensuring that others lose, often leads to needless losses for Russia, as well.  He seems unable to see value in gains that are shared."
2020-04-30 15:56,"A predictable cheap shot against Putin by NY Times. The reason why Russians respect Putin and vote for him is simple: he is responsible for turning around Russia from a basket case under Yeltsin to a strong economy with the capacity to weather a major crisis like this. I know that many in the west hate him because he has stopped the exploitation, nay robbery of Russia’s natural resources by the west in cohorts with some Russian robber barons, aka oligarchs. Yes, he has not eliminated the entire oligarchy, but he at least makes sure that they do not sell Russian assets cheap to foreigners. That’s the reason for the people’s trust in him."
2020-04-30 16:39,"Even Putin knows when he is out his league.  Meanwhile, Trump, Pence, and Kushner still act like they've got this."
2020-04-30 16:40,The Russian dictator is far more clever than the wanna-be American dictator - Putin knows better than to be on TV constantly proving that he is incapable of dealing with this crisis.
2020-04-30 16:49,"Putin's disinformation program is alive and well, and should be guarded against."
2020-04-30 17:30,"Interesting that the U.K.’s newspaper, The Independent, shows Mr. Putin in regular street clothes, with no mask, in close contact with the doctor who approx a week later tested positive for Covid-19. 
Thankfully I read other sources.

2020-04-30 17:43,The Russians still believe in the old ways of  the Soviet Union basically to lies and lies and make it looks like real truth like China at the moment
2020-04-30 17:46,"Hmm... passing  off responsibility to local officials.
Is Putin playing by the Trump play book, or is Trump playing by the Putin play book?"
2020-04-30 17:05,"Putin.. an autocrat... is following the same personal operating model as Trump.. also an autocrat (just more constrained by the constitution). 

Trump refuses to take any blame or responsibility for the pandemic, but is happy to steal credit for good things done by others. 

AND.. this is precisely the problem... Trump DID NOTHING during the early weeks when it would have been possible to contain the virus entering the US.  Instead he told everyone it was no big deal, cases would drop to zero very quickly, media accounts otherwise were of course all ""fake news"". 

Those of us in the present... suffer.  History... history will not be kind to Putin or Trump.. but that is no salve for the suffering being faced right now today with this pandemic."
2020-04-30 16:19,"The curious non-response of autocrats, including our own, plus bolsonaro, putin, duterte, et al, is proof they cannot deal with a natural disaster, one that is immune to lies or physical threats.  Covid-19 has revealed those men as the frauds they are."
2020-04-30 16:22,It's amazing what a pandemic will do to Putin's plans for world domination.  He certainly didn't see this one coming.
2020-04-30 16:39,"There is one simple explanation for this: Putin cannot blame this virus outbreak on the West. The only time Putin has ideas and is full of energy is when he wants to blame Russia's problems on others. This time Russia's problems are because of him, he has no idea what to do about that."
2020-04-30 17:23,"""The situation is under total control.""   Putin probably meant the Russian state media is under total control when he said that. There was also initial reassurance by the state media in 1986 right after the Chernobyl nuclear plant meltdown."
2020-04-30 17:11,"Have you noticed how all the authoritarian and wannabe authoritarian strongmen have distanced themselves from this world crisis?  They don't want to be responsible and have no real desire to lead their people.  Xi, Trump, Him and now Putin."
2020-04-30 16:45,"The real problem for Russia is not the coronavirus. Russia's problem is that they make nothing that the world wants. Can anyone name a consumer product made in Russia having international demand? Consider that Russia produces not an automobile, not a watch, not a personal computer and not household appliances having demand beyond its borders. Essentially Russia imports all consumer products. Consider that Russia is an enormous country with an abundance of natural resources, as well as a equally large population with latent production possibilities. Yet it produces nothing the world wants from them except perhaps oil, and there's plenty of that found elsewhere. The Soviet Union was a failed socialist society and Russia it seems cannot throw off that yoke of centralized control in favor of a market economy. With all its resources Russia could dominate world trade, instead tiny South Korea dwarfs Russia in that regard."
2020-04-30 16:46,Putin acted decisively - he fled Moscow very quickly to the safety of his vacation place.  That's the leadership the country needs - so it's not his fault if everyone else haven't also fled to their vacation homes.
2020-04-30 16:02,"Whether Russia, China, Japan, Brazil or the Trumpocracy (to say nothing about countries in real denial such as Belarus, North Korea or Tajikistan), the covid crisis has shown that a lack of transparency and/or macho posturing are good for political theater but absolutely worthless in the face of a pandemic. Governments in South Korea, Taiwan, Greece, Germany, and etc. that responded admirably and openly with their populations backed by science and sound public policy have been vindicated by the results. 

""Flattening the curve"" really is a function of leaders stopping their hemming and hawing and getting serious about combating an inconvenient truth."
2020-04-30 16:25,"Hiding the effects of the coronavirus (for many weeks, Russia had fewer cases than many individual American states) has become more difficult for Mr. Putin of late. Like trying to hide the sunrise."
2020-04-30 17:27,"It is very interesting that a former KGB agent, as bold and resourceful as they are, is afraid to directly engage in confronting the corona virus.  Contrast his actions with those of Angela Merkel or Emmanuel Macron. Quite a difference in leadership during a crisis. Either of these two leaders would face a severe backlash for sitting on the sidelines. But in Vladimir Putin's case, any challengers to him risk disappearing.   Very interesting indeed."
2020-04-30 16:42,And of course everything that comes out of Russia can be believed...I just spit up.
2020-04-30 15:54,"Russians invented space travel and helped beat the Nazis.  Now they have reduced themselves to invading their neighbors, stealing credit card numbers, and cheating at politics and sports.   Very sad."
2020-04-30 17:15,"Give Vlad a break, Comrade.  He has his hands very full with the emergency of the cratering oil and gas market and plans to influence US elections.  That’s Putin’s two-headed eagle. The long history of Russia shows that the cares and tribulations of the day will pass as a cloud before the sun.  What’s important is staying in power until the sun re-emerges.  And Pushkin, of course."
2020-04-30 17:58,"The Achilles Heel for Russia has been to ride the Oil Horse as a means of production rather than diversify for the betterment of the people.  Oily oligarchs have fed themselves well while the people get consumed by virus germs.  So many opportunities lost.  Old habits do die hard, and new ones, like free elections, are stillborn.  Very unfortunate for Russia and the world."
2020-04-30 18:18,"Amazing that a country with an economy smaller than California and certainly weaker, being that it produces nothing anyone wants to buy, lacks any diversification, and is largely dependent on oil, can make any meaningful claim to have restored ""Pride in the State"". 

Nothing but parades and flags and leaders on grandstands."
2020-04-30 17:53,"A few years ago I heard the great granddaughter of Nikita Khrushchev speak. She is a US college professor now, but grew up in Russia, and is anti- Putin. But she said “Russia will never change, because the people are fixated on having a strong state.”  At least nowadays, people who want to can leave the country. But it’s always going to be a dictatorship, a moderate government has never lasted."
2020-04-30 18:10,"Putin, like the other rightwing authoritarian bully kleptocrats around the world including our own, is a weak thief presiding over a failing or failed state. His country's economy, smaller than several individual STATE economies, is one-dimensional and based on a disappearing and nonrenewable fossil fuel. Russia produces and exports basically nothing other than a fuel the rest of the world won't be using in 50 years.

The easiest way to defeat these fascists is to move to clean renewable energy sources. Eliminate the demand for the only thing these weak leaders steal/sell for their own profit, and they disappear. Simple as that. Clean energy is a national security issue just for this reason alone, let alone the environmental fallout and effects."
2020-04-30 18:16,Yet Putin still seems to be doing quite well at running the United states into the ground.
2020-04-30 18:32,"Substitute Trump for Putin in this section. It rings true! “Mr. Putin seems less a can-do executive than a bored monarch cooped up in a palace, checking his watch during televised video conferences with his underlings about the pandemic as his popularity ratings dip.”

Unfortunately the low price of oil has not halted Russia’s military aggression, including in sovereign Georgia, where Russian occupying troops continue to kidnap and harass Georgian citizens, and continue illegal borderization. Russia is still a dangerous aggressor state."
2020-04-30 19:24,Crashing oil and natural gas prices may ultimately be Putin's undoing.    Or not.  He has more lives than a cat.
2020-04-30 14:51,"""Putin, Russia’s Man of Action, Lets Others Act Against the Coronavirus""

Now, who was it who said, ""Let the governors handle it"" and declared that the federal government was not a shipping clerk?"
2020-04-30 11:54,"It’s interesting how the autocrats admired by Trump have botched the response to the pandemic and are struggling to regain footing.  Putin, Xi, Erdogan, Duerte in The Philippines, Bolosero in Brazil ... and you can count Trump among them as a wannabe ... have been late or ineffective or listless or given over to blame shifting."
2020-04-30 16:40,"The word ""election"" here is inappropriate. These numbers of votes consist of fake votes mostly. Neither I nor any people I know don't go to vote because nobody believes in the process itself. It's just a farce and people know it."
2020-04-30 18:02,"Even with the pandemic and the full-court press against China, time can still be had for a bit of Russophobia."
2020-04-30 18:33,"Gee that figures.

Another chest-thumping dictator devoid of ideas, creativity and compassion.

Sounds familiar doesn't it."
2020-04-30 19:34,"Putin knows there's a bullet out there aimed at his head: he doesn't know when or where, but he knows it's coming.   It often ends poorly for dictators...."
2020-04-30 20:17,"The first line of prayer from the heart of almost every American these days is "" God, please advise the leader of the Free World to let others speak about and deal with the COVID-19."
2020-04-30 19:37,"Putin stated, “The situation,” he said, “is under total control.”

Sound familiar to anyone? Of course by July we will all be dancing in the aisles over the surging economy and drinking ""peach bleaches.""

Both autocrats want to wish this away so they can go back to their bluster, lies and destruction of democracy, but a pandemic is not political and lives and dies on its own timetable."
2020-04-30 19:59,"Putin is always calling his buddy in the White House.   they have a great deal of delusional facts to share . Unfortunately whatever  Trump touches is destroyed.  That oil deal  Trump orchestrated in his very important way hasn't worked out so well.
Tough times for Trump and his best friend Putin. Even there bellowing of greatness  doesn't have anyone listening to them.  Neither one knows  how to control the virus 19 and for some people death."
2020-04-30 19:30,"Putin is passive and bored by sickness and death?

Sounds nasty, but he's not so different from others one might name."
2020-04-30 18:04,"Well, Putin certainly found his boy in Donald Trump, who has done more damage to the United States than Russia ever did.  Unbelievable."
2020-04-30 22:25,"It is puzzling to compare the effectiveness of a country’s response to Covid-19 based, broadly, on whether the national government is ‘democratic’ or ‘authoritarian’. Really, both forms have had successes ( China and South Korea ) and failures ( Russia and the U.S.)."
2020-04-30 23:35,"To claim that Mr Putin was ""reelected"" assumes an election.  An election can only be held in a democratic community.  What was conducted in Russia was a piece of theatre - as well coordinated as any Broadway production.  It was most certainly not a basis for claiming that someone was ""reelected""."
2020-04-30 22:54,"Mr. Putin, perhaps, is afraid to flex his muscles against an enemy—the coronavirus disease 2019—that he cannot see with his naked eye. So, he opted to stay in his countryside villa outside Moscow."
2020-04-30 21:45,As with every other dictator; and that would-be dictator in the White House; it's all about him.  As usual.
2020-04-30 21:47,"Two brothers of the same Mother Putin and Trump both inept, insecure and irrelevant."
2020-04-30 21:59,"ah, same as his boy toy."
2020-04-30 21:38,Interesting how Russia's dictator and our would-be dictator are powerless against a virus.
2020-04-30 22:03,"Honestly, the fact that Mr. Putin may be having trouble ''finding his stride'' strikes me as beyond trivial. It's a bit like being concerned that Donald Trump may be feeling cooped up in the White House. I feel the NYT should do better than this."
2020-04-30 21:19,"He is Trump's twin. Faced with a real crisis, they both don't have a clue what leadership is about. Add Bolsonaro to this particular stew of incompetence."
2020-04-30 21:53,"Russia is a corrupt, failed state.  It's deeply in debt, and oil prices will bring it to its knees. Nothing good will come of this.  

You can say a lot of the same things about the US too."
2020-04-30 21:57,"Putin can be in office until 2036.That's wonderful news for the Russian people. Vodka anyone? Trump can only be President through 2024, and must be envious of his strong-man man crush. And Putin's staying at his country estate, so why isn't Trump at Mar-a-Lago playing golf. Surely DeSantis will allow a single golf course to be open for his buddy.  Optics? Nah."
2020-04-30 21:16,"Putin seems to have studied Trump. We know that our President can blithely skate through any responsibility he has and blame others for the lack of results with impunity and, apparently, a clear mind since he did not come with a conscience."
2020-04-30 22:08,"Call me crazy, but Putin's approach is much like Trump's approach and it wouldn't surprise me if Putin suggested such an approach to Trump in one of their clandestine phone calls. 

That would achieve two objectives: continue to cement Putin's influence over Trump and wreak havoc on the U.S. 

I still cannot shake the notion that Trump has an ulterior motive beyond staggering incompetence for his refusal to do his job.

All I can think of is that Putin has promised to make Trump ""one of the world's richest men"" or some such nonsense after Trump leaves office."
2020-04-30 20:41,Do they have a vaccine or cure? They report so few cases and deaths.  And have the Trump and Kushner families been immunized with the Russian vaccine or cure?  Just thought I'd ask since NO ONE ELSE IS ASKING.
2020-04-30 21:15,"If Democrats and ‘progressives’ have their way and kill America’s oil and gas industries, Putin will enjoy oil at $150/barrel. That’ll fund a lot of malfeasance.

The only thing keeping Putin’s political machine afloat is the price of oil and as low as it is now ultimately spells doom for him. Russia will be back exporting brides at some point.

We should thank the Trump Admin for removing Democrat shackles from our energy industry."
2020-04-30 21:53,"Putin and Trump likely concluded, early on, that sickness and death from COVID-19 were ""acceptable losses"" relative to their populations.  After all, ""It was just like the flu . . . "" they thought.  They also foolishly believed that very little effect would leave China.  Did anyone really think China was honest and that China is really so good at dealing with outbreak?  (Travel ban? Thousands left China and Europe well after Trump's ""ban"")

It never ceases to astonish me that those who seek the most control refuse to take timely action.  Their insecurity and ineptitude get writ large, especially for Trump, when they are in denial.  For Trump, that is most of the time."
2020-04-30 21:56,"The parallels to Trump are astounding.

Or are they?  Many of the strongman leaders are looking weak.  The most ruthless ones, the ones that have used the Corona panic to get an even firmer grip on the population, may be OK.  But many are facing the reality that their macho anti-science propaganda falls flat in the face of real threats rather than the made-up bogeymen they work so hard to create.

So this awful disease might just help us with one of the world's other big threats: evil tyrants who cultivate ignorance and hate."
2020-04-30 22:51,"This article should have cited the outstanding NY Times article by William Broad from April 13th, “Putin’s Long War Against American Science” <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/science/putin-russia-disinformation-health-coronavirus.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/science/putin-russia-disinformation-health-coronavirus.html</a>.
Both Putin and Trump are spreading lies and disinformation about the COVID epidemic, but no one in Russia can get away with criticizing Putin.
I am certain that the COVID pandemic in Russia is out of control and far worse than Putin will admit."
2020-04-30 21:51,"Poor Putin. May justice/karma prevail. I read Bill Browder's book, Red Notice, and checked as many references as needed to assure myself he wasn't just making it up, and then waited for an opportunity to thank you Americans for having a system that allowed the Magnitsky Act.  And the ability to be able to pass such a judgmental law of actors outside your boundaries with real consequences if found guilty of uncivilized crimes.  And then having the guts to enforce it.  May your attention soon return to such noble causes.  That's the sort of thing that makes the world a better place."
2020-04-30 20:40,"Not surprising, these ""supposed leaders"" eventually overstep their bounds.  Unfortunately,  not before accumulating vast amounts of tangential wreckage.   Must be cumulatively unnerving  and eventually debilitating to forever rest on a knife's edge."
2020-04-30 21:09,"Whatever you think of Putin, he is smart (unlike Trump)

""Victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan.""

                                    John F. Kennedy

When victory is not assured, better to let others handle it."
2020-04-30 21:38,"This certainly sounds like a planned Trump move - parades, Dear Leader for Life, scrap the Constitution. Do you of the Republican CULT notice the similarity here?

What ""your demented boy"" does is usually right out of Pution's play book - both being arrogant, disconnected, narcissistic sociopaths with zero concern for their people. I would bet that while Trump is distracting, or TRYING to distract us, with his off-the-rails insanity, he and his boss are intimately planning howPutin will help him steal an illegitimate and TREASONOUS win in November. Those nimble little-fingered Russian hackers have been doing their cyber push-ups and this feckless administration (led by Barr) has done NOTHING to hamper this interference.

Expect the biggest crimes in our history FOR TRUMP. He will, of course, blame everything on Biden, Hillary, Obama, Schumer and Pelosi - he always does. If he ""wins"" this one it will ben grossly ILLEGAL."
2020-04-30 22:25,"At least Russia doesn't have to put up with a delusional, bloviating clown."
2020-04-27 20:54,"A little premature analysis.

I remember 911 when the accepted death toll was like 6-8m until it came in much lower when the final stats were known. 

Bottom line wait till all the stats are in before even a final estimate can be made.

There may be even more deaths when the final stats are in, but the death rate may be much lower when the final count of people who had it are in."
2020-04-27 20:59,Good work on pointing this out.
2020-04-27 20:52,"There is a conspiracy theory making the rounds on right-leaning media and anti-vaxxers that COVID deaths are being dramatically over-counted.

The purpose or benefit of this overcount is to promote hysteria and enact government controls that are not necessary, and scare people into taking a vaccine once it is developed.

The method of counting excess deaths is finally how we got the truth of Hurrican Maria's true impact in PR. I'm glad to see this science applied in near real-time during this crisis to put the true impact in full view."
2020-04-27 21:18,"Not only is the number of deaths much higher than would ordinarily be expected among NYC residents, but it's undoubtedly the case that because of residents fleeing the city, there are fewer New Yorkers residing in the city this year than was the case during the comparable period last year.  In short,the baseline number of expected deaths should probably be lowered, making the actual number of deaths even more concerning."
2020-04-27 21:32,"Does anyone have any reliable statistics on how many New Yorkers have fled the city?

I'd guess that 75% of people I know have temporarily left the city, if not more.

Surely there are many New Yorkers that have expired after leaving the city."
2020-04-27 21:56,"What about Italy's comparable number, if available?  How many deaths above expected in Italy, the second-most hard hit area in the world?"
2020-04-27 22:01,"The March date used to calculate the onset of COVID related deaths assumes that no one had the virus or died earlier, when there was no testing available. It is entirely possible that there were cases weeks before that were never diagnosed, or improperly diagnosed."
2020-04-27 21:50,"Sad stats, every one a life. Exercise the body and the mind will relax a bit. Hang on 'til November and we'll all relax a lot more."
2020-04-27 21:25,I wonder how the right-wing talking heads who have been shouting that Covid-19 is no different from the flu will explain this huge increase in deaths in NYC over the past two months?  Perhaps they would simply dismiss the data as faked?
2020-04-27 21:53,"And the right wingers will accuse you of fomenting a hoax to make the pandemic look worse because it hurts Trump's chances of reelection. And that is all they care about. People dying is not a problem to Trump and his base. They want power and will climb over all 27,000 and counting dead bodies to get it."
2020-04-27 21:39,"I've been reading the obituary sections of small towns in the Midwest (Austin, Minnesota and Beatrice, Nebraska) and saw many more deaths than would be expected within a period of five days April 20 to 25th (15 in Austin, MN pop 24K and 11 in Beatrice pop 12K) by a factor of 4 to 5 times normal.  Whether we name Covid 19 or not, when the dust settles many people who thought they were safe might find they weren't."
2020-04-27 22:31,Really interesting data. I'd be curious what this looks like by county -- would help to inform what is really going on as counties seek to reopen.
2020-04-27 22:44,If NYs' weren't tested or they quietly passed away at home then they wouldn't be included in the tally of Covid19 deaths. Your graph indicates many in fall into this category leading to rampant underreporting.
2020-04-27 22:47,"Seems to me that the excess deaths are the byproducts of the pandemic and the lockdown placed on us. The excess does not come from being infected but from various other reasons. One being that those who are ill are afraid to go to hospitals, either because they are afraid of being infected by COVID in the hospital or because the hospital is only treating COVID (stories of empty hospitals w/o COVID patients are well documented.) So the person dies at home. Another reason for the excess is stress. Stress induced illnesses (including mental illness) is well documented which also lead to death. Additionally, past economic studies have shown that increases in unemployment or loss of businesses (as a small business owner) do lead to hopelessness, despair, stress, and then sometimes death (up to 50K+ deaths for every 1% increase in unemployment across the U.S.) We just saw 24M+ people file for unemployment. 

So don't be surprised when these excess deaths caused by the lockdown ultimately surpass the number of deaths directly caused by infection of COVID."
2020-04-27 22:12,"Whatever the accepted death toll, it will probably be much higher, most likely the virus was already in NYC, killing people long before the first official deaths were recorded.
When you consider the population density of Wuhan, it’s role as a an important transportation hub, the huge delay in restricting travel- well after the virus had gotten out of China, the weakness of the travel restrictions, the lack of coordination or follow-thru at entry points to the US it wouldn’t be impossible for the virus to have arrived in January.
No one will ever know how many people died of COVID, who were diagnosed as suffering from the flu or RSV."
2020-04-27 22:37,"So sad for New Yorkers and for everyone suffering from this pandemic. This thing ain't over yet, not by a long shot. Rural areas have been relatively spared, but they skew older and sicker and are often an hour from the nearest hospital. I'm sure they'll still find a way to blame Obama."
2020-04-27 22:41,"Hopefully this time will pass with technology, ingenuity, and integrity. An antiviral, eventually a vaccine, and an election. Tweets and shortages of toilet paper will fade into the past."
2020-04-27 22:49,"It is still shockingly hard to get a test. We found out today that one daughter tested positive, and have been trying to get my husband and other daughter tested, but were turned down by four separate doctors, two urgent cares, and the state department of health, just this afternoon. Of COURSE the numbers are under-reported. I was sick for a full month in March and never did qualify for a test either. Count our family as four sick, but only one ""sick."" You do the math."
2020-04-27 22:33,So much winning. Are we all tired of it yet?
2020-04-27 22:12,"Deviation from normal death rates is probably a good way to look at the likely overall effects of COVID-19.  The graphic also shows slightly, but discernibly, more deaths in winter than in summer in the years before COVID-19  -- the same is also apparent for other northern hemisphere countries  death rates as shown in recent NYT graphics.  Is this perhaps associated with the flu?  Perhaps NYT, which does extensive reporting on mortality related to weather events and climate change, could delve into the mix of factors that causes such an outcome."
2020-04-27 22:57,"Given the average age of those who die from Covid-19 it is possible that average deaths will be below trend for the rest of year.  Depending on the time frame you choose, the increase in deaths over expected will probably vary.  O

Over two years, the difference is likely to be much smaller with many of the Covid-19 deaths replacing expected deaths in the next 24 months."
2020-04-27 22:57,"NY is playing politics by ramping up the numbers.    They are going back in time and treating any respiratory death as a COVID.   It's cost-less for Cuomo, since the press gives him a pass, but does damage to Trump, which Democrats and the press appreciate.   When all is said and done, Blue States will dump a mountain of ""COVID"" deaths that are unproven into the totals in order to 1) get more Federal dollars, and 2) hurt Trump.   That's how they play it folks."
2020-04-27 23:00,"Appalling. The praise heaped on Cuomo or de Blasio is unfathomable and entirely misplaced. NYC has unique challenges—and between the state and city, budgets of more than $150,000,000,000. The lack of preparedness and bungled response have been shocking, and we must demand answers at the state and local level."
2020-04-27 23:02,"This Coved 19, Is  more deadly then the Spanish flu. at least in New york. 
In 1912 the Spanish flu killed roughly 21,000 in New York state  
 source google search.  
That was in about six months. Covid 19 has killed over 25,000
in just two months in New York State. We have to remember. Back in 1912. The Hospitals where not as advanced as today."
2020-04-27 23:11,"It is perfectly understandable that people with co-morbidities like heart disease, lung disease would put off attending hospital visits thanks to the corona virus. Unfortunately for some of them it cost them their lives...

These deaths are just as attributable to corona virus as those who actually catch the virus."
2020-04-27 23:04,"Hasn't this been the problem from the beginning? With all the high tech we still can't agree on the facts.  NY state has one set of numbers, NYC has another, each using their own criteria.  Everyone in the country is fed the statistics  as if they were the hard truth we should all believe in. How are people expected to have confidence in the decisions being made to relax the restrictions if the data is flawed. This is not a science experiment using lab rats."
2020-04-27 23:35,"The neglect of the Strategical National Stockpile by  elected officials, past and present, is bad enough. Now this administration pretends that it was never supposed to be used to help the states -- an absolute dereliction of duty. 

Telling the states they have to get their own protective equipment and then outbidding them for those same materials? Apparently, America First refers to the order in which they are thrown under the bus."
2020-04-27 23:44,"This is a very deadly virus with a mortality rate higher than anyone has ""guessed"" so far.  The fact that everyone is ""tired"" of not being able to do as they wish and that we're going to be ""opening up"" has the hallmarks of a catastrophe equal to are greater than the 1918 virus.  Be smart and dig in until we have more information."
2020-04-27 23:32,Our local Sunday paper in Orange County MY usually has 3-4 obituary pages.  The last 3 weeks have seen 9-10 pages.  That's all you need to see.
2020-04-27 23:40,"Are homicides, suicides and accidents included in these numbers? Those need to be extracted before you start to compare"
2020-04-27 23:57,This is the kind of reporting we need for every US county.
2020-04-28 0:32,"Ok so this is a) not surprising and b) not very significant from the actual totals. 

25% of nyc has had covid (probably more if you keep measuring) this means that the death rate for those <44 years old is less than 0.01% (for all comers, most of those patients have Significant medical problems ) so we will day for the average person under 44 has <0.005% mortality risk (likely less than that). The rest have rates also very low. 

We need to reconsider what we are doing."
2020-04-28 1:06,"Interesting observations, presented in a flawed manner.  It is informative to state what the baseline number of usual deaths per week is as well.  The 20K number means much more if the usual toll is 1k/week than if it is 1M/week.  The time series graph, however, shows how stable the weekly deaths usually are.  It is possible to look at this graph in isolation and recognize that something exceptional is happening, its shortcomings notwithstanding."
2020-04-28 1:17,"These numbers don't make any sense and will likely be dramatically revised once the CDC crunches the data.  Overall mortality in the US is still at a three year low, so we should wait before drawing any conclusions.

First, comparing deaths to ""this time of year"" is probably wrong, as the number of deaths in a normal year peaks sometime between December and February, and this flu season in NY seemed significantly less deadly than usual. Also, adding the accumulated ""missing deaths"" dramatically bumps up the graph for the period.

While true that some emergency rooms are busy, but many more are in fact emptier than normal. This suggests that the Covid-19 hysteria scared off many experiencing mild stroke or heart attack symptoms from going to the hospital, likely increasing the mortality rates among them."
2020-04-28 2:19,"In addition to direct COVID deaths, increased stress has probably led to an increased death rate from heart attacks and strokes, but that people are dying at home rather than in hospitals.
Last month a friend in a high-COVID region complained to her doctor about chest pains.  The doctor did not send her to the hospital, and she did not insist. Two weeks later she died suddenly at home, from what was evidently a massive heart attack.  She was 75 and otherwise in good health.
Under normal circumstances, she would still be alive."
2020-04-28 2:56,"NYC has trains, subways, buses, elevators, escalators, and taxis were we all share our germs. Ultraviolet - C light may be the only way to make the density safe. Robotic technology and applications can change the curve for all types of viruses."
2020-04-28 3:17,"'Excess deaths', 20,900 in this situation,  is a completely valid way to imply the impact of new factors.  This number represents a 25% increase over the COVID fatality count, 16,673, a percentage increase that passes the sanity check.
Given the normal uncertainty in 'cause of death' assessment, and the time it takes to do a detailed assessment, and the enormous stress the medical people have been under, an under count of COVOD fatalities would be completely expected."
2020-04-28 3:54,Is thee a way we can politics out of this and discuss rationally. Nowadays everything is pro or anti Trump. Both factions are strong but I think  there is a place to be objective too!
2020-04-28 2:51,"I’m sure the Covid numbers are actually higher . With people isolating themselves , I’m sure other causes of death have been reduced. I’m sure fatalities due to accidents and other risks associated with normal life have been greatly reduced ."
2020-04-28 1:32,"It is such a heart-breaking situation.  I must say, just like President Trump, whose lack of foresight and planning has made US the pandemic poster child, Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill De Blasio also must take responsibility for the lives lost due to their lack of preparation and early action.  When New York State published one single case of Covid19 on March 1st, did anyone really believed that number.  Given that was three months after Wu Han's outbreak and NY being a city of immigrants and a hub for Europe and Asia, how could the top two executives of the city and the state not begin the preparation work back in January?  It's the job of any effective executive to hope for the best but ALWAYS PREPARE FOR THE WORST.  It's no secret New York metro area has by far the highest population density in the country.  Why did these two gentlemen waited till California was locked down before following suit?  That's not the action of forward-thinking and strong leaders.  How many lives may have been saved if New York city began social distancing, mask-wearing, sheltering-in-place weeks earlier?   See these numbers: New York state has 1135 deaths per million, Nationwide: 117, California: 45, and the second worst hit country in the world, Italy, has 450.   This is not a partisan rant.  I've never voted Republican in my life, but someone should be held accountable for the thousands of unnecessary and potentially preventable lives lost."
2020-04-28 1:41,"If you want to compare the corresponding flu statistics, here they are: 

<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm</a>

The most impressive thing about these statistics is the wide error ranges. For example, the number of flu deaths is 24,000 – 62,000."
2020-04-28 0:30,"Republicans want to grab power or once they have the power to hang on to it at any cost.  During ACA deliberations, they said there would be death panels to decide whether a sick person should be saved at considerable expense or let that person die to save money.  Recently, to save the next election for Trump and themselves, they were saying old people should volunteer to die to save the economy!  Now they are saying the Covid-19 deaths are being inflated to make Trump look bad.  Seems like they have no need for the truth and no shame in floating wild lies."
2020-04-28 1:15,Shame on Cuomo and DiBlasio for so many senseless deaths. Should have responded quicker like CA.
2020-04-28 1:44,"20,000 extra deaths in a few weeks is horrific. 

Today we read that an ER doctor in Manhattan committed suicide while recovering herself. This was very likely brought on by the constant onslaught of death and suffering she witnessed. Some covid-19 patients coming in by ambulance were dying before they could be even treated in the ER.

Anyone commenting here that this is acceptable or somehow “normal” is either deranged or heartless. Please volunteer at a NYC or Chicago or Boston hospital and then post a comment based on reality."
2020-04-28 4:30,"What surprises me a lot is the steep increase, with no warning at all. I think thats not related to the infection rate, mortality or incubation period, but a magnifying effect, my theory is viral load raised exponentially at certain levels of social spread and from there it turns out deadly. If thats the case, again only good testing and common sense measures will make it through, lockdowns wont do but to leave people in poverty and infecting their  families."
2020-04-28 4:58,I celebrate the fact that investigative journalism is well alive in the NY Times in moments of excruciating uncertainties affecting so many of us. It's good to read that legitimate questions can be raised concerning the deadly counting this pandemia is causing not only in this lovely state and city but everywhere.
2020-04-28 4:04,"One has to question the reflexive manner in which the media and Democrat politicians takes it as a given that blame for all coronavirus casualties goes to Donald Trump. Just yesterday, Adam Schiff declared Trump guilty for all 50,000 deaths nationwide. One would hope for a measure of objectivity and self-assessment especially in New York where such a disproportionate number of the deaths occurred. It is patently absurd to blame the White House and not focus on the obvious. If there is blame to go around - and perhaps there shouldn't be any - it is the local authorities in New York City and in Albany who should be put on hot seat. But, of course, this cannot happen in a Democrat dominated state and global media capital which are so singularly thirsty for Trump's blood."
2020-04-28 4:47,"An excellent analysis, something killed those people, and its not hard to imagine what.
I don't believe that New Yorkers are any more susceptible to infection than anywhere else, and while the rapid rise is no doubt due to the crowded nature of the city, it illustrates what will happen everywhere if we let this virus run wild, just on a faster time scale."
2020-04-28 5:21,"Statistics for confirmed cases of COVID-19 are highly dependent on the very varying numbers of tests in different states and communities. Consequently, one would think the most relevant statistic available for comparison purposes would be the deaths per number of residents. However, if you look at the state by state comparisons, some seem to make no sense, inasmuch as states with significant numbers of cases and/or deaths have very different fatality rates.

Different states and different localities use different criteria for attributing cause of death. I expect politics as much as medical protocols play a significant role. Responsibility, accountability, and image undoubtedly are factored in to states' reporting of deaths. Is it coincidence that, even pulling out the sparsely populated high plans and mountain states, you still pretty much see the states with Democratic governors reporting higher death rates than states with Republican governors?

For instance, Florida with 1088 deaths has a fatality rate of 5/100,00 while Louisiana with 1740 deaths has a fatality rate of 37/100,000. Texas with 666 deaths reports a fatality rate of 2/100,000 while Connecticut with 2012 deaths has a fatality rate of 56/100,000. These differences cannot simply be attributed to a difference in medical care."
2020-04-28 5:33,"There was an exhibit in a New York City museum on epidemics months ago, long before the present epidemic had taken its first victim.  Looking at the wall posters showing casualties in various cities it was obvious that NYC had done much better than other American cities--many fewer deaths in proportion to population.  I guess about a hundred years from now people will see how an exhibit on how NYC did in relation to other US cities in the pandemic year 2020 and their eyes will pop at how badly we did.  Whatever the judgment on the performances of the Governor and Mayor will be, our horrendous coronavirus infection rate will have to be taken in account."
2020-04-28 5:53,"It's not out of the question that the additional deaths may not be due to the coronavirus per se, but to people being unwilling to go to the hospital for treatment of something else.  These could be ""shelter-in-place"" deaths, which could also account for why (another commenter mentioned) deaths in Democratic-run states appear higher than in Republican-run states."
2020-04-28 5:53,"so if we almost double the official statistics (actually multiply by five, divide by three), we get the real toll, is that it. Presumably many States are even less reliable with their statistics than NYC."
2020-04-28 6:35,"Very nice and timely analysis of the mortality data available for NYC.  I would like to see the results of the same analysis using the national and state mortality data.  For a wider geographic area than NYC, I am wondering if the physical distancing and shelter-in-place restrictions actually resulted in fewer deaths from all other causes.  Or, did the fear of exposure to COVID-19 at the hospitals actually result in more deaths from all other causes. With all the attention the pandemic is getting, I know everything will eventually get sorted out. And, I’m looking  forward to the time when we have a clear understanding of what actually happened and what could have been done better."
2020-04-28 7:28,"My calculation of death rate from this given 24.7% rate of infection from Department of Health antibody test is that we have 1% death rate from COVID-19 in the City. This is without eventual deaths from currently hospitalized. If we include that then we have 1.1% death rate in the City,"
2020-04-28 9:36,"NYC posts maps of confirmed cases by ZIP code area as well as maps of percent of those tested who were positive. Manhattan has a suspiciously low number of cases as a whole. The map of cases shows that three ZIP code areas in Harlem and Washington Hts are in the bottom quartile but not in the bottom quartile for percent testing positive. Thus, 10030, 10037, and 10039 are grossly undertested and cases are not counted. Other ZIP code areas in poor communities of color or with high immigrant populations also show anomalously low number of cases.

Staten Island, on the other hand, shows results of overtesting: high numbers of cases but low percents of positives.

Even testing appears discriminatory in this hyper-segregated city. this is epidemiologically and ethically unacceptable."
2020-04-28 8:02,"Good research. Now do the nation, county by county. That will unmask attempts by political leaders to minimize danger in order to boost the economy. Plenty of politicians who are accustomed to being judged on economic performance will be content to let the virus kill more than it has to, if only that will get their economic ratings up. There is an emergency need to hold those politicians to account, and the method of counting excess deaths is the way to do it. Once the politicians discover there is also going to be an inescapable accounting for mismanaging the pandemic, maybe they will start caring about how many people they kill."
2020-04-28 4:39,"The City's infection tally numbers do not make any sense.  The Times should investigate this.  The total of infections in the five boroughs does not equal the sum reported.   And if you divide the number of infections by the infection rate, you should get the population of each borough, but that number varies substantially from day to day.  

For example, earlier today the city reported 48,342 cases in Queens, 41,327 in Brooklyn, 19,499 in Manhattan, 35,398 in The Bronx and 11,424 in Staten Island.  That sums to 155,990.  But the City said the total is 156,100.  That happens almost every day (is it so hard to accurately sum five numbers?)

The City said the infection rate in Queens is 1.93% which implies that the population is 2,502,174.   But on April 23rd, the City reported 42,637 cases in Queens and an infection rate of 1.81%, which implies that the population is 2,015,934.   So did Queens grow by half-a-million people in four days?

Furthermore, between 4/21 and 4/27, the number of cases increased by 21,187 or an average of 3531 per day.  But the City claims the number of new cases is now just a few hundred per day.

So IMO, the numbers do not jive, make no sense and can't be trusted."
2020-04-28 6:43,"Bear in mind, the fact that Trump refused to read the daily briefing in January makes him responsible for only a couple of thousand of these deaths. I do hope the judge will keep that in mind at the sentencing."
2020-04-28 4:59,"In the 2018-2019 year, 36,000 people in NY died of the flu. 27,000 New Yorkers have died of Corona, mostly those in their 80’s and 90’s and/or those with health conditions. They should continue to stay at home. The rest of us need to get back to work, get  back to paying our rent/mortgage, get back to living."
2020-04-28 10:44,"Oh, we can talk freely about UFO nows: they are finally official. It seems a bit of 'Too little too late', though. As a distraction, they probably will not qualify. Somehow they seem less menacing at the moment than some of us humans. 

We can already start the blame game.

It is not over yet, so we cannot start to mourn. 

When will be the time for our tears?"
2020-04-28 11:08,"Let's bear in mind that health is directly under the Governors - by and large Governors across the nation like Gavin Newsom, etc... acted responsibly by imposing social restrictions and lockdowns as needed - instead of playing political basketball with people's lives.

That said, it time we leave this behind with nearly 15% of the New Yorkers having developed immunity - and focus on the path to take ahead till the vaccines become available."
2020-04-28 6:02,"It is most unfortunate that NYC leaders made the decision to keep the subways open and running during the pandemic.  This decision has led to the continued spread of the Sars-CoV2 virus during the months of February, March and April, 2020. This decision has led to the many excess deaths in NYC, Long Island, New Jersey, Connecticut and Upper New York state as well as to elsewhere in this nation.  This decision has led to the establishment of a large asymptomatic carrier population which most likely will serve as a reservoir of virus to continually episodically cause serious COVID 19 disease in seasons and years to come.  It is very possible that this very bad decision will lead to the economic downfall of the Eastern seaboard establishment.  

I do note that  Wuhan, China  stopped operating their subway system in the end of January 2020.  It is reported that as of April 26, 2020, Wuhan no longer has any Covid 19 patients  in their hospitals as all have been discharged.   Wuhan has not had any Covid 19 cases diagnosed in this last week."
2020-04-28 5:32,"Stalin suggested that the only thing that counts in an election is who counts the ballots. Governor Kemp has been instrumental in how voting is arranged and counted.
Here in Canada the branding has us believing New York and suspecting Stalin is at work in Florida and Georgia. I am a data junkie and every time I hear an American say we can't trust China; I shed a tear even as I know you can't trust China is a truism.
It was a century ago when Woodrow Wilson's Committee on Public Information said patriotism means pretending your worst mistakes are your greatest accomplishments whether it be a stupid war or second wave pandemic arriving while you are celebrating a victory over the first wave. The celebrating  is why the second wave was far deadlier."
2020-04-28 7:54,Trump is claiming his enemies are artificially inflating the amount of deaths related to C19 in order to weaken him politically.
2020-04-28 9:13,Cuomo and De Blasio should be charged with manslaughter. NY COVID-19 deaths are 11.5x the national average and 5 standard deviations above the median. They didn't close the subway. They sent infected to nursing homes. They withheld hydroxychloroquine. Was it just incompetence or actual malice?
2020-04-28 12:17,"When some historian many years from now tries to explain the pandemic of 2020, there will be a separate chapter on New York City, but no separate chapter on any other American city.  I loathe Trump, but the historian have to look at the actions or inactions of de Blasio and Cuomo, not Trump."

2020-04-28 15:00,"Earlier measures to stop the spread would have reduced the quick peak in deaths, but might not have cut the overall death total.   Looking at the graph, it looks like NYC allowed the virus to spread freely, and took the hit in increased deaths relatively quickly.

If this is the case, then deaths in NYC might fall more sharply than in other areas, as the number of people who have had the virus already is approaching 50%.   In places where people were more isolated, the virus may continue to spread through vulnerable populations.   

Such an effect may have happened in Wuhan, where the virus flared unchecked, but burned out after a few months."
2020-04-28 17:32,The analysis of the global mortality makes a pretty good argument about how bad things could have been if the world wasn't locked down.  The numbers in Sweden also show a 500% jump in mortality in Stockholm and this number rises each day.  The CDC is currently indicating  an increase of 10% total mortality in the United States.  I can't even imagine what affect a 500% mortality applied to the entire country would have on every day life.  The continuing analysis of this data could be critical in determining how the economy can open up.
2020-04-28 18:35,"I would think largely closing down hospitals for non covid cases would cause a spike in deaths from other causes (plus at least anecdotally some people were afraid to seek medical care for non covid conditions due to fear of catching covid while at the hospital/doctor).  I would be interested to know if there is any way to figure out how much of the increase is from heart attacks, foregone er visits, etc"
2020-04-28 19:54,"as an MD, it is a very interesting statistic, and when this is all said and done we will have to analyze where the excess deaths are from and why. 
also, I do not blame Trump, Cuomo, or Deblasio.  Again, when this is over we need to examine what everyone did, to make sure we are prepared in the future. Who could have really planned for something like this? even simulations are not the real thing. And these are hard decisions to make. Its easy to Monday morning quarterback, but that does not really help.

2020-04-29 1:28,"de Blasio and Cuomo have blood on their hands by not providing decisive leadership during this epidemic.

The reasons for so many deaths in our area are the homeless on the subways.  A certain % of them are infected with the virus - just like the rest of us - and NOTHING is being done by Cuomo or the mayor to stop it.  That's why so many MTA workers have died.

Look at the NYT deaths per 100,000 people.  The leading rates are in NYC, Long Island, NJ, Westchester, and Rockland.  Why?  Only NYC is densely populated.  Many people who live in these areas work in Manhattan.  They end up taking the subway.  That HAS to be the common thread linking these areas.

Cuomo needs to call in the National Guard and remove every homeless person from the subway and not let them return.  All solutions up till now are just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.

We don't know which homeless people are infected so we can't take any chances.  They must all be removed.

NYC will be the last city in the country to re-open.  We will never be able to re-open if the subways continue to be death traps.  No safe subway = no economy.  How long can we last as a city if people keep dying from the subway and people can't get to work?

Cuomo today said, ""Someone tell me what to do and I'll do it.""  I'm telling you - bring in the National Guard to work with the NYPD and get every homeless person out of the subways.  THAT'S your only solution."
2020-04-28 21:45,"Since the beginning of April when the deaths from CORVID-19 took off, the CDC Weekly Mortality figures for the US show about a 70% increase from expected for ALL pneumonia and flu deaths EXCLUDING deaths recorded as CORVID-19. Including them and it’s some 400% higher than normal. Total deaths while significantly up are not up that much. There maybe some offset because of reduced traffic, industrial and violent crime deaths, etc."
2020-04-27 13:47,"There really is no alternative - keeping business closed for long periods of time will lead to the demise of the world economy, which will have a more significant impact to the health and well being of many more people than the Corona Virus."
2020-04-27 13:33,"Surprise surprise the French unions don’t want to work, I guess things are back to normal in France"
2020-04-27 14:37,"I guess we'll see, won't we! How THEY manage this could make or break economic re-opening, and the data, if reported accurately, should tell us the results within 4 weeks.

I like Michelin - they make great products and I wish them well, but lives are more important than profit. I hope they bear that in mind effectively."
2020-04-27 14:41,"Utterly fascinating. This, and a companion COVID-19 piece re.: success in fighting virus by New Zealand and Australia, are both illustrations of why the Times' brilliant coverage of the pandemic remains competitive with the absolute best of the global journo pack on this crisis. Well-done, Liz Alderman, insightful and thought-provoking stuff. Thanks and have a safe and healthful day."
2020-04-27 14:47,"NW Ohio is home of the  Jeep factory.  As it prepares to reopen, there is great worry among the Ohio workers, because a large percentage of the employees live across the state line in SE Michigan.  Detroit and surrounding counties are one of the COVID hotspots.  So there is fear: will they bring a pandemic spike to the Jeep plant, and to Ohio?"
2020-04-27 15:19,"Starting up with skeleton crews is a good idea for plants where a large amount of workers suppose to work together. Mass testing and surveillance should go along with that.
Those who are more worried about the Jones than the health of blue-collar workers should be aware that they, when major index companies face significant sick-leaves after reopening, can wait way longer for the next spike on the market."
2020-04-27 15:38,"The unions are pushing for more safety, while the boss is pushing for more production. It sounds like a legitimate debate.

With the Amazon legal precendent, Michelin's management knows very well what it's up to. It won't risk it all for 2 weeks of production with 20% workforce.

Beside, with 2 fatalities out of 112'000 employees, it gives pretty good ground for Michelin to consider they're on the right path."
2020-04-27 16:29,"Why does everything have to be framed as evil corporations versus poor victimized workers? What ever happened to ""we're all in this together!""

Here's the reality: no industrial tires, then no harvesters, combines, or heavy trucking, and that means no food. At this point, we are all aware that the global supply chain has no slack, so its not like we have a stockpile of industrial tires to coast on.

Instead of an uplifting article about Michelin and its workings keeping the backbone of the world's food supply up and running, the article goes for the cheap hit, opening with a bit about the resumed production of molds (not tires, just the molds) that are used to make tires for cars like Porsche and Telsa (and how many other makes and models?). What we don't hear is how many workers are actually doing this work, or what percentage of the effort is being spent on these personal tires?

Given that the work is only being done on the mold, you're probably talking about a single craftsman carefully honing and polishing a piece of harden steel—not an assembly line with workers, shoulder to shoulder, cranking out tires. Indeed, it's only towards the end of the article that we learn in the US and Canada, that it's only the sites producing industrial/commercial tires that have reopened, not the sites producing consumer ones.

Just once, can we not assume the worst when it comes to business owners and simply acknowledge that the situation is difficult and that risk is unavoidable? Please?"
2020-04-27 18:03,"I have to say, if I hear or read “French Union” the hairs on the back of my neck go up.  Hide your museum tickets and hide your transit passes!"
2020-04-27 18:15,"Michelin has been and still is one of the most 'paternalist' companies in France, and probably the world.  The tire industry has been hard hit by cheap Chinese imports, yet Michelin has never laid off employees the few times they had to close factories in France, they all got new jobs or re-training for another job, at their choice.  Employees get good salary with great benefits.  The article says no one working for Michelin has even come down with the disease at work,  less likely died.  If I worked for them, I'd volunteer to go back to work.  The CGT is the most radical union in France.  Nothing is ever good to them, they are keeping an 'anti' establishment position as their idea of how to appeal to their members.  Their membership is down to 600k, having lost 23k members in the past three years.  They do not represent French workers in Michelin nor anywhere else to any degree of importance. What they do is make lots of noise. Your journalist should have interviewed members of other unions, but then he would not have gotten such  'against' comments."
2020-04-27 18:34,"Notwithstanding this agreable tour of French labor relations, the  likes of the CGT are barely a footnote for Michelin now. In fact, France itself is relatively de minimis for Michelin, with its 10 sites out of almost 70 worldwide. I'm glad for French labor that it has gotten to throw its weight around a little during the pandemic, but its power is now that of a minor pest, like flies at a picnic."
2020-04-27 19:15,"Porsche tires are essential. What do you think doctors drive, hello?"
2020-04-29 10:30,"“Some public health experts have suggested that younger children could be brought back before teenagers, who appear to be more susceptible to infection and are also more able to learn independently from home”

This might be true, BUT teens are also more able to understand and to independently maintain necessary social spacing, keep masks properly on their faces, and take and sustain other critical safety measures.  Can you imagine the K-6 group doing all that?  They can hardly resist sticking their hands into one another’s food or, during a lice outbreak, resist hugging, sharing hat and hair accessories at school. 

And how will the bathrooms be managed??  Especially when many (most?) schools already lacked the money to hire enough staff and when having adult monitors alone in the bathroom with a child presents a greater risk of abuse to the child and liability to the adult."
2020-04-29 10:29,"""“I saw the president say, the kids don’t get sick,” Ms. Robinson said. “Well, they’re not in there all by themselves...""
This is the first of many articles about re-opening schools that I've read that recognizes the problem teachers and other school employees will face when schools re-open.  Even if kids are only exposed to each other for far fewer hours, the teachers will be there all day long, five days a week, in a closed room full of children, any one of which could be an asymptomatic career.  Any teacher over 50, or any obese, hypertensive, or diabetic teacher would be crazy to put herself in that position.
There are two issues that need to be considered separately--
One, how do we provide day care for children so their parents can return to work?  and 
Two, how do we provide quality public education while still fighting this virus?"
2020-04-29 10:32,"I’m an administrator in a school of nearly 2500 students, built in 1922 with each class maxed out at 31 per class. Our three daily lunch periods have over 800 kids per session.  How do we keep students six feet apart from one another when the physical plant itself doesn’t permit it? We all desperately want to return to “traditional school,” but I suspect that model will soon belong to a bygone era."
2020-04-29 10:37,"Has the President or any of his family members seen what a public school classrooms look like ? Do they know how many children ride on a school bus at any given time ? Have they seen students in the cafeteria? 

Why wouldn’t the medical community or doctors from his task force just nip this idea in the bud ? Why wait till this news is all over the news throwing parents into panic? Let’s not forget that there are mini Trump Governors around this country who would jump and do anything to please their master, even sacrifice the health and safety of our children."
2020-04-29 10:46,This is sad.  The statement that remote learning may be the new norm is crazy as I patently does not work at all.  Kids need an education in a loving environment not in a sanitized prison setting where you are taught by masked people afraid to get anywhere near anyone and without recess.  The world needs to learn to live with this.  We need to develop herd immunity.  There is no risk to children. If you are an at risk teacher you will need to decide if you want to continue being a teacher.  If you are not an at risk teacher you have nothing to worry about as the risk of dying from covid is half of that associated with driving a car.  There is no perfect solution here without hard choices but we can’t continue to shutter everything. It is not fair to our youth.
2020-04-29 10:42,"Rushing to reopen schools is a horrifying idea.  I teach in a small room with poor ventilation.  Even with social distancing measures, that’s a lot of virus potentially floating through the air and no way to escape it.  A return to school in mid-May, as Governor Murphy suggests, means that it’s only a matter of time before students bring the virus home to their families, neighbors and friends and that so many teachers and staff get sick that schools will be functioning on a skeleton crew.  At that point, students won’t be dealing with virtual learning - they’ll be dealing with no learning.
I look forward to the day when I can teach normally again, but only when it’s at least reasonably safe to do so."
2020-04-29 10:51,"I am a school monitor in a high school with about 1000 students. I am in the front of the building and once entrants get in through our security vestibule, they pass me. I also direct late students to sign in. I am 68 and my wife is a school retiree who is a double cancer survivor. In late December, I had the worst cough of my life. My cough was productive and I had no fever unlike Covid symptoms that I hear about which include a dry cough and fever. I know that Gov Cuomo wants to test front line workers. School employees should be added to the top of the list. It may be that I did indeed have the novel virus and have antibodies. I still have fear of bringing home contagion to a high risk wife but it could be that many of us have been infected.Our school is located in Westchester which was the initial “outbreak county” in NY. C’ mon Gov, start testing availability for us."
2020-04-29 10:53,"The article neglects a couple of important areas that desperately need attention when considering and planning for school re-openings and operations during pandemic.

1)  How federal, state, and local school funding structures and truancy policies support, or disincentivize, adherence to sound public health practices.  For example, those funding structures that rely on daily pupil attendance rates, or average daily attendance, rather than being based on actual enrollment don’t work well for schools, families, or public health in regular conditions; they seem fatally flawed during pandemic and post-pandemic conditions.

2). Just as employers whose employees now are working from home are being asked by Governors and public health officials to allow, and perhaps require, employees to continue to work from home even once the government lifts/eases stay-at-home orders, so too should schools maintain the capacity and option for students to continue online, and maybe other forms of, school-from-home learning until a child-safe, reliable and affordable vaccine is widely available.  Resources  for that need to be made available and allocated."
2020-04-29 10:56,"The young seem to fare best with only mild or even no symptoms which makes them ideal carriers of this disease.  In the typical crowded classroom of 30 students, it can quickly spread among them.  And those 30 at a minimum can infect 60, their parents, which can then spread it further.  

Growing up during a time without the current vaccines, chicken pox, measles, etc., I saw, including myself, the diseases step through each and everyone of my classmates.  So, there is no reason that COVID-19 would not spread in a similar manner."
2020-04-29 11:02,"This left me scratching my head.  How can Trump make money off kids going back to school before public health experts believe it's safe?  Trump University was shuttered for fraud, so there's no tuition coming in.  So how can Trump get more votes if the schools open prematurely?  Their parents might be grateful, but only until they get sick.

The answer is twofold.  Trump knows everything and can't keep his mouth shut.  He's an expert on the virus, education, pediatric health, and everything else associated with this issue.  But only in his own strange little mind."
2020-04-29 11:12,"All interesting ideas but not very well thought out.  For example, in a scenario where children go a couple days a week, where are they on the days they don't go to school?   Their parents are working. In a day care?  With vulnerable grandparents?  And can you imagine putting 11-13 year olds in a day care with babies?  How does this help?
We need better plans..."
2020-04-29 11:12,"Maybe We will have to amend our ""Core-Value-Statement"" (Mission statement) to include something like: 

* All students, faculty and staff are committed to dutifully wearing PPE while following and maintaining Social Distancing guidelines in an overt commitment to the success and health of our diverse community of learners.
*Our community of learners includes many who continue to shelter in place and participate in Distance Learning (remote).
*Access to PPE and Distance Learning Resources shall be provided to ALL students maintaining equitable access to grade level academics, social activities, support and wrap around services and all other aspects of our learning community.
...but regardless of what we print, tweet, or say it will be our actions as individuals and collectively that will determine our new school reality going forward.  I for one am concerned knowing what I know as a 25+ year teacher who follows the news and cares about the truth."
2020-04-29 11:33,"North Carolina has already closed schools for this school year. It’s the only common sense thing to do.

My question is how will we move forward in the fall. How will already crowded classrooms maintain the necessary social distancing?"
2020-04-29 11:38,"As a student in Georgia, I can say that we weren’t ready under normal conditions. There’s no way to social distance in our hallways. Some classes are only taught by one teacher for one semester, so those naturally have 30+ kids in them. We can’t go back until the Fall. Maybe not even then."
2020-04-29 11:38,"A teacher here, on a good day, the stomach virus is running through the building. On a bad day , it's flu season and multiple students are absent for a week at minimum,  that was  flu season in December 2019. Can you imagine what a school would be like with the corona virus (plague) and no vaccine? 

Furthermore,  if you think the whole ""boycott the state test"" movement was a big deal, you ain't seen nothing yet. How many people would send their kids to school without a vaccine?"
2020-04-29 11:35,"DT keeps kids in cages, without adequate medical assistance,  hygienic access, or even a blanket. Do readers thinks he cares if schools open and kids get the virus? He wants to force the economy to open to enhance his election prospects and could care less if he has to do it on the sickbed of kids."
2020-04-29 11:31,"an actual president would be using every tool of the Federal government to acquire and distribute critical materiel (as was done in real wars, by real Presidents) instead of lying (no it's not a hoax, no drinking bleach is not a good idea), dividing (there are not blue COVID and red COVID states....) ,  urging insurrection (Michigan does not need to be ""liberated""), and gaging every single action and statement by how it will impact him personally and politically.
This administration will go down in history as how absolutely NOT to run a government."
2020-04-29 11:38,"Why does Trump care about schools opening up sooner rather than later?

Is it just that he perceives a return to ""normalcy"" in this area as an election advantage?"
2020-04-29 12:01,"I worry greatly for the young children of this nation. I have already seen the adverse emotional and psychological effects this has had on my own elementary-aged children as well as the near impossibility of educating them via distance learning. My children are fortunate enough to come from a loving home with two college educated parents available to help them through this, but most children in this nation are not. 

We must weigh and consider the psychological, emotional, and educational impact this will have on our nation’s children before any decisions are made for September."
2020-04-29 11:04,"As always, Trump has no understanding of what he’s talking about. More American citizens—especially American children—will die as a result. Through his ignorance, his sloth and his unearned arrogance, Trump has gotten us stuck in an unsolvable puzzle, with no way out."
2020-04-29 12:04,"This is yet another example of how the virus disproportionately disadvantages the poor and lower middle classes since children from these backgrounds are less likely to acclimate to the demands of virtual learning, have fewer resources, and are more likely to see their parents working not from home but at their usual work sites. The school closings obviously hurt all children, both educationally and in terms of their social development, but they also typically hinder the productivity of those parents forced to work at home and therefore create an additional drag on restarting the economy. Danish officials made this point when they moved to reopen schools last week."
2020-04-29 12:13,"Reopening schools in the fall on a staggered schedule should be a non-starter. Parents cannot continue working full time jobs while watching small kids. As a progressive, I will be completely opposed to the teachers union if they push for this. Teachers need to take on their fair share of the health and economic risks from this outbreak."
2020-04-29 12:15,"'Illinois officials have gone even further, warning that remote learning could continue indefinitely.'

Of course.  As long as they (educators) are getting their full salaries and feel no particular impact from the scourge, they can preach infinite lockdowns.  As soon as you put them into the same boat with the majority of the Americans (salary cuts furloughs), they would be signing a different tune.
Besides, that actually could/should happen soon.  The states have no money since there is no business.  Their employees should feel that, one way or the other.

The schools should remain closed as long as it is needed but let us not get that far ahead and try to normalize this extraordinary situation as a 'new normal'.   Better look for the ways that 'new normal' is as close as possible to the 'old normal'."
2020-04-29 12:17,"In this time of crisis people seem to speak more directly, with less of a filter.  This has brought to light an underlying truth - that many people see the primary objectives for schools is to provide nutrition and childcare.  The actual education of our children appears to be a lower concern."
2020-04-29 12:18,My classroom temperatures reach over 90 degrees in June and September.  (I have a donated air conditioner but there is not enough electricity in the wall for it to work.) Most of our classrooms are not wired for air conditioning or have broken air conditioners.   My students are packed in my classroom where we all sweat together and use misting bottles.  You tell me how I'm supposed to be safe in the classroom.
2020-04-29 12:00,"Lock me up.  I would never send my kids back to school in the midst of this.  What kind of role modeling is not standing up for the health of your family, the health of others, the health of a country? 

I would want my kids to know even if a president of the United States says something, believes something, gives an executive order for something I will protect my family no matter what. 

How could anyone even fathom the idea?  Let alone a president?"

2020-04-29 12:11,"Beyond mere negligence, much of Trump's and his regime's behavior is malevolent. Trump and his sycophants knew that potentially millions of Americans could die but chose to do nothing. His administration has gone so far as to purge people from the government who were trying to warn the public.

Again, that behavior is part of the psychology of malignant narcissistic leaders. They are democidal. Malignant narcissistic leaders kill many of their own people through wars and political terror, but also through willful incompetence. These types of leaders actively do things that will kill large portions of the population. Causing harm is a type of addiction for them. Donald Trump's addiction is only getting worse.

There is no reason not to have school, especially for young children, who miss so much from being kept at home."
2020-04-29 12:43,"Every time a read an article about schools and the corona virus I see the word “retention” bandied about by local politicians and state officials, and I am horrified.  These folks need to do some research. Positive outcomes from retention are extremely rare, and most teachers and principals are extremely judicious in its use as an answer to learning deficits.  The words retention and FAILURE are synonymous in world of kids.  Just think about being viewed as a failure by your peers at age twelve.  This is what will happen if school systems pick and choose who repeats a grade and who moves ahead. God help us if they base it on standardized test scores, or if it comes down to who had a computer at home or whose mother could be diligent about following lesson plans.  The same is true if the decision is to hold everyone back.  The truth is that there are kids who will flourish despite a three month hiatus. They have already acquired the necessary skills to move ahead.  That is hard for some educators and politicians to swallow, but it is true.  Are we going to penalize these kids?

This debate also, as usual, gives teachers very little credit for skill. Most teachers already teach in classrooms where children display a two to five year difference in skill acquisition and they work diligently to narrow that gap.  School systems face serious financial challenges; retention carries a huge emotional and financial cost.  Money should be used to support kids as they move foreword."

2020-04-29 12:37,"Trump does not care about education, which is why he expressed love for the poorly educated during the campaign.  Opening the schools when the school year is about to end anyway is a political stunt, meant to create an illusion of normalcy to benefit his reelection.

Children are susceptible to coronavirus infections, even though the symptoms are usually mild or nonexistent.  But an infected child is still contagious, so they'll infect their teachers, parents and grandparents, who can become seriously ill and possibly die."
2020-04-29 12:55,"And how will working parents manage an every other day school schedule? Tell their bosses that they can only work on Tuesdays, Thursdays and half of Fridays? No, this is not the answer. It still severely handicaps parents and leaves children under-educated and requiring care that many parents will not be able to give. To every commentor on here asking ""How can you justify putting the teachers and school staff at risk by opening up schools?"", I'd ask why we are differentiating their jobs and their health from from those of front line workers, the restaurant staff, the grocery store workers, the millions of people who have worked through the peak of the virus outbreak and will continue to do so. And let's not forget that school staff will not be returning to work in a vacuum- when they return to work their students' parents will also presumably be returning to work, so this is in no way singling out teachers and school employees out of disregard for their health outcomes."
2020-04-29 12:47,"So I’m going to say something controversial that wildly diverges from my mostly progressive political beliefs... and this is based on my own personal experience as a K-12 teacher.

Now would be an excellent time for states to trim the fat — and they can do this by revamping teacher pay and qualification standards. I have been saying this for a very long time, but not all teachers are created equal. Nor are all principals. They should therefore not be getting paid the same amount across the board. 

A highly qualified science teacher should be getting paid more than a PE teacher. And this trend of PE teachers obtaining administrative degrees simply because they’re mostly men and they want to make more money? It needs to stop. No school is better off with a principal who has only ever taught PE. This “old school” mentality has to change. 

These problems did not suddenly emerge due to Coronavirus. They’ve been around for a LONG time. I played sports in school, I’m from a family of athletes, and I think PE teachers are vital to every school. But when you can’t attract a highly qualified science teacher because they can make more money working for a pharmaceutical company, and someone with a PE degree ends up teaching your child biology, do you want that, really?

It’s time to revamp our pay scale so that we can move forward. Yes, I’m looking forward to getting back in a football stadium this fall (maybe). But I’d rather have competent science teachers any day of the week!"
2020-04-29 12:51,"Most other countries of the world are opening up and sending their students back to school in the beginning of May. You can't open up society without opening the schools. And the children are safe. the numbers of children effected by Covid-19 are tiny. They'll face more risk on the school bus or in the car on the way to and from school. 

Our schools will be destroyed by extending closures. Which may just be what many billionaires and business leaders are salivating over. ""Distance learning"", or whatever you want to call it is a disaster for students, and more work for teachers and parents."
2020-04-29 13:00,"The high school where I taught is one large U shaped building, for the most part.  There are entrances to the building in three locations, one along each leg and one in the middle of the bottom of the U.  The hallways are about 15 feet wide.  This building was designed for 3000 students.  When the school population grew to 3200, they built an annex across the street.  That building has two entrances.  

Now, how does a high school get even half that many teenage students to pass in the hallways from class to class in a social distancing way?  Contract tracing would probably indicate that one single case of the virus in the school would expand quickly expand to half of the 3200  students, all needing testing to see who is now infected.  And lunch period?

Staggering passing periods quickly is a nightmare.  And students cohorts do not make it easier.   All students take the four core studies, but at different levels.  One AP English student should be in Algebra 2 for math, while another should be in AP Calculus.  Then there are the classes where social distancing won’t work.  In the last decade, the school marching band has been to the Macy’s parade, London (invites by the Lord Mayor, himself), the Fiesta Bowl, etc.  We send a number of those students to top level music schools around the country.

A one size fits all approach will not work.  A whole lot more thought will be necessary to open schoools."

2020-04-29 13:02,"The first and best thing we should do is to open schools immediately and let the virus spread through them to have herd immunity for them. Based on all the available data, there is no risk to them. Most of them may have had the virus already  in NYC school system. If they had it already, they are not a threat to anybody. Whetehr they had it or not should be dtermined through antibody tests. Students with some underline problems should be isolated and allowed to study from home through online.  Teachers and other people working at schools should take social distancing measures using common sense. People who are over 60 and who have immune problems may have to sit at home. Parents should also take social distancing measures, if their kids hadn't gone through infection.  There is no point of keeping students isolated."

2020-04-29 13:31,"I’m amazed at the number of commenters who think teachers doing remote learning have it easy and should be forced back into the classroom. 

I’m a high school social studies teacher with two decades of experience currently working full time doing remote learning. If you think this is easy, try it. Simultaneously, my wife is working full time as a public interest lawyer. We juggle these jobs while taking care of our preschooler, who needs constant attention. Like everyone else, we have no childcare, although we are continuing to pay our daycare out of a sense of communal obligation. 

My school has 4000 kids. We regularly have have 25 in classroom. Observing social distancing and providing safe learning in that environment would be impossible. 

You seem to think I should risk my life, and children’s lives, going back to school. Why? So you can go back to work? I interpret that to mean that you think your job is more important than my life, my student’s lives and the well being of my own children. 

It’s not. We won’t go back until it’s safe, and our unions will protect us in this. If you don’t like it, address your concerns to the federal politicians who have done little to support average people who are suffering financially and even less to meaningfully test, trace and control the virus."
2020-04-29 13:40,"I work as a high school library media specialist.  First, I would like to know how schools would be able to keep up with cleaning chairs, tables, doors, door frames, laptops - library distributes them daily to hundreds or thousands of students, printers, Makerspace area, etc. -- when schools do not even provide wipes or hand sanitizers!   

My high school did not provide either wipes or hand sanitizers in Feb or Mar for the library media center, despite it being a very affluent school district and evidence/ need for the cleaning supplies.  Are they going to supply them now?  Then who does such cleaning constantly?  How?  Are staff/ faculty supposed to risk their health and our families in this process too?

Second, the vast majority of schools easily have over 50 students in a cafeteria, library, hallway, etc. at any one time.  
Logistically, how are schools supposed to adhere to the restricted number of people for social gatherings?

Third, all this talk about staggered times with public schools is talk and without consideration for the practicalities involved.  Teachers' unions would have to agree with them.  Would the same teachers, librarians, and other staff/ faculty be expected to work such staggered times then?"
2020-04-29 13:41,"Gavin Newsom's idea to restart the school year in July has a lot of merit. Even during normal times, research shows that students lose ground over the summer and have to be brought back up to speed over a number of weeks to make up for the summer interregnum. Why add more months onto the enforced minimum three-month shutdown most schools will have endured even before the official summer break begins?

Another reason to start back up when it's safe in mid-summer is that distance learning, which has been  gradually developing at the college level and in industry for ten to 15 years, is still not perfected, and, to be honest, what is happening now in many districts is not true distance learning as practiced at a high level, but more makeshift and impromptu. Distance teaching and learning is not just 'motorized' classroom teaching and learning, but a new form of instruction that applies sometimes radically different pedagogical concepts and values. The quicker we get kids off the mostly less-than-optimal online teaching most are currently experiencing, the better."

2020-04-29 13:19,"This doesn’t make sense. Schools reopening would require a staggering amount of resources (masks, hand sanitizer, etc.) that the country can barely supply to even hospitals right now. That’s not to even mention the huge amount of working tests this would require. It would also require a government that could efficiently get these supplies into the hands of educators. Literally everyone reading this knows the likelihood of that actually happening. 

That this is even being talked about is completely irrational. It is almost as if we Americans are addicted to the past, almost like a drug. Instead of taking a cold, hard look at present and future needs, we just want to go back to “the way things were” even at the cost of lives."

Heck in other parts of the state! I live in Western NY. In our area, fewer than 100 people have died and the vast majority of them over the age of 70 (unfortunately, it found its way into several nursing homes). Of course that's very sad but no reason why schools should remain closed for years. We've been protected because the way we live normally - more spread out, little public transportation - means we've always socially distanced to a larger degree than urban dwellers. Schools should open here in the fall."
2020-04-29 13:55,"My youngest is a first year in University in Quebec. When the university moved to online learning, most of the kids from other provinces and many from the US left to go home. The dorm then implemented rules to keep the remaining 300 kids separated. In the cafeteria, you could only eat at the designated time assigned to you, on paper plates, and you had to social distance. More importantly, talking was forbidden as it would encourage kids to congregate.

Two weeks later when they abruptly shut down the dorm, I learned about all of this. By then, the stress and loneliness had taken a severe mental toll. 

I'm now just imagining the schools in which the lunchroom is like what my son experienced. I think there will be a large, mental health price to pay. I'd rather schools stay closed than put the kids into bad situations where either their physical or mental health is at risk."

Oh, and all those federal, state and muni budget cuts that closed any school that was not maxed-out?  Does the term ""coming home to roost"" ring a bell?

Masks.  Kids can't keep their shoes on for a whole day.  They lose entire backpacks.  They struggle to bring a notebook and pencil to the next class three minutes from the last one.  They're not dumb or malicious, they're KIDS.  

We can't get 100% of adults to responsibly walk through a grocery store.  You expect kids to do so?  And when they understand their spit is now weaponized, watch what happens on the playground or in a routine spat.  (Hint, adults are already doing this, you can look it up).

2020-04-29 14:48,"Trump’s personal organizing principle is rooted in the status of the American “economy” in the narrow sense of that easily misunderstood word. With him it seems everything is “for sale,” and that any lingering “deal” can be eventually made if pressed, ie, “sell out.” Trump acts consistently as a slave to personal ego for the sake of private power; and as a result as president, his use of the power of his office is reckless. What Trump seems not to understand is that a parent’s devotion to children is not for sale, even with a failing “economy.” As important as money is and has place, it is not God and it can’t substitute for love. Trump’s failure is in not realizing the deep and sustaining principle of “covenant” ... which is not negotiable and applies to parents of school children especially. To be plain: It is not yet safe for children to return to school as if the threat of COVID-19 has been nullified. The death of even 1 child from doing so as “collateral damage” for the sake of the “economy” is unspeakably heartless and immoral. We have a leader in Trump whom we should not even listen to as regards children returning to school at this time, period. He is not competent for making this recommendation ... or, as he probably prefers to say, “order.”"
2020-04-29 13:32,"I don't think there's a perfect answer here.

The unfortunate reality is that Covid19 isn't going anywhere, anytime soon.  It would be a miracle if there's a vaccine within a year or two, which was manufactured and distributed at high enough levels to make a difference.  We can hope, but that's not a sure enough thing to plan on.  That means we will have to live with it and living with it means it will continue to spread at some level until we reach herd immunity.

It is not feasible to shut school indefinitely and, as a parent of three high functioning lovers of learning, I can assure everyone that remote learning isn't really learning.

At greatest risk in opening schools, is the increased exposure of our teachers and families to Covid19.  While measures should certainly be taken to slow the spread for all, could we not be practical and focus some increased efforts on protecting the most vulnerable teachers and families?  I think that will work best.

The easiest way to keep people safe would be if many of the children in low risk households had already gotten the virus and become immune - therefore, unable to spread it to higher risk individuals.  (For anyone who's going to say antibodies aren't effective immunity, please google ""how vaccines work"").  

Let's let the children who want to and are low risk (including families) play this summer - get the virus and safely get over it -that will be the most effective measure to prevent transmission once school finally opens."
2020-04-29 14:33,"This is a time to be creative in education.  There are now unimaginably new e-resources that in terms of the curriculum are tremendously valuable for students' daily and lifelong education.  Museums, Google Arts and Culture, EdX are just a few examples. Many educators believe it is critical for students to become life long learners and problem solvers using STEAM tools.  

As a first step, require students to select a topic of interest, research it using online resources and teachers grading the students' work based upon appropriate universal rubrics. 

 For years, National History Day has provided a way for students to learn and share their learning about a wide range of topics."

The most vulnerable of an already vulnerable group, kids with disabilities are getting the short end of the stick. I'd like to see schools step up and provide one on one in person instruction for kids with disabilities over the summer to help them make up for the instruction minutes in their IEP that were missed. We were already failing kids with disabilities. Let's not compound that failure. I'm sure some teachers feel ok about their risks and would agree to work over the summer. There is already a services cliff kids fall over when they hit 21- time is ticking away for many kids. They need skills and they need support."

I’d be willing to bet there isn’t a public school in the country with a state-of-the-art HVAC system, and kids are going to be in those rooms for hours at a time. We should apply the same thinking to classrooms as we do to airplanes; there’s no escaping the virus. Unless the federal government is going to fund viral air cleaning in every school building, we don’t have a true starting point until we have a meaningful treatment and/or vaccine. It’s time to think outside the box. Learning at home with parental guidance is a disaster for the economy, returning to schools is foolhardy... what’s option number 3?"

We may have time on our hands; we certainly don’t have the money. 

Besides, it sounds like we’re actually looking for daycare. How about hiring some of those high school students to come in, babysit AND deal with lessons. It would let parents go to work, provide a little income for high school kids, and be a great educational experience for all those at-home learners—K-12."
2020-04-29 14:30,"Unfortunately it isn't just Donald Trump advocating for early school openings. My governor in California (who I believe is doing a great job) has publicly advocated opening schools in June or July for the 2020-21 school year: All on the premise that California's children have lost ""too much"" of their knowledge from Aug 2019 (when the school year began) to March 13, 2020 (when California schools closed). Apparently the 30 weeks prior, were meaningless.

It is unfortunately that so many without an ounce of pedagogy or classroom experience have latched onto a fairly recent fallacy of  knowledge retention- (of lack of).  

The reality: By April most schools are ""wrapping up"" the school year. Proms are being held. Elementary field-trips are taken. Seniors are working on completing any grade deficits...Beside, the logistics of physical distancing on a  high school campus or PLAYGROUND and too-small Cafeterias would be a nightmare:

I would love nothing more than to back in the classroom with my students, whom I care about deeply, but how can we even get to our manifestly unsafe building without coming into contact with hundreds of commuters every day?

We can make some common sense steps such as increased cleaning and perhaps spreading desks out a bit, but I fear that government officials will require impractical mandates that cannot be followed.

I understand that our economy is a mess over this global pandemic, however, reopening schools or reopening inessential businesses puts an increasing number of people at risk. If businesses are slowly starting to reopen and schools, how do we know if they are actually prepared to keep their workers safe? Do they have access to face masks and other protective gear?

So countries will probably have an hard long look at what they can afford to be produced outside there own borders, production will be more decentralised and mixed (think PPE)

Second, now that we are all in pretty big trouble due to a virus that showed up in an unidentified country in east Asia which was nevertheless very forthcoming and efficient in handling it, China can finally turn towards domestic consumers who will be free to spend all they want on all the infinite number of goods they have been producing.

With job losses brings a glut of apartments and commercial real estate that was already in trouble. One example, Conde Nast, on its way out and with it, lots of well paying jobs.  Who wants to or can live in New York under these conditions? Sure bottom feeders will snap up some real estate, but the average person considering a 2-5 million dollar apartment? They are rethinking their lives and not buying anything at the moment."
2020-04-28 16:31,"You can count on Chinese to spend on good food, sight-seeing travel, and luxury cosmetics.  

Chinese love to eat. They may not go for trendy cloth or chase new fashion design, they will go for a good meal.  Even during soft lockdown in some Chinese cities, people line up with social distancing in mind for famous local beef soup noodle or other delicacies. I personally haven't met any Chinese who doesn't love certain Chinese dishes. Pretty soon, they will go back to restaurants, café, and high class hotels for new dinning experience. That is a sure thing.

I watched another HK news that surprised me.  When Wuhan lockdown was lifted,  people rushed out for sight-seeing trips to Huang Shan and other famous destination.  They wanted to make up the lost time due to lockdown during the traditional Chinese Lunar New Year holidays. In addition, middle and upper class Chinese cannot travel abroad, they will spend domestically instead. This will boost the domestic travel a lot.

Lastly, French luxury brands already reported that their first quarter earnings were down except China, which showed positive improvement in March due to reopen the business at that time.  Chinese customers traditional contribute significantly to French company earnings.  This trend will continue when things are opening up more."

You know this is true, and I know this is true, so don’t call this a pile of covfefe!"

The fat cats in Corporate America would sell their own mothers down the river for a few filthy dollars. To the extent possible, at least all strategic goods and associated raw materials should be produced in America, in America owned factories staffed with American workers. The two main challenges will be forcing greedy Corporate America to pull out of China and to be circumspect. Regarding the latter, if the trend is too radical we'll have a problem. Corporate America stupidly out of greed put our fate in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party and the CCP has us by the short hairs. What will we do if China significantly raises the prices on medications and medical equipment, for example, most of which is produced in China? Things are never simple."

As per a study by Nomura Group on 56 companies shifting production out of China, 26 went to Vietnam, 11 to Taiwan and 8 to Thailand. Only three went to India. And in the coming days we might see more going out of China. Japan is already winding up some of its operations from China back to Japan and some to India. So fearing more such 'relocations', China's factories are back in production, of course with skeletal staff, as many fears to join back. It is really going to be a tough task, more tough than handling covid-19 situation for China in retaining the remaining factories and other establishments."

Now, Covid-19 has forced billions of us around the world to go back to basics and limit our consumption to necessities. I see this as a needed shift to our culture of mindless consumption, but every NYT business article I've read seems to decry decreased spending on luxury and consumer goods as a huge loss for the world. Come on, NYT, connect the dots. Unnecessary consumption = unnecessary environmental destruction. How about an article about the mines that can be closed because we've realized we don't need 2 cars and 10 devices per household?"

Andrew Yang started down that road, but many more changes need to occur. BTW, there have been many economies in human history. Clinging to one that started 300 to 600 years ago, with fundamentally different circumstances, is ultimately self-defeating."

No matter. Store shelves will be choked full with fresh inventories flown in from...Nebraska? Pennsylvania? Car plants won't keep up with the demand either.
Apple will delay its annual iphone release extravaganza by about a month. The faithful will be lining up 2 weeks ahead of time to grab one of the new models, aptly called 'iphone $', made entirely in the USA. Prices will start at around $2,000 and up, with the top model (the iphone $$$$) hitting the $5,000 mark.
Drug companies and the agri-business will not experience any shortage of basic materials; food processors will churn out volumes unheard of. WalMart will retool entirely and switch to buy only locally made junk. The 26 million plus unemployed will all go back to work and paid more, so they can afford to live.

2020-04-28 18:15,"China has a lot more tools in their tool box to jump start their economy than us.  For one thing, they don't have a political party, like our GOP who always favors corporate welfare over their people.  They have room to stimulate their economy by spending more on their people's well being, such as health and retirement, which is none existence. 

The Chinese government through their industrial and modernization policies transferred China from a dysfunctional country like India into modernity like the west and modern countries in Asia.  Hopefully they will soon realize that this is the perfect opportunity to stimulate their economy by having much better social safety net resembling  successful countries in the West and Asia.  

Owning a Chinese company as an American, I always tell my employees that their government is far more competent than ours, perhaps one of the most in the entire globe.  If they stimulate their economy with more social welfare spending, their growth will help the entire world get out of our economic mess."

2020-04-28 18:51,"Good. bad.  Time to rein in the consumer economy  -- time to rethink the entire economy.  I suspect income inequality is as bad in China as in the USA.  

The stock market has to stop being the barometer of the economy  -- it has little to do with it in reality.

Social goals need to be set.  Will the US get single payer universal healthcare after this?  I doubt it.  BTW what is China's system of healthcare?   Will American citizen s be willing to help bringing in the wheat and why not? or changing beds and gardening and cooking and cleaning a Trump hotels -- and if not why not?  (We know that many companies do not want to hire actual Americans who might be well complainers and trouble makers.

I think it is really impt. that the consumer-garbage making economy not recover.  Why all of the throw-away stuff?  Why not washable hospital gowns?  Does everything I buy have to come encased in throw away plastic?  Why not a container that gets returned to the store (like bottles and reused -- what a quaint idea - reuse.  I marvel at the packaging; I have no need for Tupperware! So many containers I cannot use all of them   RETHINK.

No body has $$ but the CEOs and all sorts of people - sports figures, coaches, TV personalities, etc. are often over paid.  (and supported by those advertising the throw-away products the people are no longer buying??)

If our government does one thing I hope it is a requirement that American corporation making and selling medicine, medical equipment, and food must be based in America, and reserve a stockpile for Americans.

This pandemic has also taught us that we can work from home, work less, cut our own hair, cook our own meals, grow some of our own food, sew our own clothes, save more, watch fewer movies and TV, stay closer to home, and just get by with less overall. It has also reinforced how much we dislike cheap (and often poisonous) stuff  that is made in China. We will spend more for quality products made in ANY country other than China, or we will do without. We will continue to go out of our way to do business with companies who do NOT have operations, manufacturing, production in China."

I've watched the greedy, terrible people who wrecked it continue to get away with it while the rest of us pay for their mistakes every single time. The system that is rigged to make those very same bad actors very rich is also suffocating the planet, making it less habitable for lifeforms such as our own every passing year. So, I'm going on economic strike. I never lived lavishly (good savings, maxed 401K every year, modest purchaser) but I'm going full Depression Era grandparent in the aftermath of this and living like my salary is 1/4th of what it actually is.

Consider the fracas between the ReOpen vs Don'tOpen groups. If corona testing & cures arrive quickly, the ReOpen group wins but if death rates spike, the Don'tOpen crowd will gain prominence and demand we repeat the last 6 weeks of complete shutdown.

The point is that neither side can accurately predict how quickly testing and cures will arrive. Economics aside, considering the death rate, the ReOpen crowd is taking more risk."

That is different than here in the US.  Here a lot of people spend much MORE than they have and pay whatever the outrageous credit card interest rate is (20%?) for the privilege.  They are encouraged to bankrupt themselves by a bankrupt culture.  

We need a better social safety net in the US, but we also need a cultural shift to a personal safety net--a savings account.   

It used to be that spending meant you were supporting good US factory jobs that paid a living wage and provided heath insurance without a five-figure deductible, and even a pension.  

Now that spending means you are enriching hedge funds that pay zero taxes, China, and creating terrible ""service"" jobs that pay a pittance and force workers to survive on food stamps, housing subsidies, and Medicaid."

However, the calls for boycotts against China are quite misguided. First of all, it's discriminatory to target over a billion people because of the bad actions of a few government officials in Wuhan. It is like the BDS movement against Israel--there are legitimate criticisms you can make of the government, but boycotting everything from that country just to protest their government is discriminatory. If you would not want to be judged based on the actions of Trump or of the governor of a state you don't even live in, then you should not judge Chinese businesses based on the failings of Xi or the Wuhan local officials either.

Moreover, it's hard to see how boycotts would even hurt China as a whole (as opposed to the individual businesses that would be targeted). China isn't sending us goods for the heck of it; they need our dollars to buy things that they need, as well as have a rainy day fund in a reserve currency. The largest imports of China are tourism, oil, and semiconductors. Tourism is basically gone now anyway, oil is very cheap, and the dollar status as reserve currency is precarious, so China will not need as many dollars to buy things it needs."

I am pretty sure from what I here, also the luxury segment will be hit pretty hard even if they will try to bring down internal costs even more to compensate missing sales as always.

2020-04-28 20:59,"Unfortunately, Americans will be convinced that the way to ""stimulate the economy' is to give more tax breaks to the wealthiest, agree that executives should be paid in one day what the average worker earns in a year or two, perhaps 3 or more, that workers have to accept cutbacks in their pay and benefits and it is their fault so there will be layoffs.

This belies the simple fact that consumers, and only consumers ""Create Jobs."" But the wealthy don't want that known, they want to don the mantle of ""Job Creator"" when they do everything possible to minimize wages and workers while maximizing their compensation and shifting the cost of poor executive and management decisions onto the workers by laying them off when their decisions don't make a profit. 

We learned this back in the 1940's and 50's but by the 60's we bought the idea that the wealthy create jobs. By the 80's pay for workers got frozen in buying power terms while management and executive compensation soared. 

The wealthy manipulated the mortgage market and the workers paid the price in foreclosures and job loss while top pay soared more. 

Today we are told that only the wealthy create jobs. Maybe it's time to call that idea exactly what it is: A LIE (or as Trump would say: ""Fake News"") The lesson I learned in Bus-101 - a business only exists as long as it has paying customers is still true.

2020-04-28 21:41,"All this talk about moving manufacturers back to America is misplaced. For a large swatch of the products produced for everyday items, the economic costs of making it on US soil is just not there. Economies of scale for everyday prosaic items are just not there, even if you were able to automate the heck out of it. The problem is the bulk of the consumers are the poor, or lower middle class, and a portion of the middle class. The purchasing power of this group is low. If you cannot provide the product at a price point they can afford, your idea of reshoring the manufacturing is totally misplaced.

American tax policies and government regulations are ever more tilted towards the wealthy. This gap is growing and is even more destructive to the social fabric of society.

People need to think beyond the 30 sec sound bites, thought bubbles shot out there like a shotgun blast by the politicians. Sadly, most voters are cognitively challenged to make the proper decision."

2020-04-28 21:22,"Let's remember this: China is anticipating a market. By the time they are up, running, and shipping goods, the US markets will be reasonably ready.
Yes, idiots will go out and endanger themselves too early, but as we come back on stream, consumer goods are going to be there. It'll be slow for awhile, small businesses will be devastated - particularly as big companies take over their market share, and you won't be able to get any meaningful help from the Oval Office, but even though another round of Covid-19 will be hitting us again in the fall, China's sales market timing is right."

Financially I've recovered.  Psychologically, I'm permanently scarred.  I've paid off my mortgage a few years ago.  And coincidentally I paid off the last of my student debt in January of this year. I save about 2/3 of my take-home pay.  3/4 if 401(k) is included.

Now that China has gear up for the recovery and from the response here and Wall Street they haven't learned anything. 
The Wall Street is discounting the pandemic and things will be normal soon. The stock market is back to last September prices. While the readers here think the lesson is U.S. will produce the PPE here instead of China. The word depression never even enter the discussion. China is telling you when U.S. reopens with 70% service economy compare with 45% in China the pain will persist not to mention the pandemic is under control in China and not even close to control here."
2020-04-28 19:32,"World is changing fast and so does the consumption patterns all around the globe. All economies will be affected and China is not an exception either. Chinese have done enormously well to combat covid crisis. West was a bit contemptuous when Chinese were in the thick of it and Trump ridiculed China oftenly. When Italians were facing the brunt of pandemic; EU didn't prove to be a credible partner. Regardless of blame game between China and America; Chinese remained steadfast and reasonable in their 
 response. Their leadership showed maturity and when Trump asked for medical equipment and PPE, they responded well. China is back with assembly lines and smart supply chains. I think they will be quick to re-adjust due to their first mover advantage in opening economy after covid recovery.

People, screaming 'stop buying Chinese products, that will teach them a lesson' should understand that it wasn't China that came to America offering their junk at ground floor prices; it was US companies, who went there in their perennial search for ways to increase 'shareholder value' the best way of which is cutting labour costs. What started as primitive jobber arrangements, slowly but surely turned into more and more involved and technologically advanced manufacturing. Today China can supply everything: from base materials, to semi-manufactured components and sophisticated turn-key applications and products as well.
There is not a single American-made product that doesn't contain a large percentage of Chinese-originated products and materials; be it a generic, or brand name drug, a smart phone, a car, even your orange juice, made of pulverised oranges.

This is a perfect opportunity to commence producing high quality products again.  It used to be that Made in America meant quality.  It hasn't for decades.  I'd rather spend my money on something that will last rather than what looks good but falls apart after a few washings or a few uses.  

One other thing; in the last month and a half we've learned what we can live without.  You're going to have to work hard to get us back.  Try treating us with respect.  We don't have to spend our money on your products if they aren't basic necessities."

The oldest people that I knew while young had lived through the great depression and the lessons they learned were never forgotten. Buy only what you need, buy quality and take care of the things that you buy. I predict that will become a lot more common among many around the world once the Corvid-19 pandemic is under control.

Unfortunately our economy has been built upon mindless consumption and if people start to buy thoughtfully and for only what they actually need we will never get back to where we formerly were."

Just take a look at pictures of hundreds of cars lining up in huge parking lots and along the roads from Pacific coast to Atlantic in USA, waiting since the early morning darkness to get a box or bags of donated grocery. Many who came late were turned away empty handed.

Our greed is just as strong as the manufacturers and corporations that sell us stuff. We cannot blame anyone but us.

We cannot support big corporation's greed. It is killing us as a nation and as individuals. ""Normal"" life was not quality life.

As a person who for years attempted to work for others only to have my credentials & abilities devalued in the traditional marketplace, attempting to build a following strictly based on critical thinking & intellectual pursuits, I found it difficult to attract followers in a world that promotes the superficial & popular over the substantive & intellectual. However, as a black American w/ 6 earned degrees from very elite universities, but could never get gainful employment, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE INTERNET. Why? Because the internet is destroying gatekeepers. No longer do you have to follow the old go-to-college-get-a-job mantra. The old work hard mantra is nonsense. The American dream is dead. With the internet, I can set up shop in any field or endeavor of my choosing, create social media pages, generate followers, monetize content & watch cash roll in. There are a ton of internet multimillionaires who will never apply to college, fill out a job application, get a recommendation letter, beg for a promotion, work for 30 years, build a 401(k), take orders from others & have their entire existence dependent on a company that will use them up & throw them away. That is an antiquated model. I blame much of this on the boomer generation who were able to get good jobs and good pensions, but did little to help the younger generations to a better life.

His employees are risking their lives and the boss' wife-to-be is posing half naked and blowing kisses at herself to show she's social distancing.

And in this article about Instagram Cash Giveaways, the money flow is clear, however the chasm between the old world and the new is just as glaring. 
I should probably re-read this article because I barely understood any of it, however what I did get is 1) people are basically buying instagram followers, even if marketers don't want to call it that, 2) the sponsors of these giveaways are not always transparent or even reputable and may even be breaking rules of instagram or state sweepstakes laws, leading me to believe that this wild west won't last much longer, and 3) perhaps the marketing world has finally found its holy grail-- to be able to market directly to your potential customer and create enormous brand loyalty through your followers who see your own content/advertising whenever you want.
It's as powerful a concept as it a shocking shift in the tectonics of ad marketing, and I don't really understand it at all, but I see the power and value in it (a lot more than renting a mansion to make 12-second dance sequences on tiktok!) and the ad agencies on Madison Ave must be quaking in their loafers!

The second question is when will we get them.   Both the article and the companies that are making the tests say June or July.

We are way too early opening up businesses because we have no national testing program in place, not nearly enough test kits, and and no one at the Federal Government able to accurately quantify and explain to the States what actions are necessary on their part to assure a safe reentry into the workplace and where social gathering may occur. It's all ad hoc analysis by Governor's and their staff, each State on its own.

I see no good outcome from opening up without an adequate test program in place."
2020-04-28 12:05,"Testing is not what we need. What we need are treatments that will prevent those who have the illness from becoming deadly. And we need an effect vaccination or a flu shot-like annual shot that will limit serious illness.

This virus is a symptomatic in many cases and mildly symptomatic in most others. Many of those people are not going to get tested—most wont think they need to and others won’t want to subject themselves to the uncomfortable nose swab. So how will testing help since they will still spread the virus? And if it is true that having antibodies to the virus does not protect one from getting the virus again, what good does testing really do? It would be a never ending series of tests that would add little useful information.

So we must focus on a cure for this novel and seemingly very different kind of virus, not on how to determine that we have it."

It does not say WHEN that will happen.

It is unconscionable that our taxpayer dollars fund such an inadequate effort to test citizens for the virus. I understand Trump might not want widespread testing because it will increase the number of positive results; however, this ""reopening"" will not happen without the confidence garnered through testing."
2020-04-28 12:12,"Over 50,000 deaths and 1 million confirmed cases.  That’s a 5 percent fatality rate compared to about 2 percent in other countries. Unless the virus is more deadly to Americans than others I’d say there are at least another 1.5 million cases that we are missing because we are testing far fewer people than other countries.  It’s definitely not time to go back to the way things were before the pandemic. We have to do more than flatten the curve."

Pence just agrees with whatever he says, helps him into the driver's seat, steps back, shuts the door, and watches as the vehicle weave all over the road, stops, and starts erratically while Trump texts and drives wherever he is taking us. The trouble is that he is driving a school bus with most Republican legislators on board."
2020-04-28 12:40,The incompetence is staggering!
2020-04-28 12:50,"Trump should be listened to now only to document his incompetence.  He is an utter failure not only as president, but also as an sentient human being."
2020-04-28 12:40,"I don't even bother to read any story with a headline containing the words ""Trump vows."" I also avoid articles  with headlines asserting that ""Trump promises"" or even ""Trump says.""

What's the point? By now no rational person can believe a single word that comes out of that man's mouth.

I know the Times has to cover these proclamations in the surreal era in which we are living. However, is it possible to bury them inside somewhere or at least serve them to us way ""below the fold,"" as we journalists used to say in the old days when every newspaper was actually paper?"
2020-04-28 12:37,"It appears Trump doesn’t think America is so great.  Maybe he has information we don’t.  Or maybe he doesn’t want to know how many people have COVID 19.  But it seems like he is conceding America is incapable of testing to the extent we need to.  
Or maybe it’s him and his administration.
Let’s give someone else a try.  I’m still betting on America."
2020-04-28 12:46,"Is it worth our time and effort to answer his preening each time a lie spills out? Yes, because a whole lot of people still believe anything. Hence, calls to poison control centers when they drink undrinkables."

2020-04-28 13:07,"All Trump wants is for us to shut up, go back to work, and if we get sick or die, so be it. Just get working and get spending. 

And it's not just him. There seems to be a concerted effort afoot to build momentum towards re-opening even though every fact we have says that re-opening anytime soon will be a catastrophe that can have only one result - a massive resurgence of cases. There's almost no discussion given to the fact that by re-opening, we may very well be signing our neighbor's death warrant. Our parents'. Our friends'. Even in some cases our children's. And we're condemning hundreds of thousands of others to a devastating illness that can lead to permanent organ damage. It will also result in more damage to what's left of our economy than simply staying closed. 

This is the wrong path, folks. There is another way, a way that focuses on doing everything we can to keep essential workers in all industries safe while providing individuals and businesses who's jobs and services are not essential with the financial support they need to meet their needs without having to risk their lives while we wait on a vaccine. We just have to be willing to re-invent our lives in light of the reality we're living in right now, and give up on wishful thinking and trying to reclaim what's already been lost."
2020-04-28 12:56,"The development and widespread distribution of effective and timely Coronavirus tests is a Federal responsibility, pure and simple. 

Trump’s Teflon is wearing off day by day as he desperately tries to blame anyone or anything else for his own gross incompetence.  

I sincerely hope Trump is convincingly fired in November by the silent majority and takes his Senate cronies out of power at the same time."
2020-04-28 13:03,"""Rather than one coordinated federal response, the Trump administration has been engaging on an ad hoc basis as states take the lead."" So much time wasted that these ""leaders,"" who still refuse to wear masks and practice social distancing in public, have repeatedly shown their gross incompetence. We have lost precious weeks and weeks that we can never get back as 50,000 people in the US died on their watch. What would it take -- a second, even worse surge this summer in red states that are ""opening up"" without the benefit of consistent, widespread testing? Something closer to home, like one of them or their immediate families contracting COVID -19? Images of millions protesting on the news every night? Because nothing else so far has been able to shame, pressure, or frighten them into doing the right thing. 

That Trump would even murmur the suggestion that we open schools before the end of the school year (after mumbling that absurdity about treating the virus last week) should stop all of us in our tracks, breathless. This is tragic."
2020-04-28 12:49,"Of course Americans want to get back to their jobs and send their children back to school. It is going to take years for millions of people to recover financially.

However, Trump is giving the go-ahead to reopening the economy without testing or any serious plan on how to accomplish the opening. His suggestion to reopen schools without a plan is similarly negligent.  It amounts to nothing more than co-towing to what people want to hear without taking any responsibility as a leader to plan, guide and implement a complicated and extremely important transition.

His recommendation is right up there with injecting disinfectant. Just another glimpse into the thought processes of a madman.

However, in that case the consequences would be the deaths of single individuals foolish enough to follow Trump's suggestions. If reopening the economy is done improperly it will lead to the deaths of thousands of innocent people."
2020-04-28 12:59,"There are words here that are not appropriate when referring to Trump or this administration:

""Vows""  (in the headline) Trump doesn't believe in vows, marital or otherwise. His so-called promises are wastepaper.

""Unveiled"" (a new plan) Trump just says things. They aren't related to reality. If you unveil a statue, there's an actual statue underneath. But Trump's plans aren't real; they're less than soap bubbles, and he'll claim tomorrow that he didn't offer them.

You cannot report him as if he were a regular human being, who lies sometimes but tells the truth a lot. He, apparently, DOES NOT KNOW that any reality exists outside his dysfunctional mind."
2020-04-28 13:04,"""experts have recommended that anywhere from 0.9 percent to 50 percent of the American public must be tested""

No wonder those of us who aren't ""experts"" are so confused."
2020-04-28 12:43,"While reading any news story I do so with the expectation that it contains not only bias but also a high level of political bias. Unfortunately, all readers are trusting those who have a financial or political incentive to shape information. That might help readership statistics but ultimately does not serve the nation well.  The Times is a great newspaper with top notch reporters but I look forward to the day that it eliminates all bias in the stories it reports."
2020-04-28 12:51,"At the very outset of all this, Trump told Dr. Fauci why not simply let the Coronavirus wash over the United States.  The stunned Dr. Fauci informed Trump that many would die so stay-in-place was truly necessary.  

Unperturbed Trump's actions illuminate his core belief---that CV-19 should be allowed to run its course through our country.   How else at this very late date can it be said Trump is truly serious about testing or PPE gear for our frontline medical staff much less the public's own need for masks and gloves? Utterly bizarre.  The one thing is clear, Trump believes what he wants to believe. The simple fact CV-19 is decimating factories and undermining the supply chain of foodstuffs and yet causes no corresponding concern or response by the federal government, illuminates both the hazards of the workplace and the threat to our food supplies.  

We are all truly in a battle isolated and surrounded by a virus that intends to kill or harm us and damage our food supplies.  Even with Congress giving Trump billions to boost testing Trump simply dithers, defers and propagates propaganda that America is winning in a war that we are actually losing. My condolences to those who have lost family and friends to CV-19, stay safe!"
2020-04-28 12:32,"While Trump pushes more and more of the testing responsibilities on the states his Treasury Department does its best to nit pick on just  how much federal aid should go to them. FDR  could develop a lend lease to reach a vital objective DJT says one thing on the ""perfect"" communications with the governors while is administration fails to follow through."
2020-04-28 12:38,"Trump seems to think that he's done his job if he just tells someone else to do something. So far, that hasn't worked really well. 
We need the ability to test and re-test. We need to send people around to individuals' homes to administer enough tests to get a realistic snapshot of how pervasive the infections might be. We need the results quickly enough to be able to trace contacts and help those contacts isolate themselves. We need enough tests of antibodies to be able to see trends even when there are errors in individual tests. 
A lot of needs and it will take money and will to address them. Until that happens, ""opening"" the economy will be a crapshoot. Telling states and localities that it's up to them to do the job is not enough."

2020-04-28 13:24,"Generally, it seems 45 is wanting to give all responsibility to states, and have also the federal government do nothing. This relieves him and his cronies from any responsibility and needed action. 45 doesn't want to help other countries do anything either, clearly, pulling out and defunding international organizations. 

What 45 wants is to be the big shot ""boss"" and live in luxury, ride around the world in a nice big airplane and be applauded for how great his, what a ""winner"" he is, play golf and host big dinner parties in his Florida hotel. He likes to read about himself in the news and watch himself on television especially if someone is praising what a ""great"" job he is doing with any and every single thing.

This is all and everything being president has ever ever meant to him. 

He is a sub adult and now proving to be sub-human."
2020-04-28 13:12,"Donald Trump is great at ""making things vague""...but only because we allow that behavior. The scientist-epidemiologists around him can't cope with this obfuscation. They are accustomed to discussions that focus on numbers, hypotheses and proven facts. He succeeds in the short term.

The virus doesn't care about politics or PR diversionary tactics. It will provide the final judgement on Trump as measured in contagion and death."
2020-04-28 13:12,"That powerpoint yesterday reminded me of corporate presentations that were heavy on aspiration but light on tactical details. In his ongoing fixation with avoiding blame, the Trump administration has consistently refused to use the power of the federal government - namely to lead a coordinated effort at the national level to drive the creation, access and delivery of vital supplies, including testing. Trump's claim that other countries have called him to compliment him on our testing is a blatant lie and is ludicrous. Right now the U.S. is the laughing stock of the world, as well as the subject of pity."

Plans are not public brainstorming.

Plans are not hopes and wishes.

Plans are real, actionable, goals and objectives, something we have expected from competent administrations in the past."
2020-04-28 13:45,"Every time the Federal government makes a testing related decision it seems to MINIMIZE the amount of testing or seems oblivious to the need for a variety of different types of tests for different purposes.

I do not understand it. It makes no sense economically. Seldom have a seen a bureaucracy so scared offending its political masters, but that does not fully explain it either."
2020-04-28 13:29,"The cruel lies of Donald Trump about the availability of testing, p.p.e., respirators and other resources needed by the nation's governors and mayors persist. The president blames state and local officials.

The shift now is that Trump no longer cares that his lies are easily disproved by facts on the ground. This man cares nothing about the plight of the victims of Covid-19 or their families."

2020-04-28 13:42,Shambolic Incompetence Results In Epic Fail.
2020-04-28 13:42,So Trump walked back his earlier assertions that we had enough testing. Now he's following the advice given to him two months ago. Just another contradiction in a sea of chaos and confusion since January. His behaviour resembles the zig zags of line on a polygraph machine. And the Administration follows the same blind path. There has been no cohesive federal response since the beginning and rest assured there will be none at the end. We have fifty states with fifty different plans. A complete disgrace.
2020-04-28 13:43,CONCERNED? This is an understatement given the banal wind this President blows every day.
2020-04-28 13:47,"We have the talent in this country to have formulated a plan to combat this deadly virus but we don't have the leadership in the White House and all the president has done is to prove he is incompetent and uncaring. He has made a life or death crisis into a Keystone Cops operation. 
It's  time to come to grips and realize we or on our own floundering in lies false statements and now even more deadly musings. It's time to ignore Trump and long since time for Republicans to stop giving large corporate operations money instead of small businesses, begin by helping the American people, it's our money and we need a President that can lead period not a pack of self abdicating fools."
2020-04-28 13:33,Tens of thousands of small businesses are being forced to close each day. Why not temporarily convert those idle buildings into local testing centers? We could literally have one on every corner.
2020-04-28 13:41,"Trump calls this virus The Invisible Enemy, and he likes it that way. Testing makes it visible, more subject to rational rather than magical discourse, more manageable in ways Trump has no interest in managing it.

Testing is plumbing for truth, an activity alien to the Trump mind. Testing is orderly, a predisposition at odds with Trump's disruptive predilections. Testing paves the way for a rational solution, a track Trump has never traveled.

Bleach injections, ultraviolet belly beams, miraculous curve flattenings, the warm weather cure, all these are preferable to anything that works. Trump did not enter government to make it work.

Quite the opposite."
2020-04-28 13:27,"When Trump talks, it is just that, talk. There is no plan, just a script."
2020-04-28 13:33,"His plan is to lie about what the states will get, when they'll get it, what they already have and how many tests are being done and analyzed.

Sounds solid to me. Pretty similar to his plans to provide PPE and ventilators, and we know how well they turned out."
2020-04-28 13:37,The only thing that would amaze me about the Coronavirus is that if all of the experts and all of the politicians were in exact agreement about what should be done.
2020-04-28 13:33,"Trump says he is a wartime president. Yes, it is true that the US faces an adversary from afar that is threatening the life, safety and economic wellbeing of the entire US. As such, it is a threat that needs the mobilization of the government and the US population to fight it.

He is not acting like a wartime president, however.  Image if  Roosevelt, another wartime president, comported himself like Trump. What if he said that the federal government was the supplier of last resort? Where would the US have been if Roosevelt had said that each state should have anticipated the external threat posed by Germany and Japan and therefore should have built up their arsenal of guns, bullets, planes, etc. to arm their own, rather than a federal militia? Where would the US be if Roosevelt didn't fully engage  and coordinate with industry to convert from civilian to war goods production?

I can tell you what would happen.  The US would be losing against the foreign adversary just as badly as they are against COVID-19.

Let me reiterate, Trump and his cronie cabinet are not acting like a wartime administration.  They are acting more like a Keystone Cops administration."

Mondays' roll call of Pharmacy chain leaders gauzy recitations of in-store testing to-come was disturbing for the simple fact that the pharmacists are already overworked and understaffed - the additional testing workload is not accompanied by additional resources at the individual pharmacies, nor is how to pay for the tests disclosed.

Trump is washing his hands of any effective responsibility for providing meaningful testing - the pharmacies have been added to local Public Health agencies in that they have been set-up to fail."
2020-04-28 14:38,"One aspect that I believe is being missed in this debate.  The tests peddled by the government currently are only 70 percent sensitive.  That is, for every 100 people identified as having the test, 30 are missed and sent freely into society.   This is staggering to those of us who work in this industry.

With no national plan—no coherent instructions at all—families, schools, and offices were left to decide on their own whether to shut down and take shelter. When test kits, masks, gowns, and ventilators were found to be in desperately short supply, governors pleaded for them from the White House, which stalled, then called on private enterprise, which couldn’t deliver. States and cities were forced into bidding wars that left them prey to price gouging and corporate profiteering.'

2020-04-28 14:28,"Yesterday, the governor of Georgia claimed that the Georgia Department of Public Health had run 32,000 tests. That is not true. I’ve been tracking this in a big nerdy spreadsheet, and here is the truth:

4/20
Total Tests run by GPH - 5,362

4/21
5,733

4/22
6,014

4/23
6,537

4/26
8,898

4/27
9,411

Total increase in tests run by GPH labs, 4/20-4/27: 3,681

The total number of tests run in the state increased from 78,966 to 127,169. Tests run by GPH represent 7.4% of all tests run in Georgia. The state is almost entirely dependent upon commercial labs.

But guess what? The official website abruptly stopped showing the breakdown as soon as Kemp claimed that they’d run 32,000 tests yesterday. Now, it’s anybody’s guess. 

The state claims that these GPH tests are free to anyone showing symptoms. Okay. But they don’t tell you that you’ll probably have to drive to a specimen collection point (SPOCs) to get a swab. These are available in just 42 of Georgia’s 159 counties. 

So to anyone defending the president, or Kemp, or any other governor of any political party who is LYING about testing, bring the receipts with you if you want to play. You’re dealing with a data scientist and I don’t play games. I win them.

Just think how much easier this would be if we lived in a country that didn’t politicize science! No scientist wants to deal with politics. You cannot change a cold hard fact. All you can do is lie about it. Stop lying. People are dying!"

2020-04-28 14:01,Senator Murray said it all. The president does not have a plan. So far he has wasted everyone’s time with rambling presentations and outrageous claims of his success in fighting covid 19 - that go deep into the ridiculous. The scientific community (i.e. people who really do understand math) is unanimous in calling for substantially more testing capacity and he is still in single digits. The federal government is responsible for marshaling that effort despite Trump’s claims that it is up to the states. Build the needed testing infrastructure !
2020-04-28 14:04,"While unintentional, the liberal governors crying for Trump to do everything for them are actually demonstrating their complete incompetence.

The New York Times reporting on coronavirus testing is like Lucy and the football - every time the US boosts its testing, the NYT yanks the amount it needs up higher. That's why it seems like the US is making no progress on coronavirus testing. They have been, but you wouldn't know that from the media coverage which makes it sound like the US is always behind even as it pulls ahead.

2020-04-28 14:30,"I don't get it.

Why doesn't your president want to test enough Americans to get on top of the virus and allow the reopening to proceed safely?

Is it because he wants to save money?  Compared to how much the government is spending on stimulus and rescue, the cost of testing is very small.

I don't get it!  Can you help me to understand?"
2020-04-28 14:07,When will these tests be available? And will Mexico pay for them?
2020-04-28 14:11,It would seem quite simple. Test everybody and isolate and treat those who are positive for the virus until they recover or die. Trump doesn't get it and has essentially done nothing to fight the virus. Without a vaccine there is nothing more that can be done.

2020-04-28 14:55,"The key to Trump’s plan, and his election strategy, is to blame the states for everything that goes wrong (I.e., more infections and deaths), and to take credit for anything that goes right. That it might work tells you how low the United States has sunk.

2020-04-28 14:04,"“These were not complaining people. They had everything they needed. They had their ventilators; they had their testing,” Mr. Trump said on Monday after a call with governors.

This says it all. He won't do anything on a national scale because he might have to direct national assistance to states whose governors have had to beg him for help. He believes the property of the  federal government is actually HIS OWN, and he can hoard it for his family and friends, and refuse to share it with the states. He tells  the states that ""his"" aid is only backup, that states have to get their own equipment. I wonder if he knows or cares what this is doing to the federation, and what the longer term results will be. States' rights proponents and Libertarians get their wish. How does that work when  whole states are dying because there are no tests or PPE, and medical personnel flee because they know that staying is a death sentence. Be careful what you wish for? Too late. Trump is experimenting with the dissolution of the UNITED states. Balkanization, anyone?"
2020-04-28 14:44,"The briefings ARE a waste of time. Trump reads, in  a monotone, various numbers, out of context. x number of q-tips are being manufactured. How does this fit with overall testing strategy and availability ? He reports what is happening but takes no actions, while state and local gov'ts struggle. That approach was set at least when Pence took over on 2/28 and announced we are a federalist gov't  and the federal gov't can only monitor and advise."
2020-04-28 14:53,"Trump fears a weak economy.  He lost his best bragging rights - to the best economy ever.  Nevermind that he inherited a strong economy from his nemesis President Obama, but with a growing economy one would expect EVERY president to have the best economy ever.  Obama did after fixing the recession created during the previous Republican administration.

Trump also realizes that Presidents do not get re-elected with a bad economy - so keeping a healthy economy is a fundamental part of his re-election strategy.  Perhaps now he already sees the handwriting on the wall.

The sadly ironic thing is that it was Trump's slow, weak response to the pandemic that worsened the economy so much.  It could have been contained more by prompt, decisive action.  It is still being made worse by continued weak action on maintaining rules on distancing and on weak supplies of test kits and PP&E.

Trump champions a strong economy in words while pulling it down with a lack of leadership and action to fight the pandemic which is pulling ti down."

trump is looking for a quick-fix-Martian-Death-Ray from the Flash Gordon television series to knock out the Virus so as to obviate the necessity of a costly and slow testing program.  He wants to avoid all of those messy scientific metrics that are required to properly open up the economy.  That will take time."
2020-04-28 14:27,"This is quite the quagmire.  

I understand the need for businesses to get back up and running.  I understand the need of millions to get back to work to earn a living so the very basics can be paid for.  And I equally understand the caution and concern for reopening the country without sufficient testing available.

At the very least, I would hope that OSHA would play a major if not leading role in helping businesses determine the how and why certain precautions must be met before giving anyone the green light to proceed.

I would also hope that these businesses would ""tip toe"" their way back into opening up for workers to return.  A slow, gradual return would be extremely prudent.

But a burning question I have is what is the game plan if workers begin to get sick once they have returned?  

Simply putting out a sign that reads ""Open For Business"" is not enough.  I can only hope that thorough, detail game plans have been in the works which establish a smart, safe and effective way for workers to return.

Somehow without having sufficient testing available, I cannot help but think there's a strong potential for a second and deadly wave of this virus."

Even 10% of those who have public contact is going to be overwhelming! A vaccine is the only way this comes to an end, and even that is going to require unprecedented logistical effectiveness and public cooperation. Trump can make promises all day long, but he can't speak this pandemic away. We're all in this for the long haul."
2020-04-28 14:39,"It seems pretty simple.  What happens in one state can affect and infect people in another?  That is the reason we have national vaccination programs and support.  The only alternative would be to quarantine everyone coming into a state.

Trump seems incapable of any kind of abstract thought, he cannot conceive what the future might bring; he refuses to listen to the experts who can educate him.  

In January, he saw no reason to take action, except a weak travel ban against one country with a lot of holes in it created by exceptions. He would not accept the pandemic probabilities explained by experts.

As the pandemic progressed and worsened, he didn't realize how wrong he had been nor did he start following most of the recommendations of the health experts - instead letting economics professionals determine health policy.

He has still never really accepted the primary role the Federal government must play in such disasters.  The government reacts to a hurricane affecting one state but sadly won't take charge of a pandemic affecting all states.

Instead, 50 states are expected to all figure out what to do largely on their own and to compete with one another for shortages in testing kits and supplies and in PPE and medical devices - 50 states all calling the same companies over and over to beg for supplies from companies.  How do the companies allocate their short supplies - how do they know which states have the most critical needs or which are getting supplies elsewhere."

Of course we need to seriously ramp up testing, but simultaneously, EVERYONE should be wearing a face mask when they're in a public setting and strictly maintaining six-foot-separation.

The fact that the President and his staff refuse to don face masks and refuse to model six-foot-separation is incredibly irresponsible, reckless and increases the number of coronavirus cases since daily Trump viewers - who are known to disproportionately doubt science, facts and the seriousness of the coronavrius - religiously observe Trump's daily Variety Hour TV show.

Wake up, White House - you're the problem."
2020-04-28 12:18,"We have two paths to follow.  One is to open up without proper testing and let herd immunity burn out the virus.  With some social distancing, the rate of new infections will be slower than say in New York, but we still will end up with nearly as many dead and sick people, just at a slower rate.

Or we can test the heck out of the population, restrict travel between communities, and keep the infected home for two or three weeks until they clear the virus.  Then we get rid of this thing by summers end.

It appears we are choosing the former because that's what Trump wants.  As wrong as he has been and as many times as he has been wrong, why does anyone listen to him?

What is maddening here is that the virus is just beginning to ebb.  This is not the time to take the pressure off. Another month will really knock it down.  But no.  We can't do that because the guy who has been wrong about this crisis from the day one, who has horribly mismanaged this crisis from the day one, thinks a rapid opening will get him reelected.  No it wont.  It will get him a raging epidemic through the fall election season.  Who will he blame for that?"
2020-04-28 15:22,"Testing is not the silver bullet everyone seems to think it is. The problem is that a negative is meaningless. It only means a person is not positive that particular day. So what is the testing regime. Every day? Every 3 days? every week? 

And a vaccine is not a sure thing. They were working on a SARS vaccine that never made to market. 

And immunity is also not a sure thing because the virus can mutate. We have an influenza vaccine but we need to modify it every year because there are a dozen strains and the mix an match annually, and it mutates constantly. 

I suspect this will become like the flue in that it comes around every year. Maybe we get a bit of immunity, maybe we have a partially effective vaccine."

2. Testing needed to reopen

“﻿Ten states would need to increase their daily testing totals by at least 10,000 to do so by May 1. New York, for instance, would have to perform more than 100,000 more tests a day, and New Jersey 68,000 more testing.

﻿Many states are not close to their goals. New York, for instance, has been averaging barely more than 20,000 tests per day since mid-April. New Jersey has been doing about 7,000, on average. Neither has announced reopening plans or dates, giving them time to ramp up testing. “

and the chaos that will ensue afterwards if the result is 
close, if there are many sick people, and if absentee

Surely we know at least one sociopath who will declare victory, but what will that then entail? Will the majority sit idly by and blandly not contest that?

Everyone says that they are data driven, that science is the touchstone for all actions. Let's actually use the data available, then.

 Serology tests have confirmed across the nation that the infected cohort is much much greater than the number of diagnosed cases. The lethality of the Covid-19 is less than .003%, about like a flu season.

The curve would have flattened (as it has in Sweden) through usual infection and ""herd immunity"". Time to stop the  economic madness.

The lock downs were useful in allowing the hospitals to catch up but it we continue the lock downs  any chance at herd immunity will be delayed indefinitely.

Note to file: there has NEVER been a vaccine produced against any other caronavirus, so, don't expect one any time soon.  This is not unusual, there aren't vaccines for other viruses...HIV, for example, either.

Oh, somebody please ask Drs. Fauci and Brixs at the next press conference about this and don't let them wiggle their answer about ""unreliable"" tests. Tests are all over the US: NYC, California, Florida, etc....they cant all be unreliable and even if half wrong lethality would still be about .005%."

Testing would tell the truth, and guide our nation to adequate solutions with adequate resources.

Shamefully, the US has morphed and retained a faux testing policy from January to February to March to April, and now into May and June.

While many things have gone wrong, the most serious being a health problem allowed to destroy a robust economy (b. 2009, d. 2020 RIP). But testing and science could have, should have, would have greatly prevented that secondary problem.

When we have adequate testing, an effective treatment, or a vaccine, we can mount a proper counter offensive. Until then, it's everyone for themselves, and if it catches you, it's up to your immune system to deal with it.

I suspect that the early days of WW2 felt the same. The Germans and Japanese were winning on every front, and we were ramping up our military, hoping for any good news we could get.

Then, he could pressure every state to open and, when there is a huge new outbreak because we still don't know who is carrying the virus and infecting others, he can blame the governors for failing the ""test"" test.

Right, we elected the greatest flim-flam-man in history, and he'll take the county down with him."
2020-04-28 15:49,"While there certainly aren't enough coronavirus tests in this country,  Americans ARE being tested on a daily basis -  as to how much patience they have over the utter lack of leadership in the Oval Office, and the White House's refusal to do what is necessary to effectively address the coronavirus pandemic."
2020-04-28 15:07,"So long as the president maintains a binary approach, the country will not achieve the desired result. He keeps framing the situation as ""we"" and ""them"" or ""we"" and ""they"". Where is just plain ""we""? Evidently he believes that he is above the fray and we are not in this together."
2020-04-28 13:25,"In the midst of a war, battles rage. And good commanders and leaders react to ever adjusting situations. When conditions change, the battle plans adjust to those changes. Pres Trump is proving to be a brilliant leader and tactician. I liken his approach more to a George Patton, than Dwight Eisenhower. He is bombastic. flamboyant and braggadocio at times, yes, but he is also very effective. The media need to understand his methods and strategy. His only true goal is to save Americans and America."
2020-04-28 16:01,"I wish we had accurate testing but we do not in sufficient numbers for our population.
We could fall back on the age old methods of symptoms and case identification and contact tracing.  How come we act so helpless when we identify an increasing number of symptoms and fever is easy to identify.  And many people could tell us their contacts, and people then could trace the epidemic. And quarantine  those at risk."
2020-04-28 16:06,"Everyone seems to be assuming that a vaccine will be developed, but there is no guarantee of this. There is no vaccine yet for other coronaviruses like SARS-COV-1 or MERS-COV, or many other deadly viruses like HIV. It is a very difficult task, and the effort to have one for SARS-COV-2 will be unprecedented. We all hope for an effective vaccine or treatment as quickly as possible, but in the meantime sufficient testing is critical to help manage public health and safety as best as we can. Complacency is not an option."
2020-04-28 16:04,"Chaos, wilfull ignorance and pathological lying at the White House. Not sure why anyone expected anything different. It's on-brand for Team Trump, the MAGA crowd, and every GOP sychophant in DC. 

Meanwhile, the body count grows. 

American Carnage. Delivered."
2020-04-28 15:54,"The story line has this totally correct.

POTUS Trump ""vows"" more testing - a song Americans have heard for almost two months and the lyrics are written in invisible ink. Trump says; Pence nods his head; Pence and Trump rattle off meaningless statistics of ""demonstrable progress"". Big numbers - listen to yesterday's presser -  and then compare with what has actually been delivered to the regions/governors pleading for assistance.

Trump's mindset is simple - YOU (citizen of the United States) - must pay for the test kit if you want to be tested. Recall remarks about professional athletes & wealthy getting tested, 

""At a White House press conference Wednesday, NBC’s Peter Alexander asked President Trump the question that’s been on everyone’s mind: “Do the well-connected go to the front of the line?”
“Well, you have to ask them that question,” Trump said. “I mean, I’ve read—.”
“Should that happen?” Alexander asked.
“No, I wouldn’t say so,” Trump replied. But, as usual, the rich have easy access to services working class people struggle to find. “But perhaps that’s been the story of life. That does happen on occasion and I’ve noticed where some people have been tested fairly quickly.”

<a href=""https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/03/thats-been-the-story-of-life-trump-on-why-rich-people-are-getting-tests-first"" target=""_blank"">https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/03/thats-been-the-story-of-life-trump-on-why-rich-people-are-getting-tests-first</a>/

So, the insight here is simple - purely transactional. If it's needed you must pay for it. If you can't pay for it, then you die. Basic Trump empathy."
2020-04-28 15:57,"WHAT plan? I didn't hear the actual plan. More politics, platitudes and perseveration of lies."
2020-04-28 16:00,This president needs to go. Every day it gets worse and worse.
2020-04-28 16:00,"On March 6, while touring the CDC on his way to golf in Florida, Trump proclaimed, emphatically and repeatedly, that ""anyone"" could get a test, the tests were available, and, further, the tests were ""beautiful.""
A week shy of TWO MONTHS later, I haven't been tested, nor do I know anyone who has. I just don't see how we can possibly open up the country and approach anything near normalcy until  we have tests—beautiful or not—and the testing is widespread. Testing is the sine qua non of reopening our country, and every other country on the planet.
Testing, testing, testing. Why did Trump lie back on March 6th? That's what I want to know!
Mr. Trump: Where is my test????"
2020-04-28 16:02,"Trump's desire to get our country up and running, the economy rebounding is motivated by one thing and one thing only: doing so would give him a better chance at being reelected.  Anyone who thinks he sincerely has our collective physical health in mind is kidding themselves.  We've been in this for over two months now and health care workers on the front lines still don't have the PPE they need to treat the sick.  Anyone who thinks all of those millions of jobs lost so far are coming back anytime soon is kidding themselves.  Without testing on a much grander scale, which our President has worked against to keep the numbers down, we only have a hint at how bad this really is, how bad it is yet to get, and yet he wants schools to open..."
2020-04-28 15:54,"The only rational testing plan couples results with an action.  The viral infectivity test — using qRT-PCR to detect vial RNA — requires an amplification step that takes time, reagents and a specialized instrument platform. And until the presence of antibodies is confirmed to actually confer immunity, the antibody test is poor predictor with no obvious actionable result.

In a Sunday interview, Dr. Birx mentioned the real solution — a switch to antigen testing, which would detect the novel viral coat proteins, not viral RNA.  No amplification needed, just a quick readout +/- to determine if someone is infected at that moment, possibly even on a daily basis at work  That system could yield tens of millions of instant tests per day, with direct, actionable results on the spot.  

Until there's a vaccine or treatment confirmed to work in trials, instant, actionable testing should be the goal of any national effort to open the economy safely."
2020-04-28 16:05,"Science is immaterial to Trump, and “testing” is just a mere shibboleth. 
Here's the part that continues to mystify me: why don't the commentators ever seem to recognize that Trump has always done what he does, and will always continue to do so, simply because for him, acting in character is always just doing what any self-respecting sociopath would do: to himself, he will always be the most knowledgeable about anything and everything, and he will always be the only one who can fix anything, and everything he does will always be the greatest feat of all time, and when anything falls short, it's always someone else's fault and even then he isn't appreciated enough for his miraculous deeds and everyone should stop complaining and recognize his greatness - and, as with any sociopath, the true meaning of ""integrity"" is absolute dedication to him, and he is absolutely incapable of empathy; consequently, the veracity of his utterances is irrelevant, and merely counting his falsehoods is fruitless.
Therefore, as we continue to watch people needlessly succumb - thanks to his decrees, what we should really want to know is this: 
If he is truly incapable of behaving any other way … 
1) when is a sociopath legally responsible for his harmful acts - can he be held liable for some sort of criminal negligence? 
2) regardless of whether the sociopath can be held responsible, what about all those who support those harmful acts? 
… why isn't anyone raising these questions?"
2020-04-28 16:08,"Please for the befit of the country people need to ignore Trump. 

It serves no positive useful purpose to feed into him. By listening and responding to him is just encouraging more dysfunction and distraction.

The thing about the sickness of narcissism is that negative and positive response feeds the beast equally. Starve the sickness and the beast will shrink.

Stop enabling the sick person.

Focus on the medical experts and do what they say."
2020-04-28 16:02,"1. Stop allowing the president to get away with boasting about imposing the China ban: it was porous, allowing US citizens and others from that country to enter. The virus doesn't care about citizenship. These people should have been quarantined! Also, the ban didn't stop folks from Britain: again, the virus doesn't care about nationality; Europe, in fact, was the largest contributor to our virus outbreak.

2. Percentage of tested is what matters, NOT absolute numbers. Continuing chest-beating about numbers of tested should be contested and corrected: it is grossly misleading.

3. To V-P Pence: it doesn't matter if it was availability of testing or availability of processing the tests! One without the other, which is where we still are, is the single greatest problem. ""We will have:"" No more should these words be sufficient to quite questioners."
2020-04-28 16:03,"Trump doesn't want to test because he doesn't want anyone to know what the actual numbers of infected people are, lest it hurt his reelection chances. Remember when he wanted to keep the cruise ship offshore so those sick passengers wouldn't be counted? He'll stand at the podium and talk about testing, but he'll never do anything to actually provide more testing."
2020-04-28 15:54,I have a conspiracy theorist side that has increasingly been wondering if the fact that most insurance companies vowed at the beginning of the crisis to waive copays on testing and the fact that tests aren’t available are connected.
2020-04-28 16:01,Trump’s resistance to extensive testing has a simple explanation: more testing will provide factual information that undermines his ability to lie and mislead.
2020-04-28 16:08,"Experts knew, as did Bush and Obama, that America is going to be attacked by new viral infections on a regular basis. 

Our ability to test fast and widely to track their spread was known to be essential to containing and recovering from these infections.  S. Korea was primed and ready to go into action when this one appeared, because they were prepared.

Trump and his government failed to heed the warnings, failed to prepare, and when the infection arrived, failed to exercise Federal leadership to get working tests out. Still haven't. 

Instead we get Pence telling us, when he promised to deliver 4 million tests a month ago, he never promised they could be used. 

This virus will remain on US soil for years. It will continue to infect until we reach herd immunity (about 70% of us have been infected) or we have a vaccine.  

And let's be crystal clear: this will not be the last or only virus in our future. We will face the same issue with testing again and again, unless we have a response and policy in place.  

It's clear, for that, we'll need a minimally competent government. And only the public can hire one."
2020-04-28 11:36,"The president is not in touch with the reality of the country and the forces facing it's citizens. 

We need on demand antibody tests, we need repeated Covid19 tests and we need access to them in the places where we live, rural or city or suburban!   

We need contact tracing. We need a strategic and tactical plan, like a Covid 19 ""Marshall Plan"".  

We need data to make decisions, coupled with Science and best practices to resume our lives.  

What I continue to be unable to forgive or forget is the enabling #GOP and the ignorance of it's members.  

I will remember their power hungry activities in November, 2020, if I live."
2020-04-28 12:28,"All of the promises yesterday were for unspecified dates in the future. Testing is 6 weeks late. Compare to other countries that pushed testing early - lower death rates.

2020-04-28 17:47,"Need wide and deep testing on two fronts, it seems obvious, on at least 2-fronts:  
1.  Random samples of the population, drawn from strategically selected areas where it is easy to spread it, and, then, from naturally social distant areas where it is not:  Provide scientifically defensible data on how wide spread it is, and on catch-rates in different settings.
2.   Work-place sampling with tracing, especially when there are factory lines (like in meat plants, Smithfield, Tyson, etc). 

Couple arenas that come to mind... need well-trained sampling, data oriented statisticians working with infectious disease specialists to set up the testing..."
2020-04-28 18:01,"There are two things to remember about anythng Trump says publicly, on this or any other topic:

1. Basically, he’s doing a “cold reading.” Throw a lot of guesses out there seize on whatever looks like it’s being reacted to, count on the suckers to forget all the misses.

2. He likes begging. Makes him feel like a man.

2020-04-28 12:07,"There were gloomy predictions for India as cases started mounting in mid March, the inevitable restrictions came, but did we rush into a lockdown too draconian for us to now get out of? Maybe that's the reason most of the states remain silent, letting the central government call the shots.

The lockdown came suddenly, taking millions, especially migrants who work thousands of miles away from their villages, by surprise.

We failed to anticipate the overwhelming instinct of wanting to get home in times of crises. Perhaps a graded restriction could have worked better?

No wonder confusion reigns supreme among local businesses, who despite having the official go ahead, is not sure of resuming operations.

2020-04-28 12:47,"Epidemiologists and pandemic experts including WHO officials have repeatedly said India needs a longer period of lockdown than most countries due to its large population of 1.3 billion and it's population density. Infact, India's population density is even higher than China's. Moreover, the already crumbling health institutions would be over-burdened if there is a spike in the number of cases. The extent of outbreak is still not known because India's testing rate is still among the lowest of all the nations. Loosening of restrictions would only add light to the fire, as India does not have robust public/civil crisis management teams like China to tackle a second big spike in the number of cases."
2020-04-28 13:04,"So far the Govt has done a good job.  It is easy to talk many measures but it is very difficult to implement them for high density large population of 1.3 billion.

It was a big step for the people to follow but like those demanding zero lock-down in the US mid west , did not listen to the advice. Eventually some strict measures were taken.  Lock-down in the hots-spots is required."
2020-04-28 12:33,India has done well contrary to dire predictions by the western media and think tanks. The country has been united unlike the US. It managed to take care of the migrants reasonably well. There has been no reports of widespread starvation.

2020-04-28 11:58,It looks like India has for now beaten the virus!! But the credit goes to the people of India who have understood and respect the science behind the virus spread. But here in USA many of us are in middle ages and dont believe science or doctors!! See the absolute number of hospitalizations in USA vs India!!
2020-04-28 14:03,"Thank you for this well written informative article. As we struggle with efforts to reopen our economy, it is interesting to learn more about the what is happening in other countries. 

It makes me sad to read some of the rather harsh comments posted in this section labelling India as bad and confirming that there are strongly held polarized beliefs about India. 

I thank the NYTimes for neutrally reporting this news, describing different points of view, and helping the readers try to better understand what is going on in India. Newspapers play an important role in society. Thank you."
2020-04-28 14:04,"NYT articles on India lack statistics or relative comparisons. A country of 1.3 billion people has similar number of cases as Netherlands or Sweden. It enforced strict contact tracing and lockdown which were followed by people. Millions of poor are being housed and fed. India has a federal structure like the US, with states and city governments who can implement different restrictions than federal government guidance."
2020-04-28 13:31,“Unified at the beginning” should have nixed by the editors. How can you call a forced migration  (due to fear of starvation and having no money for housing once unemployed) of millions because a four hour notice to lockdown unified? The ignoring of the largest migration since partition is like calling the original partition unified.
2020-04-28 13:40,"Leave alone COVID-19, political governance in India has failed and had been failing over many, many years.  There was and there is little transparency, minimal accountability, and absent course correction.  The many years of the Congress party failings made possible the emergence of an avowed communal party now in power.  Having botched the monetary system with a thoughtless and brushed over devaluation and having gone no where but down with economic growth, the party in power now has resorted to patriotism, religion, Muslim hatred and Modi dogma to distract the populace.  No one in the ruling party to question Modi; the crowd follows the anointed leader.  COVID-19 underscores the utter plight of the poor;  the sight of millions walking for miles with no state or institutional support, the seeming indifference among the middle class  to the sorrows of poor and the silence of intelligentsia leave Gandhi's India a pale of the nation he visualized."
2020-04-28 14:03,"It's not surprising many Indians hesitate to open their businesses or go to work. Indians are conservative in nature and multi-generational families living in one place is a big disincentive to take any risk. In fact the major reason, besides Modi government's admirable job in handling the pandemic, for success of the lock down is fear people have of Covid-19."
2020-04-28 14:20,"Thank you for covering India in this article.
Yes, India has been able to avoid cases and deaths. On global dashboards and in this story, it looks positive.

But lockdown has broken a lot of people here. We are a democracy with capitalist economy. Right from a daily wage worker to big business guys, everyone is on their own. The support of the government is minimal. And if we consider the size of 1.3 billion, it is hard to support for any government. People here know how to figure themselves out and do not expect government to support them. 

There is a mass migration of workers from cities to their native places. They will be supported there on agriculture and local economies, they are not coming back for many years now. Big changes coming here.

Either it is a lucky escape for India if everyone helps each other out, or a historical disaster...if they are divided by fear.
I hope and pray it is the first one.
I will also do by bit to help. Many startups are tying up with small businesses to help people stay at home for prolonged period of time. If essential reach safely to Indians, there is hope.

NYT should dig a little deeper into Indian cultural fabrics, unique fears societies have and the economy. The pictures are great but look forward to more detailed analysis."
2020-04-28 14:50,I am in the R&D and Tech sector. Generates mountain load of business. We have 4 active cases for days now. Stupid to stay closed. Open with caution and social distancing is what we should have. Modi has shown executional brilliance deployed on a poorly crafted idea and funny to see credits coming his way when actually he has forgotten 200 million people do not have a home to self-isolate into. Funny guy. Dangerous guy.
2020-04-28 14:39,"Proving the western media dire predictions of death and starvation, India has done relatively better than most other countries in dealing with Covid19. It has far less Covid19 deaths than most other countries so much so that funeral homes are laying off people due to lack of dead bodies to deal with. Migrant laborers are being provided basic meal resulting in no widespread starvation as NYT predicted. My mom calls me up worrying about my well being given the dire covid19 news they hear about in the USA. They report no lack basic food necessities in the neighborhood.

NYT May consider giving credit to Indian central and state govt for doing pretty good job so far in spite of relatively poor healthcare infrastructure."
2020-04-28 16:42,"India has done a wonderful job at mitigating the effects of COVID-19. It must be very puzzling to public health officials everywhere who were predicting a dire outcome in India because of its population density. India did not have far to look in their own neighborhood about the devastation COVID-19 would have done without mitigation, China is next door to its East and Iran is not far to its West. It is one thing for a communist country like China to have sweeping mitigation as compared to democratic India which is actually more akin to EU in its structure, individual states are like different countries with different languages, customs etc. It shows that the people in mass heeded the national Government's call for a shutdown despite it being so painful for their livelihood. So they have some issues opening up, I think most countries will have issues opening up, as we do here in the US as well. That is a small price to pay if the human cost in lives is low. India has a few hundred deaths, we have them in the thousands here, keep that in perspective."
2020-04-28 16:45,"India is a federal democracy. The central government, various state governments and people in general have done to make the long lock down mostly a success. 

It's not surprising at all that most state governments and people are more cautious than the central government over reopening. Over caution is good in this pandemic. A win-win for the government and citizens in India. Best wishes."
2020-04-28 17:38,"Low cases and fatalities could also be the result of abysmally low testing rate, one of the lowest in the world.

2020-04-28 18:12,"The Indian government is managing public perception better than it is controlling the actual pandemic. The reality is that India has hundreds of thousands (or millions) of COVID-19 cases, but inadequate testing has ensured that, as if writing, the country has only 30,000 or so confirmed cases. Health challenges abound in India, which are likely to mask many milder cases. Poor surveillance ensures that suspected cases and deaths are missed. At some point in the future, the excess mortality in this period will tell a much grimmer story than is currently acknowledged."
2020-04-28 10:47,"The Indian central government response led by Modi has been an unmitigated disaster thus far. It has consisted of a brutal lockdown implemented without any warning, police excesses which are dehumanizing, no relief to the ordinary man. chaotic and pointless measures like lighting candles and banging thalis,and a complete absence of anything medical.Far from any financial relief it has actually started reducing normal benefits to retired people and slowing down pensions. Banks are closed so that people cannot have access to their own money.Religious passions are once more being fanned even at this hour. Compared to Modi Trump has acted magnificently and taken good care of the people."
2020-04-28 15:28,"India's population, its high population density, general poverty, illiteracy, and moribund institutions make it a particularly dangerous tinder box for the corona virus fire. Yet, the fact that the federal government woke up to reality early and took bold steps, has helped the situation. Some local/state governments have also done well in this regard, where others (particularly West Bengal) have not.

More importantly, people in India are, for the most part, sensible/practical, and do not exhibit the ideological stubbornness (Government is BAD, MY freedom at any/all costs) that is visible in the United States. Such fluidity in thought may be beneficial in dealing with extreme circumstances like what we have with this crisis."
2020-04-28 19:21,"With all the channels of information controlled by Mr Modi’s government and intimidation of media how can we believe what is coming out of India. Mr Modi also tried to fudge unemployment and GDP  figures before 2019 elections. Mr Modi is known for his shameless penchant to show he is the savior of India and his propaganda machinery has constantly churned out stories how he has handled this crisis better than leading western nations. 

Using common sense, one can just estimate the effect of Hindu temples attended by thousands of devotees daily till March 18 as against Muslim congregation which numbered barely 4,000 for 3 days. By the way I am a Hindu. 

Then migrant workers in clusters of hundreds traveling for days to their villages.

The median life expectancy in India is 69, 10 years less than the US. The average age of death from covid is 80. The vast majority of Indians have far more to fear from starvation and other infectious diseases than they do from covid. It is amazing to me how many supposedly educated NYtimes readers seem to have no ability to actually rationally assess risk. This lockdown was for India's elite and is evil."
2020-04-28 15:45,"It should be understood that India is two totally disparate countries.  One group is a clutch of mega-cities.  The other consists of 600,000 villages.  Let that number sink in for a minute.  A one size fits all to the pandemic is nonsensical."
2020-04-28 17:36,"Herd mentality often shows that people do the dumbest things. However, on an individual level, most (not all - see the bleach guzzlers and hydroxychloraquine munchers) people will recognize imminent danger. If your officials tell you that a), b), and c) need to get done such that you are safe (not likely to die from Covid19) to re-enter to a sort-of-normal life and then they tell you those things haven’t been done, but it’s safe anyway? Hmm. I’m going to take a wait and see and I think most prudent folks are the same."
2020-04-28 19:33,"India is one of the only countries in the world which has seen an overall drop in mortality during the epidemic.

Not only are Coronavirus deaths low in India, all other causes of mortality have dropped during the epidemic as well. Things have become so bad (or good) that funeral and mortuary service employees are being furloughed or put on reduced salary. This will be studied in economics and medical textbooks for years to come. There is something going on that nobody understands."
2020-04-28 15:20,"Several lessons learnt from the Covid crisis
Mega cities in India with populations comparable to some nations in Europe and Latin America are not sustainable in long run. They have become magnets for attraction to rural migrants who live in illegal high density shanty towns without sanitation  .They have become breeding grounds for epidemics ,religious riots and social unrest.As a nation India has to develop rural economy and disperse production centers away from cities 
Remarkable story is India which is a nation of diverse multi racial ,multicultural ,multi religious and multi linguistic with huge number of uneducated and poor  has been able to enforce and sustain lockdown for prolonged period in national consensus without rebellion . In contrast Western countries with some of the educated population are openly flouting the social distancing,peddling conspiracy theories and indulging in open rebellion by extremist groups against restrictions to contain panepidemic"
2020-04-28 15:09,"COVID-19 has not caused much
harm to India. But the communal
virus that the ruling party has unleashed has seriously damaged the social fabric of the country. The hatred
and violence of majority, indeed the
tyranny of the majority, has sharply
divided the country. India will likely
emerge physical in reasonable
shape but much diminished in
in peace and harmony. Lockdown
in Kashmir since August 2019 continues. Modi government shows
no humanitarian concern."
2020-04-28 15:24,"The positive is the fear. As long as fear exists, all of us are on our toes. That will prevent complacency. 

Differences of opinion will always exist.

But complacency and indifference and deliberate overlooking and bravado and devil may care attitudes are currently very dangerous and to be avoided.

There is very little of that here this time."
2020-04-28 15:16,"The logic behind the lockdown was to save lives. It seems India has achieved that. At least thus far. Are the authors trying to blame the government for not striking the exact balance between keeping the economy afloat and saving lives in the outbreak? If yes, then the authors are being delusional. Show me one other country which has managed to strike the balance between stabilizing economy and saving lives in the midst of this calamity. I understand NYT's itch to be critical of the Indian politik. But get real. Look around you. Look around your own city for God's sake. India has had less than a thopusand people dying so far, whereas the US has sixty times as many. And India has three times as many people living in a place that is one-third in size. If you still can't fathom how successful India's lockdown has been, then you are living in a world of fools."
2020-04-28 19:47,"“In India, health care workers have reported being physically attacked, spat at and threatened with sexual violence for treating patients with the coronavirus.

Doctors in protective gear were chased by a stone-throwing mob early this month in the central city of Indore after they tried to screen a woman for Covid-19.”

And Yes all other countries including USA and it's citizens are perfect. Now all Americans and many Indians are happy by talking look India have lots of problems. Yes we have and this is because since we are a transparent and democratic country and we don't change our data by 50 to 60℅ , we don't hide and spread, we have better immunity since we struggle more than others inspite of not having foods 3 times in a day and last but not the least inspite of US and many other so called developed country failed to stop epidemic, india never make fun of these country ..... Go to global time where newspaper is full of articles making fun of USA  about its failure against COVID19."
2020-04-28 20:54,"I think the commenters here who are prematurely lauding India and more specifically Narendra Modi’s government are the same ones who were singing the praises of President Xi and the CCP’s response to the coronavirus pandemic in China. We know Trump is a pathological liar, but please don’t believe the propaganda that is being peddled by the Chinese and Indian governments. They’re incompetent charlatans, too."
2020-04-29 11:36,"Let’s be honest about what really motivated this decision.  The step would ensure an ample supply of “protein for Americans” (i.e. McDonalds cheeseberders for the Commander in Chief).  That was the perceived real crisis at the White House. Clearly the health, well-being and safety of thousands of American meat processing plants workers, who work in groups of hundreds at a time, in close quarters on production lines, was not.   The Burger King will not be inconvenienced by the pandemic."
2020-04-29 11:46,"The insanity of the current administration is on full display each day. Every time there is a chance to fix a problem by making better standards (COVID testing, masks, social distancing, etc.) Trump issues executive orders which only inflame the problem. Releasing Tyson and the other meat lacking plants from liability and 'ordering' the workers back to the slaughterhouse is a recipe for certain disaster. Where are the real leaders. Expect a large surge in vegetation voters."
2020-04-29 11:47,"Is the government ordering workers to go back to work or just saying that the plants must stay open?  This and other articles are unclear on this point.  I'd be shocked if the federal government has the authority to order people to work, but this article appears to indicate that the federal government has such authority."
2020-04-29 11:50,"If Trump wants to force the meat packing plants to open, does he also intend to force the workers to go back to work? (I think that there is something called the Thirteenth Amendment.)

If they feel unsafe, let them strike. If Trump then tries to force them back, let's have a one-day general strike (except for first responders and health care workers) in response, and if needed keep repeating until November."
2020-04-29 11:53,"Humans can get plenty of protein by eating plants, and if necessary insects. The convenience of meat has led to its over consumption, especially in unhealthy forms sold at fast-food chains."
2020-04-29 11:55,"There are some SMH moments here.
1.  The meatpacking industry relies on immigrant labor very bigly.  Trump hates immigrants and now he wants to them to go back into dangerous working conditions for his political benefit.
2.  Guidelines are meaningless.  Regulations are needed, but Trump hates regulations.  In this case, regulations may be needed to put protein on the tables of the American people.
3.  The Dept. of Agriculture has been politicized so that the experts who know how to keep food flowing from farms to processors to grocery stores have been denigrated as the deep state and politicians don't know how to do it."
2020-04-29 12:01,"I suspect this will be seen as one of the most important developments in the response of the administration to this crisis. Unwilling to use this law to increase testing and supplies of PPE, Trump now uses it to force plants to stay open, and, for all practical purposes, the employees to enter these spaces., where thousands are already falling ill. As Maddow examined in detail in last nights broadcast, the CDC guidelines are entirely voluntary, in radical contrast to guidelines issued by this department in health emergencies by previous administrations, an indication that the administration has chosen to keep the plants open no matter the degree of risks to the employees and the communities in which these plants are located. I assume this also makes illegal any attempt by labor to act, (or even to advocate?), in an effort to pressure companies to improve the safety of their employees, in any manner that would impede the work being done. Take note, America. This is the administration that is asking for a second term. Combined with the rapid stacking of the courts with right wing appointments, labor rights are in danger of being radically curtailed."
2020-04-29 11:41,"Ventilators aren’t essential, but cheeseburgers are. Right."
2020-04-29 11:47,"We can all live without eating a lot of meat. It will lower obesity, heart disease and all kinds of ailments from our awful eating habits not to mention how we torture poor chickens, turkeys, and pigs.  And what about the low wage, often illegal workers?  Any interest in saving their lives too?  Only in America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. Where greed is king."
2020-04-29 11:50,"As an ER nurse, seeing patients from meat packing places with injuries used to be pretty common, sad to say.  But selfishly speaking, they weren’t passing anything on to innocent others and they didn’t typically die from their injuries.  

Now that has all changed with the pandemic  COVID-19.  It’s not just a matter of sewing up injuries anymore, is it?  

Dr.Fauci and Dr. Birx.  Shouldn’t you be pleading with Donald Trump to not open up meat processing plants?  Isn’t that part of your jobs?  How are you going to explain his murderous executive order?"
2020-04-29 12:01,"Sadly, 45th, his (lack of a cohesive) Administration, and the #FecklessGOP always here on the side of Greed and Avarice.  am a carnivorous type but can live just fine without meat. No red meat for over 20 years at one point, and little of it now. There are plentiful options.

The conditions most of the Workers labor under are abysmal and these people tend to be Black and Brown. The same population who will be hit hardest by the coming Depression. Let 45th and VP Pence go to Work ONE SHIFT to show solidarity with those the blithely send into the Breach. That would be Leadership while teaching them a lesson on Empathy.

2020-04-29 11:54,"Sounds like the Tyson Foods, JBS, Smithfield Foods and Cargill got exactly what they wanted;  blanket Defense Production Act cover, to continue making their meatcutting employees sick with COVID. 
The State authorities , who want to shut down these dangerous meatpacking plants can now be overruled by this DPA ruling. 

Welcome to Trump world, where employee workplace protections are ignored, and powerful Trump supporters can get legal immunity for infecting employees with Covid."
2020-04-29 12:07,"It’s time not only to have meatless Monday, but meatless Monday through Friday."
2020-04-29 12:07,"This pretty much says it all Quote “Using executive power to force people back on the job without proper protections is wrong and dangerous,” Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., wrote on Twitter, saying he echoed calls by the food workers’ union “to put worker safety first.”"
2020-04-29 12:07,I don't have to eat any meat at all.  And I won't.
2020-04-29 12:09,"These horrific and cruel meat processing plants have clearly become coronavirus hot spots where numerous people have gotten ill and died, and yet this poor excuse of a president, with his total disregard for the health and safety of the workers, is selfishly trying to force them to risk their lives so he can have a cheeseburger, continue the CEO profits and in doing so support his re-election.   Who would want to eat anything that has come out of these plants anyway.  Close the plants!"
2020-04-29 12:04,"President Trump, show your support for the meat processing workers - visit a plant. The photo-op would boost your poll numbers"

2020-04-29 11:53,... but we're still dumping dairy.
2020-04-29 12:10,"Every decision Donald Trump makes is about money- someone wants to make some and he is always willing to help them (for a donation of course) and any loss of life is perfectly acceptable. 

Trump supporters should know by know that he believes every single one of them is entirely expendable.  Like he told the gold star mother, “this is what he signed up for”."
2020-04-29 12:14,"Is this meat safe to eat?    Meat workers who don’t show symptoms yet can be shedding the virus for days on the meat they are handling.   And I don’t trust this administration to guarantee the safety of any meat, chicken, pork, beef from these contaminated factories.   Trump is only thinking about his ratings and his wealthy pals who own these factories but what about the workers safety and the meat being safe?"
2020-04-29 12:14,So meat is critical but testing is not? Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people.  Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers.
2020-04-29 12:15,"Maybe ""essential"" has just become a euphemism for ""expendable.""  It's no wonder people who work in factories (not ""plants,"" another euphemism) where animal flesh and secretions  are processed are considered expendable: They are employed in an industry that exists because humans consider billions of living beings to be expendable.  It doesn't take a big leap to throw humans into that pile of expendability.  One more reason to embrace compassion and leave animal products off our menus."
2020-04-29 12:16,Not good.  We need the people that work in these processing plants to be tested and cleared before they handle our meat.  Just declaring that they must stay open without assisting them in this task is not good enough.  The federal government must commit to due dilligance in helping these people get tested IF Trump is going to declare this industry as critical infrastructure.
2020-04-29 12:22,"The workers are largely minority, and many can't vote and aren't unionized. The companies want to keep it that way, and the GOP wants to pay back the agribusinesses whose owners vote and give them money.  States that want to protect people have no right to do so. Just another page from the GOP playbook for dividing and weakening the country."
2020-04-29 12:22,The safety of our food supply is becoming an issue in Canada as well. COVID didn't sneak up on us - we had weeks if not months of growing concerns and information. So why did employers do nothing until there was an outbreak? Most have occupational health departments. Why did our health officials not identify these large employment sites as having higher risk for spread? These are all things that we need to learn from.
2020-04-29 12:23,"As a vegetarian the whole thing is disgusting- see ing the carcasses, the inside of these plants.  Time to lesson consumption.  Meat is high up on the food chain- any harmful chemicals become more concentrated.  It takes 20 bowls of grain to produce a pound of meat.  Better for the earth and for our health.  I am not strident- just lower consumption."
2020-04-29 12:23,"A DPA order that forces workers to protect profits at the expense of their personal health and safety, done.  A DPA order that forces plants to retool and produce PPE or testing supplies at the expense of profits to protect the health and safety of Americans, nope."
2020-04-29 12:24,If 20 Airline pilots had died would the reaction have been the same?  Or 20 politicians?  Or 20 Costco employees?  Or 20 PPE makers?  Or 20 doctors? All considered essential workers.  But a working class person who has a physical and emotionally challenging job in a remote area doesn't raise an eyebrow.
2020-04-29 12:28,"This administration has issued unenforceable ""guidelines"" instead of enforceable mandates as political hacks watered down the standard type of CDC and OSHA reports and conclusions issued after inspections of plants. Legally, the plants can ignore the guidelines and to make matters worse the trumpites want to provide indemnity from lawsuits. This is nothing more than blatant malfeasance on the part of the trump administration. It stands to reason that if these mega-producers won't protect their workers, in puts to question the safety of their products. Particularly, when the trump administration provides them legal cover if consumers are sickened. The only recourse consumers have is to avoid such products until the processing plants get their act together."
2020-04-29 12:28,"I wonder how many migrants are offered entry to the US and out of detention if they agree to work in one of these meat packing plants for a period of time and probably live in one of their dorms- it’s like they are prison labor-  which may be the next batch of
Workers if the migrants thing doesn’t work out - seems like we have an endless supply of expendables."
2020-04-29 12:30,"According to Trump, Personal Protective Equipment for healthcare workers is a luxury, but meat for grilling is essential.

The meat processing plants were closed by the owners because they had become Coronavirus hotspots.  So now Trump is forcing the workers to risk their health or be replaced while he's protecting the wealthy owners by giving them liability protections if their workers contract coronavirus.

There is no doubt that the Republicans are the party of the rich.  What is less clear is how  they swindle so many working people into voting for them when the Republicans clearly think that workers are expendable."
2020-04-29 12:32,"President Trump didn't want to force companies to coordinate to produce covid-19 tests, because that would be ""socialism"" and we'd be just like Venezuela. But heaven forbid he can't get a Big Mac.

Got it.

It's not difficult to predict Mr. Trump's actions: figure out the right thing to do or say in any situation, and expect the opposite."

2020-04-29 12:36,So we get a useless order yet not a word about the severe consolidation of the food process that allows a handful of closures to upend the food supply. Wonderful. And then the CEO of one of the major players puts out a full page mea culpa instead of going to the appropriate officials long ago to work on this potential problem.
2020-04-29 12:40,"Seems a lot of diseases come from eating animals.   H1N1, Mad cow, even the current pandemic is believed to have been caused by animal to human transmission.  Maybe it's time to switch to a more plant based diet?  It's easier on the environment too."
2020-04-29 12:41,"So exactly how does a plant stay open by Presidential order if the workers, largely undocumented immigrants, don’t show up for work?  Maybe the National Guard can be called up to perform these jobs?"
2020-04-29 12:42,COVID 19 allegedly spread to humans as a result of disgusting live animal trade culture and practices. Those most susceptible to complications are people who suffer from disease attributed to overconsumption in general and meat in particular (e.g. Obesity and heart disease) This is an opportunity to switch to a plant centered diet for your health and the environment.
2020-04-29 12:47,"I'm certainly not a vegan, but I don't see how a decline in meat consumption of 30% is a threat to national security.  Seems to me it's more of a threat to Tyson's bottom line.   Meat producers should only reopen when they can make adequate provision for worker safety.  Meat packing workers tend to be disproportionately poor and minority.  Sacrificing workers' health for corporate profits isn't exactly new but in this case it's particularly egregious.  Besides, do you really want to eat a chicken that came from a plant with an ongoing Covid-19 outbreak?"
2020-04-29 12:49,"There should be a mandate that if a business wants to open (or be “liberated”) the the owners, deciders should be REQUIRED to work in the same room as the lowest paid employees (or at least eat in the same lunchroom) so they will be proactive in protecting everyone at the company.

I love that the owners of my local retail/restaurant businesses that I support are working along with their employees to answer phone calls, prepare meals/packaging, provide curbside service or delivery. From what I can tell, they are operating their business responsibly to protect themselves, their employees and customers."
2020-04-29 12:49,"This is an industry that fights to the death regulations and inspections that are meant to protect their customers, us, from food borne illnesses like Salmonella, Shigella, Listeria and toxic E Coli. 
Is it any surprise that they also have no regard for the health of their mostly Brown and Black workers, their families and the communities they live in?
Is it no surprise Trump uses the full power of his presidency not to guarantee safety equipment for health care workers on the front line or the means to provide adequate testing for the virus so rational decisions could be made by governors? But to use it help a cruel and rapacious industry?
I hope the workers strike to protect themselves and their families for the government and industry are certain not to. And that all of us are willing to risk the chance of a decrease in availability of some meat to show our solidarity with the workers. No workers means no plants are open.
In 1945 the coal miners in KY struck. Truman called out the  KY National Guard to open the mines. The head of the UMW told Truman "" You cannot mine coal with bayonets"".
You cannot cut meat with bayonets either."
2020-04-29 12:51,"It there a legal provision within the authority of the DPA that overrides INS enforcement? If we’re invoking as severe a legal mandate as the DPA, how can CDC standards be voluntary? What kind of monitoring is/will be in place to ensure compliance by Tyson, it’s management, plant supervisors and employees as relates to testing and self-quarantining?"
2020-04-29 12:51,"Meat is not essential, just ask millions of vegetarians, or learn anything at all about nutrition.  Of course, we wouldn’t want to endanger the obesity epidemic, live by humane standards with animals, cut into corporate profits, or miss any chance to take advantage of poor people and immigrants.  I don’t expect anything different from the current administration, but it’s still hard not to be disappointed each time."
2020-04-29 12:51,"There is something about this that reminds me of the irony of the old Topol ""smoker's toothpaste.""  We risk the planet's health (climate-wise) producing a lot of this meat, the workers in the processing plants are becoming ill and risking their health (and maybe some of the meat is contaminated by the virus too),  and then people take risks to go buy it in a crowded store and then risk their health if they eat it frequently and heavily. Maybe we should be trying to be smarter about all of this?....."
2020-04-29 12:52,"A country is not ready to re-open if it can't guarantee a standard acceptable degree of workplace protection. No is advocating for full hazmat suit but when we can't even enforce wearing of masks, any attempt to re-open this country will be short lived and doomed. 

Airlines are still flying and there are some pretty horrifying situations being reported where flights are full and the majority of people are not even wearing masks. 

Into this situation you are going to force people back to work. So, the only choice in America is either potentially contract a deadly disease with no cure or lose your job and you can't feed your family?  Come on folks, we can do much better than that."
2020-04-29 12:53,"One third of meatpacking workers are immigrants, probably more. If Mr Trump thinks the work is essential are the workers not? Who does he think will replace these workers?"
2020-04-29 12:54,"Don’t kid yourself, not even for a minute. Donald Trump’ executive order to restore the supply of meat and eggs has little to do with Americans having adequate food. 

It was ordered so that Tyson Foods, the company that lied, and as best we know, still lying about the amounts of antibiotics they give chickens, and extreme human resource issues about workers having adequate break periods, could do business as usual.

I would guess that Larry Kudlow, Trump’s stock market maven, convinced Trump that by allowing Tyson to operate in its usual way, it would slow down the negative earnings effect to Tyson’s bottom line, and perhaps that of the entire foodstuff industry.

This, as we all know, or should know, means more shareholder return, and a boost to the Dow Jones Index. Trump, of course, understands very little of this,  especially food safety. But, we can wryly note that an increase to the Dow Jones Index bolsters his re-election prospects."
2020-04-29 12:56,"Executive orders are not mandates by fiat. This is not a monarchy. Executive orders clarify how federal workers are to execute on existing laws. Anything that goes beyond existing laws is unconstitutional. If a business wants to shut down, in this 'free' country, they should be able to shut down. If the EO specifically invokes the defense production act, then I could be totally wrong."
2020-04-29 12:57,"Meat -- specifically, prime steak -- is critical to the functioning of our president.  Without red meat (well done), Trump's creativity would crater.  With it, he has the strength and wisdom to foresee the projectry of and cures for COVID.  It's not easy to spend 12 hours a day (and night) watching network news.  Or to have the courage and perseverance to confront Fake News every day -- another precious 2-3 hours of his time.  He's doubtless anxious for schools to reopen quickly so that he can visit American youth on their campuses, maskless and gloveless.  And clueless."
2020-04-29 13:00,"Well folks, this is the crack in the door corporations have been salivating for. So now legally workers have ZERO recourse for their health and safety. 

The Trump administration and the corporate government just declared war on the workers.

The workers take ALL THE RISK and corporations have ZERO. As workers drop dead the corporations will simply plug another in like a hand tool.

Workers need to see how the virus shut down the mighty US economy and that the workers can do the same.

France’s workers stage general country wide strikes to get what they need, there is absolutely no reason it will not work in the US.

Workers must realize the real power they have and shut down the country to a standstill.

It is time to tell Trump and the establishment to go POUND SAND."
2020-04-29 13:01,"Our President’s failure to require suppliers to produce PPEs and other necessities to help our medical community (doctors, nurses, ambulance and hospital maintenance personnel) care for our fellow Americans Is disheartening, discouraging and without an iota of kindness.  Their services are essential. 

I can’t understand the order to keep meat plants going, even despite the recommendation of some owners of the companies that the executive just made.  What is the rationale?   If someone can explain this decision to me, I sure would appreciate it."
2020-04-29 13:02,"With the co-morbidities of diabetes and COVID-19, not to mention the obesity-driven cardio-pulmonary co-morbidities, you would think that a sensible Administration would account for how continuing to overeat meat risks lives in the short term and an American economy weighed down by eating-behavior-based illness in the long term.  A visionary Administration would support our collective health, humanity and economy of agricultural and water (irrigation) innovation in plant-based diets.  What a waste of leadership."
2020-04-29 13:04,"Does this order include egg processing plants? Animal products processing plants are the hot spots of Covid-19 infection in my state so this is a shortsighted order. Of course, my state's Republican governor jumped right on the bandwagon and announced that anyone who quit her/his job because of Covid-19 in the workplace would be ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits. In other words, a disquieting voluntary quit without good cause."
2020-04-29 13:05,I find it just a bit too coincidental that the alarm of massive meat shortages is being made by Tyson whose meat  plants are so troubled by the spread of the the pandemic. At the very least his company is to benefit from shortages which limit supply and will drive up prices.
2020-04-29 13:05,Buy local and buy less. I’ve shopped the local farmers market for meat during the entire quarantine in PA. No shortages. No panic. No problem. I’ll never buy from the big corporate industrial meat producers again.

2020-04-29 13:00,"So, who's gonna put a (metaphorical) gun to Trump's head to give him a reason to worry about worker safety?  Certainly not the Republican Party of Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, the Original Strikebreakers.

Don't put it beyond Trump, Mitch, Kevin & Co. to resort to military ""encouragement"" of slaughter and packing house workers to MAGA."
2020-04-29 13:11,"I live in the Northeast Georgia mountains, not far from Gainesville Georgia, which claims to be the Chicken Capital of the World.

I have no idea how many chickens are processed there in a day but there are countless chicken houses throughout Northeast Georgia.

I believe that Trump is going to learn another lesson about the limits of his power.  He can order those processing plants to remain open and if ordered, they may stay open but that does not mean the workers will show up. 

Those chicken processing plants, like other plants across the nation, have become pandemic hot spots.  To the workers, Trump's orders will be tempered by their fear of becoming ill."
2020-04-29 13:14,"We need to revolutionize our food system. Instead of supporting exploitative (human and nonhuman) industrial animal agriculture, we should instead invest in small farms, farmers and plant based foods. This particular virus is obviously a wake up call."
2020-04-29 13:18,"This industry has never shown any concern for the safety and well-being of its employees that long predates the arrival of COVID-19 and paid poverty wages.  It's not enough to force these poor souls back to a work environment that will certainly kill a number of them but the companies want to be shielded from any liability to human life- their employees and consumers (let's not forget about their damage to the environment).  Trump, his administration and the Republicans in Congress should be charged with and tried for war crimes against humanity.

The answer is unionizing for everyone who cam be unionized, before the GOP manages to make it illegal. Large-scale strikes are looking more and more necessary to upend this rigged system. But you can probably count on the Trump GOP to order in the military to break any strike now. That’s how much damage they’ve been able to do to our so-called freedoms as Americans.

When NY and other states were begging the Federal Government for ventilators to deal with skyrocketing infection/fatality curves, Trump told  us that invoking the Defense Production Act was a bad idea, because, he cryptically implied, it might ""make us turn out like Venezuela"".  And he made similar refusals, followed by dithering and then belated acquiescence, when States have requested more PPE and enhanced testing capabilities.  But now, he's using this very same Defense Production Act to force meat and pork processing plants to stay open, all while endangering the lives of those who work elbow-to-elbow in those very plants.  So what he's saying is that our ability to eat meat and pork is more important than our hospitals' ability to save COVID-19 victims, at the same time that they protect their frontline Doctors and Nurses!

What cynicism comes next? Slavery! Slave labor produces an outcome not all that different from the ""slave's choice"" he gives to working people. History looms over his shoulders. 

He ought to offer workers unlimited free health care and daily testing for COVID 19; income continuation and job protection if the employer gives them permission to stay home to protect family and friends and to conform to directives for social distancing; the right to sue an employer for endangerment; punitive liability for employers that violate the law; strong regulation and oversight of plants to ensure health safety regulations to prevent the spread of COVID 19 are enforced. 

Finally, the orange monstrosity should call out the National Guard and order them to pack meat wherever plants become under-staffed. He actually has the moral authority to do that.

I had many of the symptoms and obvious direct contact, but I could never get tested because I was told I didn’t have a fever. I did, but because my normal base temperature is 97.5, when I registered at 98.9, nobody outside of my PCP considered it elevated. 98.9, for me, was the equivalent of 99.9, which would have qualified anyone else for a test.

Either the rules aren't tight enuf or the enforcement of them too lax and unconcerned with the labor force.   In either case, short-sited company execs, and governors like IA's Kim Reynolds, whose rhetoric matches Trump's, are causing more plant closings and illness than we'd have if proper precautions had been previously taken."

Would Americans starve or suffer if they didn't eat meat for a month or two months? Don't think so but it would hurt the fast food industry if they couldn't sell their greasy burgers, hot dogs or deep fried chicken. So why is Trump using the Act?

We're all set on protein, Mr. President. Focus on calcium, because calling poultry inspection an ""essential service"" strongly suggests you need a backbone."

Now, Americans, even our dear “leader”, are too greedy and self absorbed to care what happens to their fellow citizens or the country as a whole. Even though many people may die to supply them with a Big Mac, they’re happy to make that sacrifice. 

If you need protein, there are these little things called beans. Cheaper, packed with protein and minus the cruelty."
2020-04-29 16:48,"Trump clearly has interests of the owners of big meatpackers in mind with his latest action - including the WH Group of China that owns Smithfield.  Clear also that he has no regard for the workers, their families or the communities into which workers disperse - carrying the virus with them - as their shift ends.  As a matter of (real, not alternative) fact, hard to think of a more efficient way to get community spread of coronavirus than beginning each day by bringing hundreds of workers together and having them work eight or ten hours in close contact with workers infected with the virus to ensure effective transmission, then sending these newly-infected workers back out to infect their families and other community members as they go about their normal activities.  Credit Trump with true genius in using DPA to get truly effective spread of coronavirus and the Covid19 it causes!   Congratulations Glorious leader!"

2020-04-29 17:29,"I'm sorry, but packing plant workers are falling ill and dying by the thousands. We call all make do with less meat if that's what it takes to stop the spread, especially considering that the corporations are at fault for not taking any measures to prevent the spread and encouraging workers to come to work even when they were exposed or even sick. Smithfield was offering bonus for perfect attendance!

The dirty secret is that a very large percentage of the workers in those plants are immigrants (many undocumented) and refugees, and those corporations and the White House see their lives as disposable.

Please, don't buy meat. THAT won't kill you. Widespread contagion in your community may."
2020-04-29 17:31,"Setting aside Trump and his abominable diet for a moment, let's not forget that people are also employed in the processing of vegetal sources of food. Worker health and safety is not just an issue in feed lots and slaughterhouses.

I see other posters raising the rationing of dairy and meat during WWII, which is an interesting point, but what I don't see is any discussion of victory gardens.

If other areas of agriculture suffer from similar employee outbreaks, we'll also see shortages of fresh produce and other plant-based foods. In other words, if you have one, you might want to consider expanding your garden."
2020-04-29 17:32,"Give me meat or give me death?

So far, Trump and his GOP/Trumpist Party appear to be choosing death at every turn.  Mandating the meat supply chain operate with no realistic, legally enforceable means of effective COVID-19 health and safety protection for employees- essentially giving that industry a ‘license to kill’ for profits. 
If the GOP/Trumpist Senate stopped handing out corporate welfare / 1 percenter campaign finance 'bribes', our tax dollars could actually be used for what truly needs to be done to combat COVID-19 (i.e. pay for adequate testing, PPE's, and real protections for front-line workers and folk's that were already living hand-to-mouth / paycheck to paycheck, before the pandemic).

Got to wonder if Trump's penchant for 'rat burgers' and the GOP'S tradition of putting 1 percent-er wealth before 99 percent-er health, are not root motivators for yet another failing Trumpist edict.  Trump's 'meat thing' exemplifies the fairy tale of human nature and business voluntarily enforcing CDC guidelines in work place and public spaces.  I love meat as much as the next person, but given a choice between meat vs. other viable protein sources, it doesn't / didn't have to be that way, but that's Trump's unilateral choice for you.  Given what the Trumpist Party is forcing on us, I'm willing to 'sacrifice' meat to combat COVID-19.  How about you?"
2020-04-29 17:43,"Why should the U.S government subsidize the meat industry and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association who then encourage everyone to eat meat? Americans already eat 1/6 of the total meat produced in the world, clogglng their  arteries at the rate of 2 percent a year. A plant based diet is the way to go and the hostility of our government to such a message, not only  hurts everyone driving up medical costs but we have not even gotten into animal cruelty, water pollution, methane gas and the environmental impact of eating meat."

This is Republican economics, employment policy?

What assurance is there these laggard companies will keep my food free of exposure to the disease that's caused all this?  Why on earth would I believe they would do such a thing?

Not when one meat factory has fostered hundreds of exposures and still refuses to keep its workers safe.

Not when Tyson drags a sick woman back to the line and keeps her there fondling raw chicken until she dies of Coronavirus.

Not when corporate fan-girl Iowa threatens workers with loss of their benefits if they refuse to return to hellish, unprotected jobs as ordered by the Prez.

There may be Smithfield beef and Tyson chicken on the shelves, only an idiot would eat it."

No executive order for N-95.
No executive order for PPE.
No executive for ventilators.

We have tested slightly more than 1% of the population. At the end of the day if we don't have adequate testing to tame this pandemic, we just re-open any business blindly. It doesn't matter whether it is poultry, cattle industry, restaurant, football, concert or school, operation of any business will not even be close to half of normalcy. We are at risk of resurgent of the contagion or facing the second wave in Fall."
2020-04-29 18:30,"Donald Trump's absolute lack of concern for the well-being of America's working people is make starkly clear with this meat packing decision.

Workers are forced to return to work or lose their unemployment.  But the Trump Administration is making CDC guidelines for health safety voluntary for the companies and providing them with immunity from lawsuits for not providing a safe working place.

The irony is one of the largest of these companies -- Smithfield Foods -- was purchased by a Chinese Company in 2013 with a $4 billion loan from the Chinese Government owned Bank of China.

Thus we have Trump forcing American workers into a virus infested work environment, with voluntary safety requirements for the benefit of a Chinese Government financed profit-making company.  

What more does it take for American's to see just who Trump is?"
2020-04-29 18:36,"Please big government fans, explain how meat will get to my grocery store by virtue of a federal edict. The unintended consequence of this action was to allow the companies to force their workers to be in unsafe conditions through a liability shield.  You cannot plan an economy by government fiat. The proper response would have been to double the price of pork. Food is too cheap in America in any way. The higher price would have allowed for safer worker conditions and a priority coordination by farmers, processors, and transportation companies."

Now is the time for consumers to stand with the unions and insist that these rapacious companies do right by their employees and provide PPE and testing to ensure their safety as well as paid sick leave.

No defense production act for life saving equipment for those on the front lines of the fight, but Trump invokes it at the behest of the meat processing companies, at the expense of the health and well being of the workers and the nation. 

The US has the highest number of confirmed cases globally,  isn't that reason enough for alarm and invoking the defense protection act for PPEs so that fewer citizens will die needlessly?  PPEs are not considered critical infrastructure during this national emergency? But meat, in a country where we may have less selection now, but still have more food available to us than most other countries during non-pandemic times.

I feel for the workers. If they want to work, then yes, this is a good thing. If they want to reduce their risk and live, they are being denied this option and employers are given a pass not not ensure worker health or safety. What about right to life? That's in the Constitution too. Forcing people without health insurance, for low wages with no regard to their safety feels, rather is, positively medieval.

They are covered in protective gear from head to foot, making sure the meat product is safe from contamination. Shame isn't it that some of these owners didn't value them as much as the product. Didn't provide protective PPE's for them, just PPE's for the dead meat. Now they have to choose to go back to work or starve, what kind of choice is that. My heart breaks for them and the choices they have to make. If I had children what choice would I have except to go back to work and just hope. I'm glad I'm a vegetarian.

The self-declared ""War Time President"" has no problem providing bullets and body armor - as he should -  for our armed forces; but little or no  protection for our citizen warriors in their life and death battle against this hideous disease. Our states have to fight it out for such limited supplies. This, while his number one general Mike Pence, shows the troops how it's done by refusing to wear an offered face mask while visiting otherwise masked infected patients and medical staff at the Mayo Clinic.

I really don't care what niggling little changes they make at this point.  First it's way too little way too late, and second, they've been doing a LOT of clear lying.   They could say they found Jesus and reinvented themselves and I for one wouldn't believe it.

Farmers will either develop new supply chains or starve, their choice, and if they choose to starve, I'm not worrying about it!

One exception, it is not just whites doing 'well' it also is immigrant asians in many instances who have come for the Amercian Dream and worked hard to build up a business and become entrepreneurs.  The difference between the haves and have-nots still comes down to education at an early level. Look at how important education is to the asians. I've taught many of them.  Until someone tells the teachers unions in big cities to stop fighting charter schools so that inner city children can have a fighting chance to escape the cycle, it will just keep repeating.

Yes, there are always going to be rich people and poor people. And yes, there will always be white collar workers and service industry workers. But the extent that people of color over populate one group over another is mostly a matter of choice, not some racially motivate bias.

The more affluent among us naturally have the better jobs, even ones which allow them flexible hours and the ability to work remotely. Those jobs come with educational (not racial) requirements. Something most people of color choose not to pursue, primarily because education was never properly emphasized in their upbringing, or their existing economic situation didn't encourage it.

Those among us working in the service industry do so because that is the only jobs we qualify for. Again, this is primarily due to lack of education. But it is primarily education, not race, dictating who gets access to what jobs. 

Now, during shut-down, many of these service industry jobs are on hold. Which means these workers are not getting a paycheck. If the economy opens, but some workers elect not to return to work, then again those same workers will not be getting a paycheck. Either way, everyone is in the same boat.

So I fail to see the racial inequity of opening up the economy versus keeping is shut down. It's not a racial issue to begin with. Its about education."

Working in a country where one can be fired for having the wrong skin color, the wrong political opinions, being too experienced, or, as in this crisis, too outspoken, does not make for a good workplace.  

Sick leave, paid vacations (of a decent length), leave to care for family members, high quality day care; all of this is part and parcel of being in the workforce in many developed countries.  So are decent minimum wages.  Only in America, since we count ourselves as part of the developed world, are people penalized for being unable, for whatever reason, to work or to work in a popular, well paying field.

I don't see many employees asking for enough money to purchase luxury items unless politicians consider decent housing, decent schools, access to good medical care when and where it's needed, food, and yes, smartphones, a luxury."

Corporations are polities--they make policy, police policy which employees must recognize and obey--in accordance with more general policy--property, tax, labor and corporate law, treating employers as feudal lords.

""Jobs Jobs Jobs"" is a scam for corporate welfare and employee subjugation. As though serving your employer is the meaning of life.

What I don't understand is the premise.  If one makes a priority to focus on education when young, one can do almost anything in the US.  Even without a college education.  As a matter of fact, many do quite well.  Education and effort give you a leg up.  How is paying people just for being born supposed to improve 'inequality?'

The Times has been doing a great job reporting throughout the pandemic. But this piece should never have been published. No kudos for Tankersley today."
2020-04-28 15:25,"Too-early restarts may benefit some individual bottom lines and the mental health of some, but communitarian concerns for the larger economy should be put on hold, because as long as everyone isn't back, the economy isn't back.  Collective concerns have to placed on defeating the virus first."
2020-04-28 15:56,"I'm skeptical that the virus situation is going to be any different in 1 year or even 3 years of lockdown, unless herd immunity works out despite the lockdowns.  People will get sick sooner or later, unfortunately.

We are not getting a vaccine within a year.  Two or three years at the earliest if it's even possible."

2020-04-28 16:03,"Yes we know there is income inequality and these situations point it out even more. What these articles never seem to do is talk about cultural values within the communities that also hold them back.
And it's not just the culture in minority communities that hold them back. Look at poor white rural areas or areas with large concentrations of Orthodox Jews (I'm a Jew) ."
2020-04-28 18:00,"This story makes the classic mistake of confusing causation and correlation. It argues that blacks and Hispanics, because of their ethnicity, are worse off as a result of businesses reopening. The author implies a cause and effect relationship. A better analysis would focus on (lack of) education as a predictor of who is worse off as people are called back to work (causation), and then note that blacks and Hispanics have, on average, lower education levels than whites (correlation)."
2020-04-28 18:12,"Here's the truth. There will always be a need for people to fill jobs that require on-site work, and those people will always be most vulnerable during a situation such as this, regardless of whether stores shut or remain open. That is an inescapable fact. No amount of government regulation or liberal pontificating will change that, unless we're ready to go full automation in some of these sectors.

It's unfortunate, perhaps, but it's the reality."
2020-04-28 18:54,"My question is who decided that tattoo parlors, hair dressers, and nail salons are ""essential""? I can live without all of those for the next six months (I am a woman who used and wants all of them). Instead, I could use a walk in a park, need to get my driver's license renewed before it expires, and have my car's radio fixed."
2020-04-28 21:59,"The folks about whom the author worries  are less at risk if, as noted in the article, people remain reluctant to leave home to go to the businesses where poorer people work. They will, if their employers reopen, have a paycheck, reassurance that their jobs remain, a routine, and a sense of purpose. They will not be confined 24/7 with out-of-school children in relatively small homes. It's not so simple as the author portrays it."
2020-04-28 23:23,"Where is the national plan or strategy coordinating all aspects of getting back to work?  What are the interstate logistics, health considerations, supply chain issues just to name a few things that need to be addressed.  Shouldn't these be a comprehensive effort led on a nonpartisan basis managed by a competent and able POTUS leading the federal government once the issues have been realized and identified however late?  Finger pointing and excuse making is not and will not get it done."
2020-04-29 0:04,"In my opinion, no matter when or how the ""economy"" starts many of the low-paid workers and self-employed will be near slavery, with off and on work and no benefits or security. The federal government will have to deal with a 5 or6 trillion deficit this year with more to come. The states will be in a similar financial strait but without printing money. Most retirement plans including social security will be cash short. Only the top 10% or 20% of wealth will be able to manage in this envoirment."
2020-04-29 1:50,"Let's see if I have this correct:  Minorities are disproportionately suffering because of the business closures caused by the coronavirus, but when businesses open again, minorities will disproportionately suffer.

2020-04-29 6:26,"This article touches on exactly what some of us are facing. I work in an office where at the moment most people are working from home. As one of the lowest paid workers, dispatchers (working in open air area) we have to continue to come in. Management is polling at home workers wether they want to come back, but those of us that have been risking our health the last 6 weeks don’t have a say and would prefer they don’t come back till there is a real drop in cases or vaccine for this. We are out of sanitizer, Lysol, and there has been no direction on how we at the office can stay safe. 
I need to work, but I’m scared to death I’ll get sick-there are too many unknowns re: this virus. 
We all feel lost, frustrated and scared because there is no clear consensus on any level of what should be done to get us ALL thru this. This is the first time I’ve ever felt like a second class citizen due to the job I do."
2020-04-29 8:06,"Can anyone explain why we still do not have the proper testing needed before reopening the country? Until we do employers are issuing possible death sentences to their employees, their families and their communities. 

We just do not know who and how many are infected when not testing those asymptomatic.

This is exactly what happened in the 1918 pandemic and we have learned absolutely nothing from the death tolls of opening up the country too soon. 

This will lead to more social distancing when the second wave comes to kill, destroying the economy that employers and especially Trump (only because of his reelection fears) want to fix."
2020-04-30 14:01,"I will tell you a story about economic inequality that you have ignored. There are over three million oil and gas royalty oil holders, mostly small land holders like farmers, that have lost their royalty oil revenue as almost all small oil fields have closed. One day you earn some income and the next day it is gone and in most cases gone for, probably, forever. There is no bailout for these people. They join the line that part time workers and illegal immigrants who work under the radar are standing in. No bailout for them. Large swathes of our economy are being mostly ignored in this crisis."
2020-05-02 2:28,"My father is hispanic and works in healthcare and most of his employees are people of color, all of whom are able to work from home on a computer and keep their jobs safely.

2020-05-02 11:37,"If we do not tax the hereditary oligarchy back into the upper middle class, there will be a class war in this century.  Democracy cannot coexist with ALEC and the Club for Growth.

Otherwise we will degenerate into Rome redux, and the great majority of Americans will be de facto electoral plebes, voting for anyone who will feed them."
2020-05-07 17:59,"As with just about everything else, Trump is wrong about reopening so soon.

Why is anyone listening to him? You don't have to be a professional political pundit, Wall Street whizkid, or epidemiology expert to see how reopening is going to go: badly.

May our individual decisions in the ballot box come November be better than buffoons'."
2020-04-28 10:36,"People it seems will get used to anything in that office. It becomes normal. Some turn it off, look away. It's past time for Joe Biden, if he is the challenge to this, to show us the decency we used to have at the top."

But, somehow, I don’t foresee that ever happening.

The media needs Trump as much as he needs the attention. It is called co-dependency, and we know from psychotherapy that both parties are damaged and complicit in its continuance."

That why he came back.  This delusion that he's some kind of supreme super power is the essence of his existence.  He lives in an imaginary world, and doesn't know it.  His whole life is a dream.  Trump's only reality is what he says it is.

This is the person Republican party leaders believe is suitable to be president of the United States.

2020-04-28 10:58,"Actually it was becoming one of our family's rituals, dependable as the Johnny Carson show (had been in its day)for sending us  to bed laughing. But without the diversity or wit. The presidential  'bully pulpit' has become just that: a platform for attacking doubters and spreading lies.Why should he deny himself free air-time denied any challenger? And why would the base doubt him; he reflects all their neuroses and dislike of education, facts, and responsibility?"
2020-04-28 10:53,"Trump’s inability to stay away from the camera is a direct result of his narcissism. In his mind, he can never do anything wrong; the simple fact that he does it makes it right. Ergo, since he never makes mistakes in front of the camera (in his fantasy world), there s no reason for him to avoid the stage. Let’s all hope he continues being a moth to the flame, incinerating his re-election chances this November in the process."
2020-04-28 10:59,"As soon as Trump opened his mouth, he was in campaign mode. Where are Democrats' demands for equal time?"
2020-04-28 10:50,"We've been reading in the Washington Post the last few days that Trump routinely ignored or refused to read his Presidential Daily Intelligence Briefing - which provides the President with updated urgent information about national and world affairs first thing every morning.  He had no interest in the information contained therein.

He ignored them at our peril.  In January, the PDI began
including dire warnings about the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.

Trump continued his daily 'celebrity coronavirus apprentice' yesterday because appearing before crowds to chatter off the top of his head - especially about himself - is the only part of being president he likes. Everything else has just been an interruption into the 300 days he's spent at his golf resorts  - one long festival of golfing, rallies & tv, enjoying being president - 'the most famous man in the world' but doing no real work.  

Basically, Trump's spent his presidency on vacation.

Many understood in 2016 Trump was ignorant of the job of president, ignorant of current affairs & policy - to the point he turned the G.O.P. primary & then the race against HRC into a carnival of the totally irrelevant:  jokes, threats, bizarre biographical commentary & empty proclamations that didn't address any real problems.  Trump didn't even know what the country's urgent problems were (""Mexicans!"").

We're paying now for his narcissistic need for an audience & for his 'base' that provides it.

The rest of us watch in fear & horror."
2020-04-28 10:58,"The information transmitted by President Trump,  Vice President Pence, and medical experts are very valuable. The sadomasochistic exchanges between Trump the showman bullier and the disrespectful limelight seeking press are not worth it."
2020-04-28 11:18,"None of his appearances, rallies, photo ops are worth our time. And now, in a desperate attempt to shift attention away from the real American Carnage (words from his own Inaugural Address), he is going to risk lives of West Point graduating classroom preen, strut and lie in front of a captive audience. I want to live long enough to crawl to a polling place or ideally mail in my ballot to throw this entirely corrupt person out of office. Then, I will tune into to see AG James read her indictments."
2020-04-28 11:21,He couldn’t come to grips with not hearing himself talk in front of cameras.  Withdrawal is not Trump’s forte.
2020-04-28 11:22,"Donald - you wild and crazy guy! I love surprises (especially when he reverses himself on foreign policy). Who misses the boring predictability of previous administrations? Every day in America unfolds as per Donald's favorite maxim: ""we'll see what happens!"""
2020-04-28 11:23,"The lure of the TV cameras is simply too much for a person with a Narcissistic Personality Disorder to avoid. The American Psychological Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Volume 5 sets 9 criteria for the disorder.  Trump has all 9. One of them is an incessant desire for attention and admiration.

So if you didn’t know why he couldn’t resist the cameras yesterday, or ever, now you know."
2020-04-28 11:22,"One simple question for all my republican friends, family and coworkers, why?"
2020-04-28 11:15,"Trump brags about the high ratings he is getting on his ""news briefings"" (its neither news nor is it brief).
High ratings?  Maybe it is because he rudely commandeers the media usually interrupting local news broadcasts.  
Watching the local news is where we get the real information about what is happening.  (Have never heard anyone on the local news suggest we drink Clorox to cure Covid 19).
So I allow the ""doctor in chief"" to babble on so I can determine when he will either give up or the stations will return to the local news.  In the beginning  he would take up the entire 30 minutes and I would miss among other things the weather report. He does this all to support his ""Very Great Insecurities"".  Enough. My TV is on mute.  
Yet, I am sadly counted in his ratings."
2020-04-28 11:17,"Like an insect, Trump is attracted to the headlights, destined to crash into it and end life. In this case: his re-election prospects."
2020-04-28 11:22,"His ability to play the media like a cheap fiddle is indeed pure genius.  His more outlandish comments get the best coverage - the disinfectant statement has had major coverage for five days now - so the more bizarre or controversial the better.  The media, all types, don't seem to have figured that out yet.  Genius.  Pure freeeekin genius."
2020-04-28 11:17,"Here's a thought: instead of the endless litany of all the stupid things Trump has said and done, and continues to say and do, how about the NY Times write up ONLY the factual parts or informative parts of the Trump show. Like Joe Friday, we all want ""Just the facts"".   Can you fill a few less column inches and just bullet point the stuff that has merit?"
2020-04-28 11:46,"And he actually did pretty well, keeping it short, and with the presence of many private business leaders who repeatedly praised him, and who Trump praised back. At one point in the future, regardless of who the president is, every American will and should be very proud of the united response by private and public sectors to this crisis, which demonstrate the greatness of this nation."
2020-04-28 11:36,"He's right. The Briefings, or at least the part where ""President"" Trump speaks are not worth the time, which is why  I stay away. The media coverage of them (again, Trump's part of them) is nothing less than the networks giving Trump free campaign appearances.

Speaking of which, Trump's plan to speak at the West Point graduation presents the networks with a challenge: Do we  give free coverage to a Trump campaign rally, with him using West Point cadets as props, or stay away?"
2020-04-28 11:51,"We have thousands of dedicated professionals working to protect our national security. Their most important findings and advice are distilled into a daily national security briefing for the president. Since early January, the President's Daily Brief warned him repeatedly about a coming pandemic.

Trump's reaction? He declined to read them. 

This is malignant narcissism in action. If Trump isn't the star of the show, he changes the channel. 

It is difficult to forgive the Republican Senators for not removing this disastrous president from office."
2020-04-28 11:51,"Trump is now going to do the impossible, open the economy and suppress  the election."
2020-04-28 11:38,"Can you imagine what it would be like if the press pretended to be characters in a Far Side cartoon?  Just staring blankly at Trump and when he wants to be asked a question, no one has any.  And after like 30 seconds, the press just shrugs their shoulders and gets up and walks out.  It would be great.  Imagine Trump saying ""Wait.  Where are you going?  Don't you have any questions for me?  C'mon back.  I'll ask the questions and answer them too. You can't leave.  I'm not done yet."""
2020-04-28 11:31,"Don’t watch these briefings, but just saw a short clip replayed that amazed me.  Trump saying that he built the greatest economy ever.  Then followed how the stock market was up yesterday.  How clueless.  First of all, the stock market is not the economy.  And, you think you might realize this when you have countless Americans wondering how they are going to pay their bills and lining up at food banks.
Then Trump related all this economic downfall to this “thing that should never have happened.”  Not sure what that even means in referring to the virus.  I think what he really wanted to say was this thing that should not have happened to me in my time in office.  Because everything and anything is all about him."
2020-04-28 11:31,"Of course he'll continue to go out there, and force himself on the American people who choose to watch.  I'm sort of torn between wanting him to to so--so more of America can see exactly how this man is--and wishing him off the tube completely.

When he confined himself to his own rallies, it was easier to ignore his self-absorption, grievances, and lies.  Now, for those who watch (I sure don't, not live) they get unfiltered Trump.

I suspect many more will be totally sick of the man after more months of his litany of complaints and hopefully, will be eager to vote him out of office."
2020-04-28 11:38,"Most are aware Trump's been chomping at the bit to get back to those run-up to the 2020 election rallies he's been holding -seemingly forever-those dependable rallies held in 'Swing-States' that had become a weekly staple he could interject amongst his golfing weekends at Mar a Lago and occasional weekly White House appearances. 

But then his weekly, crafty-jetting hither and yon- had came to a halt once the Covid-19 virus got the attention of our nation, attention Trump had been doing his best to downplay for months, mind you. 

But within days, came the next-best thing, the Covid-19 Press Briefings-immediately coming across more like happy-talk, self congratulatory pep rallies but obviously not what they shoiuld have been-that is, sessions to inform and reassure the yearning public to what was going on, that much needed, steadying-hand our nation needed. 

But eventualy, Trump pounced anyway, seemingly, deciding 'these'll do just fine'. He had an arena once again where he could get his points across and equally satisfying, a daily opportunity to beat up on 'the press', something he warmed to years earlier at all those pre-2016 election rallies.

And with that said, at the end of the da, it became obvious Trump got his groove back. He just couldn't stay away."
2020-04-28 11:52,"Do you think Trump can keep up the daily carnival barking (briefings) until November? How much can America endure?

In less than four years Trump has made the American public schizophrenic and moved other nations of the world from centuries of envy and admiration of America to laughter and pity.

I cannot to watch Trump on TV or even hear his voice on the radio. To do so is to risk my emotional health. He is hopeless as are Republicans and his supporters. There's nothing new to see. Nothing else to say.

I can only hope we can endure until the national nightmare ends. The Trump nightmare itself is a deadly pandemic. May it come to an end in November. Then may we begin to reopen and restore America.  From both pandemics."

2020-04-28 11:53,"Pompous, fact free ""wing-it"" briefings by the President have no useful function in our democracy. Media should attend but not report on vacuous, meandering, and destructive ramblings. Like SNL now, these should be taped, with only newsworthy highlights reported on. Providing this White House free airtime without condition make reporting media complicit in its debasing of our democracy."
2020-04-28 11:30,"When are the news reporters and the American people going to understand that Donald Trump can't stay away from his bully pulpit.  The man is a narcissist and thrives on attention.  The reporters at those briefings are in la la land if they think that they (reporters) are going to catch him in a lie or that Trump will be honest with the American people.   Trump has those reporters eating out of the palm of his hand.  And he knows it. 

As to Dr. Birx, she is typical of mothers who think they can protect their child by defending and explaining what their children say and do.  When she stands there or with Fox News and says, ""let me really explain what he meant"".   Dr. Birx is a great disappointment and represents women who are still living in the 50's and 60's.  Women who think that they must please everyone, their husbands and families.  You remember those women, with the apron on and smiling and making Dad's and Johnny's favorite chocolate cake.  Everything will be wonderful and then smile.  Don't forget the pearls too.   Instead Dr. Birx is wearing a scarf and not pearls.

Trump is an egomaniac and unfortunately we are stuck with him until January.  Hopefully Trump and his grifters will be out of the White House and sanity and honesty will be back in the White House with Joe Biden.  But trust me, Trump will still continue with his craziness from his retreat at Mar a Largo and the golf course, ranting and continuing to tell outlandish lies.  And his followers will be there."

2020-04-28 11:56,"As a true reality star villain, Mr. Dr. Trump was simply testing the media to see if they could do without him and once again he has proven himself correct, as they have flocked to his latest news conference in large numbers. He recognizes that without him the news media would have little to report which would eventually lead to layoffs and  yet another industry experiencing financial failure. So, he sacrifices himself to keep that part of the economy stable. Since national and world news revolves around him, it's only proper that he make himself available to enrich our lives during this period of fake pandemic, or whatever else he chooses to call it. Rain or shine, hot or cold, here, there, or anywhere, when Mr. Dr. Trump decides to talk, the media will be there to listen because his alternate reality offers us a glimpse into our potential future."

Only he possesses the “best words” that will keep the hook set in the mouths of his base.   Like countless other spontaneous pronouncements, “not worth the time and effort” was valid until it wasn’t."

Can anyone imagine this happening with any other president?

Trump has truly diminished the stature of the office of the greatest country. To think he may get re-elected just boggles the mind. To think what this country will be like if he does get re-elected sends shivers down the spine. 

Vote. Drag yourself to your polling site and vote. Put on your masks, PPE, whatever it takes. Transport those who are unable. Pressure you representatives to allow mail-in ballots. Do whatever has to be done and vote. If Trump’s failure to lead and daily lies putting you and your family’s lives literally at risk during this pandemic doesn’t do it then I suggest looking in the mirror and and take stock of the person looking back. 

We are better than this. I have to believe that."
2020-04-28 12:29,"One needs to think like Trump (briefly, please!) to understand yesterday. For him, it isn't about the quality or substance of these briefings. It is about the ratings. The on-off again nature of yesterday's  briefing only served to build buzz in advance of the big event. The press fell for it and many were left wondering what the big news would be. And, to no one's surprise, there wasn't any. 

Labeling them press briefings or press conferences is irrelevant. If the president decided to change the nomenclature to ""PANDEMIC WARNING!"" to boost the ratings, he would."
2020-04-28 12:28,"“Not worth the time”.  Unbelievable those words coming out of the  President’s mouth.  People have lost their loved ones, unable to bury their loved ones properly, people are fighting for their lives to live and please do not forget who are in this to keep them fighting to live, our first responders.  Most of our Governors and local officials are fighting this everyday to ensure our safety and when it will be the right time to reopen this country.   And those working to make sure we get food, mail, the basic things to get us through this health and economic crises that will last for years and recovery will be slow and very painful.  But according  to Trump, it’s “not worth his time” to simply do  a daily briefing."
2020-04-28 12:27,"Trump, the man who rose to ""fame"" as a reality TV star, simply could not stand that Cuomo's briefings were still going on and were better received than his ever were.

It is a shame that CNN and MSNBC waste time showing the clown under the pretense of news briefings.  They should shut them down and let FOX News alone carry them.
2020-04-28 12:55,Trumo has proven that even in the midst of a pandemic his main concern is his ratings.
2020-04-28 12:55,"When Trump said he was going to make America great again, he was just being sarcastic. What he really meant to say is he was going to make Trump great again, and what better way to than to turn a failed New York brander and fading reality show star into an acting president straight out of central casting. Grifters gotta grift and incompetent presidents seeking re-election gotta appear on TV even if it's ""not worth their time.""

2020-04-28 12:33,"They weren’t worth my time either. Anytime I see his face or hear his voice, I turn off the radio or tv. Why should I waste my time with his lies or medical advice? He is completely useless - and worse than that - he is a danger to us all."
2020-04-28 12:44,"1. Embrace fake news. Joe-get out of that basement-set up a presidential looking podium in your garden and start telling us how you will bring our country back from this abyss.
Despair and hopelessness reign now. Give us some hope, Joe.

2. Fellow Anti-Trumpers, quit trying to fight our amoral, pellet brained President with words. He always gets in that last word. If journalist have to ask him questions remind him he is a Grandfather with grandaughters (should they date someone like Gramps?), dog him about the church he goes to on Sundays etc.

3. Shout out to Senator Collins, you were so right about Trump changing for the better after the impeachment trial.  Good luck with applying for unemployment, Susie, especially if you move to Florida."
2020-04-28 13:03,"Much as I think Trump is wholly unsuited as a leader his weird musings on the efficacy of light and disinfectant on COVID-19 have been pretty universally misreported. He did not suggest that anyone inject or swallow disinfect, nor did he suggest that anyone bathe in strong light. What he did was suggest to his advisors that they might investigate such approaches, and suggested that in fact that they were already doing so (they were not). Idiotic as these suggestions were, they were obviously the product of his dismal understanding of science and inattention to the information he had been given. His great 'you know what (sic) had put two and two together and got a tremendous number - if light and disinfectant can kill the virus on a surface then why not on the internal surface of the lungs? Absolutely not an idea that should be spouted to a national audience as no doubt some people of even more limited intellect will try it, but he didn't actually recommend anyone should do it."
2020-04-28 13:06,"Aside from the lies, exaggerations, endlessly repeated assumptions (without Trump, we would have gone to war with North Korea? Sure, Jan)  one thing I repeatedly marvel at is their consistent lack of a coherent message strategy.  

Clearly any organization is a reflection of its leader, and this organization is like a highly caffeinated toddler bouncing from one thing to another with no sense of unified purpose.  It's maddening & these briefings have made me much less confident in the future of this country."

2020-04-28 13:04,Trump does not read his daily briefings. He does not attend the daily work of the Covid-19 committee (under Pense).  He does not prepare for his daily 1 - 2 hours presence in front of the television camera - he receives his briefing notes only 30 minutes beforehand.  He very rarely prepares for anything.  He is fundamentally lazy
2020-04-28 12:58,"This so called man is running the country, in a manner of speaking, from his amygdala.  Every decision is made in response to this ancient part of his brain perceiving some minor threat to his power.
Many others have suggested this so I'm just echoing them:  you think ""he can't resist the lure of the cameras""?  Stop sending the cameras, and the reporters.  Just stop going.  Pretty soon no one but Fox will be there and they deserve each other.  The media, including you, NYT,  is torturing us by covering this No News briefings and it's just too hard to look away no matter how much we want to.  Please make it stop.  Go out and cover someone making a difference and inspire us instead of depressing us with the daily reminder of the incompetence of the POTUS.  At this point, it seems like news organizations are taking the easy way out by continuing to cover these events.  Challenge yourselves to go out and report on something meaningful."
2020-04-28 12:47,"This pandemic would be difficult enough to live through safely even if we had an Angela Merkel or Jacinda Arden.  But it is absolutely monstrous that we have to get up day after day and find that this unfit man is still heading the government.  We will never get out of this mess because there is no national strategy, there is no honest, smart leadership.  The governors can only do so much.  It's actually becoming frightening that we will be isolating/distancing until a vaccine is ready.  And then when it is ready, who is going to get it?  8 billion vaccines?  That will take a while to make and distribute.  The rich will get them first (except for the anti-vaxxers on both ends of the spectrum) then people with  doctors, then poor people.  It might take a long time to get to the poor people.

I wish a journalist would just pull together and print his February schedule.  All rallies and fundraisers and golfing.  That is a dereliction of duty.  When one sees it in front of your eyes, that schedule, the top of your head might blow off with anger.  He is directly responsible for many, many deaths in America.  Unfit.

Trump is unfit and his Republican enablers who voted to acquit are complicit in all of those deaths.  I'm looking at you Susan Collins.  I'm sure you're 'concerned'."

2020-04-28 12:56,"New York Times, will you please lessen your coverage of Trump?  Not everything he says is worth repeating or amplifying.  I’d love to hear more about Joe Biden and his doings, about how different states are experiencing and conducting themselves in the pandemic, how other nations are dealing with such radically changed economic, social, cultural, and governmental landscapes.  We know Trump is self-absorbed, ill-informed, outrageous, and destructive of democracy.  Please, please, please dial down the volume on your coverage of him, and let us hear and read more about people/places who are earnestly working to counteract the worst effects of the global scourge."

2020-04-28 12:44,"God help us. But in the meantime, I am thankful to the media for continuing to ask the tough questions and for covering the Presidents irrational and harmful behavior in the critical manner of Mr. Baker's reporting in this article. Please vote in November, Americans."
2020-04-28 13:03,"“I never even thought of changing the date of the election,” Mr. Trump said.""

When I heard him say this in his soft, I'm so innocent Joe Pesci voice, it tells me that yes, he has absolutely thought of changing the date - or worse, calling it off altogether.

For someone who lies as easily as he breathes, he's not very good at hiding it."
2020-04-28 12:37,"The daily “re-election infotainment/infomercial” serve only as a means of free campaign advertising for the Donald, and nothing more. There is no news/information/advice that is emitted from the oral cavity of DJT, only; aerosols (primarily festive propaganda, with a slightly bouquet of disinfectant); pH adjusted (“base building”) Democratic-bashing, vitriolic vapors; and a smattering of klown flatulence added as a rounding top note. In short, the ultimate perfume that will soon have an advertising campaign tag line (not unlike “obsession by CK”), but depression by DJT."
2020-04-28 13:09,Blow up the Times' own photo at the top of this article and you will see that Trump's pupils are as large as saucers. I'm hoping someone at the Times can investigate what is going on medically with Trump at these briefings. He's either on drugs or quite ill.

He didnt listen to the intelligence briefings in January warning him that this Pandemic was coming to the United States , he didn’t lift a finger to read the Pandemic Playbook left to him by President Obama , he fired the Pandemic Task Force , he called it a hoax while doing rallies for his re-election, he said it would “ miraculously “ go away , and on and on . 
       He blames it on the impeachment, that he was distracted. Not an excuse . In fact , keeping Americans safe is his first job and ironically if he did was he was supposed to do as president this would have taken his narcissistic mind off the impeachment. 
      This is a man who not only is completely useless to this country, he is hurting the very country he is supposed to protect . 
 
       I am disgusted beyond words."
2020-04-28 13:20,"Trump will attempt capitalize on this pandemic, the pain and suffering of many. He can't help it, he was born this way, just like the Scorpion and the Frog.

2020-04-28 13:23,"Trump is delusional. The more he speaks in front of live TV cameras and reporters, the more obvious it becomes. So I encourage Trump to keep doing them!"
2020-04-28 13:12,"So, Trump can't resist. He gets up there on Monday — blah, blah, blah, drone, drone, drone from his prepared remarks. 

Then he parades the businesspeople — who one-by-one demonstrated what a REAL businessperson sounds like, with words spoken from their minds and hearts, clearly a manifestation of their knowledge, thoughtfulness, and preparedness. I actually felt reassured after hearing them. Maybe we can get this testing ramped up after all! 

Then Trump gets up again — blame, blame, blame, boast, boast, boast. And I'm back to feeling hopeless. Any progress we've had to date has been no thanks to Trump. And any progress we have going forward will be no thanks to Trump. He is just in the way."
2020-04-28 13:21,"The more real people see real unfiltered Trump and observe his viciousness, and unclear thinking and self-absorption one has to think it will be in the long-term best interests of the country.  It won’t matter to the rally goers but maybe it will to the decent “real man wannabes” and the suburban types that just delighted with anti-pc and the stock market.   Let them see the man behind the phone."
2020-04-28 13:17,Not my president of the United States; he has made that clear to me and to his supporters.
2020-04-28 13:23,"Let’s face it. Trump is first and foremost an entertainer and if there is a camera and an audience, he can’t not perform. He’s the least entertaining when he does what his staff wants and just reads the script he’s been given. You can see immediately that he’s not happy - he doesn’t pre-read the script so he stumbles over words and phrases that are unfamiliar. He reads in a mechanical monotone that conveys his attitude “I’m not happy”. When he goes off-script, Trump the Entertainer emerges. He physically brightens. He becomes animated and the pitch of his voice changes. He’s in his element."
2020-04-28 13:09,"Trump can’t stay away and neither can the press. 

I have yet to hear a reasonable excuse for covering these “press conferences” live. Did the press cover live everything Obama, W, Clinton, HW or Reagan said? 

Why does the press have a compulsive need to broadcast live every word that comes out of trump’s mouth? 

I am losing respect for many news organizations like CNN and MSNBC. It seems they would rather tussle with trump in the Rose Garden than cover stories of how real Americans are dealing with this crisis? 

Apparently most seniors have not received a stimulus  and they are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Can we dig deeper into issues like these and what our government is or is not doing? Many seniors are the financial bedrock of their families. 

Those who need a fix can catch him on Twitter. There is also this channel called “C-SPAN.” You may have heard of it. 

We need the broadcast and print press to be the grown-ups in the room, having the adult conversations about what American adults are discussing, like how to pay the mortgage or rent or how to feed children who can’t get school food or how to hold our government accountable. 

I’m tired of the jokes and memes about trump. The WH press corps should do the responsible thing and self-isolate like the rest of us. Otherwise they are just putting essential workers at risk. I’m sure the WH custodians would appreciate less foot traffic by people too vain to wear masks on camera."
2020-04-28 13:09,"These are not press briefings . They are propaganda disseminations from a cornered and angry leader who  is seeing all his campaign rhetoric turned upside down. Nothing Trump says can be believed . We may as well be hearing a speech by Chinese leaders or Putin.
 If  they were press briefings, Pence or a competent press secretary would be doing them.I was more impressed by the briefings of Brian Kemp here in Georgia yesterday which seemed to follow the pattern and matter of fact approach of Governor Cuomo.   However  Kemp and Trump believe the media should not criticize their decisions."

You know what's truly scary? 50% of your fellow Americans feel the same way. Which means, no matter how frustrated and angry you get, you're going to endure 4 more years of this stuff. 

I can't, for the life of me, understand how anyone could waste 1 nano-minute watching Cadet Bone-spur or listen to his voice. The fact is, everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie, including ""the"" and ""and."""

2020-04-28 13:36,"Media outlets have been providing Trump with free campaign coverage for weeks now, under the guise of ""coronavirus briefings"".

But this high-value, free campaign coverage has got to stop.  If these donations haven't been filed with the FEC, which they probably hasn't, they're illegal.

The media should be present, however, and bleep out any words not related to the coronavirus, which is the stated function of these briefings.  

While spewing some nonsensical or incorrect information about the coronavirus, Trump mostly uses his free T.V. time to attack his usual enemies -- journalism, China, immigrants, Americans greedy for free healthcare and a working wage, greedy governors who want too much PPE, and exhorting his base, and governors, to open the economy before it is safe.  His words inflame, misinform and are destructive.

If media just covers Trump's coronavirus utterances, be they wise or ridiculous, they're within FEC guidelines, and preserve fair campaign coverage."
2020-04-28 13:25,"The only thing missing to complete the absurdity many pretend not to notice daily, is bugle players in pompous attire marking the grand entrance of Mr. Bouffant and his court jester, Pence tossing rose petals and compliments. More than a show, a global spectacle!"
2020-04-28 13:42,"I wholeheartedly agree the reporters and news outlets that are being verbally abused should just not go for a few weeks. If you can’t stay away yourselves then what I think we need is a formal rebuttal from someone like Mr Biden, or Ms Pelosi after every one of these briefings. Someone to tell us things will get better and this is “one” thing that is working and here is a great plan and we can do this together etc.  Please is there no one out there that can step into the spotlight to counter theses depressing briefings?  All they need to do is sound sincere. 

Never does the president sound sincere about how sad it is people lost loved ones to his silent enemy. He generally only mentions it from his prepared speech which he obviously didn’t write nor read before he walks out there. Even if he’d use a teleprompter it would look more sincere than trying to read the speech notes like it was the first time he saw them. 

We need sincere hope. We don’t need self congratulations."
2020-04-28 13:45,"Thank You Peter Baker & Maggie Habberman: Pres. Trump suggests at a W.H News Conference that the ingestion/injection of Disinfectants and use of UV Light could treat COVID; later tells Reporters - I Can't imagine why anyone would try that. Um, Mr. President, they tried it because You said it could be Helpful.
So, we are left with Trump  pretty much admitting that he 'Can't imagine' anyone listening to what he says. God help us. November can't come soon enough."
2020-04-28 14:03,"What if he called a press conference and nobody came.  Since these briefings provide little news and plenty that is false (and dangerous) why don't all reporters go about their business elsewhere?

2020-04-28 14:08,"Forgive Mr. Trump- with his eye bags puffy with fear, hair often disheveled, revealing his baldness - he is a one trick pony, doing the only thing he has genius for: self-promotion.
Somewhere, underneath the bluster & braggadocio, he knows he is lost. It must be terrifying to suddenly have enormous responsibility and no knowledge but an instinct for self-aggrandizement rooted in his struggle to fight off the indelible old feeling of his father's contempt. Donald was the black sheep then and - like Raskolnikov- keeps returning to the  humiliating battle."
2020-04-28 14:10,"Can we please see more reporting on the thoughts and sentiments of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders rather than continuing this coverage of Trump.

2020-04-28 14:16,"Until the Trump absurdist phenomenon, I thought that in general Americans are mostly pragmatic, commonsensical people who wouldn't be able to take seriously for long this narcissistic, and actually delusional at times, individual as their president. But it turned out I was wrong. They may take seriously Trump's habitual lie that he had built “the greatest economy in the history of the world”, and he may yet to be re-elected!!!"
2020-04-28 14:18,The news media must find a way to avoid the 2016 mistakes of giving Trump unknown $$$M of free campaign ads.  He is obviously addicted to any coverage even coverage which clearly shows his ignorance. I don’t have the answer but he will play the media like a fiddle again. He has proven  many times that the media is also addicted to him.
2020-04-28 14:20,"Impulsive. Trump is impulsive, and that’s not a quality anyone should want in a president. I want someone who listens to experts, takes their time, and makes deliberate decisions while still being able to think on their feet. Trump is not that person. What an absolute disaster."
2020-04-28 14:22,"“There has never been, in the history of our Country, a more vicious or hostile Lamestream Media than there is right now, even in the midst of a National Emergency, the Invisible Enemy!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday morning. “FAKE NEWS, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!” he added.

Most of the fake news I’ve heard has come from this fool’s mouth. I never thought I‘d live to see a POTUS who is an enemy of the United States."
2020-04-28 14:06,"Mr. Baker lapses as he tells us what the aim of the media has in large part been for most of the briefings, including the Monday brief: to anger and provoke.

Baker writes, ""[President Trump] largely avoided the sort of anger he had displayed in recent days, even for questions that would typically provoke a sharp response. Asked if a president should be re-elected after so many Americans died in a matter of weeks, he argued that he had prevented it from being worse.""

Why would any reputable reporter working in the White House be so disrespectful to both the officeholder and the office itself?

And the press continues its effort to try to drive the President off the air when a large number of Americans look to him and his team for unfiltered news each day.

I remain hopeful that the President continues these briefings, with one policy change: Reporters who disrespect the President or any other speaker should no longer be called on. A referee can be hired to keep a list."
2020-04-28 14:28,"So Trump put on a banana hat and ran around flapping his arms and singing the alphabet song. Why anyone bothers to watch these ""press conferences"" is beyond me."

2020-04-28 14:47,"I’ve never voted for Trump and never will, but the bias in the Times can be almost unbearable.  To wit, “He made no effort to reconcile that with his own administration’s guidelines...”. There’s nothing to reconcile.  States can make two types of errors - reopening too quickly or reopening too slowly.  Trump is talking about the latter when mentioning the possibility of lawsuits to protect the rights of citizens.  This is in no way inconsistent with his criticism of GA for opening too quickly."
2020-04-28 14:48,"The subject of the news briefings were the most important issue impacting the lives of United States citizens since Trump's administration commenced and arguably since the great depression.  Thus, they were most certainly ""worth the time and effort."" 
His response shows the true Trump:  incredibly incompetent, dishonest and worse, a coward.  When it got tough for him, he wanted to quit doing what is most fundamentally his job as President - to speak to the American people and re-assure them that everything that can be done is being done.  Its all we ask for.  And if he doesn't believe it worth his time or effort to do just that right now, then he should resign from office right now."
2020-04-28 15:18,"The fact that he changed his mind. much to our disappointment, does not mean that the networks need to broadcast them live. What does it take for the networks to decide they can still have journalists there to cover them later, but they are no longer going to cause possible harm by airing them as they happen? Name one major announcement at these events that needed to be broadcast live."

Calls those who print what he actually, truthfully  says, verbatim ""enemy of the people"" when they're only repeating his words.

2020-04-28 14:57,"Why do you refer to Joe Biden using the President's nickname for him?  
Like it or not, your use of the moniker influences how people experience Joe Biden.
The use of derogatory nicknames, as this President likes to do, is intended to influence people's beliefs.  When repeated over and over research has unequivocally demonstrated that this has the intended effect.
If I tell you that Ghandi died at 114 (which is false) and then later ask you to estimate the age at which he did die, your estimate will be a  greater age than if you had not been exposed to the lie.  Even if you know it's a lie.
Don't do the President's own bidding.  Your readership misses nothing if you leave out the nickname.  It's not news, it's propaganda.  Knock it off."

  However now I look forward to it. With Trump saying the most idiotic stuff and repeating the same non-sense over and over everyone except the Trump supporters will see this men is in over his head. That he was never fit to lead this country.
  One thing I find disturbing is when Trump lashes out at journalists with name-calling and personal insults. That is when the journalist has nobody to blame but themselves. They should stand up and insult him right back calling him a ""fake"" president and tell him off.. I don't care if he's the President or not the journalist needs to stand his/her ground and give it to him right back. They get thrown out of the briefing for defending themselves, fine.  If the network doesn't want to stand by their employee for being treated like that shame on them. I know I am one that couldn't sit there and be verbally assaulted."
2020-04-28 15:42,"Biden needs to hold frequent press briefings where he can give the American people a taste of what fact-based, empathetic, rational leadership looks like. While some leaders, like Cuomo, are doing that, we need to see Biden. Since the primaries ended, Biden has disappeared. Hillary thought the American people couldn't possibly elect Trump, but 43.3% (according to fivethirtyeight.com) of Americans still support the lying, bleach drinking, hurricane-nuking, Sharpie-wielding man in the White House. Biden needs to more actively campaign on why a Biden Administration will improve the lives of the American people because it is the Electoral College that will decide not the popular vote."
2020-04-28 15:09,"The briefings should be carried live by his own network, Fox News, only. They are given solely for the benefit of his base. Does anyone else actually watch them? The rest of the media can report highlights, or whatever little substantive information is covered. They are his ersatz rallies.

2020-04-28 15:27,"What I hear when he says it's just not worth it:

Trying to be helpful to the American people - even in his ham handed way - was too challenging and people are just not worth the bother of me being criticized.  They should be thankful of me and pay me respect.

What I do know from my short time on this planet is that respect is earned and takes much effort to develop over a lifetime."
2020-04-28 15:36,"Hard to argue with Trump on this one - his briefings have been a waste of time. That they have been covered by the media is, at best, disappointing, and at worst, confirmation that clickbait trumps value every time, and that the notion that the news is separate from ratings and entertainment is a quaint reminder of some earlier time."
2020-04-28 10:57,"Trump was on TV?  Missed it.  I think I was filing my nails or sorting the silverware, things a bit more important than watching a failing TV show jumping the shark.

I would appreciate it if the networks treated Trump's daily showcase as a contest.  Every time he fabulates, a red X would show up on the screen.  After three of those the networks have to switch back to Seinfeld reruns.

Win win."

The problem is we need someone who can lead, who can understand the magnitude of the issues that are present and coalesce resources for the benefit of us all. Instead he banters about spurious solutions,  pontificates about how great he thinks he is and tries to shuffle responsibility onto others.  So, we needed a ""Knight in Shining Armor"" and got a Great Orange Flounder."

They could easily be misled, especially when the person doing the misleading is their own president. By warning them on the disastrous consequences of what you tell them to do, the media is living up to its responsibility. 

Certain things you have said are an insult even to elementary school science and commonsense. Elementary school in this country are raised to respect the institution called the presidency. They tend to believe what their president says. For the first time in the history of the country, parents have the embarrassing task of reminding their children now and then that what their president just said is rubbish.

Each taxpayer owes North of $200,000 in Federal Debt alone to those who hold US bonds.
Being  over 200k in the hole is not considered economic success in most circles. That would be a hoax or a delusion. 
Great economies don't carry that magnitude of debt which doesn't count the 2 trillion just spent or the near 10 trillion owed to the US trust funds.  
That 17 trillion in debt is due to tax cuts hoarded by the gilded class in America which should have been used to pay our bills over that last 20 years.

The man is unfit for office: the evidence is overwhelming, looking straight at Dr. Birx (as she sat stone still and sighing) about ""getting light into the body"" and ingesting or ""injecting disinfectants"" to clean the lungs internally. It's a stunning clip to watch; the president of the United States making such a dangerously absurd and grotesquely ignorant suggestion about covid19 in a public news briefing. Trump's dysfunction and contempt for science and expert advice is hindering the government's response to this pandemic. Trump and his administration were warned about the threat of this viral pandemic repeatedly. But Trump didn't have the discipline to read his daily briefing books! And this isn't the first time Trump's failure to read his briefing books has been reported. The man is unfit to serve in the office of the presidency.

2020-04-28 22:15,"The daily briefings are patently absurd. I’m certainly not watching. However, on the plus side, it’s good for the country to see Trump make an absolute fool of himself every day. Perhaps it will dissuade some of the base that are beginning to realize that Trump is a disaster."

All of these things rely on a supply chain of people and equipment.  It is not easy to make all these things and be told that you need to get it done on a schedule that may not be possible.  Particularly frustrating for people whose boss cannot do what they do.  Ordering it done does not get it done.  Pronouncing it unacceptable doesn't really accomplish anything.

No big corp will be audited for loans under 2 million.  Every actual small local business is limited to about $20,000.00 in funding?

It's a terrible situation. Politicizing the situation may be problematic, as some will accuse, but I have one question: who did you vote for in 2016? There was a choice between an experienced government administrator and a television reality show celebrity. Who did you vote for? What did you expect? You voted for ""small government"" you say. You voted to ""turn things upside down"". You voted to ""drain the swamp"". Or you didn't vote at all; ""it doesn't matter"" you say, ""my vote doesn't count anyway"" or ""I didn't like either candidate"". Well, it matters who you vote for. It matters that you vote.

They engineered the first round of business bailouts so that their own elite-status customers would benefit even if they didn’t need the money.  Meanwhile, the local hair stylist, restaurant and garage mechanic were left empty-handed.  

Yes, the Trump Administration is incompetent and corrupt in every way, shape and form, and it shows up in the SBA’s handling of this small-business money.  But if the banks had been civic-minded in the first place, there would not be well-funded large businesses sheepishly handing back their grants from the first round.  When the LA Lakers get millions and the local pizzeria gets nothing, you know that banks are part of the problem."

That equals $17,500 for processing a $350,000 loan and $100,000 on a $10 million loan. Earn $100k on a $10M loan or $2.5k on a $50k loan. Both loans take the same amount of work. Which loan would you push through?"
2020-04-28 16:30,"The feedback we have been getting is that there appeared to have been a rough approval rate of about 50% following the first go round of applications for the SBA PPP loans. That’s probably on the high side.

I would like to see a list of the banks’ top 100 customers (with less than 500 employees) and the corresponding SBA loans awarded. If we’re all on the same playing field, at least 50 of those should have received zero, right?

That’s “right” as in “yeah, right”.

I wonder how many of their favored customers even had to even go through the online application process that has proved so frustration for so many of us.

But, putting cynicism aside, this is a huge undertaking for both the banks and the SBA. Banks that typically have had 6 persons working on SBA loans have had to increase their staffing levels to 1,000 – overnight. This is not a process I would like to manage."

The only potential upside, as others have noted: perhaps teachers will get more respect -- and pay -- for the immense responsibility and abilities they deserve as educators."
2020-04-27 22:56,"The pressure that is being put on parents is quite unreasonable, and shows an alarming lack of understanding at the administrative level of what kids need most during a time of duress, upheaval, and in many cases, trauma.  And in so many instances, teachers are feeling just as pressured as parents. The notion that kids are NOT going to lose skills and regress when everything is in crisis and the world is falling apart) is absurd. We are all regressing, and we will all rediscover our strengths and perhaps some new ones when we can begin to get back in to the world, such as it will be.  And what will help kids and parents be most resilient going forward is finding ways to preserve their relationships, with each other, and with the teachers who miss them and care about them. That we can hear each other and take care of each other are the skills that we need most."
2020-04-27 22:58,"I applaud the parents in this article who made the attempt to create a sense of order out of chaos for their children by setting up dedicated workspaces and creating color-coded schedules. As a middle school teacher, I can tell you it’s no picnic at our end, either.  Many teachers are in the same boat as the parents in this article - they’re trying to work while taking care of their own children.  I have the “luxury” of having adult children, allowing  me to do what I need to do for my students without interruption.  What’s frustrating for me is that no matter how many schedules (also color-coded) and reminders I post, the same students fail to complete the work. I teach in an affluent school district with a 1:1 student to device ratio.  I see some of my 8th grade students routinely  submitting  work at 4:00AM!  Even with my careful planning and virtual teaching, I truly doubt a lot of real learning is going on."
2020-04-27 22:59,"I hope parents now will understand the importance and service of teachers, and support their demand for justified raise. These teachers are heroes for taking care of your children all year long. They deserve raise, good night sleep, more resources, less financial stress, etc. And please someone tell centrist Democrat hero, the apple of the boomer's eye ""Andrew Cuomo"" that as well. The boomer generation is letting us down in many ways and while keeping too many privileges. I would say ""they are the investor class""."

2020-04-27 23:02,"Terrific article, and equal parts soothing and concerning.

Our 6th grade twins (boy/girl) are doing the best they can— as are me and my wife.
We oscillate between being helicopter parents and letting them find their own way, but strategy apparently only works in 12 hour increments and must be retooled often...
Both kids are in NYC public schools.
My daughter’s school is far more entrenched in technology, while my son’s is far less interactive. That has been a big problem as his work just happens in isolation despite our urging him to reach out to friends.
Some teachers are better than others as far as devising lesson plans. The tears and the arguments are not always daily, but they happen a lot.   
Some days are better than others.
What has been helpful is trying to get meals to happen together.  Dinner, yes.  Lunch sometimes, breakfast— sort of a rolling concept.
Movie nights are something to look forward to, and exposing them to “Taxi” and “Cheers” on a nightly basis."
2020-04-27 23:02,"Maybe online learning is not the right way to go for parents who haven't committed to homeschooling.  Can the children (not infants or toddlers) do things around the home?  Meal planning, shopping with a parent, meal prep, dishwashing, house cleaning, pet maintenance, bathing and feeding the youngest children, etc.  Children can do these things or at least participate based on their age."
2020-04-27 23:03,"It is absolute insanity right now in our household. And we are food secure, housed, have devices and internet, our income seems secure, and both parents have master’s degrees. 

But three kids trying to stream pointless Zoom calls while my husband does real work? 20 new apps between three kids? Constantly shifting messages about grades, attendance, technologies, and  teacher preferences just make everything worse. 

My gifted 7th grader transitioned pretty easily. Maybe 1-2 hours of Zoom calls and tons of work to keep him busy. The class is filled with high achievers but they all have terrible time management. So he stressed. My 5th grader got mandatory 15 hours of Zoom calls, plus another 15 hours of regular homework. Yeah, she’s pleasant. And the first grader? No. It required five hours of my time the first day. He is reading Harry Potter and riding his bike now.  That is it."
2020-04-27 23:06,"My 4 year old has been doing three half hour online Zoom sessions for her pre-k class.  It goes about as well as you would expect of a 4 year old.  Sometimes she participates and sometimes she is hiding in the closet with her dolls or chasing the dog around the house.  In between, my husband and i take turns sneaking out of online work and take her for bike rides, games of candy land and meal prep.  Ive had to accept that between 9am and 12pm i may not get much accomplished.

I cannot imagine how the mom of 7 is surviving."
2020-04-27 23:08,"It’s super challenging. My Husband is in the front lines and I have a 10 year old son who has special needs and a active 4 year old who constantly demands my attention. Both require one on one teaching. Homeschooling has been challenging for the kids and stress levels are at a all time high. My goal is baby steps, make them do activities where they learn and allow them to problem solve and not just stick to curriculum. Major concern remains that my special needs kid does not regress. Sometimes you just have to resort to electronics for them so that you can breathe!"
2020-04-27 23:08,"You touch on it in the article, but it needs to be said explicitly: the current method of schooling is amplifying inequities. 

Parents who already feel threatened by schools, or already have any type of involvement with Child Protective Services or the like, will not be comfortable sending a nice letter to their child's teacher sweetly opting out of distance learning. Families who have kids with IEPs who opt out of services provided ineffectively by teletherapy will get unpleasant, vaguely accusatory letters from their districts' lawyers so the districts can cover themselves for not fulfilling the requirements of the child's IEP.

Distance learning is ridiculously stressful for parents. It needs to stop. Everyone will be ""behind,"" no matter what, but the current system is forcing the most vulnerable students even farther behind. Schools should shift the emphasis from curriculum to connection, and make everything optional. 

I am an educator and a parent, and I speak as both in this comment."
2020-04-27 23:10,"My son is 9 and in the third grade. We made a bit of an effort at first to get him to do worksheets but it became too much of a miserable battle every day and it wasn't worth it. We're focusing on learning in other ways: Nature & science from walks in the woods, math, fractions & chemistry from baking things together, and I'm encouraging him to read and giving him small rewards for doing so. Last night he finished Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone and he was so proud of himself. This much more positive than trying to get him to sit in a chair and do math for hours at a time. One of my friends is a teacher and she said no matter what parents do at home, they're all going to be playing catch-up next year, so if you aren't running a coronavirus homeschool don't beat yourself up about it."
2020-04-27 23:11,"This answers a lot of questions for me. I have taught in an elementary classroom. I have supplemented the half day schooling of our kids in the German public schools (no supervised homework there, that was on me). I have sent teens to an American high school where they went all day, did their homework and I was off the hook. What I'm seeing in this article is the collective frustration of a lot of ""professionals"" who have been able to afford day care, all day school with homework supervision, and after school lessons, activities and sports. Their children have been supervised by others most of their lives. Not to say they don't have a good relationship with their parents, but the responsibilitiy for care and high level of involvement has often been handled by others outside the household.
Welcome to the wonderful world of actually taking care of your kids - now try to show better appreciation for those who would otherwise be engaging your ""little dears"" and preventing the current conflict situations."
2020-04-27 23:11,"I was so happy to read this. It’s great knowing that other parents and kids are going through the same thing, that really helps. 

Today is the beginning of the 7th ‘school week’ at home for my daughters, ages 8 & 10.

I’m not forcing it too much on days when there’s a lot of resistance because—
1- I wonder what they are really even getting out of it? I mean we’re doing our best but it’s not at all like real school.
2- I’d rather not have a (even more) stressful atmosphere around the house during this weird time.

I hope they can go back soon, I have no doubt this is negatively affecting their education."
2020-04-27 23:14,"This article does not sufficiently acknowledge what it is like to do a full-time OTHER job while simultaneously teaching two children under 10.

And no, my kids’ teachers never had to to that. I do what the teachers assign in 2-3 hrs then give my kids a chocolate chip for every 15 minutes they let me work alone. 

Anyone have a large supply of chocolate chips? My annual review is tomorrow morning at 10am."
2020-04-27 23:17,"For most people (parents and children alike) it a change of mental framework.  Home was a place to unwind, relax, not do work.  But now for many the division between (work/learning) and home is not something they honestly have the mental discipline, not because they don't have mental discipline at work or school, but because their mind still hasn't made the transition."

One day last week, I was online from 2AM to 6PM, preparing for and working in real-time with various classes.  I have so much respect for online teachers---always did, but honestly now I see how much more difficult it is.  In face-to-face classrooms, a teacher can improvise if something is not working. Happens all the time.  Online, everything is front-loaded, and it's really hard to adapt and change course.  

It's just plain hard to home-school, hard to online teach.  The thing about online instruction and teaching is that it is hit-or-miss, day by day, and variations of technology can just disrupt it all.  We still had some great meetings this semester, but then I lucked out into fantastic students this time."

2020-04-27 23:03,"Here's one reason the current setup often doesn't work. This anecdote took place in 1979, between my child, a NJ third grader, and me, a working NYC third grade teacher.

Mom (observing that my child had misinterpreted the teacher's assignment): ""Honey, that's not what the teacher means for you to do.""

Child: ""Yes, it is.""

Mom: ""No, honey, she means for you to..."" Mom elaborates.

Child: ""No, Mommy, that's not what she wants!""

Further escalation ensues.

Mom, totally exasperated: ""Honey, that's not what she wants! I know, because I'm a third grade teacher!""

Child, triumphantly: ""But you're not MY teacher!"""
2020-04-27 23:21,"""Education experts advise that making a schedule can help children treat the current setup more like school..."".

2020-04-27 23:26,"It's a raw deal for all concerned. 

Parenting is a calling. Home schooling is a calling. Teaching in the classroom is a calling. Teaching online is a calling. 

The students , whether just being launched into the educational environment or soaring high in college and fully immersed in all the quirks of technology, are experiencing enormous anxiety. Their fears are larger than life. Their fears become their life. My heart breaks for them.

Teachers and parents experience a shared anxiety, but it seems to be more ""task"" related, largely a result of their own feelings of inadequacy and over-extension. Their fear of failure is more immediate. The anxiety from isolation is soul crushing. My heart breaks for them too.

Do your best each day. Avoid comparing yourself to others. Keep the faith. This too shall pass.

Love to all...

I would note that many students are going to want to move on from their current grades, particularly seniors who want to graduate and move on to college (hopefully not virtual) or employment.  School districts are going to have to find a way to award diplomas to those seniors who have lost their proms and other significant events of their senior year and want to move on with their lives.  And parents who are finding the virtual learning stressful should let their children's teachers now; now is not the time to stress out.  Some parents may find it helpful to have some activities that give their children some structure to their day."

A greater challenge teachers have never faced. We get what parents are going through, we really do, since most of us have our own children plugged in somewhere else in the house. My advice to the parents is the advice I am giving to my 97 students - do not stress about school work, unplug when you need to, be kind to yourself, and remember lessons are to be done, not for grades, but to keep your mind occupied and out of your parent's way so they can do their own work!"

Teaching is a complex and challenging job that requires certain competencies, training and ability to manage.  Some parents can do it better than others, but the bottom line is that we need our trained teachers and our schools and we need to be much more supportive of them than previously.  

It’s a difficult job.  I know; I taught for 34 years in the public schools.  Teachers need, respect, support, decent pay/benefits and appreciation. Our country undervalues this profession and education in general.  Maybe things will change with new awareness of what the job entails."

The common core and constant standardized testing regimen will resume soon enough. Enjoy learning while you can for a change."
2020-04-27 23:42,"In 1968, when I was in 8th grade, the NYC teachers went on strike from the start of school until after Thanksgiving.  No mobile phones, no computers that weren't the size of a room, no Internet and no expectations that we'd learn anything.   Some churches, synagogues and civic groups had study groups, but they were invitation only and we didn't even knew that they existed.  Most women didn't work outside the home, so they watched their kids, which often meant they were playing outside for hours.  Jimmy Breslin wrote a great colum about a kid who went to the track daily teaching himself the physics of horse racing. 

Eventually my father went to Barnes & Nobles on 18th St. and bought used copies of all my textbooks but German, which he declared hopeless to learn.    I plowed through them, more out of total boredom than great ambition or desire to learn.

When we returned to school, a fellow student proudly said they finished the first three chapters of our social study textbook.  I'd read the whole thing.

Granted I was older and had only TV and radio as diversions, but I learned that I could teach myself anything.  That was a valuable,albeit unintended, lesson."

But seeing both sides of the class zoom screen tells me this isn't conducive to learning and is definitely not a long term solution for any of the parties involved. Everyone is over stressed. If structured distance learning isn't working for your family- its going to be ok if your kid takes a break until school opens again. Show them science documentaries. Let them paint to music. Plant some seeds and watch them grow. 9 weeks of missed school will come out in the wash."
2020-04-27 23:53,"Ok, this is tough because we are all upset, it is not an easy time. But these parents need to get a grip...and be parents. I grew up an only child who learned early on to entertain myself, do my homework, and not get in trouble; particularly important since both my parents worked. My parents could not usually help me with my homework.  A schedule, some household responsibilities and having the parents create actionable demands would really help. I think parents don't know how to parent and make demands of the kids. Homework is one of the first responsibilities they need to deal with."

None of this is ideal, and it's her teachers who are doing the hard work with creating the lessons. As long as she is a little bit engaged and learning something it's a win."

Students know how to access the curriculum, yet about half are choosing not to do so.
Many young people are using the emergency as an excuse to check out. They are emboldened by the messages contained in stories like this and frustrated home situations.
Now project forward when classes resume in September. Think about how the value of education will have been damaged by the learned helplessness that allows them to just play Fortnite."

It has strained our marriage, increased our alcohol budget, and caused enough tears to float the arc.  I do not lay fault with the teachers or school system— when was the last time any of us prepared to operate in a pandemic?  But we as a society need to learn that it’s ok to let go a little.  These are trying times.  I don’t want my kids to fall behind but I’d also like to end the daily fights over math homework and demands that I print home work when I’m dealing with a client emergency.

2020-04-28 0:03,"In our state, teachers have been maligned as ""making too much"", and disrespected in so many ways. This pandemic has shown us two very important things:  1.  Teachers definitely are not paid enough for what they do, and 2. Todays' parents don't know their kids the way they think they do.  Both of these are fixable.  First, pay teachers a decent living wage, one that allows them to enjoy life a bit, and second, remember what a struggle it was to home school your children, and do some studying yourselves!

Nobody knows if this will even be minimally successful. I hope schools/districts will be able to effectively judge which students can move ahead and which should repeat the grade they're in this year. It serves NO purpose to push kids into the next grade level if they haven't been fully grounded in the current one. It's not the end of the world to hold kids back a year, better than swamping them with stuff they're not ready for. As for posting on Twitter and FB, WHY? Don't you know you're letting yourself in for diatribes from both sides? Just do what's best for your kid and don't broadcast it in social media!! You know that's where people go to JUDGE!! Just get on with your lives as best YOU CAN, and stop looking for validation! It's a whole new world we're in. Use your common sense, especially with your own children."

As for trying to work from home as well as supervise the homework of one's children - I just can't imagine it.

Give my kid a puzzle and she'll figure it out. Yet I'm not allowed to teach her analog clocks in a way that works for her. Week 1, the hours, week 2, half hours, quarter hours in the next etc. Not enough reinforcement for my kid to remember the 1 page ""worksheet"" from the week before. Tears, every time. 

Yet let kiddo borrow dad's ""cheater watch"" with the increments on the outside bezel and she's loving it.  She's got enough info at her finger tips to crack the code, and with practice, it'll come naturally. Parsing out info without the bigger structure being obvious made it harder for her.  All these ""lessons"" and we are weeks in before the 1=5 minutes concept was even addressed.

It's emotionally cruel what we're having to do for her, simply to follow their rules and not let her lead.

I am in no way arguing that that is the best solution. I haven’t even given it serious thought but why not? As a parent, I’d be fine with it.

That takes care of the basics!

Home is a place where children and adults normally feel free to be themselves.  It’s not school.  The environment itself is not conducive to parent playing the role of teacher or your child viewing you as a slave-driver.

Some children love to learn and can learn on their own.  Ok, let them!  They’re being themselves.

Put a reading Ap on their computer or tablet.  And look for things they’d like to read.  Look for books that you can put on the Ap for free.

But most importantly, you are a parent.  Spend family time with your youngsters.  Older students may need to work at their studies.  But .... it’s not worth it to have meltdowns and crying jags, when you both love each other.  Concentrate on the LOVE!

I am very fortunate that my child's teacher does not have children of her own so has been incredible in devoting her energies to the class.

Not to mention, the vast amount of inequities that plague many families in urban areas.

I'm doing  live lessons on X,Y, and Z all day long!) The other source of extra work are administrators who are obsessed with pushing students and teachers to the limit by adding more and more work--even when teachers are relaying the complaints of families who cannot keep up with the overflowing workload. When my grade team and I brought up that families were struggling with a particular format of assignment, the principal added even more work for the kids (and us) to do.

This situation stresses the entire educational supply chain. There is no satisfactory solution. Perhaps limit school schedules to a few hours each day and spend the rest of the time in recess."
2020-04-28 1:09,"I do feel bad for parents who are doubling up work and supervising their child. Especially those parents who are essential workers, or are in a single parent household, or who lack internet access and technology. I do wish people would stop saying that they are teaching. Unless they are writing lesson plans, providing feedback, etc. you are parenting, not being a teacher"
2020-04-28 1:11,"I think that most education experts believe that factors which assure educational success are parents who read to their children and the presence of ""read"" reading material in the house.  There's not much of K-8 pedagogy you can't teach a kid in a few hours over the summer sans TV, live-streaming, netflix and the internet."
2020-04-28 1:11,Let’s not forget the trauma to parent and child when the child consistently asks for help and the parent consistently turn her down because hashes working. It’s upsetting for everyone and at least in my house I’m worried about the lasting affect it will have on us as a family.
2020-04-28 1:11,"I wanted to draw your attention to the plight of parents who have children with severe disabilities. School is part of essential therapy for us. Our kids are without a medical necessity right now, not just education. We parents are at risk of losing our jobs, not just our sanity... For us this crisis is many good worse."
2020-04-28 1:12,"A friend teaches in a public elementary school in Pacifica CA where more than a dozen languages are spoken and many low income parents do not have access to technology or the internet. The seismic shift to online classes will leave thousands of kids in the dust if school districts cannot fill the gap, unlikely in the coming era of widespread budget cuts. That is overwhelming."
2020-04-28 1:13,"My hope out of all of this--that parents, and voters, realize that teaching is a difficult profession that requires a lot of skills. Teachers are highly trained to understand the academic strengths and weaknesses of your child, as well as his/her basic psychological make-up, all the while understanding the same information of 30 to 65 other children. 

As a career changer who became a middle school math teacher, I can tell you from hard-earned experience that teaching, and teaching well, ranks up there as among the most difficult jobs I've ever held. The demands are constant, and delicate, and sometimes enormous. 

So when teachers ask for better working conditions, higher wages, and better school facilities, I hope taxpaying voters are far more willing to give it to them in the post-pandemic years. Even politicians--especially of the GOP variety--now understand the sheer emotional and brain labor that goes into teaching their children. Tens of millions of voters now have sustained, gritty, first-hand experience of the huge number of obstacles and difficulties that go into teaching. Some have even broken down crying, seeing how difficult this labor truly is.

That is one of my ultimate hopes for the post-pandemic period--that the teaching profession will be far more lauded and appreciated now that so many parents have personal teaching experience. It ain't easy."
2020-04-28 1:18,"My 8 year old twins are doing great with distance learning.  Our amazing public school teachers have done an amazing job prioritizing wellness.  Assignments always involve outdoor time—nature journaling and observation, exercise etc.  The teachers have explicitly encouraged us to tailor assignments to meet our family’s needs and forgo assignments that lead to strife.  While I am an essential employee and go to work daily, my husband works from home and has managed to keep everyone on track and progressing.   That said, my girls miss school so much and can’t wait be back."
2020-04-28 1:20,"This is not a one-size-fits-all situation. How could it ever be? No two households have the same combination of parents, children, work situation, access to technology, and so on.

I wish everyone could take a deep breath, operate with good intentions, and do the best you can under your particular circumstances. It is truly all you can do.

Everyone is going to be behind when school reopens. The teachers will adjust accordingly.

Speaking of teachers, I hope this will inspire us all to treat them with a bit more respect when this over."
2020-04-28 1:21,"One of my best friends is Norwegian and lives in Oslo. He told me how surprised he was that 2 days after schools closed in Norway, his kids instruction had moved totally online. That is - teachers actually teaching the children over the internet. 

Sweden has kept elementary schools open but closed the gymnasiums (~equivalent to high schools). So far there is no evidence of significant deleterious health effects.

Here it is a totally different story. After some weeks my daughter’s high school teachers posted homework assignments, but this is totally self-directed learning. My elementary school age child has weekly social “meet ups” where the class talks and plays games. The teacher sends lots of “suggested work.”

I’m glad something is being done but the education of millions of American children is suffering greatly. What about all the children with special needs? 

My wife and I are working from home and having a hard time doing our own full time own jobs let alone being teachers for our children."
2020-04-28 1:22,"While peripheral to this article, which I am living since I am teaching online and parenting, I was surprised to see the comment on math.  I am a research mathematician and a mother of three. Why is it always assumed that kids have to wait for their dad to help with math? ""Seventh-graders need help with algebra, last used by dad circa 1992."""
2020-04-28 1:25,"I understand that kids need help with the tech side of this new reality.  But when did it become acceptable/standard for parents to have to help kids with homework?  I guess I’m dating myself to say that when I was a kid, we did our own homework.  Maybe you’d talk to a friend if necessary and that’s only when homework got harder in high school.  Kids today are even more connected so maybe let them actually learn something like how to solve a problem alone."
2020-04-28 1:26,"My wife is a special ed teacher, and during a ""normal"" time, between classes and building curricula and doing progress reports and quarterly reports and activities and being pressed into fund raising ...

But what is the immediate alternative? Don't they to teach kids, or send millions of people back into the swamp of the virus?"
2020-04-28 1:26,Maybe it's finally time to give teachers some credit for the hard work and incredible job they do with children. It would be nice to pay them a real wage for all they do.
2020-04-28 1:27,"I'm currently stranded in the US with my 9 year old daughter from our current home in China - a 12 hour time difference. She starts school at 8:30, ends at midnight, and wakes up whenever. We're fortunate enough that her core classes are in the morning and not the afternoon (China time) but she's unhappy about missing the ""social"" zoom session everyday at 3am EST.
Third grade is the worst age for this - she's too young to work independently, but too old to blow off her lessons. Or maybe we just skip learning long division and see how things turn out."
2020-04-28 1:28,"I have four elementary aged kids. While I'm fortunate I still have a job, it's been enormously stressful trying to work from home, keep up the house, feed the kids, and try to make them keep up on their school work. I'm not doing any of it well and it's exhausting. I debate every day taking an FMLA leave, but I'm worried that will mean the end of my job. Yes, I know my job is ""legally"" protected, but practically, it's not. If we weren't in the middle of a pandemic, I'd just quick, but then what if my husband loses his job too?"
2020-04-28 1:30,"How on earth do any of the parents commenting here have the energy and patience to write a coherent sentence :) I am so impressed and reassured. After finishing work, chores, cooking, zoom preschool, coloring, puzzles, reading, more work, unpacking groceries, and bedtime, more work, and cleanup, I am reading these comments while drifting from exhaustion into sleep. It’s wonderful to have a minute to read and think before passing out and doing it all again tomorrow. Zzzzzzzxxx"

2020-04-28 1:31,"I think it would be easier for parents to subscribe a comprehensive, self-contained, education software than trying to keep up with remote learning put together hastily in a week. 

I did this when my son was in 1st grade, and my attention was divided between my husband who was hospitalized at the time, and my other child who is severely disabled.  The education software was engaging and fun, and it was a good supplement to whatever he was learning at school.  

Good luck to all parents."
2020-04-28 1:31,"High school teacher and single mom here, sheltering in place with a high schooler and middle schooler. We have been relatively successful with the online school, although it certainly has its challenges. I cannot imagine what my colleagues who have young families are going through. Teaching remotely is like being a first year teacher all over again, which is physically and mentally draining. Pair that with parenting and homeschooling the littles... no thank you! I imagine any parent who is trying to work remotely through all of this faces challenges, but it is especially hard when you are expected to work at the EXACT same time you child is supposed to be at school. 

My hope is that when we return to school in the fall, whether it is remotely, in our classrooms, or a hybrid model, we can learn from these lessons and adjust accordingly. Because although I personally can get through this sprint to June, none of us are prepared for the marathon that lies ahead."
2020-04-28 1:32,"I began my teaching career over 30 years ago in an intermediate school (6th,7th,8th grade) when I lived in New York. Educators normally see students for 6 hours and 20 minutes a day.This sudden paradigm shift to remote learning reverses what was normally students coming to a teacher's class. Online learning now requires students to come to the material. In addition, time management is key to a student-centered approach. Today, I teach two online classes at a junior college (as well as high school) and I can attest to the fact that adults and high schoolers struggle with time management- so I can imagine grade schoolers. Power struggles are never fun and are more difficult when they are forced through circumstance. A coherent policy in terms of what is required of students needed to be in place. Circumstances didn't allow for that. However, I do see a hybrid approach to learning on the horizon- where there is an online component as well as a face-to-face conventional approach-and it will give districts time to prepare students and teachers alike in terms of helping parents cope."
2020-04-28 1:32,"I've got older kids (8th, 10th, 12th) grades.

This has been an interesting peek into the behind the scenes of what my children face every day : the teachers who really care about the kids and make plans, still do that. The teachers who mail it in, still do that too. 

The teachers who are sanctimonious gits (typically the ones who mail it in) -- well that shows through very clearly and the kids (and parents) respond accordingly.

For all the challenges out there, it is impressive at how much adaptation is going on. If this would have hit during my high school years -- we'd have had to try to mail all the stuff back and forth."
2020-04-28 1:33,"My son is 5. We do some school activities, we read, we zoom with the teachers, sometimes we go out to ride a bike. That's about 3 hrs a day at best. The rest of his time is TV and podcasts while jumping on the couch. It's awful to watch a smart, active 5yr old rot in front of the TV for weeks with many more to come because we have to work. And we are the lucky the ones."
2020-04-28 1:33,"The hardest part is the tech side when you have a 5-6 year old and they have to go to 7 different sites, everything with a different user name and password which you didn’t set up and these kids are expected to upload images and search websites for research! I am sure it will pay off in the long run but this is all new to them. Like starting them with algebra before they learn math."
2020-04-28 1:34,"Perhaps from this worldwide medical tragedy, teachers will have earned a long overdue respect. As a retired teacher, I would have preferred no loss of life, however."
2020-04-28 1:36,"Families with two working parents and two small children simply can’t handle all these spinning plates. We’re struggling here like most families, I’m sure. 

The goal may be to set up schedules and structure, but I don’t think remote learning is all that helpful or effective. I used to work in an education lab that developed video games that taught math and science. Learning apps might seem great but all of this elides a central fact about educating young kids: without in person analysis of the kids, you have no idea if they’ve learned something about the world, or just how to play the game. 

In my family we’re switching to a way more old school approach. The kids hang out with my wife and me as we work. We take breaks to read to them, and they have some games they can play and activities they can do on their own, but for the most part, it’s not about assignments for them. It’s about hanging out and watching their parents work. We’re all a lot happier this way. They’re learning to be independent, what work looks like, my wife and I are getting stuff done, and the kids aren’t quite so crazed."
2020-04-28 0:52,"Time to appreciate all that teachers do.  Time to make sure they are financially rewarded. If parents have trouble with 2 of their children, imagine if they had 30 they were responsible for."
2020-04-28 1:23,"I feel terrible for parents of younger children trying to do it all and also for the teachers, many of whom have their own children, spending interminable hours trying to keep students engaged via screen. This is no way to educate young children!

My own kids are college students, who are better equipped for the demands of remote learning, and they're having a heck of a time. How much worse it must be for elementary schoolers to be locked inside with a screen and expected to focus on academics.

It's really no one's fault, and eventually this all will end. In the meantime, I wish we could all just lighten up and take a well-deserved break from the relentless pressure to achieve. Focus on loving your children and tending to your mental health. The multiplication tables can wait."

2020-04-28 1:37,"My takeaway from many of these comments and those following similar articles, is that most teachers and parents are doing their best under difficult circumstances; there are also a number of teachers who seem to dislike teaching, children, and parents intensely, and want mostly to shove this dislike into the stress of the current situation. This is not the time (I'm not sure there ever is a time) to criticize other people for how they relate to their children, or to suggest that anyone unprepared to teach children trapped at home for an unspecified length of time shouldn't have had kids at all."
2020-04-28 1:20,"Just read, kids. And learn a foreign language from a book or online program. If you read 100 pages a day of a non-fiction book, and pick up a new language over the next several months, you'll be fine.  And you don't need to have mom or dad looking over your shoulder, either. Such independence will be liberating."

Get a grip and talk to your kids people, you are not in a hospital ward or ICU tonight wondering if you will see the sun rise on a new day. Those suffering people are not griping over first world Zoom problems like this whiny group."
2020-04-28 1:29,"I am a high school teacher. We were all given little time to ramp up. We are trying to make it work. With older students they have to be responsible  to sign in on schedule, Zoom or read if they are supposed to, produce a response, join discussion boards. (not  for 7 or 8 hours a day though) They are not going to be ready for their AP exams. I am in some despair and feel for the parents and students. Because we spend a lot of time calling, e-mailing and sending letters and the principal is going door knocking in a mask. The message: "" Please come to class on line tomorrow, we're here, here is my phone number, how are you and your family doing...About 1/3 are showing up.
 More and more American children lack basic knowledge and skills. People are too busy at work, when they are home there can be a lot of indulgence and too much screen time. This is a good time to share basic knowledge: cooking, measuring, using a calendar, sorting the clothes-it can lead to discussions: For older children: "" Where is Malaysia ? What do we know about the politics and geography ? Where is Vietnam ? What was that war about ? What was the draft ? Watch the news/discuss. . For younger children: Go for walks and practice tree and bird identification. Plant some seeds. Go to the National Geographic photo of the day. Have them write sentences about it. Go to the NASA website. Go out later and look for planets and constellations. It's a big beautiful world. Refuse the bad worksheets & say why."
2020-04-28 1:09,"These parents have long been insulting teachers as having an “easy job,” discounting the value of what teachers do, and making sure they voted against any bond issue or any possiblity of increasing pay for teachers.

I'm not a teacher. But unlike these cry babies, I do know how much value teachers provide, how difficult it is to teach their Little Lord Fauntleroy’s, and what it really takes to educate each new generation of kids who “have brains full of mush.”

Of course, after the Rona has run it's course, these parents will go back to doing their best to make sure teachers don't get paid what they are worth.

At least they've experienced what it's like to teach their little darlings for a few weeks."
2020-04-28 1:42,I’m a high school science teacher and I can completely understand the frustration of parents. I have less engagement from students each week. They need each other and I need them to help keep the curriculum exciting and meaningful. We are all just trying to stay safe and sane. I will continue providing curriculum but I just want to try to stay connected to the students and try to have them stay connected to each other. Connection over content is key during this challenging time.
2020-04-28 1:44,"As unpopular as my comment is going to be, it's time for tough love here: I guess there is no hope for anyone of us if everyone is just going to throw their hands in the air. Where is our collective resilience? You have a picture of a 5 year old and a 7 year old ""doing math"" on their iPads (insert eye roll). With the constant dopamine rush young children have been getting from the iPads and other mobile devices they've been given from the time they could talk, is it any wonder they can't focus. Truly, I think this has been a huge wake-up call for American parents. Everything was all fine and good when you could raise your kids any way you saw fit and send them off to school without any sort of regard for how what you were doing was impacting their ability to learn. This sounds, to me, like American parents are getting a taste of medicine that was of their own making."
2020-04-28 1:44,"I feel like the hardest part of this is the difference between how kids interact with a teacher, and how they interact with a parent.  I’ve read that when kids are comfortable with their parents, they can show the worst of themselves freely- in this situation, it’s a double edged sword.  Of course I want them to trust me, but my six year old’s relationships with his teachers are very different than with me.  When he gets frustrated, the anger is palpable.  I imagine if that happens at school, his reactions are quite different.  I am trying my best, but I also have a two year old, and while I was generally a stay at home mom prior to this, I now also have a husband who is working from home in a fairly small amount of space.  We do have a schedule, and try to separate weekdays from the weekend as much as possible.  We have good days, and then also really bad days, when we can barely check into his distance learning due to short tempers.  I have nothing but respect for school teachers.  I absolutely CAN NOT WAIT until we can return to some version of normal.  I’m not worried about my son being behind- I’m more worried about the lack of social interactions."
2020-04-28 1:46,"Objectively speaking, I would like to tell all the parents out there, going through this angst with remote learning. that you are not failing and stop being so hard on yourselves.  All you can do is give it your best effort and hope for the best.  I predict children will bounce right back from this and catch up just fine.  No parent struggling with work and other familial responsibilities should beat themselves up over this.  It's going to be fine. I just know it!"
2020-04-28 1:46,"This whole distance learning situation is a disaster for out family.  We don't need an ounce of additional stress in our home.  The school's expectations are the final straw.  Honestly, nothing is going to happen if the teachers need to back up a little in the curriculum next September to pick up where the pandemic left off.  However, there will be lasting harm to children's well being, mental health, and development if they experience this pandemic as anxiety provoking, stressful, and traumatic.  There is a big risk to children if parents are too emotionally strained and stressed from ""schooling"" to provide meaningful connection and support to traumatized children.  And make no mistake.  The situation is traumatic for children in households even where everyone remains healthy.  In households like ours, where both parents had Covid, one with pneumonia, one with encephalitis, plus multiple children ill, the trauma is overwhelming.   ""School"" doesn't even begin to make it on the list of priorities.  Physical health, mental health, and family well being.  That's it."

We did this for three weeks before his regular school started virtual learning & is not returning this school year. I feel like I need to continue our old routine but obviously less b/c he’s missing out on a lot. He made his new weekly schedule and it’s good- he’s self motivated but I know he misses the social aspect of school and I feel like his online zoom class meetings are for that, not real learning. He gets homework for the week but again it’s obviously less and online without interaction- he plays piano & composes too so that brings him joy- and our garden is finally sprouting. In the age of covid19 I’m game to try anything. I’m not even mentioning my job.... it’s just what I choose to do- it about social emotional learning so as parents we are over our heads with a lot but love, empathy, compassion & reassurances are critical to combating anxiety & fear. Here’s to turning 12 under a continued lockdown this week. Hang in there families. Hang in there."
2020-04-28 1:49,"Working at home, while children are present, is ""one of the most trying aspects of the pandemic""?? What about working in a slaughterhouse, or a nursing home, or a supermarket, while trying to figure out childcare for kids? Or what about people who've lost their jobs?

2020-04-28 1:50,Perhaps the silver lining of the quarantine is that the country will finally recognize teachers for the valuable work they do.  Now if we could just start paying them for what they are worth.
2020-04-28 1:52,"While I appreciate that the school district is trying to create learning assignments for my kindergartener, I simply do not have the time to sit with her to use Zoom, type in answers, etc. while my husband and I are trying to do our full time jobs. I have found that the more hands-on, creative subjects have been the ones my daughter has gravitated to most and require the least from us: art and computers. I always knew she loved art, but who knew she'd love coding for kids so much? Code.org pre-reader module is amazing! I'm perfectly happy if she forgoes her academics (this is kindergarten!) and makes art, codes, reads some books, works on puzzles, watches lots of tv, helps me cook/bake/clean, and gets some movement in. She's learning plenty from all of that."

2020-04-28 1:54,"I feel for parents who are struggling with homeschooling (though this isn’t really homeschooling—if teachers are providing lessons, content and assessment). I also think if parents are having trouble teaching 1 or 2 or 3 children along with working from home, maybe we can all be a little more grateful for and supportive of our schools and teachers once students head back, instead of complaining about them all the time. They care for often more than 30 of your children in one class—all day—along with all of the planning, paperwork, grading, inadequate resources, prep work, etc. They provide learning in academic subjects alongside of lessons in life. Teaching is hard work, isn’t it? There’s no coffee breaks or bathroom breaks or internet breaks."
2020-04-28 1:55,"Apps for school to help them learn is a failure.  I’m sorry, but kids cannot learn on an iPad under the age of 15 in my experience.

Give the kids some books to read, maybe print out some math word problems, and then send them outside with a bow and arrow and let them have fun.

As a child of the 80s, I remember being home sick or home because of snow closures. We had work to do, and we did it, but I have zero memory of my parents being around, let alone helping me.  Summer meant roaming around aimlessly.

Parents should expect less of their kids, and they will exceed the expectations ten-fold if you leave them alone."

That silly Bill Bennett.  He may need to retake his history lessons."
2020-04-28 1:56,Closing the schools was never necessary. It was based on misinformation and simple fear mongering. All they need to do was to keep the at risk teachers and administrators at home. All schools should immediately reopen.

2020-04-28 1:57,"No, no, no! Do you help your kids when they are in their real classroom? Of course not. I text my 3rd grade granddaughter every morning, remind her what her daily remote school schedule is. She is in school, not her parents or me. And I ask her to FaceTime me when school day is over so we can chat nonsense. The most important thing these kids are learning now is not academics. It’s learning to adapt, be resourceful, use Internet resources, and interact with friends in this new normal. I’m 82 years old, I used to pick her up every afternoon after school, help her with homework, etc. But we as close on Facetime. Just can’t hug."
2020-04-28 1:59,"What a lot of commenters don't understand is that we have full-time jobs. We would love to step up and home school full time but we also have to do our jobs simultaneously. It is worse in some professions than others, and if you're a woman with a male boss. So yes we do have deep respect and admiration for teachers, but cannot teach and provide everything else and work full-time effectively. When elementary school teachers send emails with assignments due later that same day, it is going to have a discriminatory impact."

1) work on weaker subjects daily-writing for the younger one,math for the older. Just an hour or so

2020-04-28 2:01,"I’m a 2nd grade teacher posting lessons on the Seesaw platform for my students.  Our district in Portland, OR has been wonderful about getting ChromeBooks to every family that requests one, so parents do not need to share their work, or sole home device, with their children for lessons.  Home learning is still a challenge for parents of my students, but I understand I’m also teaching them too, and I find listening, problem-solving and commiserating with parents goes a long way.  

I also work hard to inject a lot of fun into my lessons, often through time outside to free up parents.  Last week, I had my students make nature sculptures in their yards using the art of Andy Goldsworthy as inspiration for Earth Day.  On Friday, I posted the NYTimes article of 53 recipes for cooking with kids.  They chose a recipe, did all the measuring and took a picture of their finished product.  Rave reviews all around.  This doesn’t replace classroom learning, but it does accept our changed circumstances and adapt hands-on learning to our new home reality."
2020-04-28 2:01,"What happened to reading a book?  If you don't have any books for your kids to read, try to borrow a few from somebody, or order some inexpensive used ones.  Also try to get an appropriate math book and workbook.  Perhaps the kids have their current school textbooks at home.

Heavy reliance on technology may not be doing the trick.  Try making use of the printed word.

And get rid of the TV, video games, and all that stuff--forever!
Your kids will turn into geniuses."
2020-04-28 2:02,"I can understand the frustration of the parents in this article and I can also empathize with how exhausting it is to direct my kids studies while doing my paying job.

But, I think that my children have learned in an entirely different way to connect, communicate, and be responsible.

My 7 & 4 year old have made leaps of progress in this challenging environment and we have bonded in a very different way.

When Rafi, my 7 year old would come home with 20 pounds of books, scrawled notes, and not much clarity on what was expected, that was torture. Now assignments are laid out clearly, he has learned to print and scan and submit assignments. He and friends now organize online playdates and I see a much higher level of executive functioning that 6 weeks ago.

I know this is not ideal and certainly not all kids benefit, but I would suggest to find the bright spots. 

Good luck parents and God Bless the kids!"
2020-04-28 2:02,"I have a lot of sympathy for parents right now. But please don’t kid yourself that going for a nature walk or baking is the same as or better than school. It’s not. Do the best you can, and be honest with yourself."
2020-04-28 2:05,"Let’s relax school schedules, open up libraries and empty them out. Give away books and  textbooks sitting unused in schools at schools.

Who cares if a few (million) books don’t get returned?  What a great problem to have! Bill and Melinda will probably be glad to pick up the tab.

Let’s take advantage of this time to do something different. We’ve only got about six weeks.

Let’s encourage kids to read - fiction or non fiction, newspaper, magazines or encyclopedias. (maybe provide free access to NYTimes for all students - and create some special content). We could encourage individualized reading plans with teachers and parents working together. We track students progress. Emphasize exploration and having fun - minimize Google Docs, YouTube and Zoom. 

And while we’re at it, let’s get movie and sport stars (and other luminaries) to read aloud their favorite books to help get young and uninitiated kids (and their parents) involved.

What the heck, maybe encourage kids to learn a little Latin. 

Carpe diem"
2020-04-28 2:06,"For me, I was shocked at the response of our FSUSD school district in Solano County, telling me to hold tight, that they were working on a plan to get online learning in place, once they were sent home in the middle of March. It took them THREE weeks, and a very mediocre solution at that. Shouldn't they just be able to continue their education plan online, seeing as every student is issued a Chromebook at the beginning of school? Then again, their response wasn't surprising seeing that when PG&E shut the power off due to the imminent widfires (which never threated the school) last Fall, my son told me they did nothing for three days since they had no power. Can't teachers use a whiteboard and continure education without electricity on a sunny day? I should not be surprised teachers seem parlyzed as to what to do.

Luckily, my boys are 13 and 16, pretty self-disciplined, and I've been able to get them up to the lake and outside on a bike more than I would have otherwise. Sure they won't get some boring lesson plan taught from some uninspiring teacher, but they sure have been getting an education from the natural world. As for video games, Fortnite is a way they connect socially with their peers.

What my boys have learned is that they do not need a teacher to learn about something they can easily do or research up something on their own."
2020-04-28 2:08,"I think this issue exposes one of the fundamental issues of the nuclear family, which was marketed to Americans after the Second World War as a way to boost housing sales. What we’re seeing is a failure to scale. We used to live with our extended families, and there was always someone to babysit and help out around the house. Though there were more children, it was an economy of scale: one or two people could manage the group of children, leaving others free to cook, clean, and go to the office. Now (and for the past several decades) we have every family unit repeating the same work for each child. That doesn’t scale. Further, we’re reliant on our school districts to babysit our children, and those districts are criminally underfunded. So, here we are, without our schools, and the redundant labor is now obvious."
2020-04-28 2:13,"I'm grateful both of our children are grown; I can't imagine trying to teach young children while still trying to meet expectations from work.

That said, our son, a senior engineering major, is struggling with learning from home. He was very disciplined at school, carefully scheduling his time and physically segregating his learning spaces (usually the computer labs) from his social spaces. It's a system he's perfected over three years (he also has ADHD) but that really doesn't work in our modest duplex (that we also share, also unexpectedly, with his older sister, who was supposed to start a job in Africa this month). Of course, it doesn't help that his professors were wholly unprepared to teach remotely, which is understandable, but it's still the students who will pay the price, which they will pay in both lack of meaningful learning and, perhaps, needing to retake classes."
2020-04-28 2:14,"This parent’s and all parents’ frustrations are real and valid. However, once the pandemic is over- are some ready to take ownership if their kids don’t perform on high stakes testing or in an actual classroom setting where there are collective norms? When everyone is back at work somewhat- are they ready for the call from the teacher that their student refuses to sit, raise their hand, have civil discourse with peers and disrupts learning because they have broken routines for at least 6 months if school starts in September? Or are those things going to be the purview of the teacher- who also needs to account for the loss of a academic skills while being evaluated by those same high stakes measures and pressured admin? I hope so as opposed to the teacher taking blame..."
2020-04-28 2:20,"This article focuses mainly on elementary school students and their parents. I am a high school math teacher, and I am seeing different challenges for parents of high school students. #1 - Many of my students are staying up late and, therefore, sleeping late. Last week a girl missed a test, which was scheduled for 2:00 PM, because she slept until 3:30 PM. I have many students wake up at noon or later. #2 - When they are awake, are they actually doing work? It looks like they are working. They are on their computers after all. But let's be real. Teenagers are masters at hiding their use of social media and/or online video games. They try to do it in my classroom. What hope is there when they are in their own bedrooms? Teachers deal with these challenges everyday with built-in structure and discipline. But now these challenges (and many others) fall on the parents. God bless our teachers? Yes, of course. But God bless our parents, many of whom are doing two full-time jobs."
2020-04-28 2:20,"To all the glib teachers, it's not helping. 

Many of us really DO appreciate your hard work and wish you had more fairly-compensated and secure positions. 

But man, Please dial down the coursework and let's be realistic about the number of hours in a day, including time to eat and sleep. I appreciate your commitment, but This is a once-in-a-century pandemic situation with 26 Million unemployed in a month - mama and papa have to keep their jobs now more than ever. 

Let's work together to figure out a way to keep these kids on track while not destroying the American home as we know it."
2020-04-28 2:28,"It’s not just the parents who
have paid jobs who are struggling.  It’s tough on all of us who are not ourselves professional educators, and even on some of us who are — it’s a very different dynamic than being the teacher of someone else’s kids.  Additionally, it is NOT the same as many homeschool/home education programs and set ups.  As in NOT AT ALL."
2020-04-28 2:29,Teachers are working at home and have children too. They are as stressed as the parents of their students.  This is a new environment for everyone and one for which no one was trained or prepared. Hanging all of your frustrations on teachers is very unfair and counter productive.
2020-04-28 2:32,I’m still confused: why don’t we cancel school (is anyone even learning from online classes?) and instead teach through the summer—as if we had two months of snow days?
2020-04-28 2:32,"Teacher here. I think it's terrible that teachers are shoving a lot of work on students. I teach high school English. I use one app. Today, we discussed theme and imagery in poetry. We read two complex poems and discussed the themes and imagery. At the end of the lesson, students completed a short writing activity comparing the themes of those old poems to their lives today. Done. I told students to relax and have a great week. I then prepared a nice lunch and took a nap. Tomorrow I'm going to bake a nice batch of oatmeal raisin cookies! 

Seriously, the fourth quarter in most districts is pass/incomplete. Stop stressing. Do what you can do. I know many of my students are stressed or depressed. I don't want to add to the misery. 

Instead of all the tech, students should have taken home some interesting books from the library, read them, and written a few book reports. Everything I ever learned, I learned from reading."
2020-04-28 2:33,"This article resonates in so many ways but fails to address the biggest challenge with the move to online schooling: The ways in which it privileges children with a non-working parent and additional resources (space, devices, parental time, a personal bedroom) at home. While our school district has been great, I am finding it very difficult to juggle the computer use demands of three people while also working three jobs (which have all moved online) and trying to complete a PhD. Teachers use a wide range of apps and online portals, each has separate expectations, and it's just overwhelming. The current situation privileges children with parents free to now act as teachers. To continue to have graded participation is unfair. While I deeply appreciate the fact that my sons continue to learn and have such dedicated and committed teachers, I do think that the system needs to move to a P/D/F grading system, and take into account that each child is working with vastly different resources and support structures. In addition, I feel the judgement of some of the school support staff when one of my sons has not completed homework. He is a reluctant learner at the best of times but it's obvious to me that a school administrator believes that I am being remiss. Really, if it's a choice between my work and his I have to choose the one that pays for rent and groceries."
2020-04-28 2:35,"It’s discouraging to see so many comments here putting down the parents who are having a difficult time. If parents are worn out by homeschooling and work, why does it make these commenters so angry? If those of you who never had to do this, or who ran such tight ships with your own kids that you never faced long days where you cried in the bathroom or what have you, are such great parents, why not offer some advice instead of haranguing everyone with tiresome lectures? Everyone is struggling with something during this unprecedented situation and I doubt any commenter here can say with any certainty that they have this all figured out. So all stone throwing and judgement seems ill-placed and rather counterproductive."
2020-04-28 2:36,"For me and most of the teachers I know, it's weird and surreal to try and teach this way in a crisis. But guess who decides the curriculum and how often assignments are given? You guessed it! Not me! It's up to my city and even my adminstration. Trust me, I'd like to give a manageable amount of work that really just keeps my students reading a bit every week, but I'm also being micromanaged during this crisis by admin who are seeing how often I post work and asking me to document every message, email, and Google Meet for all 150 of my students. You don't like this type of education? Change the system. And don't start with complaining to your child's teachers. We actually have very little say in the matter."
2020-04-28 2:37,"I think there is a temporary, partial fix just crying out for a try. Employers should move, when possible, to a 4-day work week for a couple of months. Parents, and others, would benefit from, and greatly appreciate, and remember the decision. There are studies showing that productivity might not decrease in many cases."
2020-04-28 2:39,"I can’t imagine working full-time while home schooling a six year-old. During these extraordinary times we need to cut each other some slack. Lighten the workload, focus on subjects like math where skills are accumulated over time and let some of the other work slide. It is more important than ever to provide lesson materials that are genuinely engaging. If that means watching a movie and then writing a synopsis, or working on weights and measures by doing some baking, then so be it."
2020-04-28 2:41,"I’m so disappointed in the tone of many of these comments. So many seems to take this as an opportunity to smugly point out how teachers should be more valued, paid more, etc. while others suggest any parent who relies on the childcare aspect of school is absent in their child’s life and “outsourcing” care. 

We are all struggling. We must admit we cannot fully “reopen” the economy until we can figure out where children can go each day so their parents can return to work. It is so hard to daily attempt to do both my job and teach my child. We’re screaming for help because we know how important teaching is. Children have never been raised in the vacuum of a nuclear family - it takes a village, including schools and teachers. Working parents cannot continue trying to do what amounts to two full time jobs every day. Something has to change. And we need to have a lot more empathy for the struggle and stress everyone is facing."
2020-04-28 2:42,"The expectation that education would be anything close to normal when schools shut down abruptly and K-12 teachers and staff had to create remote learning methods in a week of course is absurd. I asked my daughter, a college junior, how she would rate the quality of online learning compared to in school. She gave it a 2 out of 10.

No one should expect too much for the rest of the spring school year. Parents and educators don’t need the pressure of trying to provide quality education while dealing with the stress and worry of Covid.

Of course they should all do what they can. But  I completely understand the parent who said her child is done with 1st grade.

We are dealing with an unprecedented, global crisis. Staying healthy both physically and mentally is job 1.

Kids are resilient. They’ll be ok if they get emotional support at home, as much learning and instruction as they can handle, and we prepare sensibly to return to school - in whatever new structure that turns out to be - when it’s safe to do so."
2020-04-28 2:42,"Chaos, pure chaos. From trying to find where things are on Schoology, to QR codes from textbooks that don't work.  Of course there's no textbook, just a poorly scanned copy of a page from the teacher. Install this and that app, to no avail. Oh, Win7, I don't have the proper Microsoft Framework, what??
The lessons are thrown together with no thought at all about each family's possible differences in available technology. I spend 5 times more doing IT and searching than doing the lesson.  I know the teacher is trying hard to give us something to grab onto, but its badly presented, disorganized, technically disjointed, with very poor instructions.  Very frustrating. How about just a printout, instead of a wild goose chase looking for the lesson in Schoology, installing buggy apps,  and pointing to QR's."
2020-04-28 2:44,"Just get the kids to read: either by reading to them, with them, by themselves or setting them up with audiobooks. Continue with this through the summer. And they should be at or above their grade reading level come next Fall. Not sure about the science and math though."
2020-04-28 2:47,"My kid officially dropped out of fifth grade and took up building with legos for hours and trying to start fires in the back yard with a magnifying glass. He also managed to bring a mostly feral cat into the house and now we are spending all of our time taking the cat to the vet and trying to socialize the poor cat. We did find a decent online math program, so at least he won’t be behind in math. We also have a lot of books, so reading should continue to improve. But online school, no thanks."
2020-04-28 2:52,"This will sound quite silly, I'm sure, to many.
Perhaps the emphasis during this time could be shifted to first, reading: reading together, separately,  aloud, reading aloud, reciting  and memorizing poetry. Let children make some choices  that fit their interests. 
 
For math for younger children, how about  stressing practical everyday math that is used - more often now hidden from sight? 

For older kids, and those above the parents'  level, how about using a resource like the Kahn Academy?   There are self-programmed learning online programs.  There are even commercial suppliers, like Scilearn, which might be convinced to offer deals considering the crisis.

Schools and teachers were not prepared for this -- and they haven/t given this the thought and testing that a Kahn Academy has. Just because kids have computers doesn't mean the curricula 
 are compatible with home schooling.

So don;t duplicate the school curriculum at home - not under this stressful time. Forget about worksheets analyzing character traits. Forget formal tests.

Schools and teachers can prepare for the fall can be made for the fall in case shutdowns are still a major or recurring problem.

The ideal is to keep young minds learning, but not hating the experience.  Maybe it's an opportunity to encourage them to find something they are fascinated with.   The point is not to keep them glued to laptops 5 to 7 hours a day, or to generate as many worksheets as possible as proof of work."
2020-04-28 2:52,"Most if not all parents have no business teaching, particularly their own kids.  I have been teaching 35 years.  Am good at it and know all the tricks.  I made the transition to online teaching very quickly and easily.  The kids are doing great.  Why?  Because I give a lot of thought to what I present and what I expect in return, allowing for all variables.  As I see it most teachers don’t really know how to teach.  And certainly no parent can learn it on the fly.  Kids will engage if you know how to connect with them.  Parents by and large have no idea how to really connect with their kids and motivate them to learn.  It’s often a reflection of how they were taught and what their values are."
2020-04-28 2:52,"My middle/high school kids are doing fine. They’re self-sufficient, and they can get their week’s work done by Tuesday. But that doesn’t mean other people aren’t having a hellish time of it, or anything in between. I’m not sure why other people have to literally experience someone else’s misery to be able to sympathize. Just “try it on” as my bestie, a frontline nurse and mother, would say. Sympathy won’t hurt you—and it might just make those who are struggling feel like they’re not alone."
2020-04-28 2:54,"The bottom line is everyone is doing the best they can and everyone is managing a different load. I am a middle school counselor and have been making personal contact with all of our families. The one thing that I have learned is that every family is experiencing stress and different circumstances. What one teacher is doing is perfect for one family and too much or too little for another. My school is simply stressing connection and engagement. I think that is the best approach because the last thing we should be doing is causing stress in families. Lastly, teachers who choose to teach online and educated about how to approach that type of learning. I know parents are frustrated with all the apps and platforms that teachers are using everyday. Please remember that this has been a huge learning curve for all educators. Parents- breathe and do what you can. That’s it. Teachers are amazing and are probably working too hard as usual. We should all treat each other, and ourselves, with some grace."
2020-04-28 2:57,"I am a teacher.  High school. I lesson plan, give feedback, and record progress in a way that now takes 3 times longer so as make this current online platform functional.  I had to re-do the grading system, create new rubrics, figure what digital platforms would work for assignments and assessments.  It is a lot.  I have a 3rd grader and a 9th grader at home with me.  My husband is gone every day, Monday - Friday for his job from 8 to 5:30.  I start my day at 7:30 AM and finish by about 6 PM.   My girls and I have a schedule, but we flex it as the days are monotonous.  I have a terrible temper, (at home), that my family regularly sees.  My daughters and I all have our moments of screaming and bawling and feeling sorry for ourselves.  But we don't quit.  We regroup and say we will have a better day tomorrow.  I am always exhausted but as a teacher one always is- my life is unchanged in that way.  I have all the time in the world for people who are passing through hardship and need a hand.  I have none for people who feel themselves above the inconveniences of parenting."
2020-04-28 2:58,"Common core is already much too accelerated for many of America’s children.  And now school districts and administrators are planning to just pass the kids along into the next grade level even though they have effectively lost a full third of this year’s meaningful instruction??  Are they crazy?!

Many parents I know would much rather have our kids repeat this year’s grade than have to play catch-up for the next year(s).  Can you imagine the strain and undue pressure  that will put on kids already being pushed so fast they barely, if ever, achieve any real mastery in the 3 R’s etc.?  Not to mention the significant strain it will cause teachers.  Add to that likely massive budget cuts due to lower tax revenue coming in, especially in districts already struggling with fiscal (mis)management or in poor rural areas.   I hope governors, state and local superintendents and departments of education and principals and teachers take all that into consideration when deciding next steps."
2020-04-28 2:58,"Could anyone have possibly expected something different when school was canceled 4+ weeks ago?

At the time, the only issues the media focused on were free meals and child care.  Now we are seeing that schools (and camps, and sports, and activities) are an essential part of the social fabric and most parents literally can't function (at least professionally) without them, and kids really need their teachers!

Maybe our leaders -- and cheerleading media (including the NYTimes) -- shouldn't be so glib about shutting down schools next time.  Perhaps next time we can be like Sweden, which never closed k-8."
2020-04-28 3:00,"All children need to learn with their peers away from parents. Some children desperately need school for meals, a chance for a better life, or daily escape from bad situations. Parents need schools so they can function as adults. The school system plays a critical role in dealing with society’s inequities and pressures. The burden on teachers now and always is huge. I am sorry they are so poorly remunerated for this.

If basic social and learning needs can be met by educators and parents in these tough times, children who are not in dire circumstances will not “fall behind”, I think. It is difficult; but they will develop different strengths and ideas about themselves and the world, which will be valuable in the long run. The key to their future happiness is not whether they finish the schoolwork; it’s whether their parents keep afloat, they have some school structure, and the future looks at least okay in their household.

Only a very small minority of children throughout history have gone to a red brick schoolhouse five mornings a week. The elite were privately educated; most worked alongside their parents from dawn past dusk. Many people live this way now. I don’t know about you; but I am going to chill out, work and have a beer when my daughter finally goes to sleep at eleven."
2020-04-28 3:04,"Parents, due to general good times over the past years since WWII, have become soft and weak.  Americans in general are no longer the strong people that our parents, grandparents and great grandparents were.  Each generation has gotten softer and softer.
Convince me I'm wrong."
2020-04-28 3:07,"I am almost 68 and grew up in NJ. I can never ever once remember my parents doing homework with me or my brothers (although my mother might help in typing a paper). They could have, they both were professionals with graduate degrees. It was just expected that we do our own homework. We were taught independence by school and parents. It turned out OK: my brothers and I are also professionals with  graduate degrees.

Somewhere along the line homework became a family team effort. So did school projects (and for some so did getting into college). 

However, teaching also changed. Teachers had to prove they were teaching and it was not possible to wait 10 years to see their results. 

Under the present situation it is worse. Teachers have to prove they are working in order to justify, as it were, getting paid. They turn Zoom into graduate seminars which require far more than most children can do themselves. The teachers are afraid that somebody might say that they should not be paid or take a cut so they pile it on. I assign therefore I am.

To make it worse, there are not always enough devices for everybody. Or devices at all in a home. 

Thankfully, I can do my own work disrupted only by a Zoom of watching my grandchildren doing or not doing theirs.

This too shall pass. The material will be made up.

Teachers should cut parents and students a break (and get paid) and parents should loosen up."
2020-04-28 3:10,"I'm working COVID ICU so even when I am home, which is rare, I cannot be with my kids. My young teen can't motivate and keeps getting notices saying her work isn't complete. I'm sorry but I cannot be there for her to stay on top of it. My ADHD older teen still has AP exams? From home? Alone? Schools and educational orgs need to stop pretending this is some normal semester and allow for summer make up."
2020-04-28 3:11,"With all due respect, parents (or others) who are “working from home” are barely working, although they may have their work laptops turned on to mark their presence.  Employees know this and so do their managers or employers."

2020-04-28 3:21,"I’m sorry but parents need to toughen up in dealing with their children.  I see many of today’s parents succumbing to their child’s will on every ask.

2020-04-28 3:22,"The canned programs that elementary public school districts have purchased and require teachers use are not designed for remote learning.  These programs rely heavily on worksheets that are printed off and either completed at home or in class. Teachers in the past two decades have received hundreds of hours of professional training on how to teach these programs and little if any instruction or encouragement to create and guide lessons and units that meet his or her group of students' learning needs or include long-term projects that ask students to demonstrate and extend their learning.  Choice in how students present their learning and creativity have been turned over to the children labeled ""gifted."" In my district it's become absurdly apparent how most of our teachers and their students are completely unprepared for remote learning as the PDFs they are told to use do not convert to Word or Docs and the Chrome extensions that are free are not sufficient.  I'm just trying to keep students engaged and connected to their community with optional fun science experiments at home, audio recordings of me reading books aloud (with publisher permission), art and computer design challenges, and just giving them a place to stay connected to school, and I'm not alone--but be forgiving if your child's teacher is asking them do to stuff that is too hard, too confusing, and overwhelming, as it's likely that teacher is being told he or she has to do his."
2020-04-28 3:22,"Imagine having a job where you are routinely ignored, disrespected, insulted, and even threatened by those you are supposed to supervise.  

Imagine having a job where the people you supervise are allowed to evaluate you anonymously.

And I'm only a college professor.  I work with my secondary ed colleagues every year at different training events.  The rigors of my job are nothing compared to theirs.  

But we get four months' vacation, right?  No.  Many of us work during the summers.  Either we're trying to make ends meet or undertaking research projects that can't be done during the academic year.  Oh, and we don't get paid over the summer.  Most of us are on nine-month contracts.  

Most of us make less than $60,000 a year.  Those of us at universities?  Most of us took a seven-year vow of poverty and have only just now started saving for retirement in our mid-30s.  Some of us don't even have that luxury.  We subsist on food stamps and thrift store finds.  Most of us are still paying off student loan debt well into our 40s.

2020-04-28 3:25,"This is why our society is broken, we are in a world which requires both parents to work just to be able to.. live.. to get by. This, At the detriment of our children who absent the parents for most of the time, require others to be paid to do the job of a parent. If society was more harmonious with being/ living, we would be able to live off a single income parent while the other focuses on the precious and most honorable job of child rearing. The broken society is oppressive, requiring us to toil, endlessly. It begins in school when the child is forced to compete, is compared to others and expectations are given. The purpose to train them be productive in a working world. Which is another way of saying, train them to be oppressed, manipulated and exploited for something the imaginary valuable paper called money."
2020-04-28 3:26,"Interestingly, the dropout rate from the profession in the first five years has been about 50% for, I believe, well over a decade, and reports of teacher burnout have been circulating for at least as long.  I wonder if trying to support 2-3 students with varying needs while working from home will give the general public some insight into why supporting 20-30+ students of varying needs (with all the documentation, assessment, meetings, accountability, etc. that go along with it) might cause a teacher to burnout..."
2020-04-28 3:32,"My daughter and I are both second grade teachers in affluent communities, so there are many stay at home parents, parents who already work from home, and extra resources. We both have almost 100% buy in to our online learning platforms. But this isn’t the situation in so many places and has unfortunately led to a very uneven playing field amongst all of the children in our country. We really, really miss the interaction with our students in the classroom. And I  am so grateful for all of the parents who are able to help their children navigate online learning while they try to keep their work life and family moving forward. I wish I could do better for my students and I couldn’t do it without the help of parents and older siblings."
2020-04-28 3:33,"Maybe, just maybe, folks will appreciate the incredible work our teachers do. 

It’s harder than your job, isn’t it?

And how does it pay, in comparison?"
2020-04-28 3:37,"With respect to Mrs Williams-Morris and others in her shoes, having a job that requires focus and analysis in front of a computer all day is not easy with a 6 yo or 2-3 young children... life would be much simpler if my wife I and/or could spend a day parenting and doing domestic work. Things could be worse but it’s frustrating to try to keep up expectations with 2 working parents... I’m sure even harder for a sm or sd."
2020-04-28 3:37,"Parents should lower their scholastic expectations, and teachers should lower their HW expectations. Pass/fail grades are great. And let online school do what it does best - serve as an educational distraction and form of routine and structure for our kids for a few hours. That’s the best we can hope to achieve - and it’s pretty good. Thank you, teachers!!"
2020-04-28 3:37,"Question the idea of productivity. What is at the root of this concept that dominates human life in our society, but is not a universal concept for living.

Do we need to impose this religion of productivity on our children right now? Do we understand why parents working at home during a pandemic must be as productive as they were when going to an office?

Ask yourself why."
2020-04-28 3:38,"I don’t mean to brag, but I have no children. I do have a Master degree in Education. I’m very glad for both, and know that teaching children at home is nearly impossible for each parent out there trying to help. 
The Twitter post about “ my son is done with first grade” did give me a laugh. Does this patent not understand that children DO IN FACT fail first grade, and thus may have to repeat it?!"
2020-04-28 3:40,"I commend and appreciate all teachers. I also commend all parents who are navigating this extremely difficult time that arrived with sudden impact into all of our lives. Moving forward, let's be gentle with ourselves and our children. Expectations should be around family health and happiness. No one needs extra stress. Maybe just have kids read books they enjoy for a couple of hours. Do some puzzles. A couple of math sheets. Maybe learn a new recipe or help fold the laundry. And the next time teachers ask for a living wage, necessary classroom supplies, or lower student-to-teacher ration, let's support them because we all know how hard they work and how valuable they are to all of us."
2020-04-28 3:40,"It’s now May. Children “check out” after Spring Break. Keep it light until next September. Children can read what they like, learn new vocabulary, continue math as best they can. I don’t even remember what I learned from May to June in any of my grades.  Character traits? How many times with this bore?  Zoom on Kindergarten? Give me a break. Consider the Kindergarten year over.  High school students should take the Montessori view of independent work. The children are living through an unprecedented time. That’s learning enough."
2020-04-28 3:41,"My kids learned at home. We very rarely followed a curriculum or did formal learning. They read a lot, played together, took long walks, spent a lot of time in nature and spent hours each day alone doing what they wanted to do.  While us parents worked and did what we had to do. They have grown up to be responsible, hard working respectful adults. Who knows if they were “behind” their peers. Maybe parents should take a deep breath let the kids do or not do their school work. This is a short amount of time in the life of a person. The kids will be alright, in fact this time away from formal learning may actually be good for them. Surprising little gets accomplished in a school setting anyway."
2020-04-28 3:41,"In these trying times students, parents and teachers should just remember that “ good enough “ will make the day go easier. Nothing needs to be perfect. For the mental health of all doing what you can is just fine. Keeping your sanity is paramount, don’t you think?"
2020-04-28 3:41,"Apart from a few subjects, much of what is taught and emphasized in modern education is useless nonsense that drains mental energy. This is energy best used elsewhere, such as the observation and interaction with our living environment and nature. 

The wasted hours and energy of millions of children means that our world will remain poorer for it."
2020-04-28 3:42,"Imagine how it is for the tens of thousands of teachers who are working from home and who themselves have children taking classes. That’s my case. On top of learning new technologies, using our own hardware, electricity, bandwidth and plastering our face on a daily basis (with our homes as background), we also have to assist our children and cook all meals and clean and do laundry. This is most stressful on teachers, believe me."
2020-04-28 3:46,"Teacher’s work is hard! Educating students is a difficult and challenging job. Good teachers motivate people to do their best work. Great teachers are priceless, but deserving of good compensation like college coaches.

Keep reading with your creations and all will be fine. Good luck 🍀!"

2020-04-28 3:58,"My heart goes out to you parents, especially those with younger and\or kids with disabilities. My only child graduated from H S last year, in the nick of time. He's finishing up his freshman year at college home and online. All I have to do is make dinnet!"
2020-04-28 3:58,"Nothing about this is easy. That is okay. Reading this article, as a T and a P, I felt a strong anti-teacher bias. Perhaps, instead, we need to look at parenting education. Free parenting education for parents of toddlers could change the world. So many of the struggles here are because parenting is hard work, exhausting work, rewarding and important work, and most people never study psychology or education. Teaching is, at some level outsourced parenting. We are in this together, us teachers and parents. Communicate, help each other. Reporters can help build community instead of fostering division."
2020-04-28 4:00,"My mother missed 2 full years of school - 1937 because polio closed all  schools in NZ and in 1943 she supervised the younger children at her school because the all-male teachers were fighting WWII (women were not allowed to train as teachers in Australia at that time). I am not saying that these losses did not effect her education - they certainly did- but that she had a different kind of education during those years. Helping her father on the farm as an eight year old is still one of the highlights of her life at the age of 89. However, as a teacher myself I hear the parental anxiety of those quoted in the article and it reminds me of the ‘helicopter parenting’ trend so familiar to teachers now. Worrying about a child “falling behind” is one sure way to transfer adult anxieties to children and to destroy their enjoyment of learning. Whatever that learning may be; helping parents in a practical household task like learning how to cook or finding a way to keep self directed that does not involve hours of screen time. Independence and creativity may be the most valuable skills in a post-covid world."
2020-04-28 4:06,"These are no doubt tough times for parents, children, and teachers many of which have the priviledge of working from home and not having the threat of being deployed to the front lines of fighting Covid-19. I sympathize with them all. As much as parents need to chill about trying to recapitulate a school day or simulate daycare at home via remote learning, teachers need to stop complaining that they have to adapt to distance teaching. There's a certain hypocrisy of the way I used to go to parent teacher night and receive contructive criticims of my child, and yet teachers can't cope with the fact that they are now under the microscope and need to step up to these unusual times. Teachers are lucky they get to still work and from the comfort of their own homes no less. Is it challenging? Absolutely. But would you prefer to don some PPE and take care of Covid-19 patients? How about work the checkout counter at Stop and Shop? Be thankful parents care enough about thse value of teachers' work and have high expectations of them to expect them to be able to adapt to the times. And when this is all over, can we finally pay teachers the higher salaries that they have long deserved?"
2020-04-28 1:43,"There is a great deal of suffering that everyone is experiencing.  Unfortunatley there is no end in sight  for any of us.  So we just have to look to the future and think that one day we can look back o n thiss entire experience and realize that we all have the same collective esperiences and we came out the other side.

We are trying to educate our children and someone else is dealing with care for their parents, handicapped children etc.  No one has  heavier tasks than anyone else.

We just have to keep putting one foot in front  of the other and realize  that this virus 19  is pretty horrific.  It could always get worst. Trust in each other and stay the course."

Luckily, my kids are on vacation this week. I finally got work done without interruption! For the past several weeks I've been an anxious wreck. It's impossible to be a good employee, a good mother, a good teacher, and a good wife in the same 8 hour period. Last week I broke down and emailed all my frustrations to the principal.  He calmed a lot of my nerves. I've got an overzealous teacher on my hands, and I can ignore him when needed. I suggest contacting your principal - nothing changes when you are shouting into a void."

I sympathize with my parents and guardians, and I'm somewhat irked at some of my fellow teachers. They seem to think that through extraordinary effort, both theirs and their students', that they will emulate the learning experience their students get in school. I don't believe that's possible. And I think serious damage can be done to children and families during a very trying time by attempting to do so. For my students, I've scaled back significantly, tried to include more fun in my lessons, and cut many of my students who were already dealing with a lot some slack."
2020-04-28 4:26,"For all of those students who are not graduating high school or college I suggest calling it a year and starting over next year. Students are adaptable, will continue their learning and, above all, young. 

Parents should be parents till then, not inept substitute teachers."
2020-04-28 4:30,"The lack of socialization, play dates, study dates takes a real toll on children. Social media can help with this. But with yellow tapes over play structures, park closures, athletic teams, music, after school clubs stopped... we are basically condemning our children to more lonely path of psychological development. It's unfair to them.  In the future, we must be able to prevent dangerous viral and pathogen spread better than we are now."
2020-04-28 4:31,"Maybe a little more respect for teachers now that parents see what a hard job it is would be nice.  Maybe a lesson learned, teaching is hard so let teachers do their jobs with less parental intervention.
I am not a teacher, but I was involved in hundreds of school design/construction projects in the course of my career.  I know that between parents and school administrator teaching is tough, even without students...give teachers a break."
2020-04-28 4:32,Stop curriculum and have students read books according to their grade level. Reading itself is education.
2020-04-28 4:40,"I began working with the grandmother and mother in a family through a local refugee resettlement program three years ago. I have remained in touch beyond their status as refugees, because they have become friends. Often, my visits focused on helping decipher homework assignments of their elementary age children at the family’s request. Despite my own children being little more than a decade older than theirs, the language of the school curriculum felt as foreign as the family’s native tongue. The math exercises were unlike the math I learned or even the math my children learned. The social studies and science pedagogy flummoxed me. I have a post-bac degree, and the mother and the grandmother were teachers before fleeing their home country, so education’s importance or mechanics were not unappreciated topics. I knew what their classes were trying to teach but I couldn’t sync with the how of getting there. I can understand and empathize with parents grappling with the difficulties of trying to fill the gaps left when the traditional classroom is unavailable. Godspeed."
2020-04-28 4:44,"My wife and I had been homeschooling for about two years when the quarantine began. To meet the challenges of homeschooling, I work a relatively low paying job that comes with regular hours; my wife works sporadic weekend hours; we live in a small, cheap home in an undesirable town; we share one old car; we rarely eat out; and most of our shopping is at the Goodwill. These are some of the sacrifices we have made for our convictions. I'll concede our life is not for everyone.
 
Nevertheless, I have been sad when I hear how many people have struggled to manage their home lives--juggling work and caregiving--since this began. I feel bad for people who have had to scramble to just manage, especially if those people are from households where choices have always been an unaffordable luxury.  But, I feel profoundly sad now that I see that the majority of my coworkers and peers--people who have the luxury of choices--have chosen to organize their lives in such a way that they can only function when they are rarely together as a family. 

Teachers, health professionals, and essential workers deserve praise because they have difficult jobs and they serve others. Many unsung heroes also make personal sacrifices for others. But, emergencies are not the exclusive province for making sacrifices for your children, your family, and others. I hope people reflect on that and their choices rather than simply pine for the days when they can send their family away and return to work."
2020-04-28 4:47,"My younger granddaughter just had her 11th birthday and the ""tablet"" her school gave her kept dying so I bought her a rope computer for her birthday.  Besides being able to do her school work on it, she is teaching herself to type on its full sized keyboard  and researching art techniques and materials.  Her mother is currently laid off so they can walk the dogs together as well as take long bike rides on their local bike paths while still practicing proper social distancing.  I'm sure the skills my granddaughter is picking up will stand her in good stead when schools reopen.  Fortunately she has always been a creative kid who keeps herself busy with art projects and not computer games!"
2020-04-28 4:48,"“Home schooling”  is an oxymoron. It’s actually cruel during a pandemic. 

I don’t think the schools are helping anyone by remotely “administering” lesson plans for the younger kids. Frankly it demeans the teachers to suggest their expertise is easily duplicated and enervates the parents in their feeble quest to emulate what they were not trained to do. 

Read to your kids as much as possible. If the kids maintain their reading levels ,  they will be able to catch up with everything else when school resumes under the guidance of their teachers."

1) Classroom setups in Google Classroom with different subject  headings for different subjects and their assignments to be uploaded. 
- Links to videos, pdfs anything can be places here in one place like a mailbox for access.

2) Zoom classroom meetings with all codes available in one place. Make sure the school administrator sets it up so it is secure from zoombombing. 

3) Math - either videos on Math from safe youtube or the teacher uses a white board to teach.
- Khan Academy is a good resource and so is your local
- Mathnasium

English- they have their usual reading books / Epic.

4) Assignments can be posted on Google Classroom and “turned in” that way. Assignments are completed either in Google Slides digitally or in pdf printed out, and uploaded into Google classrooms.

5) History- “liberty kids” is on youtube and extremely informative and fun- ask your kids.

Parents - feel free to add to this list so we can all help each other and suggest to school administrators what works."

2020-04-28 4:36,"There is something really wrong with American family life. My kids are grown, and having them stay with me has been one of the few blessings of this pandemic. What can be better than your lawyer son asking you to rewatch Harry Potter with him and his partner? But when the kids were small, there were moments, of course, when I was busy writing my college essays while they ran riot in the living room. So I can understand the frustration of wanting them out of your hair. But if I ordered them to do their homework, they would do it: perhaps not well, but they would not disobey their father or me because the hierarchy of parent and child was something that was a natural part of their culture. So what’s wrong with a parent who cannot just order her son to sit down and do homework? A parent who cannot tell her daughter “This is what you have to do and this is what you are going to do”? Where is parental authority? Why do people even have children in this country if you treat them as if they were made of glass and then they grow up selfish, whiny and entitled? In short, it’s not the pandemic’s fault if you don’t know how to instill discipline and sense of obligation in your kids."
2020-04-28 5:00,"Kindergartners may actually be better off without formal lessons. 

My mother was trained as a kindergarten teacher in the 1940s, and in those days, they advised against introducing formal learning too early and instead advised teacher to focus on building the skills needed for reading and making the children eager to learn to read by presenting them with interesting stories. All supplemented with art, music, and simple dances and games.

Prospective kindergarten teachers were told that many five-year-olds are not neurologically or emotionally ready for sit-down formal learning and that forcing them into a formal curriculum too early would make them hate school. On the other hand, there was no harm in delaying the introduction of explicit reading instruction until first grade.

Many if not most of us adults had a non-academic kindergarten experience, and we turned out fine.

If I had a five-year-old at home, I'd ditch remote learning kindergarten and simply concentrate on providing an enriched home environment full of books (for looking at pictures and reading aloud), art materials, music, and real-world examples of numerical concepts (cooking?), supplemented with physical activity."
2020-04-28 5:01,"Just some thoughts from a teacher, knowing I do not speak for all:

1) Teachers do not often choose what we teach or how much we teach. This is left up to administration, district policy or even state policy. Teachers giving ""too much"" are often simply following mandated instructions.

2) Teachers are often parents too. We juggle teaching students while homeschooling our own kids. In my case, I teach while keeping a two year old entertained and I am not permitted to have him with me during actual instructional time, but he is a Monressori child and we too are keeping up with curriculum. 

3) We are giving parents the same material we cover. The trouble is: most parents are not trained to do what we do, and we know it. 

4) We worry about our kids, especially low income and high risk kids. I have worked with many students in my career who were significantly safer at school than at home, and I do stay up at night, wondering if they are OK. 

5) We are learning too. Some of us got a week-long crash course in online education. Most of us did not and are redoing our curriculum as we go. 

6) Many of us are spending 10-12 hours per day just prepping and teaching. Not all of us. I will proudly say that I put in over 250 hours in the last month, on top of parenting a toddler embodying the Terrible Twos.

7) We hear you. Now is the time to be on the same team. We do this with 30+ kids every day, but never online. Let's learn together. For your kid's sake, do not give up."

My wish, though, is that the Times would focus on what good there is in all of this. Teachers are giving everything that we have to educate our children as best as we can through this time of remote learning. We, too, are burning out; feeling hopeless and depleted, at times. However, we keep moving forward. Every teacher that I know is exhausted at this point, and feeling despondent. Nonetheless, they keep moving forward. Not because we feel obligated to do so; but because of the love that we have for our students."
2020-04-28 5:14,"What's missing the most in our situation is the frustration of our son at not being with peers. I think the social context of everyone all responding to the same instruction in a classroom setting has merit for many kinds of learning activities. All this tech needs to be put aside and maybe  they need to just spend time with each other on calls, maybe even 'buddying up' on some lessons and talk about, as my son put it ""how this virus is ruining everything""  Shared experience is a fundamental human need."

I remember the bad old days well enough, of getting my kids to do homework in the evening after a full day at work. It completely ruined any semblance of family time in the eveni ng. The goal for these parents should be that they keep their jobs, and that the home is harmoniou s. Forget about this schooling nonsense and leave that to teachers, who know how, when the time comes."

2020-04-28 3:24,"“Essential workers are in perhaps the toughest spot, especially if they are away from home during school hours, leaving just one parent, or no one at all, at home when students need them most.”

Yeah.  Try being a single parent (not by choice), with all those and more demands on you."
2020-04-28 2:22,"Of all the people dealing with the many, many horrible effects of this pandemic, I think it's safe to say that American parents are the loudest complainers. No matter the news site, there's been one article after another over the past few weeks that's been devoted to parental wailing about having to deal with their own children.

Yes, I'm sure it's a pain having your children home as they struggle with their school work. But please remember: they are your children, and right now, as we deal with this global crisis, it's simply your responsibility to deal with them. You chose to have them (almost all of you made that choice, anyway), and now you just do whatever it takes to take care of them--without the incessant complaining, please. 

People are dying horribly--suffocating to death--from this virus. So many beautiful lives have been cut short. People are devastated by the loss of loved ones. People have lost their jobs and have to sit in lines miles and miles long to get food from food banks. And yet you go on and on about how awful it is having your own children on your hands as they do their schoolwork. 

Enough already. We're all tired of hearing it."
2020-04-28 1:52,"Another perfect example of living life without thinking -- just following what the system says -- and unecessarily paying dearly for it. If these kids were simply reading one good book a week, writing every day, and presenting for 10 minutes to their parents, they would gain habits, knowledge, and skills that would last them a lifetime.... Instead, they burn hours attending useless zoom sessions and exahusting their parents with ""homework"". Why: because their parents don't have the imagination or the guts to deviate from the received system.  Exactly the same way they are burning themselves in jobs they probably hate and attending meetings they probably detest, with people they despise, etc....  The price of lazy, cowardly conformity is high.  Don't complain when you have to pay it."
2020-04-28 3:12,People aren’t telling me I should have kids now.
2020-04-28 3:10,"I am an incompetent home school teacher. Really bad. If this keeps up someone from the school district should come over and fire me. I don’t know how my kid and I are ever going to dig our way out of this educational disaster. 
He reads Calvin and Hobbes books, so that’s something. Right?"
2020-04-28 3:14,"Our society is very sick. Many people point to parents and tell them “they’re you’re bundle of trouble, live with it!” What is wrong with us all? We as a society have one thing in the future: the children! We should all feel a communal responsibility. That’s what schools are for! That’s what our entire world organization around parks, facilities for parents, libraries, free health care — it’s all there because we once were sane and we once structured things on the simple obvious assumption that all of us adults are party to the children of the future.

It blows my mind that we have gotten so disconnected that people can say matter of factory “your kids, your problem, too bad!” 

Only a world in which we have lost touch with the concept of community can we rush to shut down schools and then gleefully tell parents school will be out for months on end. It was the most insane decision. And we continue to dig ourselves deeper into that hole."
2020-04-28 3:36,This is a global issue.  This describes the same things that I am hearing from the other parents of years 1 & 3 (my children's years) here in Melbourne.  I haven't been this tired since having baby #2 when baby #1 was 2 years old.
2020-04-28 1:40,"wow really? ""some have told her they are trying, but that their children won't cooperate."" jesus. Parent your children. Teachers often deal with 20-30 of these uncooperative kids every single day during the school year. And you can't get YOUR OWN child to do some school work?"
2020-04-28 2:51,"We are destroying future generations.  Germany, Denmark, and Sweden have all reopened schools.  Yes, we need to slow the spread and flatten the curve (and we have), but we can't destroy our future.  It is immoral generational warfare.

2020-04-28 5:35,"Everyone —teachers and parents — needs to chill. Yes, give the kids lessons and let them absorb what they can. But don’t forget this is a once-in-a-century situation. And don’t make it seem like a tragedy if the kids don’t learn as much as they would have for a couple of months had they been in school. Just get through the next few months; the kids will have a lifetime to make up for whatever it is they missed."
2020-04-28 5:39,"Honestly, why not take a break and have fun with your kids? My mother grew up on a cattle ranch, remote from the nearest school.  She was sent to town every other year to board with an elderly couple and attend the school year.  Started this at age six. She grew up to graduate from The University of California and became a teacher. Taking a break from classes is not the horrific problem we’re pretending it is.  Granted, working parents struggle to find the time to earn a living with children at home, but that is an entirely different problem. If you can, enjoy this time with your children."
2020-04-28 5:40,"I live in Oregon and have three daughters, one in 1st Grade, one in 3rd Grade and one in 5th Grade.  What I will say is that I am a divorced co-parent and sharing our girls between us has been a challenge.  Not between us necessarily, but the fact that tablets have to go back and forth, knowledge has to go back and forth on how to log on to so and so, or how to restart this daughters tablet to get her 'google classroom' to work and this other daughters for Seesaw.

I know we have a decentralized federal Education Department, our children need to continue to learn and I can tell anyone the ODE established guidelines for online learning or distance learning.  Though I don't agree.   For my own sake I love my children to the ends of the Earth.  What I will add is that I am doing my best to balance the 'requirements' inflicted on them from school.  I have told my daughters this week that these are just 'requests' from your teachers and we will do our best to meet them while remembering that life is fragile, exciting and ever changing.  I will continue to provide a block of time for them to learn from their teachers, but I will also provide a time in which this current environment affords me the time to teach my children the joys of life; growing a garden, catching a frisbee, eating a cheeseburger with cheese melting over the sides, watching the sunset.  I love my daughters teachers and my kids love them, but their sanity in this time is what is more important to me."
2020-04-28 5:17,Thank you for this. I now know my wife and I are not alone. Her work was cancelled and the only way I can keep working my shifts as a doctor is to work everyday and when I’m called upon. The chaos of a lack of structure is destroying us all. It hurts to hear our almost 5 yo cry that she has nobody to ply with anymore.
2020-04-28 3:04,I am very worried about the schools closing. Three months of lost learning could be a huge handicap for many children. If schools actually have air conditioning—and I know many don’t—maybe summer school for everyone should be considered. The little munchkins have had their break. March em back to class hup 2 3 4

2020-04-28 5:54,"As a educator with 30 years experience (and a parent with over 17 years experience), I've heard all kinds of prognostications that the future of schooling is online.  
One positive thing that this pandemic has proven is the impending death of the traditional school is highly exaggerated.  To the great relief of parents, teachers, and students (if not the corporate boards of google, et. al.) everywhere!"

2020-04-28 6:02,"I wouldn't trade this time with my kids for anything. Keeping them safe and healthy in mind and body is what I live for. People seem to take schools for granted, like babysitters. Maybe teacher salaries will go up as a result? We can't teach our kids expecting to have the same structure as they had in school. Take breaks. Allow them lots of outdoor time. Give them chores and fun activities. Feed them. Let them have too much screen time a few times a week. And play with them, connect with them during those breaks. Create memories. Yes, this IS your responsibility, so find the silver lining, anyway you can, for their sake."
2020-04-28 6:07,"In Miami-Dade, the Superintendent has stated  that if students do not submit assignments, not to give them an F, give them an X. All students  will be promoted regardless.  Administrators, put the pressure on teachers to find  out why said student has not turned in assignments, going on 4 weeks now. When we call those parents,  they paraphrase in saying that you (teachers) can't fail my child  anyway,  so why should he/she do it."
2020-04-28 6:09,"Thanks. A super encouraging, and hilarious -because oh so relatable -article. Some people replying seem to miss the point of the article. Parents who love and want to give their kids their best in these uncertain times of a pandemic are struggling. They are all saying even if it goes smoothly-homeschooling/parenting/working at home during a pandemic is complicated and isn’t working as they hoped. Kids are having big emotions. Point is I appreciate the honesty of those highlighted in this article and the humor. And the flexibility and courage it takes to pivot and change course - like maybe not follow the classroom homework suggestions. The most important thing we can give our children  now is love and security - for some that may look like a schedule and class work to keep the day moving along for others that may look like unscripted days of playing and often for many a mix of both. It’s sad that so many people writing in feel the need to judge-they are missing the point. Maybe they too need to take a deep breath and go for a walk and let themselves off the hook for whatever is keeping them so critical. Anyhow thank you for the article."
2020-04-28 6:10,"My sister is a fifth-grade science teacher in Northeast Ohio. Her students are required to take a standardized test at the end of the year that includes concepts those students were taught in the third and fourth grade. My sister’s performance review includes a percentage devoted to the “pass rate” of her students. So, for all of those whiny parents declaring the school year is “over” for their child, I’d like them to remember that it won’t be over for my sister for years to come. She’ll be struggling to teach third- and fourth-grade science in addition to the fifth-grade subjects that are covered. By that time, these parents will be back at their desks, complaining that their kids didn’t pass their standardized tests."
2020-04-28 6:32,"Teaching is hard - now imagine having up to 180 students every day. I was a pretty good teacher, but I'm glad to be retired; it was exhausting. Hope these parents gain some insight and sympathy for what teachers do."
2020-04-28 6:35,"I know this comment will probably be lost among the hundreds already here, but I'm writing because this article deeply touched me. I've been helping to run an organization called YAPA Kids, and we've been providing free online classes to young students, because we've witnessed firsthand how hard it can be for many parents to keep up with both work and their home life. I think probably the most memorable moment of what we've done is when a parent emailed me about the work we were doing. He had been battling cancer for a few years now, and he thanked us for helping to make the SIP just a little bit easier on him. That email brought me to tears, and reminded me why every community effort, not just YAPA Kids, mattered deeply and truly made an impact in people's lives.

I'm just a high schooler. My organization has no budget, little adult support, and we rely solely on the word of mouth to let people know of our existence. If you are interested in helping us help others, or you know someone who might benefit from having just an extra 30 minutes in their lives, please direct them to yapakids.org. I'm not sure if links are automatically removed, but this is a shot in the dark and I hope it works. I wish everyone well during this time, and thank you for reading."
2020-04-28 6:36,Please write about how families of young children are struggling. We have 2 toddlers (not yet 2 and 4) that are not fully school-age or independent. They require full-time care. Not only is their development but their basic needs and safety at risk as we juggle working from home. No doubt people who are unemployed are struggling. I often tell myself that we can’t complain. But we are struggling to hang on to our jobs and at the expense of our children. We are also vastly disadvantaged in being able to keep a job or be perceived as valuable because we simply can’t keep up. This is at a time when  those who are employed are being asked in so many words to work even harder under impossible circumstances. It feels like a losing battle.
2020-04-28 6:55,"I’m home 24/7 with 3 young kids under 12. They cannot go outside. 24/7. If they go anywhere they wear a mask. They are sad, confused, and scared. I do my best to comfort them. They wake up at 6am and need guidance. Until 8pm. I work 10 hour days. Currently in my basement. My company is luckily busy and I have had to work a lot this past month. It is logistically challenging and nothing any of us were prepared to do. I would prefer to “enjoy this time with them....”. But since I have to work we struggle with a lot of the issues in this article. It is about juggling not homeschooling. Homeschoolers planned to homeschool and set up for it. I have a cobbled together classroom with cobbled together learning devices.  This also cannot be compared with another, simpler time. They cannot do anything outside the walls of our home! Oh, right, unless my 7 year old wears her mask.  Can’t we just give people a break? I, for one, don’t mind an article I can relate to. If it does not relate to you, just skip it. And, yeah, we all get this is a first world problem."
2020-04-28 7:02,"How to make through these trying times?
—
I think that more women need to think about how it was for their forbearers, four to five generations back, who were taught in turn by their own mothers, ""to rule their future households with a rod of flexible iron."" 
--
Not all men need to be administrators. But all women do, without exception. 
--
Like it or not, children need to be told what to do, and then made to do it in no uncertain terms. 
Women who now find themselves trapped with their little ones at home need to practice, ""the law of kindness,"" as if the kitchen, living and dining rooms were a combined court room, with ""Mother,"" playing the role of judge, jury, prosecution and defense, all at the same time!
And how do I know? Because that's the way my Mother raised my brother and I. And that's the way I assume her mother [my grandmother] raised her. 
And it worked. 
How well did it work? Well enough for my brother and I to make it through school, hold down various jobs, and stay married, just like our parents did. 
And by the way, that's the real gold standard, for getting through life."
2020-04-28 7:09,"Teachers KNOW that parents (and kids) cannot be expected to do all this, and they don't expect it.  At least all the teachers I know are fully aware of it.  They sympathize deeply with all the parties involved.   Teachers are mourning the lost months, anxious to get back to the classroom, and missing their students.  Parents, just do what you can, and don't feel guilty.  Your job is to get your family through this stressful time intact.

Teaching is a hard job requiring specific skills.  So is parenting."
2020-04-28 7:12,"I am no expert on child development.  However, as someone who went to one of the worst schools in the country and is now an engineering professor at a good institution (with colleagues who also tend to have nontraditional educational backgrounds), I can testify that your kid is going to be fine. 

There were three girls left in class by the time I was 17.  The others had all become pregnant and left.  There were so few kids that I had to take physics and a few other classes by mail (the internet connection was too poor for online learning).  My mother was busy working, my father was an alcoholic who didn't work for 35 years and whose only contribution was, ""if you don't get your work done, you'll end up like me.""  And I spent most of my time painting with my best friend, working for money, reading for fun, playing sports, volunteering, and then cramming for tests at the last minute.

It all worked out just fine.  Yes, I had to work hard in college to catch up where I had missed out on systematically learning certain math material.  However, I had learned so much other stuff that I was far ahead of other students in other areas. 

I have found myself talking down a freaked-out caregiver via Zoom nearly every day of the lockdown.  I mean this supportively.  People really just need to relax.  Your kids will be fine.  Send them off with a screen or a book or a ball or box or whatever.  Do whatever needs to be done to get through this period."
2020-04-28 7:26,"I just finished reading the article about whose Zoom meeting gets 'bumped' when the wifi is overloaded. And then there is the cleanliness of the house while working, parenting, homeschooling, teaching remotely (mostly female) and other duties which ensure the universe continues to function.

Please note that whenever life returns to mostly normal, women will be demanding a whole lot more equivalent to what we have already earned and deserve, in tangible measurements first. 

Every single parent interviewed for this article is female. 

Most of the teachers in this country are women."
2020-04-28 7:29,"Thanks for the article, I was wondering how schooling at home was working out for parents. Given the abrupt transition, I wonder if continuing the current school year through the summer would be necessary.

2020-04-27 23:26,"My husband and I are both retired, college educated, former teachers, living in Florida.  We help our 7 year old (2nd grade) granddaughter with her school assignments while both parents work from home at high intensity jobs.  She lives in NYC, so we help her via technology.  She is a smart, organized, willing student who is remarkably adept at technology.  In short, her situation is an ideal scenario for homeschooling to succeed.  

BUT, our experience is that there are WAY too many assignments and they are geared WAY above a second grade level.  The philosophy seems to be that if six assignments are a good number to assign, twelve assignments are twice as good.  We are happy to take the time to explain concepts, and answer questions, but the pressure of so many assignments creates anxiety and kills love of learning.  By 3:00 in the afternoon, she is sometimes lying in bed with the covers over her head, crying, knowing that she has been working all day and is maybe half done.  

As a teacher for more than 30 years, I was sometimes asked to help new teachers to improve.  My advice to them, and to all the (no doubt) well-meaning teachers assigning work for home-schooling is to take whatever amount of work you are inclined to assign, and cut it in half.  The key is quality, not quantity.  Your motto should be, like doctors, first do no harm."
2020-04-28 1:14,"I teach HS English in NYC. I have 168 students. I wake up at 5:30 am every day to work for 3 hours before having to sit with my son, a kindergartner, through 4 or 5 Zoom classes and then try to engage him while my wife works. She’ll take over in the afternoon so I can work more. She works after dinner again. 

 I have online meetings, office hours, synchronous classes to teach, grading, planning and outreach every day. My good friend died five weeks ago. It’s been a long spring.

My son has a lot of tantrums. My son is scared. My students are scared. I’m strong enough to carry them through but man am I tired. I’d love to get out of 650 sq ft apartment sometime soon but that isn’t happening. 

I’m getting through it with gratitude. I have so much and am so fortunate. That’s my focus. I’m with my family and we are ok. That’s what is important."
2020-04-27 23:09,"As a teacher, I laughed when I read about the child pretending the erasure was soap and his father struggling to get him to do anything. Welcome to our world. Did he believe his child’s teachers when they said his child needed help in settling down and had trouble getting work done. Or did he insist that it must be because his child wasn’t being challenged appropriately? I have enormous empathy for parents trying to support their children’s education while working. I’m grateful everyday my children are adults. But if you hear some schadenfreude in my tone, you wouldn’t be far off. It’s been a huge lift to translate curriculum from a dynamic interpersonal practice to a two dimensional platform. Yet parents at my school share critiques of lessons with each other and then with administration. Reactive, panicked decisions ensue. It’s exhausting and it’s not sustainable."
2020-04-28 7:51,"Being a teacher is like being a healthcare professional -- as much as you deeply care for the people you're responsible for, you can only survive if you can find a way to maintain some degree of detachment. When the parent becomes the schoolteacher, this detachment simply isn't possible. And it doesn't stop with young kids or academic subjects -- many teenagers can tell you how stressful it is trying to learn to drive from their parents (especially if they're learning to drive a manual transmission). 

Our team is working from home. One of my colleagues has three young kids, one with significant learning disabilities. Both she and her husband have stressful jobs. IMO, every day that they get through with their sanity intact is a miracle. My wfh experience is a holiday in comparison -- rolling out of bed at 8 am, a leisurely coffee on our terrace, a few moments of quiet conversation with my husband, then easing into work, knowing that when the day's tasks are done, the evening will offer no greater challenge than deciding what to eat for dinner and whether to read or watch TV afterwards. IMO, working parents who are also home-schooling their kids are candidates for sainthood. (God bless contraception!)"
2020-04-28 7:59,"Some of my family members are really big on homeschooling, for political reasons primarily. They believe that a parent with no training is better than a professional educator. However, they were unable to ""handle"" their two children, so sent them off to public school. Now the teachers have to handle these little darlings, who were too hard for their parents to handle, along with 26 other little darlings."
2020-04-28 8:05,"What is the purpose of school these days?

As with many aspects of our lives, the coronavirus is forcing us to re-examine what we value and how we’re spending our time. 

Seems as if half of formal education is an absurdity dressed up as academic rigor."
2020-04-28 8:12,"My hat goes off to the teachers and administrators of the education system that stepped up without warning and completely restructured the gargantuan task of general education in a matter of weeks.

I have no doubt that the 'system' will need to be tweeked and adapted in the coming weeks as we discover what works best; in fact, I am fairly certain that the process of tweeking and adapting has been ongoing from mid-March. 

Kudos, educators! And kudos, parents! Here's hoping both groups communicate their challenges and suggestions effectively."
2020-04-28 8:25,"Interestingly, the article highlights many parents who are overwhelmed and talk about it openly, and the parent who has a handle on guiding their daughters says little, I imagine because there isn’t much to say to them; they’ve raised them to do the work. I think this imbalance skews the perception of what home schooling looks like; it is not always unreasonable. 

Parenting and teaching are absolutely not the same thing, and I agree that parents are not aptly prepared and allotted enough time and energy to fill in without accommodations for the circumstances. Successful parenting comes from many of the same strategies as teaching: routines, clear expectations, and consequences both imposed and natural. Parents of older kids who are successful remotely have been working for years to create those students by parenting effectively. 

I am confused about where parents all of a sudden started treating teachers as professionals. I am a seventh grade teacher and parents never seemed to have a problem before about what degree of difficulty for me to teach, how to grade work fairly for their child’s special or not so special needs, like lack of effort, and discipline. When I read comments about how teachers are professionals and parents are not, I welcome the sentiment but I am nonetheless surprised. 

I certainly agree that strict requirements for students makes parents teaching seamlessly unfairly charged. I agree that we all need to chill out—teachers, parents, and administrator."
2020-04-28 8:31,For all the parents who feel inadequate or who are being judged. I couldn't do it and I don't judge you. I would try of course and feel like I'm not doing it right and there would be fights and tears and then I would reassess and probably do my own thing with my kid during this particular time. My child's mental and emotional health as well as my own would be the most important thing to me right now.
2020-04-28 8:37,So how about downloading a stack of books the kids choose and just letting them read for a few months?
2020-04-28 8:39,"Online learning is difficult, I have been on both sides, as a teacher and a student, and it becomes very clear that human interaction is terribly important. But parenting is different than teaching. I was a teacher and still had homework struggles - until I set up a Homework Club with neighboring children. Suddenly, I was Teacher and not the Parent. I feel for students who no longer have their teachers and fellow students, who are suddenly stuck in their homes with stressed parents and probably trying not to be scared. My advice is to do what you can and let go of the rest. Will your children be behind? Yes, so will everyone else."
2020-04-28 8:39,"Children busying is  difficult when parents have to work at home too. In the first exeample, the family seems to live in a whealthy district in a beautiful flat. But, we can't imagine the problem which is lifted when these families come from disadventaged districts. Even if the teacher sends by email the homeworks, some parents haven't gone to school enough to look after efficiently their children."
2020-04-28 8:41,"I see two problems.

The first is the Common Core curriculum. It is a disaster. I have assisted my nieces and nephew with their math homework finding that it is sometimes impossible to even comprehend because the methods are insane.￼￼ And I have three degrees. 

The second problem is a societal one. Our capitalistic society has squeezed the margins such that both parents are required to work. This isn’t helping. The absence of active parenting replaced by day-care centers and after-school programs is sad. Children, at their most vulnerable time in life, are not getting what they need. The stress for parents is having negative consequences on themselves, their marriages, and their children. 

There will be many lessons learned from this pandemic. We are already talking about how to restructure. I hope these two topics are included in the conversation.￼"
2020-04-28 8:46,"I understand that it’s logistically hard on parents to juggle this school/work balance, but can someone discuss the mental health aspect of the pandemic, parent stress, and online school on young kids. Nobody is talking about the elephant in the room - how these kids are emotionally dealing with the stress of this isolation. I think it’s manifesting itself through defiance of school work and schools are going to have a lot more to deal with come fall, then grade equivalence."
2020-04-28 8:55,"The parents who are having a hard time with their kids at home are likely also the ones who have not disciplined their kids before and have raised children who think they can interrupt adults whenever they want or choose to not listen to instructions.

I went through a very tough time with my own kids.  My older one was defiant, collicky, disrespectful and a complete handful... Until I read a book by John Rosemond and learned about the 4 hour time out.  I put my completely unwieldly and uncontrollable 2 1/2 yr old on a 4 hr time out and he came out of that punishment like a perfectly trained robot.  Up to that point, NOTHING worked.  He would literally slap me in the face and laugh at me.  Spanking did NOTHING.  5 minute time outs.  What a joke.  A 4 hour time out?  Making a 2 1/2 yr old sit in a room with no toys or anything to do?  Magical!  Thank you again Mr. Rosemond for the most awesome parenting advice ever.

After I figured out how not to be ruled by my own kids, parenting became so much easier.  Now, my kids are older - 13 and 16.  Thankfully they grew up to be very respectful teenagers who do as they're told.  It has actually been really nice to be able to hang out with my children more than ever as I know they will not want to hang out with parents for much longer."
2020-04-28 8:55,"We are managing the situation better than most. Our 16 year old son is comfortable with technology and has experience using online tutors and classes. He has been the the only teen to show up for his online English class, his teacher had to combine classes to start a discussion. He has two long term Wyzant tutors to help him with Writing and Algebra. He is wrapping up an online BYU high school class. His biggest compliant is the lack of school work. Our biggest compliant is confusion about where to upload his art assignments. We've had to reach out to two of his teachers to figure out the source of the confusion. At least the school district realizes the kids are distracted and are switching to pass/fail grading for last quarter of the school year. I recall my UCSC experience during the 1989 earthquake and how 1/3 of the student body ended on on academic probation. I think this pandemic may have similar effect on the student population."
2020-04-28 8:57,"'Homeschooling' shouldn't be starting at 8:00 am and taking all day until 4 in the afternoon. If that's the case the work load needs to be modified! Don't judge homeschool based on this experience either. What's happening in many cases is not typical of what occurs in homeschooling. School at home shouldn't resemble school at school. The teachers and everyone else are doing their best but if your kids day is starting at 8-ish and ending at 4-ish, that's definite overkill!"
2020-04-28 9:44,"I really appreciate this article and everyone sharing because it makes me feel less alone in the struggle to KEEP ON.  I manage large multi family dwellings in the NY metro area.  My job is no picnic during ordinary times much less now.  I have a disabled parent about to start treatment for a new cancer.  I have a beautiful 11 year old with special needs.  Supporting and being a part of my child's life and activities as well as my parents is not new to me.  It is much tougher trying to bring a sense of balance now.  Keeping up with school assignments, printing, uploading and and spying in google classroom to see if the assignments really are complete.  Dealing with Zoom and Google Meets, my building residents, boards, employees and colleagues coming down with COVID, waiting 40 minutes to get into the grocery store, organizing doctors visits, doing laundry...Then there's having breakfast REGULARLY with my husband (he makes killer pancakes;).  Having a run super early in the morning (with mask).  Secret missions to the woods with my kid when there is a chance.  These are the things that have brought relief to me."
2020-04-28 9:57,"Not for nothing, but that lead picture tells the truest story. If that mother thinks she is going to get her work, or her childrens work done, while she and children are heaped on a futon/bed...she might as well not even try. Even in a small space, there neds to be proper work space. Totes filled with clothes, or toys, and a board making a college dorm like desk, is preferable over that dog pile situation pictured. there's also a thing called discipline. If in this crisis, parents are trying to be the disciplinarians they never were, expect failure. The older generations know, home is also a place for regimes and discipline. not a romping free for all, where the kids run wild."
2020-04-28 9:57,"Take a deep breath. There will be a way to catch up with core learning in math, science, and reading. High school has the least time to do this but the age of the kids helps if a tutor or cram course is the way to achieve catch up or refresher. I know, money, time, and motivation are hurdles.  The last two are on your kid to resolve. The best advice is to make it interesting so they love learning, and that may include how to plumbing youtubes."
2020-04-28 9:58,"As a chemistry teacher in Orange County, I have to say that I have been so grateful for the support the parents have been giving their children and myself.  I post daily tutorial videos, they got all of the materials they needed to finish the year before this all happened.  Students take online quizzes for assessment.  We have three hour-long office hour Google Meet sessions per week.  The students are, for the most part, keeping up with what we are doing.  It's not ideal by any measure but I am gratified with how well even my more challenging students have taken to this new normal.  

That being said, I can't wait to take this show back into the classroom as soon as it is possible to safely do so.  Kids and teachers come to school sick, it's a crowded environment that allows infections to spread rapidly through the population.  If one student has a parent at home who is sick, the illness will quickly explode through the building.  Covid would ravage a school, teachers would drop like flies as would the subs that came in for them.  We can't even get textbooks, I don't imagine that PPE will be forthcoming outside what we bring ourselves from home.  Especially now that school budgets will be slashed in the wake of this.  We need to lock this down until the danger has passed."
2020-04-28 10:02,"First and foremost K.G and 1st graders don’t need any online classes. Heavens are not going to fall if they play at home for this calendar year. This computer dumping on small children is more than crazy.

Educated parents must find time to play and teach their children to the extent possible. Any excuses won’t help. We have all done it and so has to be the present generation. I can only sympathise with the frontline workers considering the present crisis and simply not others.

There were no computers in India when I did my undergraduate course in Engineering. Now even K.G students are compelled to learn computers, outrageous to say the least."
2020-04-28 10:03,"My mother worked full-time as a teacher while raising 4 kids. Of course she never home-schooled us (and we had no internet), but here was one of her great techniques: she'd put the older kids in charge of the younger ones. When my 2-year old brother needed potty training, she assigned me, an 8-year old, to do it. When a younger sister needed help with phonics, again I got the job. Making it into a group effort helps to ease the burden on everyone, including mom and dad."

2020-04-28 10:22,"Stressed out parents, trying to teach and work at the same time, will no doubt welcome this article sympathetic to them. 

But the anecdotes described here seem to be of households where parents have abrogated, long ago,  their authority to guide and discipline their children. 

This laziness of discipline is evident in all spheres of life.  Just observe (from before the lockdown) parent/child  interactions at parks, grocery stores,  any public place -- kids rarely listen to their parents. They run around,  screaming and fighting, and don't  turn their heads when parents call. 

Parents have fallen out of the habit of reading to their children at night, let alone helping them with their homework.  

Parents, after a workday,  don't feel like giving these kids they so eagerly wanted the time it takes to rear them, instill good habits, do homework, be affectionate, even though that's the parent job description. 

Don't have kids if you can't raise them properly."
2020-04-28 10:24,"Few of My issues/ concerns with Home Schooling during the closure :

1- The Teachers inundate my kids with work on Monday and ghost them till Friday and then more emails 

2- The technology our  school and I’m sure many others utilize with numerous platforms is cumbersome and antiquated.

3- The space for people that have small homes and multiple students / parents working from home is not always an appropriate learning environment .

4- Some children do not thrive with a web based learn on your own with little to no assistance from The teachers . 

5- I am employed full time and wasn’t looking for being a full time educational teacher to my kids . Back to school can’t come soon enough - it’s Provide’s structure , social sustenance , and the ability for kids to get first hand -real time teaching the way it should be !!"
2020-04-28 10:36,"It is undeniably hard for parents to try to teach their own kids, manage the education and their own jobs.

It is also pretty hard to go to work in an essential job, and try to find day care when all the centers closed because of reduced demand - they don't have the cash to stay afloat.

And it is pretty hard to educate your own child when you cannot work in an essential job and have been laid off, waiting for a check form the government and wondering if the food bank ran dry. How do you put aside panic?

It is just hard, for everybody but a few lucky people. The bottom line is that plague is nasty, brutal and not short. Do the best you can and forgive people for only doing the best they can as well."
2020-04-28 10:38,"For years parents were the primary teachers for their own children and worked. 
Accounts are in journals of early colonial farm life. In an American literature course I read an account of a father & 2 sons pulling massive rocks and tree stumps from a field to farm. The rocks were moved (mule, donkey?) helping to build a chimney- sons were in charge of that part. I don’t remember the writer or many other details, but I was shocked at his sons ages - 4 and 7 or 8. 
BUT, working and living life was part of the education. Please, don’t give your kids busy work, give them real tasks that can actually contribute to your lives RIGHT NOW! Let them know you need their help as a family and are depending on them. It can be dusting, putting laundry away(put pictures on drawers/shelves where things belong- Montessori style) toddlers can do this. 
Following directions on a baking mix, pudding or microwave box,they get math and “chemistry” lessons with observable outcomes. Older kids can follow recipes.  Try homemade individual pizzas. 
I’m retired, but have done pizza’s with a kindergarten class of 35. Our lesson integrated all subjects that day. We(teacher & aide)mixed the dough (measurement, directions). Each child got dough to shape when it had risen. They put on sauce, chose toppings and assembled their own, baked in the cafeteria. As a class we wrote down what we did, read a picture book on fractions, cut pizzas into fractions and enjoyed.Kids need work to feel necessary. Let them!"

While it is understandable that children want to play with their parents, ""help"" them when they are working at no matter what,  children at the age of that girl who is sitting on her mother must be given some kind of easy tasks, such as reading or perhaps drawing. If the mother is reading the tasks school has set for her children, they can participate and already fetch their books and writing materials."
2020-04-28 5:47,The best we can hope for is that parents and kids pretend to do the work and teachers pretend to evaluate it. Admins can pretend everything is going great and keep cutting checks.

2020-04-28 9:32,"This is a very sad article, indicative of the breakdown of American families and interpersonal relationships, as well as the selfishness and alienation inherent to technoindustrial society.
Only a few generations ago, moms and dads and their kids went out by themselves into the wilderness and created homesteads and survival by working and living together with only each other for company.
The family was a team, a tribe, a working unit. Love, respect, responsibility, sacrifice and interdependence were the norms. 
Those pioneer families didn't have the copious luxuries of today's consumer capitalism. They had no diversions, theme parks, binge television, internal combustion engines, or public schools.
They only had each other, and it worked.
In contrast, some parents today complain bitterly when they have to stay home with and educate their own children.
As Pulitzer Prize-winning former NYT war correspondent Chris Hedges keeps warning us, we are now a nation of anomie and alienation, incapable of even the most basic human connections, spoiled by the excesses of capitalism, strangers in a strange land, unable to bond happily even with our own family members."

2020-04-28 7:06,"Note how many more mothers you interviewed than fathers.  Woman are bearing the burden of the lockdown much more than men.  Teaching is a profession.  It is impossible to do it well without specific training, which most parents lack.  But it is also impossible to be a good teacher and do a full-time job.  And as a teacher I can also report that anyone who thinks that on-line learning is a substitute for a classroom experience is absolutely daft!  So even mothers with the money and space to have enough computers and space to consider doing this properly are all but killing themselves trying to educate their children, which can't be done, and hold down their own jobs, which in many cases also can't really be done from home."

1) That all sounds like a luxury problem some of these parents are having. Think about the parents who don't have the technology for their kids to continue their education. 
2) Think about the parents who are in the service industry and are considered ""essential workers"" and must go to their 8-hour shift daily. Don't they wish they had the time & the technology to help out their kids at home?

Although face to face feedback( with teachers and classmates) is highly desirable, it is not impossible to learn under these challenging circumstances. My students who are disciplined and have initiative are managing (bless them) yet I can say that they showed the characteristics of an independent mindset before the lockdown. it may be true that ""parental engagement has long been seen as critical to student achievement, as much as class size, curriculum and teacher quality"", it is this self initiative we need to understand, teach and foster."
2020-04-28 10:48,"Lordy I am lucky. My kid’s school here in VT, and his teacher, are simply extraordinary. He logs in at 8am & is with his pals &teacher on screen until 12:30, with some small breaks. I can work in those hours if I am good & my sleep is not all topsy-turvy. Then we take a hike out our door and he has a hours of homework (including music, art & French) while I can work some more. After he goes to sleep, I can hopefully work some more. Not to say this is easy, just the 2 of us, but, certainly, up here, with the right school, & with my kid having a routine where he is both socializing (School hours & throughout the day, on line that is)  & learning, most of our days are good days. Yes, it is the woods out the door too, that is key. Vermont is what keeps me sane, always, always, but especially now. It is all far from perfect in these pandemic times but we find harmony, and my kid is learning, a fair amount at that."

1. A 3 minute max video (w.g. on solving a one-step equation).

2, online practice problems

3. short quiz

4. I am available on Zoom live from 9 am to at least 2 pm and by individual student request to teach the lesson, remediate one on one, do the practice with the students etc. 

Most of my colleagues do the same. All students have devices, either from school or their own. I expect no parent to explain the lesson or help their student. However, it would be nice if parents could enforce a schedule. 

The students who are disengaged now are the ones that were disengaged before, whatever the reason. The ones who have trouble making themselves sit down, start and complete assignments are the ones who were lacking that self-discipline before. And these students are not necessarily my academically struggling students."

Not babysitting, not watching, teaching math.

2020-04-28 11:06,"The stresses here seem to stem from attempting to create school at home (very different than home schooling) while simultaneously creating work at home that mimics work at the office. Working 9 to 5 at home IS incompatible with schooling children (as if they are still in a classroom) during the same hours. I can't even contemplate what those working parents who are working in essential jobs outside the home must face. Who says work/school during a pandemic must be done in the same way (but now from home) as done institutionally? That's the unsustainable paradigm. The neatly divided work/school/home life balance has been upended. And anyone will tell you none of that was in balance pre-pandemic and lock down either. We live in interesting times. Will we ""go back"" to the former status quo or will something new develop? That's the question."

I let him explore, test and takes some risks under a watchful eye. I am usually able to hand him off to others when I get fatigued. Raising children is the hardest job. Most folks gladly leave it to others, schools and teachers, and go to their easier jobs. Glad the Times had courage to explode the virtual classroom myths."

If parents learn that their children’s teachers are amazing human beings who should be paid more and respected and valued, that is a wonderful thing. If parents learn that many of them have raised their children  — while being physically present in the room, but talking with someone else on their cell phones — well, here’s the time of self learning. The apple never falls far from the tree. Here’s the thing. This is a terribly stressful time in which the cracks in our social order are being exposed. The take away is going to be what the kids learned from their parents’ behavior, how the parents managed their own fear and stress, what was actually important..."
2020-04-28 11:20,"Whatever we're doing right now, it's not school. There are no other kids, no facilities, no trained professionals running the show.   The first week of this madness, I tired to set up ""lessons"" for my 6-and 4-year-old with the intention of replicating the school day as closely as possible. They had absolutely no intention of listening to me in the role of teacher. 

So I eased way up. We're generally not doing anything that the school sends our way, as much as I appreciate our incredible teachers' efforts to provide resources. We just can't do it. 

What we ARE doing is letting our kids play. On a good day, they will go for hours and hours into a complex world of their imagining. When they want a break, I read to them. I've found that stepping back, letting them use their own minds and giving them the freedom to create their own world is the very best we can do. 

I don't think that hooking them up to a laptop and having them go through various measurable exercises is learning. It might LOOK like learning, but it's sedentary, it's not challenging, and it means they're on my computer, which turns them into monsters and which I need for work!

If I'm failing and being a bad parent here, I accept that. This is the choice we've made to keep our family in tact. But it sure is great to see them so absorbed in their own independent, imaginative play."
2020-04-28 11:30,"Due to a lack of academic rigor in my area, my husband and I made the decision to home-school years ago. I work from home. Some days are great and some days are difficult, but it is possible, and the bad days should not make a parent feel like a failure. Most of my friends from high school went on to become educators, and guess what? They have bad days too. Given time for adjustment and patience, it is 100% possible to work from home and also home-school. It seems to me that a lot of the current difficulty is from trying to have the educators teach remotely while the parents referee, which is a recipe for disaster. Lessons posted online/provided in printed formats so that children could complete them at the time(s) of day most appropriate for their families would probably be much more conducive to success than having to login to virtual classes at specified times. Flexibility on class times for the working parent is crucial."
2020-04-28 11:30,"On the bright side:
1. It is good that teachers are still employed. 
2. It is good that the shortcomings of distance education are finally on full display.  

Distance education always expensive and always discriminated against the poor.  Now professionals with good incomes who moonlight as parents are also beginning to feel the burn.  This is good. 

Yes, there are some kids who do well in distance education, but these are the kids who would have figured out how to learn on their own...the kids who learn in spite of the educational system, not because of it.  

Maybe some of those administrators who were always trying to talk me into giving up the noble and amazingly versatile piece of chalk for the ""smart classroom"" are finally seeing how insane distance education was from day one.

My children, 5th grade elementary & middle school left school on a Friday and the state made the decision to not return over the weekend. We started e-learning on Tuesday. It took maybe 48 hours to completely retool the way we school.

My children have adapted remarkably. They complete most things by themselves. We did have a anxious day where 6th grader thought part of math was optional and then needed to do a month’s worth of small problems all in a day...but it was a lesson in managing work. It’s a lesson in managing work when I follow up and ask, “Did you see Your teacher’s email about this?” And we find in in email instead of the Google Classroom app.

For every inconvenience about working from home (I work here, husband is essential, but here sometimes) while my students learn/work from home, there is an important lesson in organization & time management & problem solving. 

So grateful for a school district who is innovative, teachers who are caring and adaptable. Thank you educators everywhere!"

I don't see how it's doable and my hat is off to those who manage to accomplish any part of either.  My heart goes out to them as well because there is so much self-blame going on and that helps no one.  The general anxiety related to fear of illness, to paying the bills, to managing a household and also making sure one's children do their homework?  Impossible."
2020-04-28 11:34,Ditto ditto ditto for me. In our one bedroom apartment there’s no separate space for anything. My 9th grader does her assignments curled under the duvet in bed. I’m working from home—sitting on the couch where I also sleep. She cherry picks assignments. I know she hasn’t done any geometry since school closed. Early on I tried harder to impose a routine. Ditto for the arguments and tears. With the likelihood that there’ll be no return to school before September there’s also the temptation to give up caring about school and move on. The youth employment program is cancelled. The coming months—the spring and summer she turns from 14 into 15–are going to be challenging. I’m forced to be present at home now. But once I have to move back to my office all oversight will be gone.
2020-04-28 11:34,"Families are struggling with distance learning for many reasons. To all those moms out there I would say...give it up. That does not mean you give your children unlimited screen time. Take 15 minutes out of every hour of work to give your children your attention. If Dad is home, he should take every other hour. Play at any age can be educational as long it is age appropriate. Read to them or have them read to you. Talk about the story, have your kids draw a picture of their favorite part. Jigsaw puzzles build math spatial awareness, marbles/blocks/buttons can be used make patterns. Ask your child to teach you a math algorithm,  make up problems for each other. If you have access to the outdoors, examine emerging nature, look for bugs to identify, read about what you see on the internet. Sing and dance together. This is your learning but your kids know it is play."

The teacher was very patient but you could also hear the frustration in her voice. Everyone was trying to talk over each and trying to argue over answers just like kids do. I then heard my grandson yell, ""hang on, I'll be right back, I have an important package that was just dropped off by Amazon."" He ran to the front door and got his pkg and ran back to the kitchen table. By that time his father came in the room and disciplined him. I then heard someone scream and it appeared one of the students little siblings bit him while he was online. I think everyone should take a deep breath and remember we are dealing with kid's and normal life and a very abnormal situation. And God bless the teachers."

The quality and quantity of work laid out for these children is subpar. We have NOT been given adequate time or effort from these teachers, we have been left in the wind to twist......

And they wonder why they have no bargaining power with wages....

2020-04-28 11:43,"My son is 6 and in first grade. He spends the whole day on his district-provides laptop. He’s a couple grade levels ahead academically and doing fine there. But he’s way behind socially and emotionally, and in his speech. His speech has regressed quite a bit, which I hadn’t even anticipated when this started. I can relate to parents worried about their kids falling behind academically; it’s hard for me to imagine that this won’t have a lasting impact on his social functioning."
2020-04-28 11:46,"Reading this and the comments, sounds as if states need to either limit schooling, or call it a year. Chances are it will not matter in the long run. But killing love of learning? Creating incredible stress? That might last a long time."
2020-04-28 11:47,"I'm sorry, but most schools aren't doing enough to help. What's the point here exactly? To maintain what students have learned? To actually learn? I've checked in with friends of young children nationwide (who don't learn well on screens), and many teachers are just sending assignments with directions but not actual INSTRUCTION nor tips on how parents can teach / support actual learning. 

My son's teachers (kindergarten) haven't even set up a Zoom meeting. He's got two classroom teachers plus specialists (media, art, music) who are funded by Title I. Apparently they're on vacation, while I'm teaching him boring worksheets and sticking him in front of a screen of strangers running him through assignments from 8-1 and then working myself 2p-2a.

Most of my family members are teachers so I say this with a heavy heart - but frankly, a lot of administrators and teachers just aren't adapting/putting in the work. My sister-in-law's school in Hong Kong, meanwhile, had entire online coursework and actual lessons taught by the school's actual teachers (not some YouTube video) within 2 days of their closure. American educators have got to meet parents where they're at, and they've got to step up. Especially if this continues into the fall."
2020-04-28 11:48,"It is the responsibility of parents to ensure their kids are properly educated not the responsibility of the schools.  Time parents realize that.  I feel sorry for the kids whose parents do not realize that and do not make it a priority (yes despite their own work it has to be a priority).  The help you receive from teachers is a gift and should be appreciated but the ultimate responsibility for what a student learns is on the parents.   Adults working from home do have a luxury that many other do not have, and they can accomplish their work while making sure their kids keep up with their education.  If there are two parents, they can take turns supervising their kids while one focuses on work.   Obviously it is more difficult for single parents.  Parents may have to adjust their schedules, sacrifice an hour of sleep, watch less tv, spend less time complaining about their lack of time on NYT comment section and forge ahead.  The examples they set during this unique time will imprint an impression on their children that lasts longer than the pandemic.  Is education important or not.  There are those with more resources than some, however, there are those who make the most of the resources they have."
2020-04-28 11:48,"The fact that parents can't 'cope' w/their children has ALWAYS been confounding to me. I tend to think it's only an extension of how humans in general are bad at coping w/each other -- which is to say, seized at the idea of establishing clear, enforced boundaries in their general world, on a non-crisis basis. 

They're kids. MAKE them obey. Period."
2020-04-28 11:49,"I have two elementary-aged kids and I agree that this online school is not working. My 3rd grade daughter is given what amounts to busy work but with the stress of receiving a grade. There is no instruction accompanying the work. I am expected to do that I suppose. My 5th grade son gets approximately two hours of instruction over Zoom; however, most of those two hours is filled with technical glitches from the various students. I end up doing the teaching. I am extremely fortunate to be able to work from home during this time, but it is hard to teach my kids when my boss is asking me for results and in between conference calls. If there was no school whatsoever, I could have the kids read a book or watch a documentary but they have a ton of ineffective, busy work from their teachers that they learn very little and waste significant amounts of time."
2020-04-28 11:50,"Frankly, the solution is to make up the time. Bring them back a month early, run the schools a month longer, add an hour of instruction time, eliminate the long weekends, teacher conferences etc. But we won’t do any of that, the teachers unions would object to the most common sense solution. Another option is for the vast majority to redo the school year. If half or more are redoing the year, there will not be a social stigma attached."

2020-04-28 12:02,Wow. Parents have to actually raise their kids. Maybe there will be a new found appreciation for what teachers do and evaluate the salaries teachers receive. Time for a handbook for parents who are thinking of having (7) kids.
2020-04-28 11:55,"Just when parents are finding out that teaching is not at all the easy job they thought it was, the school systems are running out of money.  Next time your local teachers strike for higher wages, I hope all you home schooling parents back them up."

2020-04-28 11:55,Let’s see if teachers are as appreciated as they should be once this is over.
2020-04-28 11:48,"As if families didn’t have enough to worry about!  Last week the Times published an alarming piece about the devastating loss of learning that will accompany school closures hyperbolically titled, “The Coronavirus’s Lost Generation of Students.” 
 
Schools are ramping up online learning and redesigning curricula for virtual instruction.   As a former head of school I receive jargon-filled email promotions offering “state of the art” courses to keep developing those young brains.   Many parents, having no other sources of information, are engaging in daily battles of the wills with their children.   In the most extreme manifestations, the anxiety is expressed as “Children will fall so far behind they’ll never catch up,” or “They’re losing any chance to ever go to college.”   This language is used when describing elementary school kids!
 
It’s nonsense.
 
The original research that coined the phrase “summer slide” has been debunked.   The studies, from decades ago, were structurally flawed and poorly executed.  Retention of skill drops off several weeks after ""instruction"" stops.  But after the initial “forgetting,” the level of knowledge or skill doesn't drop off much more after 6 months or a year.   Knowledge and skill ""ramp up"" rapidly when the learning is restarted, regardless of the length of the hiatus.   From a cognitive point of view, a six-month hiatus from school matters little more than a two-week winter break.

School should be the least of a family's worries."
2020-04-28 12:01,Most of it is the the fact that their free daycare system is closed and they are forced to be with the children they sired. Reasonable people adapt and enjoy the extra time they get to spend with their children and the rest can’t wait to push them back into the system knowing it is mediocre at best.
2020-04-28 11:41,"Hey teachers might get a little respect after this. You have your 1 to 3 children to teach, engage, challenge, and assess. We have 20 to 30!!!"
2020-04-28 12:02,"As an educator of 38 years I have noticed that fewer and fewer middle school and high school students have the resilience to persevere whenever their comfort zone is disrupted. Not surprisingly, I see the same qualities lacking in many of their parents. But East Asian families seldom exhibit these traits because they tend to delay personal gratification and demonstrate more self-discipline. The pandemic is merely exposing cracks in the recent generational wall."
2020-04-28 12:02,"I feel for parents of young kids. I would have locked myself in the bathroom on day 2 and not come out. Parenting young kids is hard enough when school is in session. So thankful that my kids are teenagers, that school is pass-fail, and that I never was helicopter parent. Being a slacker mom is coming in handy right now. And way to go Sarah Parcak! With you all the way."
2020-04-28 11:57,Homeschooling works how?
2020-04-28 12:05,"In the 1950s, my parents took our six week vacations to Florida. My teachers assigned me work to do while away from school. My folks, born in 1906, only had an elementary school education. I was on my own. I struggled when my math chapters introduced the compass,  protractor and quadratic equations. But in the process, I learned to be an autodidact and that has helped me all my life. Of course, as a student I knew that I was privileged to be studying under palm trees and wouldn’t trade that for the world."
2020-04-28 12:07,"NYS Ed and the local ed boards (as all across US) have substantial annual tax based allocations but to read about the parents who get inadequate teacher support, dont have the digital devices and have no admin support for an emergency makes no sense at all.  Pandemic has shed lights on the range of incompetencies in our society ... education high on that long, long list, just behind income security and health care"
2020-04-28 12:07,"OK, parents, so when do we send the kids back to regular classrooms?  Next week, next month, next September, or next year?

Can we shuffle 200 kids, through 10 classrooms, and interacting with perhaps 20 adults over a six-hour period daily?  Resume team sports and group assemblies?  The kids themselves may be at little risk.  As in the case of the polio virus in the early 1950s, 95% of those infected showed no symptoms at all, yet transmit the virus.  Older people are less resilient.  Will thoughts and prayers suffice for the 2%+ that don't survive or the perhaps 10% quotient that require weeks to recover maybe 70% of their former vigor?

It took about four years for the polio vaccine to come in wide use--after it had been discovered.  We still await proof of a COVID-19 virus.   There will surely be stumbles or setbacks, each of them assailed by anti-vaxxers and conspiracy mongers.

Pending firm answers, remote learning may be the optimum mode of operation.   Social distancing inside schools, or to enclose all students and staff in PPE, just doesn't seem feasible.  If kids are unruly on a parent-child basis, pity the plight of a teacher who must handle dozens, or the administrator who dreads lawsuits if anyone gets seriously sick or dies."
2020-04-28 12:07,"The idea that school learning can be somehow replicated to continue at home online is like trying to fit a round peg in a square hole. It can be done, but only when you expand the square hole to include the broader curriculum of life skills, emotional intelligence, play-to-solve games, the arts, etc. It's all right there at our fingertips. Step outside. Ask open-ended ""what if"" questions that have no ""right"" answers"". Listen to music. Cook together. Play games together. Then call it a day and know that you've both learned something. The best education occurs when the teacher and the student experience learning together."
2020-04-28 12:07,Teachers get paid more than  enough. people who want to use the pandemic to set teachers up for more money should volunteer to pay more taxes. I'm all taxed out.
2020-04-28 12:08,"Perhaps this is the end of all this “promise of online learning” nonsense. School and learning are inherently social, and sitting at home alone while staring at Zoom is a pale simulacrum of education that unfortunately requires as much or more work from teachers."
2020-04-28 12:12,"This may get some folks riled up, but why are people who have an apartment in the Bronx having 7 children in this day and age? 

Even if the birth of the kids goes back a decade and a half, how do potential parents not see the problems of the world, especially environmental issues, as serious enough to keep a family level at perhaps 2, three at most? 

Parents must factor in the cost of raising such a large family, as well as living conditions. In all honesty, I find this revelation of a family with 7 children to be outrageous in the context of what the story is about. 

Call me a martinet, but I have zero sympathy for the current problems of the parents with these 7 kids. Overpopulating the planet is partially what got us into the mess in which we find ourselves. 

As for some of the other parents who are whining in this article, get a grip. They should be controlling their children’s behavior, not the other way around. Who’s the boss? Exercise some discipline. Create unbreakable rules. Yes, even yell at the misbehaving child."
2020-04-28 12:14,"This is a wonderful discussion, with so many issues it’s hard to address all of them.  But one thing we could do better in this society is to accord RESPECT to all those involved here.  Teachers, parents and children ALL need to be valued and respected.  

Let’s start with the child.  Long ago (in the 70’s) when I was teaching young children, I came to the conclusion that schools expected obedience, compliance and quiet but was that the best thing or most important thing for a growing child?  I would often tell parents at report card conferences that their exuberant child, might chafe in school, but their energy and independence would serve them well in adulthood.

Expecting schools to be places that replicate the worst sort of factories is not conducive to the psychological wellbeing of anyone!  Not the teacher.  Not the child.  Not the parent.  Give all these groups greater independence.  And RESPECT.

I was fortunate to go back to school myself, studying clinical psychology (after 8 years of teaching young children and raising a young son).  

Create learning environments that foster a sense of community, independence, psychological well-being and social awareness in addition to the basics. Give teachers greater authority over how to conduct their classes.

But right now...

We are in the midst of a very stressful time.  We in society should do everything possible to make this time less stressful.  Trying to replicate a “start-up” with everyone at a computer is crazy!"
2020-04-28 12:17,"1- Online learning doesn't work for all, 2- Online learning is not the best tool for learning compared to regular schools, 3- Schools are not only a place for education but also to grow at all levels, 4- Under the present circumstances, those who have more financial resources will be more successful, 5- Parents need to spend more time with their children (family and children should remain the priority, or simply don't have children), 6- The importance of having access to internet is obvious, for education and any other matter in today's world."
2020-04-28 12:18,"I’m 39 years old. My day starts around 6am when I get up, do some yoga and go for a run. I start work around 8am and finish around 4 working from home.  Our spare bedroom is my office and our dining room is my wife’s. After we finish work we spend time together before we have some individual time. Are days are more boring than before, but they are still fulfilling. At 8pm we clap for the medical professionals and then watch a movie together. Tonight it’s my turn but I know my wife is going to like what I pick. If I didn’t think before that our decision to not have children was the best one we ever made I certainly think that now. Good luck out there."
2020-04-28 12:19,"We are currently stuck in Singapore, on the way to our new life in Italy, the kids are doing home school with a 6-hour time difference by participating at their new school in Italy. They do surprisingly well starting their school days at 3 pm ending around 10 pm every night. The morning offers homework opportunities and time to do some projects. both are 11 years old and I am totally blown away how they handle the situation. We live out of 3 suitcases in emergency accommodation until we can resume our travels. All our furniture is stuck in a Container somewhere in Kuala Lumpur. 
Hang in there, don't pressure the kids too much, and be surprised how much kids can handle."
2020-04-28 12:20,Huh. Now maybe some of those parents who thought that teachers were getting paid too much for “babysitting” their children might have second thoughts about gutting public education funding. But I’m not holding my breath.
2020-04-28 12:22,"First - Now parents are facing the problems that teachers are facing every day -these children illustrated here are clearly lacking in the self discipline that is learned at home. There is much partying around birth announcements but parents are lost when the child arrives. How will they fit them in busy lives? I saw a woman jogging yesterday - two very young children in their stroller watching kid device! Second - there is much knashing of teeth at the loss of instruction time. Children that read and did some of their work will be fine. Did we write times or worry about the children who lost months of school because of hurricanes Katrina and Maria, or the CA fires? No - and nothing was done to help these tens of thousands who lost homes and all their possessions. The kids you write about are fed and parents are working. Please write about the homeless kids in shelters or living 10 to an apartment - not the well heeled lamenting their responsibilities."
2020-04-28 12:24,"Reading all the comments has cemented something I knew anecdotally from talking to my friends with kids in public school, Common Core has a pretty fatal design flaw. It turns out that learning to think is not a steady ascent with the knowledge and content accruing at a steady rate. So just because a second-grader can read, does not mean they are ready write a sentence that explains a proverb. Kids develop in fits and starts. School should be easy in the early grades, content-focused from fourth to eighth grade, and analysis/reasoning focused in high school. Having homeschooled my three very different kids all the way through high school, it is clear that trying to teach a concept to  a kid who is not developmentally ready is fruitless and frustrating. Kudos to all the teachers doing their best out there."
2020-04-28 12:27,"I understand that kids need help working the technology. However, I don't understand why they need their parents step-by-step guidance with completing the work. My parents NEVER helped with homework. Both worked more than 40 hours per week throughout my entire childhood.  It was understood that assignments were my responsibility. If I had questions, it was MY responsibility to get guidance from the teacher. Also, I was expected to help my younger siblings with their work."
2020-04-28 12:28,"I come from a family of teachers and work in a private school (as staff, not faculty). I have two teenage daughters (16 and 18) and the youngest already home/un-schools. I have the highest respect for teachers but much less for the educational system that has evolved in this country. The children will not ""fall behind"" if we end the school year right now. They will simply be where they are. It's a false schedule that is hurting families. Let them play. Get them outside as much as possible. Give them projects to challenge them and immerse themselves in. (How about a garden?) Ask them to design a flying car or a building that produces its own energy. If they are older, ask them to research something they are curious about. You do not have to follow these absurd lesson plans that kill the desire to learn and problem solve. Your kids are right to resist them! Shut off the Zoom (and other screens) and just be. ""Education"" and learning take many forms and happen whenever a child is immersed in something. It doesn't have to be school work."
2020-04-28 12:31,"I have experienced all this 3 months in advance by being in Shanghai.  First was E-Learning, kids were given materials to learn themselves.   My 11 year old daughter did happily with her study pal for one day and then quit as it is hard.   After 3 weeks, the school started online classes with Zoom or MS teams.  I saw her with computer and a phone in front of here and flipping through screens.   I thought she was learning until one day her school teacher showed me her attendance were missing a lot!  We were shocked and realized she was just sitting there and was on her own schedule of watching Anima from time to time.   Now the last period she is going to classes as mandatory by her teacher now.   Oh well, we finally heard the good news that school will reopen in May 18!  Almost exactly 4 months later her last day at school!!!! Hooray!"
2020-04-28 12:34,"Perhaps teachers will finally get the respect (and pay) they deserve.

And am I allowed to say that some parents typically view school as child care? And that perhaps more thought needs to go into whether to have children or not?"
2020-04-28 12:35,"There are millions of kids whose parents haven't graduated from high school, and whose reading and math skills are lacking. How are they suppose to teach their children. This problem is totally ignored in this article. This is a crisis for kids from poor families, whose parents lack both educational skills and access to technology at home. Education which is the ladder out of poverty for many has been taken away, and few seem to care. I sympathize with stressed out middle class parents, but where  is the needed focus on the poor."
2020-04-28 12:37,"Only about half of school is about subjects, content and skills. The other half is about socialization, communication, collaboration and self-direction. We teachers have managed, to some extent, to keep up with the subjects and skills remotely. The other aspects suffer, as we haven’t figured out how to approach them online. 

We can learn something from our kids about socializing, communicating and collaborating online. Many of them have created rich online environments, using Discord, Twitch, Minecraft (and other video games) and social media like Youtube, Instagram and TikTok. Maybe, instead of fighting with our kids to “stop goofing off online and get back to those worksheets” we should recognize that when they’re online they’re also doing useful work.

If we’re going to be having school remotely for long periods of time, then we teachers need to figure out how to combine the two domains of subject/content and socialization/communication/collaboration, in an online world."
2020-04-28 12:38,"With the pandemic we now face, it is a difficult, challenging time for so many of us in so many ways. And in the experience of this, what has been largely taken for granted opens up to be strikingly revealed. Teachers and education ... how precious they and that are! In the “economy” we Americans live ... “economy” in the broad sense ... the question is, Are these people and that function fairly and appropriately appreciated, supported and compensated? As far as I can see: No. Does it have to take a pandemic to get priorities right? Unfortunately, maybe; and yet that with that, a sense of hope."
2020-04-28 12:39,"I feel for parents, I really do. But now you have a tiny glimpse into what teaching really requires on a personal and emotional level. Remote learning highlights some things for me, as a 20+ year educator in NYC:

-The social aspect of being in school is a necessary component of education. Children cannot socialize effectively on-screen, period. 

- Schools need to return to teaching skills. Many children are struggling with remote learning because they cannot read instructions, are coddled and helped every step of the way, and are being taught using methods that DON’T WORK at the urging of school administrators/districts receiving kickbacks for using certain curriculum. A pared down, skills based approach is what our children require to become independent learners.

-Standards based instruction will need to be completely re-examined after this summer. We can’t hold all kids accountable to content and benchmarks that they didn’t have a chance to learn, let alone master, this year. 

-What truly matters in life is an ability to read, emotional intelligence and kindness, resiliency, and adaptability. Content can be learned anywhere, any time, if you can READ AND UNDERSTAND print.

- Andrew Yang was correct when he said we need to value people beyond their work- we all have value regardless of what we do for a living.
 
-Educating is EVERYONE’S JOB within a society!

2020-04-28 12:41,"Clearly, though no fault of the parents or the teachers, this isn't working in a uniform manner. Parents pay school taxes for public education, tuition for private education.  This entire semester should be repeated free of charge for the benefit of all students so affected. Otherwise they will start the next grade at a decided disadvantage, which will only worsen over time."
2020-04-28 12:42,"Those who can, teach.
Those who can’t, complain about those who can then discover it is a skill many do not possess. 

How is that rant about teachers being overpaid because they only work for six months going?
What about the one complaining about full time pre K?
Likewise the remark about those who can, do, those that can’t, teach?
Anyone care to evaluate their teaching skills against a standardized test?

It really is true about walking in someone’s shoes. Let’s see if that lesson was learned at the next school budget votes."
2020-04-28 12:51,"I hope this gets back to parents respecting teachers.  If a teacher tells you your kid is a disruption in the classroom, instead of reacting defensively, engage the teacher in finding a solution.  Parents who thought their kids could do no wrong are now finding they behave differently in different settings.  I hope this is a lesson for them."
2020-04-28 12:52,"Some of this boils down to one's temperament and economic class. Parents who don't feel the need to ""one-up"" others or compete for ""Best Parent of the Year"" awards or raise Baby Einsteins seem to be doing much better than those (often the more affluent) who do."
2020-04-28 12:53,"For the teachers who are proclaiming that parents are getting a taste of their professional lives:    Imagine being thrown into teacher without ever having taken an education course or doing student teaching with a mentor.  Then imagine it would be a mode of teaching and a lot of subject material that you never experienced yourself as a student.  Oh, and do it while handling at least one other full time job in an unrelated field.  And in multiple grades simultaneously.  I am not learning ""what it's like to be a teacher"".  Professional teachers never had to operate in conditions like this."
2020-04-28 12:55,"Our small, rural school district has nearly shutdown. Teachers must provide enrichment activities but if students don't participate it can't negatively impact grades. Reading all these stories has made my spouse and I so grateful for that decision. I just can't see that there is much benefit to the attempts at virtual school going on now. I don't think virtual classes are impossible, but they take planning that most school districts understandably haven't done."
2020-04-28 12:55,"Many of the commentators criticizing parents do not fully appreciate what is involved in teaching. I will address only one part: Many parents do not have the content knowledge to teach math, even at very low levels. 

Many adults do not fully understand the base-ten place value system. They can perform the algorithms, but they don’t *really* understand why they work. This means they won’t be able to teach it. (Elementary school math.) 

Many adults don’t *really*understand ratio and proportion. They may know the formula “distance = rate * time”, but they do not understand rates well enough to adequately teach them. (Middle school math.) 

How many adults remember and *understand* algebra, geometry (proofs!), and trigonometry? (High school math. 

This is the tip of the iceberg. There is much more involved in teaching. I taught algebra, trig, and calculus for many years and it was a challenge to teach remedial college math. Knowing does not mean able to teach. 

It is completely unreasonable to expect people with no specialized content area education or training or experience in teaching to be able to pick it up at the drop of a hat, while doing their own full-time jobs. 

Kudos to those parents who are able to keep up with their children’s school work! To those who can’t, please give yourself a break and concentrate on your and your family’s physical and mental health. Set modest expectations and celebrate every small success!"
2020-04-28 12:56,"Yeah, it is clear that parents today lack the skills, will, and motivation to focus on their children instead of themselves.   And, oh my, grandparents can’t come over to lend an assist.  Sorry young adults, but you don’t get participation trophies any more."
2020-04-28 12:57,"Now is a great time to start a garden--and it's a great learning experience. Any hands-on activities can be supplemented with reading books about gardening or watching the kadrillion videos on youtube about all aspects of gardening.

You can start with some leftover yogurt cups, some seeds from the store or taken from the pantry or refrigerator (think lentil sprouts, strawberry seeds, carrot tops, apple seeds, etc.) and a little potting soil. Some plants can grow in just water--like pineapple tops.

Students can write or draw pictures about their gardening experiences.

Or try developing other hobbies: crafts, chess, playing cards, dance, music, sewing, carpentry, cooking, whatever parents know how to do. Keep a journal, make a scrapbook, check it out online, etc. How about starting a little home-based business on ebay? Kids can sell their sneakers that no longer fit or make quilts or pillows out of old t-shirts to sell. Think of all the learning activities involved: especially math skills. Parents are a storehouse of knowledge. The kids can catch up in school on the academics.

Haven't we heard for years that children's screentime per day should be limited? For health and other reasons?"
2020-04-28 12:59,"A couple of examples that have been cited to help stressed-out parents here: despite all the weeks of school missed after Hurricane Katrina (2005) and the Christchurch earthquakes (2011), when kids got back to school they did even better than before the disruptions. Maybe extended time off is actually good for developing brains."
2020-04-28 13:00,"Before COVID-19 upended our lives, teachers were underpaid, undervalued, under appreciated.  This should be a wake up call for all parents who are finding it so difficult to teach their children even the basics of math, English, science, etc.

One of the positive benefits to come out of all of this will be for these parents to become a strong lobby for all teachers to improve their pay, their working conditions, and as a direct result, the quality of their children's education.

We all know teachers who have had to dip into their own finances just to provide learning materials in their classrooms.  That is not only ridiculous, it is wrong.

Let's hope the parents described in these articles don't suffer from short-term memory loss once COVID-19 is behind us."
2020-04-28 13:07,"These are reports from parents who are being conscientious.  It is very unlikely that they represent a broader swath of parents across the land.  Children are likely doing many things besides school work.  And parents too may be unable to carefully meld their daily tasks with the school work.  Let's not forget those parents who have already tuned out with cannabis or other agents, being mellow but not as focused to be home school teachers as they need to be."
2020-04-28 13:08,"Teaching children to cook teaches math and science.  Keeping a journal teaches writing and observation.  Building a city with blocks teaches counting, spacial relationships and planning. With a pencil and paper and art tutor.com anyone can learn to draw animals and landscapes. Or balance a checkbook.   Learning doesn’t have to be tied to the typical classroom structure.  I feel for parents but encourage them to focus on fun and life skills.  This period will create a pivotal memory for their children for the rest of their lives. It could be a memory of freedom and exploration or it could be one fraught with anxiety."
2020-04-28 13:10,"Remote learning is particularly hard on those that would not or could not invest in having broadband.   Most people reading this take broadband for granted;  it cost us nearly 20K 2020 dollars to install broadband cable after looking at literally every other option (Elon Musk and the cybersphere are not here yet unfortunately). The lack of broadband relegates one to near third world status.  What we gave up to pay for broadband installation looks well worthwhile now, the schools can reach us and martial arts has zoom classes.  Not ideal but far better than the alternative."
2020-04-28 13:15,"As veteran home schoolers, we found that our children benefitted from an initial period of 'de-schooling'--time to decompress from traditional schooling and unlearn some habits of thinking about 'home' v. 'school'. --And it's generally a bad idea to try to re-create traditional school at home.  

Your kids won't suffer if you let them de-school for a few weeks or months.  They're more resilient than you know, and teaching young children isn't rocket science--unless you make it that way.  Yes, I realize that many people go to graduate school to become elementary school teachers, but if you have a solid grasp of reading and arithmetic, you can teach your child."
2020-04-28 13:19,"I feel very empathetic for everyone involved in this situation. Part of the problem is the rapid nature with which this came upon us. Let's just pretend for a moment that there was a national decree that a year from now all schooling would be done at home by parents (many of whom also hold jobs). AND that a vast number of adults would no longer be able to work in the environment they do today.

There would be time to develop a mass curriculum, arrange for this new work scenario, get the technology and scheduling factors figured out etc etc.

The fact that all teachers and parents and children are doing the best they can when this complex situation was forced upon them without warning is amazing. I can hear the stress in my adult children's voices as they help with my grandchildren's schooling and work 10 hours a day. My praise goes out to all of you."
2020-04-28 13:22,"A lot of parents dreamed about staying home and homeschooling.Welcome to reality. 

I am the daughter of a teacher, the sister of a teacher, and I hope that one of the most important lessons people will learn when this is all over is that there's a lot more to teaching than people think, and that teachers should be valued more in our society than vacuous celebrities and sports teams.

I also hope that perhaps a lot of parents will get a chance to see that it was their kid and their parenting, not the teachers, that have been the issue...."

We do this every day and we are taken for granted. ""Those that can't do teach."" And most of us are good at our jobs. More support for teachers and what we do would be nice. 
And is all of the displays if frustration in this article it doesn't depict how teachers feel. I spend most of my day trying to track down students, trying to help them one on one, and trying to understand how my district wants me to pass kids that have skipped a whole semester and have NEVER submitted any work just because of Covid19 and they're SpEd.

My heart's hurting for the teachers-reinventing their jobs on the fly, parents-taking on a job for which they have no training, and sometimes no aptitude. Add in the job stress, coronavirus stress...no one is their ""best self"" right now.  Folks, the kids, especially the younger ones are stressed too!  Their world's been turned upside down. Most kids thrive on routine, and all the normal routines are topsy turvy. When little ones are stressed, they act out, or shut down.  Cut them and yourselves some slack. No, don't let them play video games all day! But  read to them and with them, play card games or board games, let them cook with you, garden with you, dance with you, sing with you--those are all learning experiences that might just also make you all feel better."

This pandemic is a lesson to everybody."
2020-04-28 13:29,"I have suddenly been thrust into working at home while also schooling my 9 and 7-year-old children.  Screentime here was limited and supervised, but now they are expected to be on screens for much of the day, with minimal supervision.  It's sort of a mess.  Everyone is trying their best.

My frustration stems from the almost the complete disconnect between the curriculum and their New Normal life.  We are all stuck at home in the midst of a historical pandemic with tons of cooking, cleaning, baking and gardening for those lucky enough for the space.  I *implore* teachers to relate the assignments to the times: provide simple recipes for them to double or half to work on math and fractions; writing assignments about their daily life; reading assignments about pandemics or other times when community sacrifice was required; so many ways to teach based off of cooking (reading, math, science, history, nutrition).  

Also, how about linking school assignments and household chores so that part of children's ""workplan"" has requirements for helpfulness around the house.  

Currently the lesson plans seem completely disconnected from the reality of this crazy time in history.  If my kiddos were a little older, I would %100 assign them the Diary of Anne Frank to read - how much more compelling would that story be while we are all cooped up together bereft of privacy."
2020-04-28 13:32,"We have two elementary school children, and right after school closed, we made up our own routine: daily reading and math plus daily short writing on a topic of the kids’ choice. About two hours a day. Once online instruction began, we tried for a week to keep up with online learning, but it felt both scattershot and overwhelming, and we soon went back to our own plan, using a number of school resources but not the daily online assignments and meetings. I love my kids’ teachers and I respect the work of teachers everywhere, but I think trying to teach *young* children online was a mistake. The emphasis should have been on supporting parents in providing something simple and consistent at grade level, keeping in mind that some people have multiple children of (young) school age to manage, plus work. It would be different at the high school level, and even the middle school level. I think for little ones, though, the love and the effort are there, but the model is wrong."

I’m learning through my 2 yr that just being present with her and letting her imagination play is what she really needs right now. Not basketful of plastic toys but just paper and crayons. And singing. Maybe what this time is showing us is that while there’s a time and place for worksheets what school kids need is the freedom to exploration their imagination. Schools will open up again and we’ll be drilling them w test prep but maybe this time we sneak in more play. 

Hats off to the teachers of littles especially. 2 yr olds are reservoirs of never ending energy."

Yes, I know, we have all the trappings of an educational institution---subjects, credits, classrooms--but all of these trappings are not designed to educate, they are designed to control and to document---As many parents are learning, there are numerous online platforms that offer quality instruction that is more efficient and effective than our turn of the century factory style schooling. Then why do we stick with a schooling platform that waste enormous amounts of instructional time on safely housing students for six hours, offer one size fits all curriculum and instruction, and whose outcomes, even in our best schools, fail to live up to the educational goals listed in school mission statements---the answer is...so their parents can go to work knowing that for six hours there sons and daughters are safe, under adult supervision, and doing what would appear to be educational activities. The custodial function will continue to be the dominant force behind maintaining an antiquated model for learning---having said that, my hope, is that schools themselves, start rethinking how they organize their schools for learning to make it more meaningful, more engaging, and more effective---they might start with viewing some Kahn academy tapes--where in my tutorial efforts with my grandson, I now actually understand all that math I never understood in high school."

Teachers are responsible for children’s lives and learning. It’s apparent to me that a number of the parents quoted in this article have no clue as to what educating children entails. They have no understandings about the field of education in the 21st-century. 

The next time teachers demand pay raises and supplies for their classrooms, don’t scoff. Support teachers. Go to school board meetings. 

Learn some truths about what a mess education is these days, not because of teachers, but because of the failed stewardship of the incompetent Betsy DeVos, who is destroying the Department of Education at the behest of the dumbest man in America."
2020-04-28 12:11,"Worse, there’s no relief in sight for the average parent, just more work, anxiety, sickness, job losses, and death. Schools need to do more, businesses need to cut every parent some slack, and the government needs to backstop families so an entire generation doesn’t grow up socially anxious and risk averse. 

But instead of supporting families and schools and local governments, the airlines got their billions. And so did the landlords. And the chain restaurants. Oh and the banks preserved their precious “liquidity” (read: so they can keep gambling with your money)

What smokes me in all this is that nobody goes poor in the corner office. The executive class cuts jobs, the stockholding class saves “value”, wealth remains safely intact with “dry powder” on the sidelines ready to pounce on “distressed” assets.

The children who ask us worried questions about corona, during a once-in-a-century pandemic?

Pay the teachers more, sure!! I’m all for it!! My kid’s first grade NYC public school teacher, who hasn’t done a single zoom, makes $115k per year. It’s hard to live on that in NYC!! Pay her more!! She’s amazing!! I’ve always told her that and continue to do so!!

My kids are the ones getting me through this. I never wanted to be an elementary teacher, but thank goodness for my kids. Every time I get a “Mommy” and a pile of hugs from the kids, it gives me strength to keep going. I’m so thankful I was able to have kids, now more than ever."

Do things that you wouldn't normally do because of our busy American lives. That recipe for delicious cookies you use to make with Grammie should be dusted off. Teach them things that you wish your parents taught you sooner in life. Put some educational tv on if they are in the mood (there's a silly one called Absurd Planet on Netflix). We have Nova lunch time, the kids love it! There's a great kids podcast called Brains On, highly recommend. There are also many free dance and gym virtual activities available.

2020-04-28 13:33,"Some thoughts:
1.  Yes, ensure teachers across the country are paid commensurate with their importance in society.
2.  Please don’t turn your teachers into nannies.  Discipline begins at home.
3.  Give teachers the benefit of the doubt before you accuse them of hurting your little darling’s advancement or threaten to sue.
4.  Support school administrators who actually know what they’re doing and are dedicated to providing a safe and calm environment in which teachers can teach and students can learn.
5.  Ban cellphones from schools.
6.  With all of this said, teachers must turn out students who can read, write and think.  From what I observe by watching and reading everything from the news to Facebook posts, too many of you are failing miserably and maybe some of you should find another line of work.  When so many Americans know nothing about the Civil War and can’t even put together a complete sentence, the nation has a problem."

2020-04-28 13:41,"I know many people can’t afford a tutor, but I’ll bet there are plenty of educated friends, grandparents and other retirees who would be willing to step in to help these beleaguered parents. How about creating a resource group of willing volunteers in your neighborhood to work one on one with a child. It wouldn’t have to be all day, and it wouldn’t have to follow a state-mandated curriculum. For young elementary school kids, how about reading books together, watching videos and talking about children in other countries and their way of life, even play an “educational” video game together that would reenforce critical thinking for older kids (remember Myst)? 

As an former high school teacher, I am appalled at the worksheet-multiple-choice, computer-generated and graded lessons that focus on data-driven accountability instead of creative, Socratic teaching methods. It’s why I left the public schools. 

I remember the day I got called out by an assistant principal for not writing down a five-part lesson plan for Act IV, scene 2 of Macbeth, when I had been teaching it for years. I waved my annotated paperback at her and said, “Here’s my lesson plan.” That year, we had a trial for Lady Macbeth instead of my usual essay test. When challenged, I told the kids, “Every criminal is entitled to a defense attorney.”

I for one would be happy to tutor a child for free—just not math."

I personally home taught my children in 70ies and 80ies from European handbooks in foreign language (my native). They (age 5-12) were already fluent in that language and I thought the handbooks were better than those in their school (Chicago suburb). They were attending also normal school like their peers. They had to read the handbook material and solve many problems. I was there to assign the lesson, explain difficulties, help if necessary. It took about 1-2 hr a day, and they turned out to be the best students in their normal classes. Individual instruction is very efficient and not stressful for children and tutors. Affluent children in Europe used to be schooled that way at home. Of course, it requires certain level of discipline from children and enthusiastic attitude of parents (tutors) toward teaching and learning. In present conditions, it would be better if teachers met with the child and parents once a week to monitor child's progress instead of those dstracting online lessons."

This is an unprecedented time and everyone is hurting and struggling. We all need to look deeper into what’s happening psychologically and mentally with the students and their families and teachers and their families as well. This is a much bigger picture than the obvious challenges of online learning for families and children. I’d like to see just one article focus on teachers’ perspectives and challenges figuring this all out. There seems to often be blame at teachers. Remember teachers have Administrators and Administrators have school Chancellors and they have Mayors and Governors and a President. Stop looking at a narrow perspective in this global problem.

2020-04-28 13:57,"I feel like there is a theme in all these comments sections about how parents are being smacked with the reality check of how hard teachers truly work. None of the NYT articles I've read so far have quoted any parents taking for granted their child's teachers. Most are simply about burnout and the general unpreparedness everyone had going into this challenging situation. I see everyone trying the best they can with what they've got, both in terms of technology and sanity. It's a stressful, trying time for everyone."
2020-04-28 13:57,"Why can't the kids just get a break from school during the pandemic?  Education is absolutely not an essential activity.  This way parents won't go crazy trying to help their kids with their homework.  And the kids will be happy too.  Some parents can be creative and give their kids some books to read like financial literacy books that are not typically used in school (such as Rich Dad, Poor Dad).  I get that that teachers and school administrators will then become unemployed but then they can get unemployment benefits or work as a true essential worker like delivering groceries for other people (using Task Rabbit for example)."
2020-04-28 14:00,"Most of these kids just need to repeat the grade. Sad but true. There's no way you can effectively transfer an entire school system into home schooling in a matter of weeks. 2020 is going to create a decade's worth of disjointed educational outcomes. Everyone is taking remedial math from now on.

Unfortunately we can't just stop the system either. New kids are born and they age into school. Holding back an entire class effectively doubles the student population in the class behind them. The only way out is forward. Schools need methods to makeup the lost material.

I feel the response so far has been confused on this priority. You shouldn't introduce new subjects to most students on the fly. You shouldn't expect parents to teach the material. Instead of building out lesson plans as though class continued as normal, I think schools should have focused on retention. A task which is easier for everyone.

You've spent half a year in school already. What steps can we take to make sure you remember that half. I feel like throwing new stuff at the kids pushes both the old and the new out the window. After that, we really only need to focus on keeping parents sane and alive."
2020-04-28 14:01,"As a high school teacher my hope against hope is that this moment causes us to break through our current way of educating children.

Too many lessons?  Yes!  but perhaps only because we continue to follow a ""factory"" model that moves students from discipline to discipline to discipline as if the disciplines had nothing to do with each other.  We are intent on giving students answers to questions they haven't asked.  

This could be an opportunity to reinvent our approach--make learning interdisciplinary.  Give students choices about reading fiction and non-fiction--actual books and journal articles.  Stop teaching students to ""be prepared for the future"" and start teaching students to be prepared to be a part of local and global communities now.  Engage students in questioning and exploring the places where they live--and how those places and peoples connect with the wide world, learn from the questions and perspectives of others. Students should be gaining a deep understanding of how our small planet works--especially climate change

Alas.  Too much bureaucracy and too much fear to change. Or not?"
2020-04-28 14:03,"Perhaps the correlation between the families’ earlier experiences with and attitudes about schooling is relevant and not considered in this article. Too many parents neglect to read to their young children, allow them to spend endless hours passively viewing devices and expect teachers to somehow create active, motivated learners. Many children arrive in school loving to read and excited to learn. Parents who communicate the importance of education and encourage curiosity will find that their children will learn. I taught English to Speakers of Other Languages for many years and found that most students,whose parents spoke little English and were not highly educated, but respected the importance of learning and of teachers, became successful by any measure and often exceeded their native-born privileged classmates."
2020-04-28 14:03,"We've been very fortunate. Even with my 12 year old son being on the spectrum- we've all managed to get to a good place. However, in the beginning  I was wound up pretty tight about what was going to happen. Would he get the proper support? would he fall behind? Would I be failing him as a parent if I couldn't support his on line learning? I had to teach myself how he learns math on Kahn Academy so I could help him prior to the pandemic! I am 50 so my academic days are way behind me. 

 I finally made peace with was was not going to happen and we do the best we can. I don't have many of the challenges that other parents in this article  face. It's a little glib to for me to type ""Just do the best you can! It'll all be okay!"" Know that I hear you all and it is tough. I am sure you are all doing your best."
2020-04-28 14:11,"Luckily, my daughter is 16 and her high school is an alternative public high school that had a good distance learning program before the stay at home order.  Plus, she was home schooled up through middle school, so the only difference now is we aren't going to the zoo or aquarium or co-op for enrichment classes.  
However, several of her friends didn't have good computers and/or reliable internet (yes, even in techy Seattle) and have a had a hard time submitting work, since the usual places they would go to use a computer (school computer lab, local library) are closed.  We had an old laptop that we gave to one friend, but 6 weeks into the stay at home, some kids are just getting computers.  That's going to make for a huge hurdle to overcome next school year."

2020-04-28 14:24,"When I first understood that schools would be closed for the rest of the school year I thought, ""The poor parents"" (I am childless and may be projecting my own horror of being cooped up with any amount of young children on a continuous basis) ""The kids will win."" 

I used to teach hordes of them to swim, coached high school varsity boy's swimming, taught history in the classroom, substituted in nursery school, worked with the learning disabled, the developmentally disabled, you name them, I've worked with that age or ability group. To expect parents to successfully work from home while simultaneously home-schooling their children, with no notice, is absurd. It is either a recipe for disaster or a forced lesson in acceptance that, in this life, control is an illusion. 

It is clear from this piece that it is the parents whose learning curve is growing most, while the children are regaining the free-form childhood (albeit shut-in) that school, team sports and perfectly designed adult scheduling of their lives had robbed them of. 

In my mind, the only way for parents to survive is to embrace the non-judgemental imperfection of their children and cut themselves a lot of slack. Chaotic playtime is learning in disguise."
2020-04-28 14:30,I teach 5th grade Math and Science. I meet with my Title one kids everyday. I was a parent many years ago and there is No Way I could have gotten mine to do even the minimum I am assigning my own students. Lots of them tell their parents they are done and parents have no clue how to check.
2020-04-28 14:33,"Some commenting here, including some former teachers (full disclosure: I'm a former substitute teacher), have noted that the course load being imposed is excessive.

It's not surprising.

When I was teaching, my fellow teachers bemoaned the rigid, paperwork-intensive ""No Child Left Behind"" program imposed by the bureaucracy. Teachers lamented the hours spent filing voluminous paperwork, time that could have been dedicated to creating lesson plans and teaching.

I'm guessing that schools overburdening children and parents with massive home-schooling curricula might be concerned with meeting government requirements and trying to conform to standards that applied in normal times.

But these aren't normal times. It shouldn't have taken a lot of thought to realize that stress would be a major factor under the present conditions and that course work needed to be cut back substantially in recognition of that fact. Additionally, it should have been noted that parents have other jobs besides, with many working from home.

It's good that parents might now be more inclined to appreciate the difficulty of professional teachers' jobs and to not begrudge them a salary commensurate with the work. On the other hand, teachers and administrators should likewise appreciate the difficulty of homeschooling children confined to their homes and beset with anxiety over a deadly virus, stresses shared by their parents.

It sounds like some school officials are in need of a reality check."
2020-04-28 14:33,"I am a High School Chemistry and Physics teacher. I never thought I would be answering questions at 1am. I keep my phone on Google hangouts all day and a computer always near by just in case I have to address one of my 100 students.  I am not complaining. I am just describing part of my day. On  top of this I have 2, that's right 2 severely disabled children which receive ZERO from their school. One was already receiving homebound instruction.( He has primary immune deficiency), so he can't have anybody come to our house.  My other son does not walk, talk, crawl, feed himself.  He can't do anything. The disabled children and their parents are not being taken  care of here.  I  feel like  the system has forgotten about them.  I am not complaining...just stating some observations. Overall we will get through this.  I  never complain. I just wish our systems before this pandemic and during would help kids like mine better.  I am thankful we are all still healthy and living in a relatively safer area. So my hopes are after most of the pandemic settles we can address more needs of our disabled population. I love my job and I am glad we can continue, even though what we are doing is less at least we are moving forward."
2020-04-28 14:34,"Don't forget that many teacher also have children at home. Educators are spending 3 to 4 times more time teaching remotely.  They receive no extra recompense for it. Know too that public school teachers are also, even in ""normal"" times, assigned the roles of social workers, mental health counselors, and baby sitters. We pay our teachers low wages and expect them to do the job of parenting too. Welcome to their world. (and no, I am not a public school teacher)"
2020-04-28 14:35,"The whole thing is a disaster. Can you imagine being a teacher, principal or administrator and like a storm cloud, this virus comes in and you have about three weeks to suddenly create online learning for the entire school system. Then you have the parents (that would be me with two teenager girls) who find themselves navigating through a maze of links and files. Today we will be meeting via blackboard at 10 a.m. There is no link. My opinion is do the best you can and the education gods should declare this semester a redo. So much is being missed and we're not even talking about the sports, fun, romances and heartbreaks and proms, which after all is what we all remember most about high school good or bad."
2020-04-28 14:35,"the subtext in this piece is that school is daycare.

Well, of course.

Some decades ago, daycare in Ontario cost about $500 a month for pre-schoolers.  At the time, Ontario was spending about $6,000 per pupil per school year.  Nowadays, daycare costs about $1,000/month, and Ontario spends about $13,000 per pupil per school year. 

School is and has been daycare for decades. The education the system provides is a freely given bonus."
2020-04-28 14:38,"I've taught kindergarten for 20 years.  I have a 6 year old daughter.  I can see that parents are learning that teaching is not easy.  However, there are some powerful tools for building structure at home.

The two components of painlessly building instruction at home include:routine and starting at an easy point.  A schedule is key.  Go over the schedule in the morning.  I have never met a child that could resist a consistent routine.  The trick to starting a routine is to start at an easy point.

If it's a writing assignment start with the simplest part and get more complicated as time progresses.  For example, in kindergarten start with printing for three minutes.  After a few days move to word work for five minutes.  After another few days move to writing a sentence for eight minutes.  During this time focus on the positive and ignore any mistakes.  Praise lavishly throughout. Lengthen session a little bit at a time. If a child has difficulty with any step, simplify things until they are ready for the next step.  

 Your goal is just building the routine.  If a child is working independently, they will be learning.  If you break the routine, you need to start all over again.  If you go slow enough, your child will build stamina and focus--Life long skills you child will need as an adult.  

Here is the suggested schedule for my class:

2020-04-28 14:40,How about just forgetting about school for now?  Promote all the students and have the school year run for eleven months next year without weeks-long breaks for holidays?  The extra time could be used to review the previous grade's work and catch everyone up.
2020-04-28 14:41,"The defensiveness of teachers in these comments is eye-opening. This article is not about teachers, it is about parents who are trying to teach full time AND work their regular jobs full-time. That is not what teachers do, so this nightmare experience is not making us parents empathize or appreciate them more. The judgmental comments from teachers, as if they take some joy out of parents' struggle, and the constant refrain of ""I hope this makes everyone respect teachers and pay us more"" are disappointing and off-putting."
2020-04-28 14:45,"My late wife Pitta, who passed away last year after an agonizingly long struggle with Huntingtons Disease, was a wonderful wonderful wife and mother, who stayed home to bring up our 4 children (while I worked as an engineer) until our youngest was 10. Trained at university as a botanist, she became an expert horticulturist during the years we had a small garden, before she went to find part time work in a local plant nursery. She went on to become an expert plant photographer, and her books on gardening with indigenous South African plants, have become classics in our country. She grew up on a farm without electricity, and was only went to school at the age of 9. She studied through junior and high school and university by candle light. I was so fortunate to meet her at university through a common friend. Maybe one should remember we are in extraordinary times, tragic and difficult for many. Maybe we should relax pressure on our children, who must be feeling anxious and insecure. These are not normal times. Maybe if our children repeat their current school year, it won't be a bad thing in the long run. Maybe sometimes we have to stop running, and lead our children at a different pace. They have many many years ahead of them. Maybe we could teach them that always running ahead is not always necessary."
2020-04-28 14:45,"It's rough, man.  My kids are in first and fourth grades.  The school district provided a curriculum to follow, but it relied on dozens of apps and sites, each with their own login.  

Meanwhile, my wife and I had bosses that expected us to work as normally as possible.  They pretended to be understanding, but the task list never decreased.  Fearful of losing our jobs, we tried to keep up the productivity as best as possible.  That has pretty much meant 18 hour days throughout the duration of the shutdown.  

Meanwhile, we're all sick of being stuck in the house.  But, compared to many who are sick, unemployed, or struggling, we are very fortunate.  We have to keep reminding ourselves that many others are in worse shape."
2020-04-28 14:46,"Albert Einstein  is rumored to have said 'There is all too much schooling' .

I think that is even more true today. I don't think that a six year old who fails to complete a Character Trait Study is going to be permanently damaged, nor for that matter if they miss the rest of the school year. 

As a college professor, my question is : in twelve years, as a freshman, will he be able to write a coherent paragraph? 

To achieve THAT goal, he is better off just reading a lot - of actual books. You learn to write by reading, not by completing exercises and memorizing the parts of speech. Does not have to be Shakespeare, it can be JK Rowling or Stephen King, so long as it has a real narrative and requires imagination. 

So far as math goes, you learn it if you are in the small minority that is truly interested in math, or you need it for your work and recognize its utility. Otherwise, at best you will remember enough to pass a test, then quickly forget it. Thus, the hypothetical Dad who last used algebra 'circa 1992'. 

School should be about producing competent, intelligent citizens, not STEM workers or corporate drones. It should provide all students a chance to learn useful skills, engage in sports and social activities, have lots of time and encouragement to read what they like, maybe even develop 'hobbies' (remember those?) 

School might be most useful now if it was all about Covid-19 - the social costs, the biology, epidemiology? 

All the students need is the NYT."
2020-04-28 14:46,"This is not a parent vs teacher vs kids thing.  This is a huge cultural problem.  We need a dynamic shift in the central role that education plays at a very, very early age for children.  As a parent of two kids who 'survived' to high school, we parents have made huge sacrifices.  Teachers have been central to corralling our kids through these years.

Electronic gadgets and apps all failed miserably in my scenario.  These approaches do not develop the most important concept needed for a child -- how to concentrate.  To focus. To physically experience learning.  Apps and games make education entertaining, but a lot of education is about grit, and grinding through 'boring'.   

Compare this.  A kid presses a button to answer a question, rather than write out the solution.  Which is more convenient and which teaches both patience and involvement of many senses.  The child is more occupied doing the work physically than being entertained. Education also involves a physical process of learning --- so many physical processes.  And we as a society should show children that education is valued.  It is not a disposable asset they play with and leave in an electronic sim world. Education is a real worlds skills. School is not only for baby sitting."
2020-04-28 14:50,"In 5th grade my daughter missed 6+ weeks of school due to concussion. We couldn't even do ""home school"" because she was unable to look at screens or even concentrate for long. I read aloud to her, she listened to some podcasts, she made a lot of pancakes, and we played an occasional game. That was it. I worried that she would get behind, but the teacher assured me that she already knew most of what she would have been doing in school anyway. We are in an excellent school district, but the bottom line is that a 5th-grader without special needs can take a big chunk of time out of school with no appreciable loss. I share this experience in hopes of reassuring parents of children in that age group who worry about the interruption in learning."
2020-04-28 14:51,The pressure is even greater for parents with kids receiving special education in NYC.

2020-04-28 14:54,"As a college professor who has been on the job for 30 years, my heart goes out to parents attempting to be their children's teachers.  About 50% of my students have some level of computer and internet literacy, the latter meaning that they can navigate to our school's learning management system (LMS).  Trying to explain to them remotely (on SKYPE) how to access the work I have returned to then for correction is a trial ... there is no way they can understand if I try doing so by email.  I am a very experienced educator and while I have taught online in years past, I frankly hate doing so.  I cannot imagine the frustration of parents attempting to do so with no experience in teaching.  Lord, please give them patience and fortitude as they try to navigate these waters."
2020-04-28 14:56,My heart goes out to all those parents! Just managing homework when kids are in school can be a challenge. Parents: cut yourselves some slack and consider staying low on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Just keeping children safe and fed is an accomplishment during a time like this!
2020-04-28 15:00,"@arcoiris I totally agree that children are being pushed beyond the capacity of their brains' developmental level. Before the outbreak, I picked up my 8-year-old grandson once a week and did homework with him until mom got home. He is in 2nd grade and cognitively impaired (delayed development) due to being a micro-preemie.

The lessons on paper must have been written with the idea that teacher had explained what's not spelled out on the page, or that the child could carry the concept home so as to explain it to the befuddled parent or, in my case, grandparent.

Teachers are my heroes. But I was once a senior editor of photographically illustrated reference books, so I feel qualified to recognize what needs simplifying. It's heartbreaking to know that many kids can't get direct and simple instruction, because learning can be such a joy."

2020-04-28 15:04,"This is one of the news articles that really poked my anxiety in this difficult time. It raises many questions on parenting, remote-learning and education in general.

While I do find some common struggles with the parents in this article, none of us can deny that it is not remote-learning that is breaking parents. Parents are confronted with so many challenges these days. The sudden switch simply exaserbated it. We can’t expect kids to be office workers to type away on the laptop and learn. I question the photo choice in this article with a line of laptops. But why not have a classroom at home? Learning for children does take place at home after all. 

Remote learning has cut a lot of the difficulties for my children: big classroom size, no recess, and poor cafeteria food. In terms of time saving, they both find they finally can work on their own craft and lego projects. They may be struggling with the curriculum materials, but they now have more time to relax.

What I would like is for the schools/teachers to provide more personal support in guiding the school work and give less slide shows for the targeted knowledge (esp the elementary school children). Why don’t we take the opportunity to look at both sides of the coin of remote and classroom learning. Reflection can take us to a better place after this crisis. That will help the parents to ease some stress in general."
2020-04-28 15:05,"I thought all kids were geniuses? That's what their parents told me, before the quarantine. The teacher in this household works 7am-11pm on the district's fiat for preparing online material. On Sundays she has worked until 2am preparing math tests for the district-determined online forum not designed for it, and which the kids don't seem to be able to use by themselves."
2020-04-28 15:08,"Too groups of people under appreciated before the pandemic - teachers and nurses. Let’s hope all these people finding out how valuable they are will remember this when contract talks come up again.

2020-04-28 15:15,"The author of this article should be a little more proactive, imo, and suggest that readers consult the obvious experts on this subject, homeschoolers.  My wife (mainly) has managed our five kids (at staggered ages) up until at least high school.  She's the first to admit that there are many parents who are far more organized and committed to conveying knowledge than she (and I) are.  We have two in public high school now doing shockingly well (public schools have some issues....)  Like us, most homeschoolers rely on the help of homeschooling organizations and MANY online resources.  The college academic performance record of children who were homeschooled is excellent (from my understanding).

Unfortunately, many institutional school students are still receiving, remotely, rote assignments from their teachers (who should really be consulting homeschooling associations... but won't, of course).  These one-size-fits-all assignments may help create coherence and allow slower students to catch up in a classroom setting, but when administered online they can be numbingly routine.  Teachers, themselves, need to learn better... from their students and from better teachers and from even ""anti-teachers"", including homeschoolers."
2020-04-28 15:15,"Well, now we know why a teacher teaches and why we as a parent should give them the kudos they deserve for doing their jobs well.
So we should make sure that we teach our kids that all the drama they might bring to the classroom has no place there.
Remember that adage: I cried because I had no shoes until I saw the man who had no feet.
Well, it goes without saying that when we complained about our teachers, now we are in their shoes.
And our kids are our own kids, so imagine when and if they have 20 or thirty such little people or tweens or teenagers in their midst each with their own personalities and problems and one teacher has to handle them.
If we can't do it with our own kid, then put yourself in their shoes for a week, what's more a year."
2020-04-28 15:16,"Turns out teaching is a hard job. Now that parents are trying it out for themselves, maybe the profession will get a little more respect. But I am not holding my breath, usually blaming teachers for all of societies problems is a a catch all response to just about everything."

My sons were not happy being booted off campus and forced to end the semester back at home, online. But at least they didn't need my help at all."
2020-04-28 15:35,"A few key things to consider. 1-Pandemic Flu is a once-in-100 years horror. You must find a way to explain that to yourself... and to your kids.
2- Children's brains are a learning machine. They're not tape recorders that wait to be viewed in 12 months. They're developing processors. In a child, the brain MUST LEARN NOW, because a child's cognition develops biologically -- it doesn't just fall into place.
This remote work-around that the school board is offering is a 'new' way of learning. Of course it isn't perfect! It's an emergency work-around. But new educational deliveries can not only be good, they can stimulate the learner to learn better. 
3- Take a deep breath, accept the emergency, socially isolate, co-operate with the teachers, attend with your child, and by god, look at the big picture."
2020-04-28 15:36,"As a former homeschooler with grown children, I have more than a passing knowledge of home learning.  But, what is being asked of parents now, in a time of intense anxiety, is simply unrealistic.  It's what we homeschoolers call ""school at home"" which is a poor imitation of classroom methods.  I did highly structured homeschooling for most of the time I did it, but at a crisis point when I became my mother's sole caregiver in her final months, I saw that all the angst about getting behind academically was much about nothing.  My kids (then 8 and 11) thrived without my carefully designed lessons.  What parents need now is some general advice to keep their kids engaged at home.  That can look different for each child and family.  It can even involve taking a break from canned lessons completely."
2020-04-28 15:37,"Amazing for parents to realize that teaching is not as easy as they thought. Amazing for parents to learn that maybe their children are not that easy to teach. Maybe parents now understand that not all the stories their children tell them about what they do in school are true.  Now many parents finally realize that maybe they are not the educational experts they believed themselves to be. If you can't manage to manage your own children who you are raising and are your own, then you should re-evaluate your knowledge of the teaching profession."
2020-04-28 15:41,"""Education is more than a luxury; it is a responsibility that society owes itself.""~ Robin Cook
     As an educator of over 175 high school students, many them second language learners, and a mother with a son going into the 9th grade I honor my responsibility to listen to the different voices in society. 
   The third week of distant learning I called families to hear frustrated parents concern with online learning at home. Many of the parents have lost jobs or trying to keep their employees on the pay roll while trying to balance their schedules alongside making a routine for online education. 
     After talking to parents with different languages and multiple financial situation I checked into ""Google Classroom"". It became evident that I was going to work longer hours just to answer student emails saying, ""I do not understand; how do I submit this? can I turn this in late?"" These comments and more were almost laughable given many of them would prefer to look up information online during class time. Now they have the chance to do what they think was better and are finding it is not the solution. 
     Due to distant learning as a teacher I am participating in ZOOM meetings. The meeting has become a place for educators to heal and problem solve. The workload has shifted to personal connections with students to connecting with any student who is willing. In the end, the responsibility teachers carry is as strong as the connection to families. Support each other is evident!"
2020-04-28 15:45,"I think I figured out why the Mommy Wars came to Ms Parcak's doorstep. Maybe the use of the words ""survival and protecting his well-being""? I have yet to hear of a child dying due to Zoom classes. Inflammatory language tends to, well, inflame."
2020-04-28 15:45,"As mentioned by others, the parents in this article are capable, engaged, with internet - and still struggling. Imagine the family in crisis, the parent who doesn’t read English, the student new to America, the kids left alone all day, the kids of addicts and lost souls, those in shelters, the parents who just can’t do it.  These families are real. We teachers are trying to reach them - by phone, text, email, standing outside their door, providing food and resources. Those students will return in the fall with greater needs than before.  You will not hear from these parents because if the NYT finds them and interviews them the condemnation and shaming will start. 

Regarding workload - teachers are being pressured to create more new content and less, to have more Zoom/Google meet classes and fewer, to have high expectations and yet just keep kids level. Create urgency but without stress. Teachers & districts are being compared across social media and in the press- loved and demonized. No one likes this. We didn’t become teachers to push out videos and links and worksheets/slide shows. 

Let’s not judge parents or teachers right now, save the reflection and changing the system ideas for later after the crisis and panic subside. 

Parents, reach out to us. Please don’t take your complaints online for the world to see until you’ve addressed them with the teacher or school. We CAN’T respond or explain publicly and God knows we wouldn’t shout out your kids’ problems to the world."
2020-04-28 15:49,"To say that teaching is hard is an understatement. I often question why I decided to become a teacher and stay in the field. It is important to remember that many teachers are also parents who have children at home, so they are also doing double duty. I hope that one outcome of the present circumstance is that our communities and government officials will recognize how crucial it is to recruit and retain high quality teachers."
2020-04-28 15:51,"I’m the granddaughter of 2 teachers and have long revered the profession.  The breadth of skills needed to be successful is astonishing, because it’s not just subject/grade level knowledge. From organizational skills and administrative skills to interpersonal skills, it is mind-boggling to me how many moving parts there are to being a teacher.  Now, teachers are having to pivot to a methodology none of them trained for.  

Some, like my daughter’s teachers, have phenomenal support from the school administration and the parents. Many don’t. The difference between our Catholic school in Seattle and the mess that is Seattle public is gargantuan. We have friends whose kids have IEPs. Those parents are aging years daily as they struggle to work online and handle kids alone whose issues usually require a village to mitigate. The SPED teachers aren’t getting support or direction they need. Total mess.

We need to acknowledge that right now, we’re all doing what we can, and that is going to look different for every single American family.  Studies will be done on the current cohort of K-12 students till they’re adults, comparing them to where they “should” have been. But you know what? The “COVID generation” may come out of this with skills we don’t anticipate: resilience, self sufficiency, empathy.  They will have a better idea of what Mom and Dad do to keep their family moving, and how much work and creativity it takes to teach. Or not. A mom can dream!"
2020-04-28 15:56,"I am from India.

To me as a parent, the new fresh interaction in school has been the parent teacher meeting, something which was not there when I was in school.

I assume based on my dialogue with our 'American' cousins, the whole idea of parent teacher meeting came to India 'from'  America.

So to read this article is so ironical.

American parents are simply not unto the basic idea of parent teacher collaboration and still it has been American society which has trumpeted this position to other societies over the years and even dictated the importance of such collaboration.

The pandemic is showing that like in this in other social activities too American society has dictated so many social practices to other societies, where they themselves fall short of the 'ideal' they presume to preach to others."
2020-04-28 15:59,"1.  Stay calm, and when you can't, take a time away.  The bathroom works.  2. Find things in your child's work that you can honestly praise and simply describe those things to your child.  After the positive, you can then follow up with instruction.  3. Give information and ask questions, instead of a lecture.  4.  Use suggestion, rather than command (The phrase, ""Sometimes it helps if...."" works well).  5. Accept and encourage baby steps toward the goal.   Remember that each interaction with a child is the opportunity to build a loving, lasting relationship and to help create a well-functioning adult. If you do these things, you will become someone whom you respect, and you will end up with adults who are the light of your life."
2020-04-28 16:02,I wish all teachers and paraprofessionals had to homeschool now under quarantine. Then perhaps they wouldn't be so judgmental and supercilious about parents ability to enforce homework and project completion at home.
2020-04-28 16:05,"The main complaint I share with other parents is that the workload assigned by teachers is far out of whack, considering grade level and the current conditions that have changed everyone's lives. It is too much and too complicated. I have to wonder what the value of a degree in education is, when teachers don't seem to have a basic understanding of how kids operate. Failing knowledge of children, common sense indicates that one would start small and simple the first week, giving children and parents time to adjust. The workload can increase over time. This is not happening. Rather, the attitude is curse the torpedoes, four bells."
2020-04-28 16:06,"This just shines a spotlight on lazy parents who used school as ""free"" childcare.

Even during a crisis, the teachers are still doing most of the work. I'm on the parent-end of this now, but I was a former teacher and I am humbled and astounded at all the work these teachers put in to creating an online interface which quite frankly, pales in comparison to the time he spends filling out worksheets and scanning them in and watching videos which is really the extent of it. 

 They create the curriculum weeks in advance and these parents complain they need to take barely an hour out of their day not even helping their kids.

The hardest part is making sure he does it and does it right. Also, the majority of the work can be typed in, but I print out his homework (which amounts to a 2 pg worksheet) and have him hand-write it because that's what he would be doing if he were in school. 

Again as a former teacher I know he still needs to work on his handwriting and I want his teacher to know that HE did it. Honestly, if I didn't care at all he could just sit there and type in wrong answers all day while I scroll my phone."

2020-04-28 15:03,"The thing about being a parent when it gets to be too much, you just have to do more.  When you think you just can’t do it anymore, you still have to do it.  From a baby crying through the night to a toddler tantrum to a teen being out with car in a snowstorm late at night.  Parents need to reach down deep again and again and learn to breathe.  I am full of sympathy ( and guilt that I cannot be of more help) for parents right now... the whole complete burden has crashed down upon them now. Day after day with no end in sight, all the familiar routines just....gone.  Being a parent is hard.  When my kids were little and I’d feel cooped (though nothing like this pandemic) I’d complain to my mom cross country.  She’d say, “Honey, did ya feed them?  Did you get them to bed? Are they still alive?  Are we talking?  Then you did fine.”"

The in-class work for Organic Chemistry is vital to learning the material— so much so,all but 5 students dropped out. My child is struggling. But he’s responsible for managing his work and navigating and that’s what he’s learning, too.

For parents of younger students— If you can’t do it all, do what you can. Most schools use a “spiraling core curriculum”: concepts of science, history, etc. are repeated and expanded at each grade level. Good— your kids will catch up.

For now, focus on keeping and building the Big Skills: reading, writing, math. 

Keep elementary-middle school students reading, reading, reading. Have a dedicated “reading time “ every day. For 30 minutes to two hours (depending on age) dedicate that time to just reading. Children read aloud to you, a page a day. You do it too. Read literature— and history, geography, science. Read your book while they read. Read a book to them. 

Have kids write—not a paper, just a few lines —on what they read that day. These paragraphs could become a paper— but just writing is enough right now. Spelling counts— books and dictionaries are all online free at your public library.

Math. Practice memorization of basic arithmetic and math facts; the times tables, etc. Higher math relies on fluency and speed of recall of these basic skills. Play games that use math, like backgammon, cribbage and many card games.

Take a walk. Laugh. Hug each other. Sleep."

2020-04-28 14:08,"I have been working with my grandchildren. Teaching kids the basics is not the problem. But the process is over complicated, to say the least. One is in second grade, the other in K. Each teacher has many apps. We get at least 8 emails from the school system every week, sometimes 3 or more on a single day. Each teacher uses several different apps. The methodology is ridiculously - and I would argue intentionally - complicated for people not trained in the system. 
Due to this, the kids see themselves as smarter than the parent teacher. They are already more technologically proficient and this encourages them to see their parents, grandparents, as stupid. That undermines authority which is a huge problem and counterproductive to a functioning system.

I have yet to read any stories of school bullying, bullying induced suicides (over 4,000 per year by the way) and of course the horrors of school shootings.

While parents laud their current new world thrust upon them, they can think of it as a hassle to overcome, or the chance in learning how to be a better parent.

100000 years ago we took our children into the forests to hunt, the fields to find food, and into the waters to fish. Today we have, ""bring your child to work day,"" And we wonder why our children have no work ethics?

I've had kids in tears.  As a grandparent caring for school-aged children, I have felt everything described in this excellent article.  And I want to say right away the teachers in this district have been amazing!  They send daily emails, they send cards in the mail, they drive by the house and honk, they have video-chatted on the phone to explain lessons.  But it's just very hard on everyone. Still, it's better this way than spreading the virus, so I'm grateful--to the school, the teachers and Gov Pritzker, and we'll keep on plugging away as long as we need to.  I'm a firm believer in the idea that everyone in a situation needs to do everyone else's job for just one day and we'd all have a better appreciation for one another. Thank you teachers!

When we switched to learning at home, especially knowing I still had to do my job at home with multiple hard deadlines and lots of Zoom collaboration meetings, I did some reading on successful homeschool models done by parents who homeschool all the time. The most important thing I learned was to look for learning opportunities in everyday events. My son can learn from watching a movie or going to the grocery store with me with just a few well-placed questions. Tell me about the main character - what was the problem he had to overcome? Read the price of this item. How much do I have to pay if I buy two of them? Then I take a picture or a video of his learning and text it to his teacher via Remind. She sent home a big packet and we use it sometimes, but I let her know that we would not be doing 5 worksheets every day and that I would still document his learning. Fortunately, my school district supports this and gives parents and teachers a lot of flexibility for learning at home. If your district doesn't, maybe that's a conversation you could have with the principal or school leadership?"

For most, dual incomes are a necessity. Possible ways to change this:  Unlinking healthcare from full time employment, allowing benefit sharing among couples with less that full time employment, and moving closer to family elders and kinship groups.  

America’s work, work, work ethic is soul crushing. Many men have few if any friends outside of the casual friends at work. Many working women still do the lioness’s share of housework. 

My parents were able to raise my brother and me on dad’s modest income. Mom missed working but  stayed home until we were young teens. We had an modest annual vacay to the mountains, dad was off every Christmas, had good health insurance, never brought work home, had ample time after work to play with us and he volunteered with little league, boy scouts, was on the church vestry, and more. The house was modest but paid for about the time I entered college.  The difference between what passed for the most well off and the middle class was not all that wide.

2020-04-28 16:22,"We're all trying to do our best; whether it's parents adjusting to working from home, parents simultaneously working and helping their kids learn, teachers suddenly changing their mode from structured but flexible classrooms to two-dimensional distance learning, to kids struggling with new routines and limited environments.

Teaching has always been hard to do well, and it's become even more challenging.  Parents, in general, do under-appreciate what a good teacher does.

But, I find many of the teacher comments in the realm of ""I told you so"" miss the point.  Parents aren't educated and trained as school teachers.  Teachers aren't required to simultaneously hold a full-time job while teaching.  Parents with more than one child in school deal with differing distance learning modes - the platforms are not consistent in many cases - imagine a parent asking the teacher to use a different platform just for their kid while supporting the other on another.

I know teachers deal with a myriad of behaviors, some very challenging.  But there are kids who can keep it together during the day at school, but release when they are in the safety of home.  Now they are home and at school, without the authority of someone not their parent from whom to listen.  

Couple that with parents learning on-the-fly to homeschool and maintain full-time job concurrently, and it is hard.  The anxiety of making sure you still have a living is immense, let alone the pandemic."

Just to turn them over to state institutions so we could work ourselves to the bone paying for their college educations?  Is that what it's all come down to?

I'm sure she's taking glances outside, because why else would she have spent a good portion of only all of Saturday pulling weeds, killing a few invasive vines, doing over the entire backyard, and then working out afterward? That was exhausting just to watch. 
As far as any of the rest of it, I'll take my military training and my degrees and I'll just keep my fat mouth shut, because if there's anything my decade of service taught me, anything at all, you keep your fat mouth shut when someone's in a fight and just keep on handing them ammunition, fuel, food, and coffee. 
And when they're on leave from the fight, it they want to spend the whole day ripping up the entire yard, seeding, planting, and then working out with weights afterward, to relax, well then, you just let them do that. 
Back in prehistoric times, when we sailed and sailed and sailed, and hit a port, drank up all the beer, and broke a few things here and there, the wise old men would say the same thing, as long as nobody's putting an eye out or making extra dental work, then you just let them do that.

I am extremely lucky that I can make this as a choice and that my job should still be there for me when childcare options return. My friends in education tell me that many school districts are just writing off academics for these last few months. Other schools, like ours, are pushing forward, sending messages daily to alert us to all the assignments our children have failed to do or failed to do properly. When I asked our principal if my struggle was unique, she told me: ""Yes."" The real issue here is one of equity.

2020-04-28 16:36,"It's challenging for parents, teachers, and students to learn in an online environment. It's not an effective environment for developing oral language or critical thinking skills for most children. If it just doesn't work for your child or family (after having given it a multiple attempts) then please just make sure your child reads or is read to, and if possible, does math everyday. And if they will, have them write in a journal, and/or draw, sing, dance, or play an instrument. None of that has to happen online or be totally managed by mom(or dad). Children (depending on age) need the habit of independent responsibility and intellectual work. Think about how much harder next year is going to be if consistent reading isn't happening at the minimum. I work with English Learners and without Zoom sessions, they get little to no practice opportunities to speak in English. Speaking and turn taking is much harder in an online environment. Nonetheless, I appreciate that many parents, even with language support, can not manage the technology or multiple plans from multiple teachers. If you're doing some learning everyday, you're doing something important! So don't beat yourself up. We can't wait to see you--in plain vanilla reality-- in September!"
2020-04-28 16:40,"As a homeschooler, I wish parents realized more that remote learning is very different from the freedom of homeschooling.  I feel for both the teachers and the families struggling right now with situation so far from anyone's ideal.  But to the parents who say, ""I always considered homeschooling and now realize it would be impossible..."" please reconsider!  You're not homeschooling right now--you're trying to follow someone else's plan and requirements at home, generally online, which can be frustrating in the best of times!  Homeschoolers, by definition, do what works best for their families, and if a curriculum or schedule isn't working, they change it.  I think it's fine to tell the schools that you're no longer doing remote learning (I'd encourage it in a lot of situations).  But then, don't consider the school year over--choose books and materials that you and your child(ren) can enjoy together and do what works for all of you.  It's not a choice of remote learning vs. no education, and your children don't need to be left behind.  You're the parent; your children are your responsibility; you're responsible for your children's education...this doesn't change whether your children are in school or homeschooled.  The silver lining in all of this should be a greater realization of the role parents have in educating their children no matter the schooling."

People are allowed to take vacation time when working from home, many just haven’t considered that option.  Only reason not to is concern that summer camps won’t open and one would need the time off then to provide childcare, obviously this is case by case specific, but it could be an option for some who are feeling overwhelmed with work, housework, homework.   An opportunity to get re-organized, a break from non-stop focus on work (which for some who were not used to working from home may have trouble balancing and may feel compelled to always be working).  With all the changes in the world many vacations will be cancelled and postponed.  Some people will have more vacation time then their company would even allow to be rolled into next year (depending on whether companies change those policies).

2020-04-28 16:49,"Reading these comments made me realize that we are an outlier - my 14 and 10-year-olds are thriving in this system of combined distance learning and homeschooling. This may reflect years of training they received in trying to be self-sufficient. For several years now, we have considered schools secondary to self-learning. Ever since my children were little, we tried to cultivate deep intellectual interests in them and help them identify resources to learn on their own. Going to school was to socialize and play, and coming home was when deep learning occurred. My son settled on math; my daughter, chess. Now distance learning is taking a fraction of their previous school time, leaving them with more time to pick up other interests. My son now tutors several children 8 to 14 years old; he gives frequent but short individual math lessons and daily assignments. It's amazing how well he can structure their day. Some of his students would not have touched a single problem no matter what their parents did. But they would follow my son's assignments and happily meet with him - a young but knowledgeable ""teacher"" is far more effective than a parent! I found that as a parent, I am extremely ineffective as a teacher for my children. I used to study math and chess with my daughter, but I disqualified myself for lack of patience. Now she learns on her own and gets occasional help from her brother, who not only has the patience but a genuine interest in her problems."
2020-04-28 16:50,"No question that it's not easy for parents to deal with the isolation, work requirements and full time parenting and teaching.  But parents did this for millenia in one way or another.

Yes, I'm stressed, the teachers are stressed...but I'm most concerned about how this sudden pivot to online learning is causing my kids' anxiety to go through the roof.  They are young and I'm not too concerned about them falling behind, but our school won't advance them unless they finish what I think is an unreasonable amount of work for this time we're in.  I'm trying to prioritize connection and free play, but they still have tremendous responsibilities for school, and I know it's a lot for them to handle on top of the anxiety and fear I also know is in there."
2020-04-28 16:54,"Yes, it's important to limit caffeine and sugar. Some children are even sensitive to artificial dyes, sweeteners, etc. 

Reward systems are important, and can include family games, play time, reading-aloud time. Scissors and glue are big favorites, but can be messy, so... balance that against your needs. Modeling doughs are easy to make with water, salt, and oil, and this can be a calming way to let them play. 

Instead of writing about three characters, you can have them draw the characters (or sculpt them out of modeling clay) and let them describe to you their artwork. They'll remember it more. 

Math should come first. And if they either can't sit still OR if their eyes are kind of just glazing over and they can't seem to process things, let them march up and down the stairs 3 times with their knees and elbows high. If you don't have stairs, then just a ""parade time"" around the room with knees and elbows high. Theoretically, the cross-lateral exercise helps get the brain synapses firing. 

Best of luck. Remember to enjoy it. They do. 

I remember doing a pasting project with my three-year-old. She screamed the whole while, ""no no, not that, this."" I was exhausted. Yet when asked if she enjoyed it, her reply was the most expressive, ""Oh yes."" Three-year-olds experience greater emotional highs and lows than any other age, and six-year-olds are peaking with verbal expression. It's okay to remind your 6's that you can't process ALL of their thoughts plus all of yours."

Google, YouTube and ""common sense"" are not substitutes for a quality education."
2020-04-28 17:06,"What I have seen with remote learning is that the problems with the pedagogical approach in the classroom are exacerbated in this new format. Teachers are forced to focus on children who don’t pay attention and waste other students’ time and far more time is allocated for projects than should be necessary. The assignments are insufficiently challenging or are rushed and insufficiently explained. Reference materials for children are missing. This creates an unbearable environment for young children who want to learn. The school has been frankly hostile to any suggestions of change. I think the idea in some of these comments that this is on the parents is insane. At my job, I am expected to completely adapt to this new situation and accept constructive criticism and that is what me and my colleagues do. Why is there a lower standard for teachers? No one said their job is easy but no one else’s is either - everyone needs to step up to the plate and get things done. Teachers are no exception."
2020-04-28 17:07,"Sorry, I'm going to share a gripe. I am a very experienced and highly-rated online college teacher (after an even longer career as a regular college professor and principal investigator), and my classes are proceeding as usual. No one at my university has asked for my or the other online instructors' help or advice in getting their regular courses online, although they are all scrambling to give each other tips.  I know how to keep the students engaged and how to avoid a lot of the pitfall of online learning. It seems that even the current emergency will not change the habit of dismissing online courses and teachers as second rate. I've volunteered some suggestions, but I'd be more enthusiastic if my salary hadn't been cut by 35% a few months before the pandemic hit, which has prompted me to quit after next fall.  My university could do that because they fought in court to exclude online instructors from the faculty union, regardless of the fact that some of the ""regular"" faculty teach exactly the same online courses as we do at regular union rates. So I hope the experience of hastily-designed online instruction will get some people to appreciate the amount of work, creativity, and planning that goes into a good online course."

From day care, to pre-school care, school, after school care, to nannies, carers, grandparents, neighborhood groups, summer camps,  the amount of time children spend with other people apart from a parent is huge - the amount of time with a parent, minimum.
Parents can't wait for September when their kids are back in school, in order for their adult lives to get back to normal.
Reading the letters I did not see one which said that during this crisis the parents were going to take vacation so one parent could look after the children full time while the other worked,  and visa versa.  
Plenty of complaints though about how they could not get on with their jobs while having to look after the children.

2020-04-28 17:23,"I read this article.  PBS news had couple of segments about parents concerned about their children's birthdays and resorting to virtual parties.  

These are nice stories from two esteemed media channels on the ""have"" problems.  

Over 25 million people have lost their jobs.  Many of the lost jobs include either single income families or both parent losing the jobs.  Then there are also families who have no luxury of doing work from home; they risk exposure to virus as they commute to work while worrying about kids at home.  

These are ""have not"" problems.  

While NYT, PBS and their cohorts do write about plights of the less fortunate, they should do so even more.  

The families with parents working from home and getting overwhelmed by kids' studies should be grateful for the problems they have."

My students, many of whom live at or beneath the poverty line are being devastated.  Being a heavily immigrant and minority community, most of them (I teach high school) and their parents are in the service industries closed by the lockdown.  They don't have income, food nor health insurance.  Some have lost their parents to the virus.  So if my students are unable to participate in my online lessons due to stress, illness, depression, lack of internet or electricity, because they are hungry - it is not the end of the world.  Education is a marathon, if they have a hiccup and lose a few months, their lives will not be dramatically changed.  Do you know what they really need?  To live in a country that cares about them, that has policies that don't just make the rich richer.   It is sickening that hard working decent people lives could be devastated by something as simple a their car breaking down.  It would be nice if our kleptocratic plutocracy actually became a true democracy, a government by the people and for the people."
2020-04-28 17:40,"This may be a bit off topic but related. Looking back at school - mine and my kids - I remember thinking that at least the first half if the year was a rehash of the previous year's stuff at least through the early grades -but even in high school. I understand the need for this. But given that pattern, the kids should be fine, assuming that school is back in Sept. Though THAT may be a big ask. Lets hope it can be. 
The kids / families with good internet access should be fine. It's the kids from economically poorer homes who will suffer the loss of school time in so many ways."

2020-04-28 17:28,"""has seven children, ages 3 to 13,""

Well there is your issue right there.

I have read a recent local story (I think it was six kids, not seven)

The crux of the story was that the still working Dad and the ""never had a job"" Mom couldn't afford food for their kids ""because they weren't in school"" and the school apparently fed them, gratis.

How can we waste time talking about whether kids are getting a proper education at home when we have the slow motion train wreck of people having  kids four, five and six when they can't possibly feed them on their own?

Until we, as a society, get a handle on preventing deadbeat parents from creating the next round of deadbeat parents when those kids are grown, whether kids play fortnite eight hours a day is irrelevant.

And NO!, the answer is absolutely NOT throwing more money at deadbeat parents who act more like rabbits."
2020-04-28 17:47,"Geez, as a teacher, this breaks my heart.  You child is not going to fall behind.  That's not how learning happens.  Really good teaching/learning is about a relationship, not information.  Nurture your relationship with your child, and if the online work is too much, tell the teacher to back off!  Take care during this incredibly stressful time.  I'm as or more worried about my parents than I am about my students."

If I can manage to run a two-hour class every day with Zoom, I don't see what's stopping American teachers from doing the same?"
2020-04-28 17:48,"I homeschooled for many years. Many families that were considering homeschooling spoke with me. I found that the ones that had the greatest difficulty transitioning were teachers because they were trained to keep on schedule with slots for multiple subjects each day. Homeschooling is different. You need the 3 basics every day: reading, writing and math, but other topics are flexible. The point is that the child is engaged and learning pretty much anything. It is enrichment based. I feel for the teachers as they have a prescribed curriculum and are probably terribly frustrated. They need the permission to go off curriculum so they can assign interesting tasks that can be done in any home and allow children to not have a uniform product. Districts would do well to have successful homeschoolers consult with them."
2020-04-28 17:49,"This article basically suggests to me that parents of kids frequently aren't *actually* parents. They breed, they drop their kids off at school, and like, 2/3 of the kid's development is someone else's problem. 

I don't entirely blame them, we live in a culture that commoditizes every last heartbeat of our lives and expects us to have side hustles on our side hustles. 

My ultimate takeaway is that our economy and our culture are incompatible with something as basic as ""raising a child""."
2020-04-28 17:50,"My wife and our elder son are both teachers who are used to putting in long hours. For the most part, parents are learning that their children may not be as perfect students as they think; parents also need to realize that many teachers do not expect children to complete every assignment that gets posted, they are trying to balance the demands of administrators, varying levels of student capabilities and interests. It's only a few months, think of the kids in eastern Europe (e.g. Serbia) who missed years of school due to wars and now working successful careers; things will balance out in the long term."

She teaches about 80 kids: 5 engage regularly on video calls, 5 others have made a little effort, and maybe a total of 20 kids have done anything at all.

When the teachers try to get guidance from above on how to grade the kids, especially the kids who have done nothing...crickets. 

The education system is such a top down control structure that no one dares point out that the Emperor has no clothes. And yet the teachers toil on...pounding big rocks into little rocks...exhausting themselves in the process while being intimidated by their overseers.

I convinced my wife to watch an interview with our child's high school principal glossing effusively at all the incredible things going on without managing to say anything of real substance.

Kids above 5th grade generally should be mature enough to handle some learning on their own, even if it’s just reading and writing about it (yes, that includes books on biology and associated sciences).  Mathematics poses a different subset of problems (no puns intended!).  But reading about famous physicists or astronomers might pique their interests for future learning.  Students below 5th grade only need to read and be read to.  Everybody gets art thru a watercolor set (or crayons).  Gym is outdoor play (or inside exercising).  Some is fun, some is hard.  Some needs adult supervision, but most does not.

So, after a short ""school day"" at the kitchen table, my kids cooked, read, played, went on nature walks, met with homeschooling friends.  That's the part that can't happen now because of COVID-19.

If there's a serious question about any particular child, then that child gets a do-over, and repeats the grade. And I dare say there'll be many in this situation.

We homeschool AND I work full time from home.  At the beginning of the quarantine, I initially felt more sympathy for parents trying to figure out how to teach and work from home, but seriously, people, it is not as hard as you are making it.  This comment might upset some parents, but I hope at least parents of very young children will take note.  Learn how to parent, already."
2020-04-28 18:20,I've struggled with my own kids. Schools teach less discipline these days.. kids are not forced to sit through boring classes or dont get enough consequences for not doing homework. My kids always answer... we are allowed to throw away food at school.. we are allowed to not do what we dont like at school. We dont need to go out of the way to make classes THAT interesting for kids. Real jobs often are not that interesting. My 5 yr old will tell me that I hurt his feelings if I tell him to shower again if he didn't do a good job the first time.. he is learning to be emotional from a young age. It would have been okay if US had 100% gainful employment at awesome wages or if everyone was a trust fund baby. My kids will have to prepare to live in a hard world.
2020-04-28 18:30,"For parents of younger children who are struggling: 
Nearly all of my relatives (multi-generational) work as teachers or in education, including for a major platform that schools are widely using during the pandemic. One teaches at an elementary school featured as a global model for distance learning. They all agree that online learning is maybe effective for children 3rd grade and up. Yes some like Khan Academy are better, and games are fun, but for instruction-based learning -- many school platforms aren't effective nor were developed for PK-2. 

So in case your younger kids are reacting poorly to it like mine is, don't feel badly. The younger ones need to develop fine motor skills (including for brain development) and require engagement/activity-based learning. They are generally not capable of independent study nor learning through a computer."
2020-04-28 18:34,"Reading this article, and these comments, makes me feel an array of emotions.  I feel unbelievably fortunate for my family's situation - we have our health, our jobs, and resources for our kids (9 and 11) to help them succeed with online learning.  I feel compassion for those families on the brink (of poverty and sanity).  I particularly feel for the educators.  This setup is not something any of us are used to.

We need to do our best during these last few weeks of the academic year, but the real question is what happens *after* the pandemic?  How will education as we know it in the U.S. change?  There have been valid complaints about our educational system before this - will they be heard and addressed before schools are back in session?  What about ""common core"" and mandatory tests?  Is anyone studying whether kids can actually learn better with a combination of in-school and online learning?  Will our teachers get more of the resources many of them desperately need?  

If nothing else, coronavirus is revealing many of the questions and disparities in our educational (and healthcare) system that have been neglected for too long.  I don't have any answers, but I hope parents, educators, and administrators can work together to make real, positive changes for all of our kids."
2020-04-28 18:39,"The readers telling parents to be more appreciative of what teachers do are just wrong. Teachers aren't being asked to teach children while simultaneously doing another job at the same time. If anything, this crisis has revealed some big problems in education. My school district's response to remote learning has been sluggish and uneven, at best. The teachers and administrators have not been able to adapt to the moment. The teacher's union has been an obstacle to thinking outside the box. I hope this pandemic has made it clear that teachers should be required to take classes to make them more familiar with online tools that the business world takes for granted because many of them have seemed utterly baffled by technology in the year 2020. Educators should never be caught this unprepared to teach remotely again."
2020-04-28 18:49,"Couple of thoughts.

First of all, this isn't homeschooling. In homeschooling, you (and ideally, your child) decide what curriculum you use, how much to assign, and how to schedule your time. If you want to skip school one day to do baking and call that ""math and science"", you can. If you want to schedule all your ""schoolwork"" for three days a week and spend the rest of the week hiking, you can. (Also, you probably spend time with other kids in extracurriculars.)

Even if you use a boxed curriculum, you get some leeway with how you implement it... and you probably have at least one parent who isn't working to earn money and can devote the day to childcare and schooling.

Many homeschoolers also outsource some classes, either to in-person classes or to computer classes. This isn't that either. In a normal online course, the teacher made their lesson plan in advance to take advantage of the medium. They didn't have to suddenly redo their planned classwork for computers on the fly. Also, their students all have their own dedicated time to use the computer (or their own computers, period) because their parents planned for this - they aren't sharing out one laptop and one smartphone among three kids and Mom's job.

Plus, either way, in normal homeschooling things are *normal*. They're not stressed, they're not worried, there isn't a pandemic keeping you inside and away from friends.

We’re in quarter four now and students have been using our remote learning platforms since regular classes began in September. Students know how to access the curriculum, yet about half are choosing not to do so.
Many young people are using the emergency as an excuse to check out. They are emboldened by the messages contained in stories like this and frustrated home situations.
Now project forward when classes resume in September. Think about how the value of education will have been damaged by the learned helplessness that allows them to just play Fortnite."

Schools and teachers are doing the best they can under the circumstances, but most are getting it wrong.

Parents and their children should work together to take what they can from distance-learning and skip the parts that aren’t beneficial. When my children aren’t interested in their assignments I let them propose an alternative lesson or activity in the same subject area. It works well for us."

It was tough for many years but now he is about to graduate from college Magna Cum Laude. He has transitioned seamlessly to this situation.

Another thing that should be clear to everyone is: learning on computer is NOT for everyone. Most kids need human interaction. It doesn't matter how well designed and personalized an educational software is, it can only be a supplementary tool. Most kids need the attention and encouragement from teachers and parents. Only a very small fraction of the kids are self-motivated enough to learn online.
Bottom line, we need more teachers and we need to pay them better."

School is GOOD for kids! In normal times, no one questions this basic truth at all. How is it that we're losing sight of this during a pandemic? I know some people are scared to venture out of their homes but we started sheltering in place in order to give the hospitals a chance to catch up, not wait it out the virus for years until there is a vaccine.

I have families who struggle with the balance and can’t get their kid to do anything. I have families not in much contact because they don’t have internet, and I’m just happy to know they’re safe.


I am a little worried about all these comments about “kids won’t fall behind”. We always see a huge dip in reading levels after summers if kids don’t keep reading. It will be even worse this fall.

Having been an educator for 40+ years, I worry about children from homes where parents are unable to help children for a variety of reasons.

2020-04-28 20:42,As a teacher and a parent the lack of usual educational progress by our youth is one of the most disturbing aspects of this COVID virus pandemic. Children are losing a year of learning progress in their lives. Life is Darwinian. Most success and upward mobility requires education. This group of kids will always be at a competitive disadvantage with people older than them or their coming competitors who did not experience this deprivation. A few of their peers will be fitter due to highly dedicated and skilled home schooling by a few parents. Some may receive specialized help and tutoring to make up deficits. Most will move towards the left side of the Bell Curve and become discouraged by the coming difficulties that they are not prepared tp overcome.

My suggestion: purchase a child friendly picture book of Anne Frank or the book: Where the Sunflowers Grow by my former colleague and friend Amy Lee-Tai about her grandmother’s experience in a Japanese internment camp in the US. Have children look around the world at how so many unfortunate poor children live and how less fortunate children live in poverty in the US. These parents need to get on-line at for some structure for small amounts and to get in-line. Chin-up. Pull yourself together!"
2020-04-28 7:34,"I know quite a few people who do home schooling, not because they want to teach their children creationism, but because they want to teach them the official learning programme in a less straining way.

Until the age of 10-11, one hour of teaching per day is more than enough to get to children to learn what they are supposed to do. Not a full day. They can then try so solve some maths problems on their own.

So if parents can spend 1 hour with their children every day, they should manage, especially if they are educated, as the people mentioned in the article seem to be.

But they have to devote that hour to their children in full, and not just tell them every 5 minutes ""do your work"" and then switch straight back to their work laptop. They can devote the time they saved on commuting to their children.

2020-04-28 22:17,"This article inspired me to re-read a note sent to parents by a school psychologist on the first day of SIP...""I think we need to put all of this in perspective regarding how critical it is to lose some months of classroom education. Our children will continue to learn. Not only will they learn from books and online learning, but this is an opportunity to be creative, to learn practical life skills, and learn how to handle challenging situations."""
2020-04-28 21:18,Can we just agree that every student all over the world will be a couple months behind and call this school year over?
2020-04-28 21:15,"After France fell to the Nazis in 1940 until the liberation of Paris in 1944, my mother-in-Law and her siblings, all under 10 in 1940, were hidden on a farm.  They escaped death in the gas chambers.  They also missed 4 years of schooling.  
All of them subsequently learned the basics of language and math.  The only boy became an engineer.  Because of poverty, the girls became seamstresses.
My father-in-Law and his brother were in a Catholic orphanage (pretending not to be Jews) and had a bit more daily schooling from the nuns.  He became an electrician (I know longer remember his late brother’s occupation.)
Of these 5 survivors, 4 immigrated to the US and had to learn English, although they had never received instruction in it during their years in France.
My point is that what is happening now is happening to everyone.  When all students (not a persecuted minority in daily fear of genocide) had the final part of the school year interrupted— for a matter of months, while they stayed home with their families— everyone is mostly in the same situation.  Next year’s curriculum should look very different from what was planned, especially in the upper grades.  Next year’s graduation requirements should be loosened.
Virtually all American children will survive the pandemic.  Every American child should be supported in learning what they missed at a reasonable pace when the danger has passed.  And everyone, lighten up!"
2020-04-28 22:55,"I am one of those who is fortunate enough to telework. And we have been pushed to step in as teachers. This has been extremely challenging especially because our kids are not old enough to be self-directed learners (8 and 6) yet. In the beginning, I would tell them to go work on their daily assignments, only for them to return to me in 5 minutes asking what something meant. Then they would start winning, and I have a meeting in 2 minutes. What am I going to do? I would tell them to go watch Netflix, which would inevitably devolve into a multi-hour TV session. I started to take a couple of hours off in the morning to supervise them and that seemed to make a difference."
2020-04-28 23:12,"I get a little distressed when I read about kids being directed to a computer screen rather than to a book to read or a map to study.  Your kids could be learning a little Latin, memorizing countries, or committing short poems to memory, to recite at the dinner table to you all, to show off their learning and maybe entertain everyone a little.  A little lofty, but, why not?  And yes, I am a parent but my son is grown--and consistently was in the top 10 of his school in GeoBee competitions."
2020-04-28 23:27,"As a volunteer at a San Jose Middle School, teaching one business class to low-income 8th graders I am in awe of teachers.  Teachers do not get a moment's rest or reflection.  The students require all your attention, start to finish.  Love working with them.  My lesson has been how hard teachers work for low pay, nominal respect.  I think there will be many post-COVID lessons, one being, a new era in US education.  That is if our elected officials get the lesson dealing with children at home or have they outsourced to nannies?"
2020-04-28 23:30,"It is important to remember that every person has been directly or indirectly impacted by this pandemic. We need to remember that students in New York City started the school year in September 2019-March 2020, that is about 7 months of educational instruction. During these months they acquired numerous skills, routines and most importantly an educational foundation was made. Students will fall behind is a statement that is misused and demoralizes educators. Let's be clear, learning starts at home, although many would like to think that it is the sole responsibility of the schools. This pandemic is changing that perspective."
2020-04-28 23:51,"A few things we don't know about coronavirus and the schools, and need to know to plan children's future education: How contagious is the virus among young schoolchildren? Are they likely to get it from or give it to, teachers? Are asymptomatic children really carriers who can give the disease to others, notably their grandparents  -- or do grandparents really have little to fear from seeing their grandchildren? That is, are our current best guesses about transmissibility in schools too pessimistic -- or too optimistic? If it turns out that fine coronavirus particles can linger in the air for hours perhaps piggybacked on pollution particulates, what's our Plan B for safely reopening schools and workplaces?

We also don't really know how useful across-the-board online education is at actually teaching children the subjects they are supposedly learning. Individuals who are well-motivated, sure -- but everybody? And parents are discovering why society hired teachers in the first place, rather than just letting parents teach children everything they need to learn."
2020-04-29 1:17,"Half-a-century ago, when I was 7 years old, my parents kept me home for a whole year, because of chronic illness. I was tutored in basic arithmetic for 15 minutes a day, and aside from that I was left to my own devices, in the care of an older sibling who was in high school with whom I shared a bedroom. As we would fall asleep, my sibling would relate everything he had learned in school in the simplest way he could, and thought a seven year old could relate to. During the day, I was bored out of my skull, and had only the many books in the house to pore through.

When I went back to school the next year, I was not only comfortably ahead of my classmates in that grade, I was ahead of the pack, academically, for several years more, without breaking a sweat.

There is too much pedagogical orthodoxy around these days, about assignments, measurements and all the rest. And virtual schooling during the lockdown is often just a reactive process born out of fear of ""falling behind"" and a grieving process, in a way, for the school experience that is vanished until fall this year, or beyond.

We're thrusting a bad simulacrum of normalcy on the kids. Leave them be. Life is long and convoluted, and they will be fine. They won't fall ""behind"" anything."
2020-04-29 1:38,"First day of lockdown was a total mess. I got overwhelmed at the thought of what lay ahead, my husband had to leave a conference call to calm us all down. Now however many days in and lucky enough to be on the other side of Covid-19, the only thing I care about is how many smiles I get out of our kids each day. Everything else can wait."
2020-04-29 1:53,"As a teacher, all I can say is ""Poor you"".   I am expected to work with a whole room full of students every day, meeting each one of their needs and learning styles.  That you have had to try to help your own children with their lessons for a month should not be breaking you.  It is an indication that you did not teach your children how to behave - you expected their teachers to do it.
Perhaps if you spent more time with your children, teaching them how to behave in various situations, teaching them patience, and that some things they don't want to do are not optional, you would not be having such difficulty now, and their teachers might have fewer students who don't take their lessons seriously, have little control over their impulses, and don't seem to know how to behave properly."

Medical professionals from the American Association of Pediatrics say the screen time should not be more than one hour for children between the age of three and five. And the screen time in children aged between ages six and 12 should not exceed 2 hours a day.

Parents have the right  to tell schools that their family rules prohibit X much screen time, that your young child will not be  participating in too much time on a tablet.  
This lockdown a good time for parents to take a look at what is known about cell phone EMF's and the attention span, and brain cancers. Then consider whether you want your community to escalate to  5G microwave small cell antennas put up at intervals outside your homes, or at the bus stop, outside parks and  reopened schools. The Environmental Health Trust has good information on 5 G.( I ran into the above article when I duck duck go'ed the subject.) Stop the ""roll-out"". ( lol, ed curriculum term).

Turn your router off at night for a mini wifi break, and make sure the games are not always running, especially where a child sleeps. Teach the child to turn off the game after use, and only turn on your wifi printer when you're ready to print."
2020-04-29 2:47,"I thought this article was about parents coping with the hardship of working from home in a truly perilous economy, trying desperately to get by, while at the same time worrying about whether their children have completed all of the online assignments and are receiving an adequate education? I have two sons and own two businesses in New York City. Like many other people, I am working incredibly long hours just to keep my entire team employed and also help my kids succeed in school. Overnight, I took on the role of teacher, coach, a CEO and entrepreneur, hairstylist, IT guy, chef, Zoom happy hour attendee, dog groomer and everything else required. I truly respect and appreciate our teachers. However, I feel that some of the comments are very defensive. The people carrying the heaviest load here are definitely working parents. This article highlights that struggle.  Everyone should show some empathy for what people are experiencing and save the pedantic comments for the classroom."
2020-04-29 2:52,"I teach an elementary school (K-4) in San Francisco.  I don't have a homeroom: I am a specialist teacher, with 20 classes a week.  I present lessons to, organize, teach, and clean up after some 250 students a week.  I have twenty three 5-yr-olds at a time.  
Sometimes alone, and exhausted.   

I don't have children, but I know how to manage them, care for them, make sure they feel safe.   I am an experienced teacher with patience to the moon.
Us educators of young children have had to pivot quickly into a teaching format none of us were trained for.   It's OK: we figure it out, deal with it, and do the best under the circumstances.

When I hear of parents critiquing teachers lesson plans and methods during ""distance learning,"" it frankly boils my blood.  

To the parents who need to leave the house to perform essential duties and help their children learn:  hang in there.  That sounds tough.

To the parents who have the luxury of not working, and have the time to help their child do homework:  sack up.  It is a gift. 

Teachers are perpetually undervalued.  A NYTimes article that centers on that subject is curiously missing from reporting."
2020-04-29 0:08,"I was an at home freelance artist working consistently when my 2 kids were born and while they were in elementary school.  


As a stay at home mom I was asked or it was assumed that I would be more than happy to look out for other people’s kids on snow days or when they had to work late etc. 

As the parents would drop their kids off at my house￼ on a snow day 
or 
tell me they could not pick up their kids because “a meeting had run late”, 

in a harried voice they would say something along the lines of 

“ Oh, you are so lucky to be able to hang out with the kids !” 

And I was! 
But it was a lot of work!!!! 

There was the time when I had just finished a piece of artwork that was on my dining room table and as I was making macaroni and cheese for the kids one of the kids took a bottle of ink and dropped drops all along my artwork! 
Or when I was going to watch a friend’s kid on a snow day and the parent showed up with not only their kid but three other kids￼￼ I did not even know !”

So, my point is not to complain. 

But it is to remind those that think that it’s just an absolute joy to be with “the kids” 
is a myth! 
It’s wonderful SOMETIMES
but not ALL the time￼!

Raising kids,caring for kids and just being with kids is one of the hardest jobs in the world. (being a caregiver and a parent, now that’s a SAINT !) 

So let’s not just appreciate, 
LETS COMPENSATE !

PAY TEACHERS MORE!"

And children are especially resilient and adaptive by virtue of their unformed bodies and brains.  The important thing is to not allow them to be traumatized, or to poison their young minds in any other way, during this period.  Encourage them to learn and grow, just like good parents do, and they will be fine."
2020-04-29 10:19,"Who ever said teaching was easy?  I'm put off by the comments from educators saying ""now you know how I feel.""  

My wife and I work full time jobs that require much attention.  We are also parents and dedicate nearly all of our extra time to that.  The point is that throwing a third job on top of that (which we take seriously) in the midst of Covid is nearly impossible to do.  Our approach is 1) work as a team 2) lower expectations for what we can do in all three areas and 3) find the gratitude in being able to spend more time with our children."
2020-04-29 11:11,"Our 5 yr old granddaughter lives in NYC. Like so many kids her age she is struggling and angry now. She’s exhibiting new negative behaviors: tantrums, being oppositional, pulling her hair. She no longer wants to dance. But a day ago she shared this with her family: “I know the virus is long and we’re all stuck at home but we are with our families and we can still talk to our friends. Just go on video chat. We’re all safe and we’re all there together and we’re all here for each other in New York City.” Perspective, wisdom, sigh."
2020-04-29 12:27,"Here’s my thought.   It’s already very stressful on a lot of moms and dads when you consider both usually hold down full time jobs with added anxiety brought on by the pandemic and trying to work at home and maybe some financial strains due to it.   On top of that, what kid really wants to have mom and dad trying to teach them math and other subjects while trying to work at home.  It might work for some.  The kids go nuts as well as the parents.   

I would simply forget about the rest of the school year and have principals and administrators focus on researching techniques and strategies for teaching in the fall.  Perhaps start school a few weeks earlier than normal.  The kids are going to be fine if they miss a few months of school...really."
2020-04-29 12:42,"As a teacher at a private school, I am on the other side of all this, and I am seeing the privilege that money in private education truly brings - continuing education during a crisis. All my students have had plenty of technology training in school and have had their own chromebooks for years. While we are using the Google platforms more, almost nothing is truly new. I had about 90% participation from my students on day one, and each day I'm probably at about 95% participation for Google Meets, homework, project. etc. We very carefully train our small classes from the first day of MS to communicate with their teachers and develop organization and study skills. They have all their necessary curriculum and books. While my students aren't perfect or learning as thoroughly as they would in my classroom, the class will still complete my curriculum and hit all their essential learning goals. They are self-motivated and have parental support and engagement. Perhaps - perhaps learning success for our students at home now depends on a number of factors, definitely including age and economic status, but perhaps mostly on what the students and teachers have been doing from August - March that can translate easily to home."
2020-04-29 12:55,"I am a teacher and I strongly value education. And the joy of the classroom should be one that every child gets to celebrate. On the other hand, I was in Rwanda after the Civil War running a high school, and we had many students who had missed a year or two or three. Some of them graduated at age 20 or 22 and are now productive members of society. Of course that isn’t ideal, but what matters most is that we give children love and understanding, and responsibilities, whether they are reading books at home, helping to clean the house or going off to school. In other words, one of the main responsibilities of the school is to raise good people and that is what parents must do as well. The actual content of learning can come later and we will all be able to get through that part of it."
2020-04-29 13:15,"I always took school seriously, raised with the value that education is one of the most important things.  That’s why it is so immensely frustrating to me to attempt remote learning right now.  

Beside a kindergartner, I have a preschooler and an infant.  The 6 yr needs support for her schoolwork, but it is impossible to give her the support she needs while also caring for the other two. If the kids were all a little older, I think it might be possible.  But it’s not possible now.

It’s frustrating because I badly WANT her to complete everything.  I want to teach her that education is so important that we need to continue it even during these times.  But at some point I realized that the frustration and stress it was causing us all wasn’t worth it for a couple months of kindergarten.  It wasn’t just causing her stress and frustration, but it spilled over on her siblings too.  We make an honest go at it for an hour every morning , then turn to other things."

I have a high schooler and I have no idea how involved I am supposed to be in that, beyond nagging him to turn in assignments.  And how will this affect his college applications next year?  We haven't been able to visit schools like we planned.  And I have an ADHD 3rd grader who can barely concentrate, and it's a daily battle.  Honestly, I am exhausted and doing a terrible job.  This is not a sustainable model.   Not only for our kids, but for the adults.  I have a job and have to make a living and putting homeschooling on us is too much.  I know I can't do it."

I am guessing that (almost) no one commenting on this site was actually forced to have children. Why have them at all if it's such a pain to deal with them?  Is this how your thinking went just prior to getting pregnant (or getting your partner pregnant): ""I know: I will give birth to children, have to put up with them for about four years, then after that they will be someone else's responsibility. I'll see them now and then at dinner time (maybe), but for the most part they'll just be out of my hair. What a relief that will be."" 

We are in the middle of a pandemic. Everyone is having to deal with something--their own illness, elderly parents, loneliness, job loss, lack of toilet paper, whatever it is. But I think it is safe to say that quite literally no one is whining quite like the American parent is whining right now about having to deal with *their own* children."

I homeschooled four kids from first grade through high school and they all went to college and graduate/law schools and the love learning. Just read. And try to keep yourself okay. 

It’s uncharitable and judgmental to criticize parents who find the rules have changed and their lives upended. Until you  are a parent don’t presume to know how it feels to have the responsibility of protecting and caring for another, helpless human being as your main job in life. Yes man6 have chosen this but again the rules have changed."

To be clear, I have always supported paying teachers more and equipping them with greater resources, and will continue to do so after the pandemic. But the problem being highlighted in this article is not that parents had no idea how hard teachers worked until the parents had to do the teaching work themselves. The problem highlighted here is that parents are struggling to work their full-time jobs while also teaching their young children (another full time job).

As someone in this boat myself, I am exhausted. I feel like I’m performing at a mediocre level both as my son’s teacher and also in my own job. It is not sustainable to expect that those of us lucky enough to retain our jobs will now also concurrently assume another full-time job for which we are not trained. This is the major theme of the article."

2020-04-29 22:21,I am enjoying all the comments here. Too many parents abdicated discipline and responsibilities in order to be their kid’s friends. How is that working out? Your kids acting up and acting out is a reflection of your indifference or passing the buck.
2020-04-29 17:09,"Our commander-in-chief has shown that education, skill, and knowledge are clearly not essential for success in modern Republican politics, television entertainment, medical practice, or military command (he knows so much more than all those experienced generals, intelligence officials, and public health scientists, due to his swollen brain). He has shown that reading and writing are a waste of time and that critical thinking is a detriment when one has total authority and a collaborating cable channel.  So point your kids in the ‘right’ direction and stop worrying about their schooling."
2020-04-29 18:29,"Great!  In a few years we will have more people suspicious of or ignorant about science and education.  

Many parents in NYC pushed to close the schools — so now ... they are stuck with the consequences of what they collectively asked for.  It is unfortunate but parents advocated for this ... they just never thought through the consequences."
2020-04-29 23:17,"Some of these comments are missing some critical factors to take into consideration... 
1.Because of this unprecedented pandemic, overnight, parents were faced with figuring out how to continue their child’s education. It’s not that we can’t deal with it, it’s that we had no physical or mental preparation for it. Any household that was already homeschooling undoubtedly carried on with little disturbance to their daily academic routine. Their system was already in place. 
2. The added fuel in suddenly having to homeschool our kids is the parents who simultaneously are trying to work from home for maybe the first time ever. 
3. We’ve always appreciated our kids educators. But as teachers here have stated, teaching in a structured school environment where the kids know what to expect, to kids that aren’t your own is a very different dynamic than parents suddenly stepping in as the teacher at home. 
4. If suddenly everyone with no kids had to take on 24 hour teaching and supervising of children I have no doubt that they would be overwhelmed and frustrated. 
This is about what we were (justifiably) unprepared for. All of our daily lives have been upended and we are all trying to adapt to the many stresses and uncertainties we are facing. It’s a new world for all of us. I have only compassion for every human trying to make it through!"
2020-04-29 23:39,"I have taught online school for a number of years, and while they work very well for some students that number is a minority.  Whenever one of my ""in person"" students talked about moving to the online platform because they thought it would be easier, I would make sure they knew that is generally not true.  
Most students need camaraderie and class community, active discussion, and a physically present adult directing their learning.  That's not possible right now. 
Teachers are scrambling  to create lessons from scratch without access to their teaching materials, and relying on technology they don't usually use, and wouldn't use in a normal situation.
Teachers would much prefer to be in the classroom with your children.  Please give them grace.  And parents deserve grace as well.  There is no work life balance for anyone right now. This is an unprecedented situation.  Hug your kids, tell them you love them, and do your best."

But truth is, I expected the teachers and school systems to adapt to online instructions asap... Isn't it their job? Yeap, sometimes any job can get hard. My manager expected me to adapt, all of your managers expected the same. This is our responsibility, appreciated or not."
2020-04-30 2:53,"Be parents. Do your job better. If your kids aren’t able to work independently by middle school, there’s more work to be done on your part. 

Personally, I enjoy my time helping my 3 children (5th, 7th, 9th grade) with their work and adding more lessons I wouldn’t otherwise be able to teach them. We also get a lot of time outside for sports etc. without the usual schlep from school to home to practice. It’s been fun and rewarding. I think we will look back on this fondly as long as we all make it through safely."

2020-04-30 3:18,Thank you for this article!! I appreciate hearing how other families are coping with COVID 19 when we have to be so socially distanced. I loved the post that said to take a deep breath and hug our children and that no one is giving out trophies for learning right now. It made me smile because my son placed 10 heart stickers on my arm today as I was trying to help with his homeschooling work.  To me it felt like the biggest badge of honor - he could see the love pouring out of my hands to him. I in turn gave him and his brother the best sticker I could find when they were done with their work. It was a small gesture inspired by my 7 year old but it said “I see you and I appreciate how hard you are trying”.  So if I could I would give you all a heart or star sticker too to say: “I appreciate how hard you are all trying” because as Mr. Rogers from my home town in Pittsburgh said when adults and children try their best they can do really great things!
2020-04-30 5:32,"I remember for years how dismissive general culture and people were of those who home schooled their kids. the inference was the parents were stupid religious bigots teaching their kids noahs ark as a scientific fact.

teaching your kids at home isn't so easy, is it? maybe time to show a little respect to those who do.

interesting too is how many parents just are incapable of being parents. sorry but for the vast majority of human history this is precisely how things were. you did your job as best you could and chances are your kids were home or with you. it's not some major struggle to spend time with your kids and teach them. 

i have two kids."
2020-04-30 16:10,"Alas...If only the parents had paid attention when they were going to school and learned something instead of being moved on to the next grade by ""social promotion"" they could probably understand the lesson they are supposed to be helping on.
(Yes, ended the sentence with a ..... Ah, you remembered!)"
2020-04-30 18:20,"The author focused primarily on the elementary school aspects of the situation.  What about standard high school subjects, such as trigonometry, calculus, physics, and chemistry, the teaching of which requires deep subject knowledge as well as teaching skills?  Few parents have the depth and breadth to even attempt to monitor their children's work in these subjects. Alas, the students' losses are our nation's losses."
2020-05-01 1:39,"I am a physician (rheumatologist) working from home right now doing telephone visits and my husband is food entrepreneur. We have three kids ages 12,9,9. The 12 yr old is self sufficient and managing online school fine. My 9yr old boys are harder to manage . I find
myself unable to keep track of what class they have and what homework they due on line . Between calling my patients, keeping kids on track, and checking all the the different apps for them I feel frenzied by 5’pm. It’s true you never really get into a daily rhythm as the kids are don’t self manage their time without us checking on them. All it takes is one of them to get off track and we end up at 7 pm realizing one slipped through the cracks that day :)"
2020-04-28 10:48,This isn't surprising - there are no independent Unions or any other people organisations in China. The CCP rules supreme and has absolute power. And you know what they say about that.
2020-04-28 10:28,"Same story everywhere when services are managed by the ruling elite, whether it’s the CCP in China or big business in the US."
2020-04-28 10:59,What an insightful story. Who would have guessed?  Thank you. This is why reading the Times is important. To learn that the Chinese Communist Party controls they Chinese Red Cross.
2020-04-28 11:20,"I've not forgotten how past funds have been misappropriated by the Red Cross during times of crisis like 9/11, which is why I will never ever donate to that group again!

To read that China was abusing the situation isn't surprising!

Their threats to withhold PPE from the United States.  Their actions that have dried up rivers to neighboring countries.  Their threats and violent actions in the South China Sea.  Their refusal to do something about the repeated epidemics that originate from the country!  

The only thing that surprises me now is the fact that our elected leaders don't recognize, or acknowledge, the new China Normal... which is a real threat to the safety and security of the world!"
2020-04-28 12:00,"The Chinese government has a transparency problem because  it does not welcome a free press.  But here in the West the government is supposed to be transparent, but  the private sector is not required to be transparent.  

As large and powerful as some corporations are in this country, what is the difference between here and China?   

Here in the West transparency in high places is effectively neutralized by the right to privacy.   So actually we don't have the right to know either.  

Why should corporations have privileges without responsibilities?  A functional solution would be to require all corporations beyond a certain size to be as transparent as the government."
2020-04-28 13:07,"The thing is the Red Cross in China has pretty much lost its credibility after multiple scandles of misappropriation of money was exposed, especially the one in 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Since that scandle was revealed, the confidence in the CCP and Red Cross declined to the lowest point ever. 

Even though the CCP leadership has pledged to reform Red Cross, few, if any, progress has been made. An important point is that the CCP will do anything to increase its legitimacy and credibility whether by controlling meida content or arousing nationalist feelings, but the failure to increase people's confidence in Red Cross indicates possible factions inside the leadership. I suspect that someone who is against President Xi has provided the Red Cross with protection, so despite countless efforts to reform this organization, Red Cross in China is still what it was ten years ago. 

Politics in China is more complicated than we think. It's  interesting to find out that President Xi may not have absolute grip over the party from scandles of Red Cross."
2020-04-28 12:49,"I am so tired of the endless China bashing that our government and media has engaged in. It is counterproductive at best and dangerous at worse. By focusing on scapegoating China, we have on both conscious and unconscious levels  reinforced the perception of China as ""other"". I believe that this has been part of the reason  that our response has been so delayed and inadequate. Remember the ""relief"" when this hit Italy because then we would get some ""real"" information and see how a modern Western nation could successfully deal with Covid without resorting to the ""draconian"", ""totalitarian"" and ""Maoist"" strategies employed by China. Then to our astonishment and horror, we saw this thing literally steamroll Italy. Oops. It really doesn't matter what China publicly said, they gave us a step by step playbook of how to handle this. What they did to contain and mitigate was literally visible by satellite and based on sound reasoning and science. If we did not see them as ""other"" we would have appreciated the severity of the threat sooner and would have followed their, now proven, strategies. We are blaming them for our own failures and continuing to do so will jeopardize the global cooperation that is required to deal with this and future pandemics."
2020-04-28 11:55,"Let's make sure in our wonderful nation that individual rights and freedoms predominate over any government controls! I am also concerned that our ""freedom of the press"" is being targeted! We need for the press to print the truth without any biased spin!"
