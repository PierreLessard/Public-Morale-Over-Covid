2020-06-16 16:34:19,"I will watch to confirm what we already know, that politics got in the way of a global pandemic in America.

The idea that Trump will hold an indoor rally in Tulsa this Saturday illustrates just how far people are willing to go to support him. Trump's denial (and protection) of the risks associated with doing this comes down to a signed waiver, any potential loss of life is just collateral damage to him. He will take no responsibility, they came knowing the odds he will say, and take it as the ultimate compliment."
2020-06-16 17:02:43,"While I'm not sure the question will ever be answered, I wonder what the Trump administration's true role was in failing to mitigate this crisis.  Is it possible that Trump's dismantling of government is responsible for the failure to contain the virus before it reached crisis levels?  Is it possible that America's failure then echoed throughout the world, given that we are typically a global leader in critical medical and scientific matters.  

There is a story I heard about researchers at other disease control centers in the world who look to the CDC for leadership and guidance in times like this.  But with Trump at the helm, the CDC was not even returning phone calls during the crisis.   If the CDC and other agencies hadn't been cut off at the knees, would the world look different today?"
2020-06-16 16:38:46,"IDK, a documentary about the 1992 riots following the Rodney King verdicts sounds like ""coverage of the ongoing protests."""
2020-06-16 19:57:23,Oh come on. We already know the answer. This is NOT fresh need.
2020-06-17 02:08:13,I think crass politics was the underlying cause of the conspicuous failure.
2020-06-17 04:16:27,"Against the highly educated advice of medical professionals and the pleas of local elected representatives, Trump intends to hold his campaign gathering in a city and state where the COVID pandemic is actively propagating.  He expects participants to sign waivers of liability, while he and his immediate acolytes will only meet vetted and tested participants - in his protected bubble on high.

      I can't but help but think that infections will occur, seeding other interstate locations across the country days later, and that ultimately deaths will result.  

     To suggest that this pestilent President isn't aware of this likelihood only confirms his willingness to sacrifice lives in pursuit of his political ends. 

     What more does a reasonable citizen need to know about the moral depravity of this man?  A man aspiring to lead this wounded Nation for four more years?  

   I'm sickened at the prospect, the possibility of both tragedies occurring.  June 20, 2020 should be marked as a day of infamy."
2020-06-17 00:56:09,"The hot mess of this crisis begins with the GOP undermining of every effective agency of the state that could have played a leading role. 

Then, prior to Covid19, the anti-science Trump dismantles the White House Office on Pandemic Preparedness! You know, because Obama thought it was a good idea...

Why isn't everyone making a bigger deal of the fact that the very Trump that has hot messed this entire crisis, is the same Trump that dismantled the White House pandemic office. 

And what happened to the CDC? They bungle testing and then are never heard from again - during a pandemic!

It is as if even Trump critics are going light on Trump because the situation is such a national disgrace and threat to the American brand."
2020-06-17 01:55:47,"Watching it right now, I'm curious just when Trump knew about covid."
2020-06-11 13:18:31,"I suppose that's a kind of hope, a double lung transplant.  I'd rather have a vaccine, thanks."
2020-06-11 13:24:01,I am sending all my best wishes for this young woman‚Äôs recovery. It is devastating to read what she is going through.  We must not become complacent about social distancing and wearing masks. All of us are at risk regardless of how trump wants to ignore the facts.
2020-06-11 13:26:48,Fascinating article.  There is still so much about this disease that we do not know and may not ever.  Perhaps in two years it might be better understood.  There has to be some link between those whom die from it no matter their age (I am curious as to her prior disease which required her to take a immuno-suppressant   drug.) Something in their ‚Äútissues‚Äù?  Some sort of DNA short circuit? Past mediations used?  Diet?  GMO foods which have altered the body?
2020-06-11 13:27:30,"Stories like these--in which people in their twenties through forties suffer severe, chronic, and sometimes fatal damage from Covid, should be more widely cited by our civic leaders.  Such cases will become tragically more common if people do not observe precautions and if testing, tracing, and quarantine programs are not continuing and robust."
2020-06-11 13:32:33,"Hope for others indeed. Nonetheless, given the complexity of the medical treatment, I believe it is not for everyone. God bless the young girl (woman) & I look forward to seeing her on TV fully recovered.

I would rather use this article as an inspiration to score N-95 masks & practice good hygiene."
2020-06-11 13:33:04,The problem for the pathologist is going to be how to sort out the viral damage from the oxygen toxicity.
2020-06-11 13:38:51,"""Hope""!? This is actually horrifying. A lung transplant is a devastating major surgery with a a low survival rate - 50% are dead within 5 years. This was a previously healthy woman in her 20s and the widespread transmission of this disease was preventable. 

What would give me hope is if literally ANY leader in government at any level would step up and address COVID with some coordinated, thoughtful and strong leadership so that stories like this could be avoided in the first place."
2020-06-11 13:43:14,"This phrase I think - ""and doctors connected her to a machine that pumps oxygen directly into the bloodstream "" was an ""imprecise"" description, at best. I assume it was referring to the ECMO.

One wishes these patients the best."
2020-06-11 13:45:56,Cheers to the medical team for putting their lives at-risk and accepting the challenge. I wish the lady a speedy recovery. üëèüèª
2020-06-11 14:09:27,"We can only wish the best for this woman.  With a young otherwise healthy individual with her life in front of her, maybe extreme measures can succeed.  

But this would be an unbelievably expensive Hail Mary for most, with serious permanent complications.  

This isn‚Äôt a procedure that offers hope.  For most patients it offers plenty of suffering with almost no likelihood for success."
2020-06-11 14:11:01,This is very scary to read.  A double lung transplant while offering hope for her to live is still a major procedure that appears to have a low survival rate  after 10 years.  The article doesn‚Äôt mention what medication she was taking prior to her hospitalization.  It also mentioned she ‚Äúhad had an minor illness‚Äù implying that it was an illness she recovered from.  These details would have been helpful if the hospital is releasing them.
2020-06-11 14:21:02,"This patient will get perhaps 5 more years to live at a cost of at least $1.5 million dollars for just the operation itself.  These will not be quality years of life and will require constant monitoring, lab tests, and hospital visits.  I have to wonder if this is in the best interest of the patient and her family, and if it is worth it for society as a whole given the significant cost."
2020-06-11 14:21:11,"Not THAT much hope.....there are very few lung DONORS around, and lung transplants in general have worse outcomes than kidney or liver. It's a massive procedure, being done on critically ill patients. It's something, but it will never be a solution that dents the problem."
2020-06-11 14:36:36,"I hope she does well! I'm glad for her, but the emphasis on saving only the young is worrisome to me. What if someone was in their 40s with kids and healthy otherwise? I understand not doing a transplant on someone who would only have a decade or less or live.

That said, we need to up the number of organ donors. There just aren't enough."
2020-06-11 14:36:54,"Of course it means hope! For this specific group of patients in this specific time we live in. Even with a mortality of 50% her alternative was being disconnected, which carries a 100% mortality. Indeed scary, but the medical group is being resourceful and working hard."
2020-06-11 14:41:41,"This story should encourage everyone to update their end-of-life documents.  Decide if you would WANT this.  Understanding that surviving the operation and living as an immune-compromised person is not a walk in the park.  Yes, you are alive.  No, you may not live a long time anyway, and you will likely live in fear of the smallest illness from now on.  You will take powerful and expensive medications for the rest of your life, and you will likely need support from your family   and your finances will need to be good to live decently.  This is not for the frail of heart, pocketbook or the isolated and lonely.

These are the real considerations when you have to write about what your wishes really are.  It isn't a multiple choice test.  It is an essay on how you want to live...or die."
2020-06-11 14:43:50,"It struck me that since healthcare in the US is a commodity, it would be interesting if health reporters started including the cost of these procedures as well as who pays. Was the young woman's insurance better than the others' who weren't given a transplant? How much will she have to pay for the 'privilege' of being allowed to live? If she hadn't been a 'professional', but homeless, would the doctors have made a different decision? What's the market price for a lung transplant, for a life?"
2020-06-11 14:46:42,"Not an either/or, but a both/and.

Yes, we need a vaccine. ASAP. There are many, many teams working on it. That is unprecedented.

That however does not mean ""Hail Marys"" should not be attempted in dire cases. No one is saying this is a cure. But to that individual, it offers hope.

The needle needs to move about every possible axis."
2020-06-11 14:53:48,"My dad died 10 years ago from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis -- immune-driven scarring of the lung tissue that has no determined cause. I can imagine many families of IPF patients are experiencing the pandemic with heightened alarm, and families of those who died from it, like mine, as a difficult reminder of what our loved ones went through. In the case of patients like this woman, we KNOW the cause and we know the steps to take to avoid and lessen viral transmission. At least wear a mask when you can, folks -- if we ask nothing else of each other, that simple thing can help even a little bit."
2020-06-11 15:09:28,"This is more of an experiment than a treatment, but talk about heroic efforts! Lung transplant will probably never become a treatment for Covid, all circumstances considered- but definitely a miracle for this person and God Bless all involved!"
2020-06-11 15:16:53,"This pandemic motivated me to finally complete a living will.  I chose no ventilator, no TPN, no feeding tube, and any other procedures that will prolong my life if I no longer can have quality of life. I also would never burden my loved ones to have to make this decision for me.  My beliefs about death include the continuation of the spirit and the wonder of  once again seeing  those that have died and that I loved. Our spirits live on forever."
2020-06-11 15:23:28,"This was a beautiful article. As a nurse, I appreciated the images. It is the first ray of hope that I have seen in a while."
2020-06-11 13:35:29,"Jesus Christ, that lung looks fried."
2020-06-11 13:46:48,"Why is it relevant that the article describe the patient as Hispanic? 

And why must the doctor refer to a woman as a ""girl""?"
2020-06-11 14:08:21,"Why does this paper always try to hide the fact that people who suffer severe complications have underlying conditions?  The first paragraph says she was healthy, buried deep it‚Äôs revealed that she is on immuno suppresants?  This bait and switch has been extremely consistent in the NYT‚Äôs coverage from the beginning.  Stop trying to nanny and just report the facts.  I worked at the NYT in the 90‚Äôs.  This would never have happened.  That was when this paper was universally acknowledged as the paper of record.   Now you manipulate because you don‚Äôt trust your readers and clickbait."

2020-06-11 15:31:32,How is a double lung transplant an offer of hope? It's not like you can just have Amazon Prime ship you a set!
2020-06-11 15:37:14,"I hope she has a thorough recovery.

One thing that struck me, however, is the idea that this woman was labeled ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù in the same paragraph where the writer says, ‚ÄúShe had had a minor illness that required her to take a medication that suppressed her immune system somewhat.‚Äù

Since when do illness, suppressed immune system, and medication fall under the definition of healthy? Wrong call, NY Times."
2020-06-11 14:03:50,"Stories like this should be pasted on the doors of the state houses everywhere so people wrapping themselves in the flag and screaming for haircuts can see them. This is no joke, no hoax, or ""something off"" as the conspiracy theorists term it."

2020-06-11 15:00:26,I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt like the title of this article. That a double-lung transplant worked is not ‚Äòhope‚Äô for anyone but the sickest and dying. It is instead another tiny drop in the bucket of one-off options with high risk of not being available to those at the end of a life the deserved to be living
2020-06-11 13:22:21,"I wish all the people in my state who are walking around unmasked, ignoring social distancing recommendations, and ridiculing those of us who follow these precautions could see this young woman‚Äôs diseased lungs. This next wave will hit my state hard, I fear."
2020-06-11 13:46:07,"Interesting that they described her as a Hispanic professional, as if the professional piece made her more deserving of the transplant than if she were a service worker."
2020-06-11 13:55:27,"Oh, yes, how ""hopeful."" In lieu of waiting for a vaccine or an administration that can exhibit even the most rudimentary non-psychotic leadership during this pandemic, I can't wait to see the Red Cross lung-donation truck so that I can offer up both my airbags."
2020-06-11 13:57:26,"There are NOT that many extra lungs out there.

Many lung transplant candidates wait a year or more for a suitable match.

Many people die waiting for a suitable lung.

Waiting for a lung transplant is hardly a hopeful scenario, although obviously it's exciting when you 're the one who wins the 1,000,000:1 lung lottery prize."
2020-06-11 14:24:23,"""She had had a minor illness that required her to take a medication that suppressed her immune system"" So she was immunocompromised. Like the vast majority of people who die from the virus. I think it is disingenuous of the Times to  claim she was healthy with no underlying conditions, and as such only serves to stoke fear in healthy people."
2020-06-11 15:09:17,"I'm glad that this young woman is doing well after the transplant. But, the availability of major body organs will always be severely limited since the donors have to die to donate."
2020-06-11 15:09:27,"Please remove ‚Äúhope for others‚Äù from the article headline. The odds of receiving a lung transplant is vanishingly small, and unaffordable for most. Hope for others would be a vaccine."
2020-06-11 15:42:26,"Thank you this was uplifting and thank you to the doctor's for trying everything to help her. 

The picture of the damaged lung should be distributed every where.... Especially online so the young folks who think they are immune can see it and maybe rethink their actions.... Wear a mask folks, be careful, and protect each other...."
2020-06-11 13:37:54,"Keep in mind that thinking about these extremely rare cases is not a good way of thinking about risk from COVID.

For example, it is possible for young health patients to need a lung transplant after getting the flu.

Unlike the COVID cases discussed in this article, who had been taking immunosupressing medications for a previous condition, the flu case discussed above had no prior health risks.

COVID is dangerous because of the high risks it poses, especially to older people, not the extremely low risks it poses to very young people."
2020-06-11 14:06:11,"Please NYTimes, naming the pathologist who you reference would be appropriate. This is another doctor involved in the care of these patients. I‚Äôll also mention that one of our pathology assistants or residents took that photograph used in the article."
2020-06-11 14:50:02,"Offering hope for others?   This is an extremely limited hope and the fact that this is in the title of the article is disturbing.  This gives people the impression that there is a quick fix for this problem and no need to be concerned about avoiding the disease.

It should be noted that this is an extremely operation, there are very few donors available and it necessitates a need for a lifetime of anti-rejection drugs. 

Denise Grady please be more responsible in your reporting instead of going for the attention grabbing headline."
2020-06-11 15:06:22,Why mention the patient's race? Was that a significant factor in any way?
2020-06-11 13:36:15,"I'm glad that she seems to be recovering, but what a horrific thing to go through. I'm in my twenties and I think of cases like this when people say 'young people aren't at risk.' That's not clear to me. Not to mention, my twin brother is immunosuppressed due to a medication to treat a disease. At 25, there are people who would disregard his health and safety so they could go to the nail salon. It's disgusting."
2020-06-11 15:12:39,This article and the photo of the destroyed lung further acts as a reminder as to just how dangerous this disease is. It's no wonder that we still see people without masks running around!

2020-06-11 17:45:13,"Some good news. But where to find a lung donor and who can donate? Most lungs that are transplanted come from deceased organ donors. This type of transplant is called a cadaveric transplant. Healthy, nonsmoking adults who are a good match may be able to donate part of one of their lungs. People who donate a lung lobe can live healthy lives with the remaining lungs."

Wearing a mask is a small, in fact no price to pay to stop a large percentage of infections and dire consequences. Republicans can look at it this way: wearing masks would save money!!"
2020-06-11 17:20:43,"If only researchers could devote more resources to stem cells, perhaps we could arrive at a time when someone could get a new pair of lungs lab grown for them.  This would eliminate the need for taking anti-rejection drugs for the rest of one's life.

This outcome is disastrous, and typical of our country's medical system: flashy heroics (with hidden tolls of suffering and slower death), are prioritized over public health and preventing disease.

That's why our life expectancy is poor. 

And individual lives, like this young woman's in her 20s, are devastated and cut short."
2020-06-11 16:13:02,"How many children in Yemen or even in the US would be helped if the money spent on this double transplant was spent on easier cases?

We make decisions as if there is an infinite amount of money and so we spend large amounts on difficult cases out of the logic that infinity minus a million dollars is still infinity.

But what if it is NOT infinity?  Then an expensive procedure for one person could be at the expense of a hundred procedures on children in Yemen or in the US.

""But oh, there are the rich and if we take them more, we can take care of everyone"".  But we cannot.   Nancy Pelosi is pretty rich and how many people, even  Democrats are willing to tax away most of HER wealth?  

My point is that we need to spend money efficiently.  And only a stupid society gets all emotional about a very expensive medical procedure.  But then no one said we are not stupid."

2020-06-11 18:42:49,I very much hope this woman has good health insurance and hasn't been laid off her job. The bill coming down the pike from Northwestern I'm sure is going to be astronomical. It would have been helpful if the article had given us a ballpark estimate on what her final hospital bill will be. I hope the NYT follows up with her in six months to let us know how she is doing. I wish her good luck in her recovery.
2020-06-11 15:47:30,"But the coronavirus is just like a cold, right?"
2020-06-11 15:58:33,"You write that ""they had heard of cases at other centers where care was withdrawn, and patients died.""

Care is NEVER withdrawn from a patient. All the members of a health care team care for the patient, whether the patient recovers from the illness and leaves the hospital, or the patient decides to withdraw life-sustaining treatment (LST) and have all symptoms treated as the patient goes through the dying process. 

Please change this language. The use of ""withdraw care"" is dangerous and ill-informed."
2020-06-11 20:13:26,"I made a promise with my relatives, and this has worked wonders. Whenever the pandemic is discussed, or the economic disruption, or how unstable things feel, we always keep a place right in front of our minds, for those whom this disease has ravaged and killed, and how it is still happening, and will be happening. The suffering is real. Those fatality numbers about a nursing home? Those are people, grandmothers, aunts, brothers. Those numbers had families, kids, and kids who had families.

Those numbers is this young woman, whose life is now forever changed and her survival still not guaranteed.

Death is not a number. It is a person. 

This ""rule"" has done wonders for how productive and thoughtful my conversations during this terrible time have been. I highly recommend it. It can change things."
2020-06-11 20:31:02,"There was no necessity to mention the patient‚Äôs ethnicity in your article. We are all Americans. When you differentiate by race, ethnicity, skin color or creed, you divide us instead of uniting us."
2020-06-11 20:49:51,"Living lung should look much more like a uniformly pink sponge than a horribly diseased steak like this patient. If not for extracorporeal life support she probably would have died before a lung transplant could have been arranged. (And donor organs have been in shorter supply during widespread shutdowns.) 

I'm happy for this woman and hoping she does well long term. But lung transplants typically are less successful than liver, kidney, or heart transplants. I believe median survival times after lung transplant are roughly 5 years, meaning half die within 5 years, but half do live longer than that."
2020-06-11 20:50:31,"Most Organs are available in Kentucky and the wait is less than the national average, EXCEPT lungs. Too many smokers with damaged lungs waiting for lung donations. So lung transplantation may sound intriguing if infection free lungs are available but lung transplantation should be last. Passive immunization against Cornavirus COVID-19 with antibodies earlier on, post confirmed infection from a recovered patient would be much more advantageous and affordable. 

Allotransplantation or transplantation between unrelated humans is very complex, costly and cumbersome especially because it requires triple immunosuppressive therapy for life for the recipients. Immunosuppression has its own problems of being prone to multiple infections and cancers. There could also be organ rejection. Transplant surgeons will try to convince a potential recipient that it is a life saver but their enthusiasm is not met with a matching outcome. One liver transplant surgeon had the audacity to say transplanting a liver infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) into a patient with a damaged liver is not going to be harmed by the HCV. Just treat the HCV infection in the recipient. I understand the shortage but why putting the recipient through having to be infected with an incurable chronic HCV infection? HCV is a slow progressing infection and it could take as long as 5 years for the infection to spread to the healthy liver.

Speed the availability of deployable vaccine. Prevention is better than cure."
2020-06-11 20:57:42,"This is NOT hope.  At best this is an extreme option for exceedingly few individuals.    And reporting this as ""hope"" one week after the transplant is too soon.  Why wasn't this hopeful headline held until more time had passed to see how this first COVID19 would do.  At least a month, maybe 6 months. This is a nightmare for someone that young or anyone else for that matter.  Here's perspective:  According to SRTR's January 2020 report: 2562 lung transplants were performed in the entire country in 2018. Before COVID19, there were 4 groups of candidates:  obstructive lung disease, pulmonary vascular disease, cystic fibrosis, and immunodeficiency disorders.  89.4% survive to one year, 73.5 percent to 3 years and 59.4% to 5 years.     COVID19 transplants are a whole new deal-her surgeon described her lungs being plastered to her heart, chest wall, and diaphragm.  The jury is out on this hope."
2020-06-11 21:31:06,"To the author, Denise Grady~
It is important that authors be mindful of language when writing about medical care. In the article you state, ""They had heard of such cases at other centers where care was withdrawn, and patients died."" Care is never withdrawn, the medical team cares for the patient and family until the patient dies. They may use palliative care, hospice care, etc. Curative medical treatment may be withdrawn, but care is never withdrawn.
Thanks for listening~"
2020-06-11 21:37:20,"We need to start a movement, ""Resist the Reopening."" Let them reopen gyms, stores, restaurants, casinos, stores, amusement parks, cruises, etc. We'll just stay home, thanks. 

Just like all those people exercising their ""freedom"" to infect others by refusing to wear a mask, we've got the freedom to just say no. Stay home, save lives. Nothing has significantly changed in that equation.

Office workers who have been allowed us to work from home not only lobby to continue working from home on an individual basis, they should band together and make it a societal demand. Unionized workers should go on strike if necessary.

What if they had a reopening and no one came?"
2020-06-11 21:42:08,"I wish this woman all the best but I think people are always looking for a magical procedure that will make people all better. Besides the hardship and limited life expectancy in this situation, people don't seem to realize that the sedation needed for spending time in a ventilator can cause permanent brain damage.

We like to think we just put people ""to sleep"" and they wake up ok, but sedation can do more damage than the illness. The medical establishment is aware of this but it isn't made clear enough to the public."
2020-06-11 22:01:37,"Maybe someone has already made this observation: Hope is a double lung transplant?

This is not a scalable solution."
2020-06-11 22:16:29,I agree with the comments that say this is not a reason for hope.   It is more of a reason to step up my social distancing.
2020-06-11 22:27:09,"If the patient recovers we should consider taking the lungs of elderly people with good lungs to transplant into young people with Covid 19.  Ethically would that be any different than letting old people get Covid and die while we reopen bars and restaurants.

On a more serious  note, I echo Sasha.  This is a procedure that will benefit a very few people with Covid 18, especially given the shortage of organs for transplant. Given the young woman's grave condition and the number of organ systems affected by Covid 19 it is reasonable to ask whether the lungs might have better been transplanted into someone with a disease limited to the lungs."
2020-06-11 22:30:50,"As many readers pointed out, this article shows an often seen misconception around organ transplants. 

They are not a ‚Äúfix-all‚Äù solution. They are often the worst case outcome and while they offer new life to the patient, they come with a hefty tag of life-long rejection risk, lowered immune system and higher risk of infections, and the new organ does not function as long - I guess between 5 and 15 years on average depending on the organ? 

When I read the article all of this is mostly missing. While I agree that organ transplant offers hope to those who face certain death like the woman described in the article, it is misleading to speak of full recovery without explaining that quality and life expectancy have now drastically changed for her. 

I do think it is amazing they could offer her this and hope she will continue to react well to the new lungs. I hope there will not be a great need for such drastic solutions for future Covid-19 patients but my heart is heavy thinking of all the people and children getting sick all over the world, many that will never have access to decent care, let along lung transplants. 

I just read hundreds of children have now died in Indonesia from Covid-19, probably due to so many being malnourished. It is horrible. The toll of this disease just keeps on getting worse.  

We must lower the spread or find effective treatments. Sadly double lung transplants can‚Äôt be considered that."
2020-06-11 22:31:11,Hope would mean that we had done more to stop the spread of this deadly virus and had a president who made sure that the effort was coordinated nationally and effectively. A lung transport may offer hope to this victim but it should make the rest of us shudder in fear.
2020-06-11 23:10:48,Extraordinary success for Dr. Bharat and his team.  I am 75 years old Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) patient and am stable on the medication.  Many with this disease are waiting for lung transplant and because of my age I am not a candidate.  I can very well relate with this story.  Some in our support group have undergone lung transplant and I understand what it means.  I am at the risk of Covid and its damage and only thing I can do is to be careful.  Our specialist doctor told our support group that he has not come across a single IPF patient who got Covid and that is my hope whatever the explanation for our escaping so far as a group.
2020-06-11 20:33:51,"This doesn't give me hope; this is incredibly grim: a young, previously healthy woman was made so grievously ill that she needed new lungs. This is both a sign that this illness is nothing to scoff at and that we shouldn't be anywhere near each other, and that new lungs won't be an option for most people who need them."
2020-06-11 21:55:38,I guess having a double lung transplant is something that some people will be hopeful for. But that is a frighteningly heroic kind of hope.
2020-06-11 20:42:21,"This last-ditch treatment, a double-lung transplant, is a powerful reminder that Covid-19 is first and foremost a respiratory disease. Moreover, it is airborne with every cough, sneeze or wheeze. Under the circumstances, a face mask should simply be a matter of common sense. Instead, trump opted to make face masks a political statement. Shame on him for failing to lead. 

Despite a hyper abundance of testing, Covid-19 nonetheless penetrated turmp's mask-less fiefdom. That should have told trump that it was time to don a face mask, but apparently one can't mask the donald, even as most White House employees masked-up. Anyone following trump's non-example would do well to consider the ""cure"" of this double-lung transplant surgery, given that a face mask is the literal and proverbial ounce of prevention."

2020-06-11 20:14:07,I would like to know if this woman was ever given remdesivir or blood plasma transfusion or antiflammatory Actemra therapy approved for emergency use before it got this far. Sounds like nothing was offered or perhaps failed to help. Lung damage is caused by the cyclotonic storm left in the tail end of the virus's attack. Perhaps the severity came from Blood type B they are starting talk about or a side effect of immunosurpressive medication. Maybe people should take aspirin and not take the immunosurpressive drugs instead during the pandemic.

Survival is around 80% at one year and decreases to around 50% at five years post-transplant. And life after a lung transplant is not easy; patients require close follow up and immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives. 

All this is not to take away from the miraculous second chance at life that this young woman now has, the priceless gift given to her by the donor‚Äôs family, or the hard work of the medical teams who kept this woman alive through devastating COVID and who performed her transplant. But I think it‚Äôs dangerous for the general public to see a lung transplant as a way out of the severe critical illness that some people develop from COVID-19. It‚Äôs not and will never be an option for the vast majority of COVID patients. Unfortunately, chronic illness or death are still the most likely outcomes of severe COVID. We must remain vigilant."

Almost the entire population of COVID patients that are in trouble do not meet all of these four conditions. This was a very rare event. A lot of transplant recipients are more lucky than anything but if the conditions are met, why not save a life? I am not sure why so many here have a problem with that."

But the fact that this disease can destroy the lungs of an otherwise healthy 22 year old is an argument for, at the very least, a crash program to produce high-quality masks and accurate and easily available tests.

2020-06-11 20:10:41,"I'm glad she's ok, but it's also horrifying -- that even young healthy 20-somethings can have very bad outcomes with this virus, yet so many schools and universities, including my own, are planning to re-open in the Fall. And no matter what they say about it being in the best interests of students to re-open, let's be real, it's all about the money..."
2020-06-12 10:43:51,"Several questions about this. 

The article said she tested negative for the virus before the transplant.

It said she was previously healthy, but had no serious underlying medical conditions. 

It said she had a minor illness that required her to take a medication that surpassed her immune system somewhat.

Dr Bharat  is at a center that performs 40 to 50 ling transplants a year and he performs most of them. (When you have a hammer, the whole world looks like a nail) For such patients, he said, the news of a successful transplant ""absolutely could start something""

Which makes me wonder if there is a supply of organs for transplant that has previously been untapped. Not.(There are wait lists for organs because they are in very short supply)

How many medically unsophisticated people will read this and start demanding a transplant for themselves or their loved ones?

This procedure is a mightily heroic measure, extraordinarily expensive, and probably doomed, statistically. A recovery will be a miracle, and we know people are ""waiting for our miracle"", which by their nature are very, very rare.

Such is optimism.

Kids cannot be kept from exchanging viruses -I recall the first case of flu I got was around 1960 or so in school-and no one paid any attention until I threw up on my way to the boys room. In the 60's and earlier-kids were seen as an extra added expense which, if parents had really been smart-they would never have conceived them.
Now, in our 50's,  through our 100's, we resent having the always moving little bug machines , around to threaten our increasingly pleasant existence. I suspect many adults would abandon them  or have them  kept in cold storage, until the threat of infection from Cov19 receded -at least, receded from us: old people.

If kids get sick, few worry but some  parents. Doctors no longer have time for unprofitable shrimps who almost surely will all survive this virus. 
I dare anyone to try and make a dentist or a skin doctor appointment today before 2022. I have heard the police and 911 won't answer sometimes now. Our highly paid government is out for the duration-while collecting full  pay for being on permanent vacation.

We've passed 111K and medical experts predict that by September, we'll be in the 200's. We've relaxed on the ""social distancing"" practices and we're looking toward a re-opening of schools in the fall.

Educators and institutions may take as many pains as possible to dance around COVID-19 but it's here to stay until there's a vaccine in place to defeat it. We may as well be on the moon in terms of dealing with this pandemic.

Americans are an impatient lot and are about to pay an enormous price for it. How many children--not teens or young adults--will be sacrificed to the virus in the fall and winter because they feared the president's wrath and ignored  the scientists and doctors and other medical professionals who told us that just because we crowd around a campfire, the wolves are still out there, in the dark, and hungry?

We're a stubborn species that seems geared--sometimes, anyway--toward the experimental and the adventurous and trust far too much in positive thinking rather than in critical thinking.

We're going to pay a price for this. Sorry to be preaching. I'm off the soap box now. Your president is still on it, and he won't care if your kids die so he can be re-elected.

This is emblematic of the inability of the West to see China, or the Chinese, in any sort of nuanced way. Of course, it is not either or.

Now, as the company re-opens later this month, the supervisors are not responding to inquiries of when to report back for resumption of work.

To the one, those articles all come with another fact - that the location is continuing to reopen. 

I knew that this time was just a pause  and that it would come to an end quite a bit sooner than the experts saying to prepare for a second wave were predicting (fall and winter). But this is far worse than even I thought. The speed with which this is ramping back up is terrifying. The only thing scarier is the failure of governors and local leaders to read the writing on the wall, step up, and institute/reinstitue full lockdowns. 

The protests have to end. Even though it's really too soon for those transmissions to show up in the numbers, we all know that thousands of people gathering together and shouting and chanting is going to make things even worse. We need to go back to essential services only being open and masks need to be required in every public place. Yes, there are financial consequences to this, but the solution is not to continue to do what it's clear we cannot. The solution is to insist that our Representatives and Senators step up and pass real, long-term financial support packages.

There are a ton of guidelines they follow: divided classes, handwashing regularly, new sinks installed at the playground, staged drop off and delivery times, activity time outdoors as much as possible, more outdoor neighborhood field trips. The number of corona cases have dropped to manageable levels. This is key: these guidelines could be implemented because of the status of the wider picture, which the schools are embedded in. You have to have both: wider picture manageable and guidelines in the schools. It is doable. And it is really important for the children."

Better that I teach them on zoom and remain alive, and so too their grandparents, rather than collect ourselves to get sick. Parents will not send their children for the same reason. So far the U.S. response has been individualist and fragmented; in other words, disorganized and a cruel failure. The environment is not everyone pulling together but everyone for themselves, like a State of Nature. That is the ultimate logic of Reagan‚Äôs children: no solid social infrastructure, no investment in people, only in capital projects and military, and a President who merely exemplifies how Americans do not feel responsible to one another. I say this knowing full well that there was heroism on the part of many, but not on the part of the society as a whole, and the heroes have not been supported. Clapping at 7pm is not adequate.

I'm expecting that come the Fall, many children will be below their grade level because of the interruption of in-person learning this Spring. I also expect there will be more severely traumatized children - the ones who went hungry or were stuck inside with abusive or neglectful family members. For many children, school is where they are fed and where they are respected and safe.

What does this mean for educators? More and harder work with less staff and resources while being paid less.

This crisis has exposed for all to see just how little we as a society value our children. We need to do better. Teachers cannot do the work of educating the youth without the proper resources.

Parents send sick students to school because of lack of sick time, money, insurance or interest. Many times I sent a student to the nurse that had fever, coughing and fatigue. I can always bet that the student will say that he/she had to go to school because mom or dad have to work? What happens? We all get sick. I got the flu a year ago and was almost at death‚Äôs door. I‚Äôm 36 and I got the flu shot. What about the teachers and staff? Many teachers have weakened immune systems, already stressed due to family and professional obligations and (like everyone else) have enough on their plate. Not only we have to catch kids up for missing several weeks of school, we have to keep everyone alive in a sense. Social distancing sounds good but kids (like everyone else) are social beings who like to hug and touch. Masks can and will be taken off so they can talk which negates the purpose of wearing one.

My point is, covid is extremely contagious, teachers in addition to students, are going to get sick; how do we teach the kids then? A number of my older colleagues will choose retirement and some of the younger ones will choose to leave education. We already have the city max of 34 students in a class. Our school already has an extended school day/split schedule to accommodate overcrowding. We are going to be stretched thin even if every staff member reports to school. What happens as teachers inevitably get sick and can't come to class? Most of our substitutes are in an age group that places them in a high risk category. It took a few days before my symptoms were obvious - how many people would I have exposed on public transportation? How many students? How many colleagues? How much risk is acceptable? Don't even get me started on the logistics of social distancing and mask wearing at school. Even if we manage that, what do you think the kids do within seconds of leaving the building?

So, we will probably see resurgence in the poorer districts.

2020-06-11 14:23:50,"As a retired elementary school principal I am concerned about returning to school this without sensible answers to the following questions: 1) Transportation: A school bus holds 60 children. How will schools practice social distancing on a school bus? Will the driver and all the children wear N-95 masks?  2) Classroom environment: A typical classroom of 600 square feet houses between 20-30 children. If that remains the setting how will social distancing be achieved?  3) The school cafeteria: Even if every child wears an N-95 mask it must be removed to eat in a cafeteria in which children are crammed shoulder-to-shoulder. How does that scenario not invite the spread of airborne germs?  4) Employees: A school consists of a principal, school nurse (some schools have no nurse), faculty, and support staff. What happens when one or more employees contracts COVID-19? Will substitutes be willing to enter that building? If not, what do we do with students in classrooms without teachers?
These are but a few questions that must be answered. I believe there are no answers that would build confidence in parents to return their children to school. The statistics are chilling: areas ignoring social distancing are spiking. Schools simply cannot adhere to social distancing. I implore parents to keep their children safe at home. I get it that academics are suffering but having children suffer from this dreaded pandemic is far worse."
2020-06-11 14:25:31,"I don't know if I just don't get it, but the hysterics about schools opening seems misplaced.  The best data available shows that: a) the risk of severe illness and/or death in children in good health under 18 is exceptionally tiny.  NYC has 1.1 million public school children that public health officials believe have almost all been exposed to corona.  They estimate there were potentially 14 fatalities. b) COVID is a significant risk to people who are obese, diabetic/pre-diabetic, heart conditions.  Risk/severity increases with age.  Above age 65 risk really increases.  We cannot continue to deprive children and college students from a quality education which is generally delivered best through in-person settings.  SO:  rather than spend gazillions on measures that likely won't work in containing the spread of corona between young people - a) provide remote access to the classroom for children who may at at-risk or have family members at-risk b) ensure adequate PPE is available to teachers at all times and take reasonable precautions.  If a teacher does not want to return to classroom, they can take a leave, retire, or try a new profession that does not require contact with children.  There are 5 or 6 new college graduates in my neighborhood going into teaching.  They are 21-24 years old and ready to get into a classroom.  COVID will not wipe out the school children.  It may, however, open the door to many younger college grads looking to teach."

A great debate is going on even  in India too about re-opening educational institutions. Some are in favour of opening schools, of course, by taking all precautions. But many are not in favor. For example, most of the parents are not in favor of  opening. Their main concern is their children's health. Some suggest that let one year go without any classes.  From the next academic year let them start from the place where they all left. After all an academic year wasted did not bother them as they want children to be healthy for the next academic year. And there are some other set of people, who want all those who are  in the final semester be promoted to the next class without they writing any exams as per their previous semester scoring.

If they are out longer than their sick time, they no longer have their jobs (or insurance, if lucky enough).

For example, look in the upper-left-hand portion of the photo of the classroom accompanying the article.  I'm not sure, but it looks like it could be part of a forced ventilation system.  I admit it could be a light of some sort, but it has a similar appearance as a HVAC blower in my mother's assisted living apartment.

2020-06-11 14:50:58,"This is what should have been done 100yrs ago or so when we had just been to learn about things like the flu. 

Doing nothing like we normally do or shutting down the economy completely is not the right way to go.

Every year during the flu season, safeguards should be in place that people of good will that study the facts can agree upon, covering sneezes, social distance, sending people home if sick, washing hands frequently, staggering work hours, subways, working from home etc. should be mandatory.

If more studies show that wearing masks at least on the subways or other close quarters should be mandatory.

The above is called common sense. 

Also studies should be made without the ax grinders on both sides to determine just how much shutting down the economy helped. In other words if the basic safeguards above were in place, it would have probably saved the majority of lives without shutting down the economy.

Also the final question and the elephant in the room is what death count is acceptable. Every year, app. 40k people get killed by guns and cars, 100k+ die from infections in hospitals. App. 70k get killed by the flu."

Many people are obese regardless of age. But no one believes that the virus is here thanks to Fox News and DJT.  The school system pays about $10 an hour for subs. Good luck with that when replacements need to be found.This is not going to end well."
2020-06-11 14:52:01,"There is no perfect, risk free solution, but we need to do a better job at distinguishing media enhanced fear from statistical reality. Schools are not going to have covid tragedies akin to nursing homes. Of the reported covid deaths in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania (two hard hit states), 60% were over 80 years old, and 90 % were over 65 yrs old. 0.4% were under 40 yrs old and none under 25. Over 60 % were nursing home residents. There are very few faculty or staff in the 65-90 age bracket interacting with students. The vulnerable population should be isolated to minimize their risk. For those between 25-60 (the more common age for faculty and staff), the fatality rate for covid infection is less than 0.5%. Almost all of these fatalities have co-morbitities. Students are not at risk of dying from covid, and otherwise healthy people under 50 are at practically no risk of dying from it either. I mean ‚Äúnot at risk‚Äù the same way I would mean I am not at risk of dying as I drive to work, or my child is not at risk of getting kidnapped on his way to school i.e., it is so unlikely that it doesn‚Äôt paralyze me into fearful inaction, but I do take reasonable safety precautions for both.  For many low income children, school is the safest place to be.  The social isolation and delayed learning is already causing serious academic and emotional consequences for most others. Students can't wait for some unknowable date when the virus is eradicated."

2020-06-11 15:31:06,"Frivolous lawsuits have kept more mediocre attorneys employed than any other approach.  Their greed driven tactic is simple a simple yet justice system supported blackmail approach:

Step 1:  Threaten to file a lawsuit without presenting any clear evidence and propose a quick cash settlement with associated future liability release.  If that does not intimidate the small business sufficiently, proceed to Step 2.

Step 2:  File the lawsuit with the minimum amount of information necessary and re-approach the target company and re-proposed an out-of-court settlement.  If they refuse, either drop the matter or risk court proceedings that will require the full discovery process to be implemented.

Many small companies acquess during Step 1 or 2 not because they fear losing, but they fear the potential size of their own legal bills if they fight knowing they are innocent.  

Small business owners have already told me that this legal ""shakedown"" scheme has already begun."
2020-06-11 15:40:51,"Let me get this straight, businesses want us back to work so they can make money, but at the same time want to be protected if we get sick doing it? 

If businesses know workers are safe to come back, I wouldn't have to sign a waiver. Clearly, it's not safe. And they know it. And I don't have to sign a waiver during flu season, do I?

People are so anxious to get back to normal that we're pretending we have this thing beat - we don't. This things is going to come roaring back in the Fall and it'll be even worse than if we had just been patient and rode it out a little longer."
2020-06-11 15:04:52,"There is no way that schools can be opened safely.  Students will not social distance in the halls, classrooms, anywhere. They do come to school sick with normal illness and there is nothing that would lead me to believe that would change with covid. Checking them at the door before they enter is a good idea if you have security that will do it consistently.  I have not seen great security in the 20 years I have been teaching.  The experts speak of viral load and if you are in a classroom for say 3 hours and someone in each hour class is  sick, there will be many others sick too. I think school should be online until a vaccine is created or at least medicine that will keep you alive if you get it.  One last thing.  Look at the number of cases in the last week with everything opening, not much social distancing there and with the amount of students in a school there will not be any distancing there either."
2020-06-11 15:52:59,"Business immunity needs to be contingent on a business showing evidence that they're making a proper effort to minimize the risk of viral spread and protect at-risk employees and customers. 

The idea of blanket immunity for businesses regardless of their conduct is absolutely insane."
2020-06-11 15:58:25,"We should set the same standards of immunity for business as for health care facilities and health care workers.  If proper guidelines are followed - which reduce but can't totally eliminate risk - then there should be no liability.  But if the business or health care institution was grossly negligent, then there should be liability."
2020-06-11 16:09:58,"I suppose that many of these workers who are being compelled to return to work because they would otherwise lose unemployment benefits, and then having to sign a waiver, will continue to vote GOP in the fall.

2020-06-11 16:31:33,"Time is on our side.  We should wait out till a vaccine is ready.  Why rush to open the business when they are not ready.

Every country is paying attention to the 2nd wave of the pandemic crisis.  China tested 11 million people in Wuhan again within 2 weeks after small clusters of infections detected there again.  Sweden started shelter-in-place after daily occurrence rises.

We should be patient and strictly enforce social distancing, wearing mask, and no group gathering outside. Unfortunately, I just saw a young nurse without waring mask in grocery store.  Some people just don't believe in science."
2020-06-11 16:41:11,"Average people cannot afford to go to the doctor because we don‚Äôt have universal health care, but businesses want ‚Äúprotections‚Äù so they can‚Äôt be sued after they force workers into situations where they could easily become infected with Covid. 

If our government had acted to save people instead of businesses at the beginning, and if we‚Äôd had universal health care and a functioning healthcare system before the pandemic began, businesses wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about being sued now.

Other civilized countries have put people first, but their businesses haven‚Äôt suffered as much as ours.

2020-06-11 16:41:33,"This rush to limit liability certainly doesn't inspire confidence does it? Clearly, business owners know the virus is real and is not under control. Some areas that have been vigilant may be ready to reopen with appropriate restrictions, but meanwhile the virus is raging in other areas and there are no restrictions on travel, which means that regions that faithfully sheltered in place are likely to see increases in cases. The lack of a uniform national plan to fight this virus while providing economic support where needed has already cost lives and will continue to cost lives."
2020-06-11 16:41:49,"Most employers already have Workers Compensation to cover employees injured on the job; it could also be applied to illness due to Covid-19.  IF an employer institutes safety practices and issues PPE to employees who need it, then there should be no need for liability waivers, or for employees to sue.  Certainly, no waiver should pertain where employers are not doing everything they can to protect their employees.   It's always the workers who get the short end of the stick; which is why unions started in the first place, and why they are even more necessary now."
2020-06-11 17:05:45,"In the absence of a strict federal rule about ""reopening"", states that do little about protecting citizens to favor businesses will bring the rest of us down (those of us who have not overcome first ""wave""). Without strict interstate travel restrictions, widespread testing, and tracing, the virus quick spread will overwhelm the country again. This time without proper hospital readiness to deal with elevated number of ill people requiring ICU beds. In the end businesses will lose despite rush to reopen."
2020-06-11 17:08:20,"I recall being taught that, in a capitalist society, businesses compete for customers by offering a better product or better service.  Unfortunately our anti-trust apparatus has withered since the ‚ÄúReagan revolution‚Äù so there is less competition but, still, customers can (and should) avoid doing business with companies that force them to give up their rights (to hold businesses accountable) in the justice system by signing a waiver of liability."
2020-06-11 17:08:53,"The risk of lawsuits is real, and the fear of businesses is appropriate.  In the US, people often knowingly engage in risky behavior, and then if something goes wrong, they sue.  In a minority of cases the suits are appropriate, but in most cases they probably are not. The verdicts are often excessive.  The American legal system is deeply flawed, and needs reform.  Unqualified immunity from lawsuits is probably going too far, but reigning in our trial lawyers is the right thing to do.

Let's not forget that in the months prior to the pandemic, US tort lawyers filed literally tens of thousands of lawsuits against major pharmaceutical firms, alleging their products caused cancer.  In most cases, the suits were based on junk science.  Usually the companies won, but given the tens of thousands of suits filed, and the nature of jurors understandably sympathetic to cancer victims. sometimes the plaintiffs won, often with awards of billions of dollars.

Several major pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson and Johnson and Bayer, were, and are, threatened with bankruptcy.  Whatever you think of big pharma, these are the companies we need to remain economically viable if vaccines and treatments for the corona virus are to be developed.

Again, wholesale immunity may be a bridge too far, but tort reform is appropriate and necessary."
2020-06-11 15:49:56,"These ‚Äúliability waivers‚Äù businesses are requiring of customers sound very much like those Trump demands of all his ‚Äúdisgruntled‚Äù former employees or hush money he negotiates with his Subterranean sexual assignations.

In other words, you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas, and end up getting fleeced as well."

The Governor continues to try the dodge that testing is increasing so there would be more cases. His original stay home order was a sham. All businesses were essential on a close reading. Now, few are wearing masks and are packing into bars. Mask vs. No mask is becoming a political divide. Hard to get the courtesy of social distancing from others.

But school is a whole other level of risk to them.    They are not only worried about their kids and teens   ( and of course their teachers) getting sick but  the risk that Their kids can bring the virus home, pass on illness to them  ( their not so young) and face the threat of losing one or both  of those parents .

The series of editorials encouraging mass protest published by the Times,  with titles like ""protest is patriotic"" may well have contributed to the surge.  One can understand the rage that motivated the protests, but the fact of the matter is that the virus was still with us.

I'm one who believes that it's time to reduce the lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, but in a controlled and rational manner.  Mass gatherings including the sorts of protests that took place a week ago are inappropriate, and will be for some time, given the pandemic."

2020-06-11 17:17:23,"If employers insist on making employees agree to absolve them of liability if they get sick, those employers need to provide good health care if workers do get sick. If an employer can't afford that, or if they believe their obligation to shareholders prevents them from providing it, they need to use their lobbying clout to demand universal health care. That would absolve them of a significant continuing liability that their global competitors do not have. It makes so much business sense that I really can't understand why CEOs are so opposed to it.

I know Republicans would vehemently disagree with all of that, and that they very much support one-sided liability relief for employers (who, after all, are their donor/constituents). But the reality of millions of Americans subject to coronavirus, and also to destitution if they get sick and require hospitalization, should take precedence over the greed of Republican constituents. But Republicans no longer even feel the need to hide the fact that they put themselves first, their party second, and their donors third. Everyone else is expendable. 

It would seem the only solution to this problem is to get rid of Republicans in November."

2020-06-11 17:30:49,"Finally, traditional education is in transition. Perhaps everyone, parents, students, teachers and administrators need to figure out this new era of online mass education instead of bemoaning the past. At long last kids are free to learn without tight physical boundaries of school buildings and limits on how far their minds can wander. Anyone with passion can be a teacher. Perhaps we will unleash another golden age of innovation with this new generation that can avail of even more vast resources online. As for kids and adults who cannot learn.....well physical school or virtual, we have to understand, that only some choose to learn academics. The internet offers millions of other fields that kids can learn from. This promises to be a truly advantaged world for everyone regardless of their economic strata or inclination.

For those bemoaning that they do not have the room in their homes to concentrate, I have little sympathy. Too many of us who came to the US to enhance our education, came from very poor backgrounds, very crowded homes, in fact very little electricity or water and zero access to computers. We just wanted to study so badly, we did it anywhere. So with all the computers being handed out by public schools, it is time every kid took their lives into their own hands and furthered it to a better place."
2020-06-11 18:28:38,"Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has singled out liability protection for businesses as the top Republican priority, with the White House in corporate lockstep.

Think of the multilayered bankruptcy of the GOP stance.

They want to exempt businesses from coronavirus liability, which would encourage irresponsible corporate behavior and encourage cutting coronavirus corners for the sake of 'profit', which would effectively increase the infection and fatality rate of customers and society in general, which would then decrease economic activity as more people became sick and more people stayed away from businesses because they know  that businesses are not taking coronavirus seriously.

Not to mention the obvious fact that you can't easily identify and trace where you might have contracted an invisible pathogen that makes you sick a week or two after contracting it.

And any responsible business will be responsible without needing a law to bail it out.

The comprehensively irrational heights that Republicans will go to to protect and bail out sacred 'business' knows no ends.

Children in poverty have never had an equal education, and now they are much further behind.

Covid has exposed the racism, classism, and anti-intellectualism of education in America.

Much of the failures in the last few decades can be traced back to the George W Bush administration‚Äôs friendships with Texas textbook companies, who then became testing companies, and highjacked our education system to make huge profits.

Our education system has needed a complete overhaul for decades. NOW is the time to attract high quality teachers by paying them professional salaries, putting them in charge of teaching again, and making sure they have the final word in how schools reopen OR continue online learning.

I‚Äôm sure the best teachers have logical ideas about how to solve the deep rot which has been exposed, if we would only listen to them."

The ""plan"" to reopen schools is not so much a plan as it is an accident waiting to happen.  There has to be a better way.  

Pretending that things are back to normal when the reality is we are just at the beginning of this fight, not at its apex, is going to cause more deaths, more spread.

Really beginning to think that Americans from the poorest to the richest, the young and the old, and even a significant portion of the medical community, are incredible self-centered, short-sighted fools.   When even MDs make ridiculous remarks, like the Republican state senator in Ohio, and US Senator Rand Paul (who actually HAD the virus) you just have to what could possibly be going on in their brains?

The top five states today for new cases, are Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.  States where social distancing and lockdowns have been bitterly opposed by at least 4 of their 5 governors.  New York still has the 8th most new cases today, but here in New Jersey, hit proportionately almost as hard as New York, we're 20th on the list of most new cases.

People just don't want to believe it can happen to them, but only to somebody else.  Trump claims that the trend is down,  Wall Street laps it up, but nobody notices that when NY & NJ aren't including, the rest of the nation is trending up  as PREDICTED BY THE EXPERTS when social distancing is abandoned.

So how is any of this a surprise? The politicians usurped the safety of our nation away from the doctors and forged ahead ‚Äì knowing more lives would be lost. The increase in the numbers is a result of too much too soon, by both the politicians and people not wanting to practice safety as outlined by the CDC. Safety has somehow become a political statement. Those with masks represent one outlook, while those with masks represent another view. This is ludicrous. We are taking about saving lives, not playing some kind of game of chicken, just because people are tired of having to live with COVID. As a result of this foolishness, the cases are rising again. Shame on the politicians and people who do not practice proper safety. Even just as upsetting is the simple use of masks should have been made mandatory across the country, as well as social distancing; but politicians found that would be too onerous on people and did not make that a law. Leadership that is more focused on today's S&P 500 rather than the lives of all Americans is without a conscience and is reprehensible.

And American investors are finally waking up to the fact that we have been hit very, very hard, and it will take a long time to recover. The Fed can only do so much, which it is... and it's time for Congress to step up.

Public opinion is actually pretty predictable. People get hopeful, get excited, but at some point they realize:

In 2008 when the stock market tanked, he said, well the problem is that no one really knows what is going on in the stock market, it is a huge gamble. The fact is that today's stock market is indeed a huge gamble, we have companies that are losing money and their stock value keeps on going up and up and up.

Now we have eased back on the restrictions after what appeared to have been a successful three months.  

Clearly, we were overconfident.  But contrary to the indications here, we well know that the problem is easing restrictions too soon.  Ducey has even admitted that.  Back East the problems were immediate and so were the precautions. But when it seems like you have beaten the thing only to find out you have not, it isn't because you're stupid and you don't know what hit you. 

 Our situation is different from yours.  And it is counter- intuitive.   The fact that we let up too soon is not surprising -- folks back East are doing the same.  For three months the virus was not much here.  We knew that easing restrictions would lead to additional cases.  But we didn't know it would be as bad as it is.  

Nobody has exhibited perfect knowledge in this crisis.  Every state takes a chance when they ease restrictions.  We have done worse than most.  We have guessed badly.  There are multiple states that have done it our way and have fared just fine.  Folks love to place blame when things go wrong.

Many people do not believe their government, at all levels, can develop and follow through on effective plans for testing and prevention.  So they become either fatalistic or ignore what‚Äôs going on, all bad.  

Trump is bored with the virus and wants to play with missiles - and spend lots and lots of money on them.  The man is crazy and very irresponsible.  No one, not the Pentagon, Asian countries as well as any and all taxpayers here in U.S. want our taxes to go for additional weaponry, especially now.

He really doesn‚Äôt have any idea what‚Äôs going on so just lie to him about how many demonstrators are outside the White House.  If he wants fake news, give it to him.

It will have the same impact and will hamper any recovery. Thanks to Trump and the (mostly RepubliCON) governors that he has pushed to open up, the pandemic will be extended until there is a very successful vaccine.

This is the inherent failure of capitalism: the acceptable sacrifice of human life is measured by gross profit (of which most of us will only see enough of to survive) and not by our own communities. Profit has no morals. It has no motives. It serves nothing but itself."

2020-06-11 20:50:27,"The only way you can have an economy is to have people. No people, no economy. Plain and simple. So if you want an economy, you have to make it safe for people to participate in it. Until people are willing to do that, the economy is going to falter. We need to suffer now, because not doing so will be seeking death. You can build an economy from nothing, but you cannot resurrect the dead.

And every politician who is putting the economy before people's lives should be arrested under Title 18 U.S. Code ¬ß 1111. Murder. Their decisions have directly lead to the untimely deaths of over 115k people and the death toll shows no signs of stopping. No one should be putting a price tag on the lives of others."

COVID-19 is not going on its own accord, rain or shine, panic or pandemonium. The virus is proliferating like there is no tomorrow and using our fellow human beings mostly adults above 55, as fodder to achieve its goal of maximum expansion of its kind. 

We need to stop worrying and continuing living with precautions and care and not with surrender and subjugation but with bravery and common sense."

The data suggests only minimal effects on the economy - but substantial effects on infection spreed.  It doesn't matter whether its the 50% who will stay home anyway or another 25% who will listen to government and stay home when told.  No business can afford to lose 50% of its costumers.  They are doomed no matter what; its just a little faster if they lose 75% of their costumers.  However, for the virus it makes a big difference whether it loses 75% of it's costumers or only 50%.  When the second big wave hits in late fall it will be critical whether cases increase 10-fold from a base of 2,000 new cases per day or from 20,000 per day.  The first we can handle the second is total chaos and collapse (should we call it the Trump plan or the Bannon plan)."

2020-06-11 22:00:39,"I grew up on stories about how America won World War II.  I heard about Roosevelt and Churchill, how our factories flipped on a dime to produce massive amounts of war materials,  how every able bodied man volunteered for service, and the women went into the factories to fill in for them.  I heard about how people pulled together, saving aluminum foil, string, and bacon grease because it was needed by defense industries.  Imagine how the lives of that generation were disrupted and inconvenienced in just a short few months.
When I read about the response of the general public and business community to the threat facing the US today from Covid, I think we are no longer a community of people who can face real hardship and accomplish great things like winning a war. We lack not only leadership, but the will to do anything that inconveniences us, or doesn't directly improve our personal financial situation in the short term.  There are no corporations stepping up to make masks and PPE unless there are good profits to be had. 
 Airlines won't block out middle seats to make air travel safer, because there's no profit there. Universities fire employees rather than dip into their huge endowments.  Hospitals lay off nurses and doctors they (temporarily) don't need to keep their profits high. And politicians refuse to provide funds for the many people who will need extended government aid to survive this pandemic.  This isn't how a strong, united country should respond to a crisis."

As advanced nations begin opening up their economies, we will continue to burn with Covid, public health emergencies and a dead economy for months or years to come. Hoping for a vaccine is not a plan. A short strict lockdown with mass testing and contact tracing would be the smartest thing to do, but we don‚Äôt seem to do smart in this country anymore."

2020-06-11 22:09:17,"""Grim Forcasts.""  

As one who took many advanced math and applied math classes, there is nothing at all surprising about a sharp uptick in cases of viral infection.  

Really?  Widespread infection happened when the case numbers were small and limited.  Did someone expect that it would be better when the cases of viral infection are numerous and widespread?

The folks who bet on the market for a living don't generally seem to grasp the underlying premise that virologists and public health medical experts know of what they speak.  This uptick was and is entirely predictable!  Welcome to the 21st century!  

Or maybe the Wall Street pros just wanted small investors to re-enter the market to provide new cash to be harvested?

In the US the notion of expertise has been overwhelmed by a desire to have political magic overcome physics, as if its a super-hero movie.  The Republican leadership is demonstrating how entirely foolish and ignorant they have become, rushing back & opening up in order to create an illusion of economic well-being, no matter the cost.  Ha.

Why do people continue to vote for fools?"
2020-06-11 21:52:08,"I don‚Äôt understand the concern, Trump will declare it fake news, Fox and Republicans on bended knee will swallow that, and all will be well since we will eliminate all data on economic pain, CovID death, and moral destruction."

2020-06-11 21:51:17,"It's the Trump/GOP virus, the Trump/GOP depression, and, truthfully, the Trump/GOP genocide. 

We long knew this GOP had animus towards the elderly, the poor, people of color, aliens, and LGBTQ people.

We heard Mitt Romney label such people ""takers,"" captured by a cater-waiter at a 2012 GOP fundraiser in Boca Raton--words that likely cost the Repubs the 2012 presidency.

And now Romney dons a mask and taks part in a Black Lives Matter march-as-photo-op, as if people won't forget the import of those words or see him for the opportunist he is.

I wonder what member of this ""administration"" or the GOP thought it was good policy to let ignoring a foreseeable--and foreseen--epidemic  as an ""economically efficient"" alternative to roundups, firing squads, or sending the victims to remote murder facilities? The ""conservative"" theorists who don't want to spend on public health and public education? Crackpots like Stephen Miller or Jared Kushner? A member of the Trump family who gets their jollies by big-game hunting?"

If disease (and in this case COVID-19), the lack of adequate healthcare, the lack of leadership, the lack of planning and readiness continue along this same path, things are never going to get better.  It will be a continual cycle of two steps forward and two steps back.  What happened to American exceptionalism?"
2020-06-11 21:50:32,"You are ignoring the obvious evidence. There was revolution in the streets, talk of sending in troops and/or abolishing police departments, and the Dow went through the roof. It quiets down, and stocks slump again. It has nothing at all to do with coronavirus, which was there the whole time - Wall Street wants the End of America. It's not clear what their reasoning is, or what they would like to come next - but anyone can see this is what the plungers are betting on."
2020-06-11 21:35:46,"I worked in Tower One, where 60 heroic cops rushed to their deaths to save complete strangers. I'll never forget, and I'll continue to believe that the majority of cops are genuine public servants, and some of them are among the best and bravest people on the planet. ""Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one‚Äôs life for his friends.""

But the attitude of too many of the NYPD in reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement during the past two and a half weeks is beyond disappointing. Some of them seem to have adopted a siege mentality pitting the police force against the people.

Hate to say it, but it's hard not to suspect that the systemic racism within the force that they've been denying is what's driving this hostile, belligerent attitude."

2020-06-11 22:23:47,"Evidence is mounting that lockdowns have had no long term beneficial effect in suppressing infection rates. Some may recall the New York study quoted by governor Cuomo that 66% of new infections were retired and/or unemployed people. In New Jersey we have been in lock down for 3 months and people have dutifully complied. Nevertheless we keep seeing new infections. At some point the efficacy of the prescription imposed by the lock down crowd needs to be questioned.

The good news is that the CDC now estimates a survival rate of 99.9% for those under the age of 65. The bad news is that many of the most vulnerable have already succumbed, especially the poor souls locked down in the nursing homes that account for more than half of New Jerseys death total. Not only did they die, they died alone without the comfort of loved ones who were deprived of a final farewell.

At some point the ""experts"" should be compelled to answer why their prescription for ""protecting"" us was such a colossal failure and why we should believe them in the future."
2020-06-11 22:47:16,"Journalists decided that the stock market fell because the virus infections are getting so numerous.  Yet, in many states,  NY as example, the rates are falling significantly.  In some states, rates remain low.  There's been good news recently about covid-19 although mostly in other media, the Times not featuring the good news.  Could investors just be waking up to the pandemic?  It hardly seems likely.  Putting the loss today on the virus is convenient but defies logic and avoids considering that stocks may be overbought."

I think the politicians have decided the sacrifice of even half a million Americans is a satisfactory trade off for economic activity.  It's clear the Governor's simply do not care, and many people don't either.  I also think that there are a lot of areas (like the one I live in) where the virus hasn't been a huge issue, most people don't know anyone who had it, and people are just tired of it.  That is unfortunately going to bite a lot of people in the behind, but if people choose to attend political rallies, theme parks, malls, etc.  they are making a decision about how much risk they are willing to take.  Unfortunately due to the fact this virus is horribly contagious, they are also determining how much risk many in their sphere are going to take - and that to me is the problem.  I'm still limiting outings, wearing a mask, won't be traveling or attending any group events.

Instead of having a rational nation public health policy, enacting nation guidelines, testing, and contact tracing, we have Jerrod and Ivanka doing I don't know what.  The virus is about to hit us hard again and it is Donald Trump's fault.  We needed strong public health leadership and what we got was The Donald Trump Show for more days than I care to remember.

I do hope he has huge rallies on a daily basis. trumptards don't know that he has all the resources to protect him but they don't but they don't care either. They deny anything that's real or truths. If Democrats say North then they'll say North is wrong and South is the only way to go. It's all about doing the opposite of the left even if it makes sense. 

NYC Cops don't want to wear masks for the same reason. They have a long history of racism so no surprise there. They can find something comfortable to put over their nose and mouth they just want to own the libs.

Protesting to get your hair done is one of many of their dumb schemes and plots.

So, dumb trump fans at rallies pass the virus amongst themselves. The ones that get sick can't sue the Donald because they electronically signed his no-fault clause. Oh well.

But what about the people out in the wider community, that didn't attend the rallies, that get sick from the asymptomatic virus carriers that spawn from the rallies? Is it the Donald's fault that they when they are infected and get sick from people who attended his rallies? 

Rational people should be outraged about this. But nothing is ever the Donald's fault, right?"

This event will be a party that no respectable non-invited virus could resist crashing, so I hope to Got that I'm wrong about this, but I'm afraid that we'll be hearing about the infections that occur and are carried back and spread to wherever the attendees return to after the convention - and that our glorious leader will be sure to deny any responsibility for - either morally or financially."

It appears trump enjoys similar protection for unrestrained libelous assertions he makes almost daily from the presidential bully pulpit. trump must know that if and when he loses the election he‚Äôll face prosecution. The inevitable prospect of conviction and even possible imprisonment looms menacingly on the horizon."

As a consequence, French pediatricians are asking for children to resume their children‚Äôs lives.
 I, for one, am appalled at the ease with which our society has sacrificed children, with people ready to protest for their right to go to the hairdresser or restaurant but showing little outrage over children being deprived of food or education, or, let‚Äôs face it, of a childhood.

So before you embark on such a foolish and illinformed mission, motivated by the dark, unfettered side of Capitalism and wall street's urging, consider how valuable your life, and your children's lives are.  If our Congress continues to remain divided on continuing to support its citizens in their efforts to protect their own lives and their children's, as well as the lives of others, by remaining quarantined, all of us need to step up and demand their compliance with our financial needs.

The Trump administration is playing this pandemic as if it were a short term problem for obvious political gains.  In reality, the best way to play this politically would be to publicly admit the severity of the problem and implement a long term solution.

Trump has done neither.  In fact, he denied the severity of the situation for months before the body count forced him to reconsider.  Now, he claims it's all over.

As a consequence of his denials and inaction, we are now faced with a long term economic downturn which will eat away at us.  By the way, daily confirmed cases are still over 20,000.  That's two million people in 100 days."
2020-06-18 17:43:55,"This is how economic depressions work. One person loses their job, and reduces their spending. In turn, that makes other people less willing to spend, either because their income is down, or they're worried they'll lose their jobs.
The job losses and reductions in personal spending feed on each other. The factory reduces the number of workers; fewer workers go out to lunch. The luncheonette lays off a few people. 

They buy fewer napkins, manufactured at the local factory. As orders drop off, the factory lays off more workers. The luncheonette lays off another waiter and cook. Fewer napkin orders. More layoffs.

The critical insight Keynes had was, states and local governments CAN'T fix this- their revenues are going down too, and they're furloughing employees too. They're spending more on unemployment benefits, but have less tax coming in.

Only the Federal government can 'just spend' money to get people back to work. Until WWII, we didn't do enough of that, and unemployment stayed at 10-15% until 1942 when war spending finally stimulated the economy enough.

The BEST thing we could do would be to test, track, and isolate people to stop the virus transmission. Once we get new cases to ZERO in an area, we can go back to normal. 

Until then, we're just fooling ourselves."

If we don't have money coming in we watch our savings disappear.  Without money coming in we can't save anything.  Even with money coming in, the basics have become quite expensive no matter where one lives in America.  

If our leaders care they'd start to look at how to support the little economy.  They'd realize that we need generous unemployment benefits, that the next job is no longer around the corner (or something we can get through networking or looking at the job sites), that our basic needs don't disappear when we're unemployed.  We've been living in a country run by and for the richest since the 1980s.

After a while even the investments by the upper third will be affected by lower expectations and earnings. The price/earnings ratio of a stock is very difficult to fake.

The MTA prints it‚Äôs own money, bonds, at the behest of the NY Gov, who controls the MTA Board. 
Huge spending in NYS and lucrative contracts for companies and principals who contribute heavily to political campaigns *wink*.
The best part for the gov?
The debt does not appear on the states books. 
It is a piggy bank. 
Currently, 60% of each ride on the subway goes to paying debt service on the MTA bonds. 
If the MTA is broke and strapped, let the bonds default. It does not hurt the state. 
There would be an IMMEDIATE revenue infusion of 60% to the MTA for the subways, not paying billions in zombie interest. 
And the fed can help the MTA get that 60% increase by not buying $8.5B in debt. 
The investors will take a hit. 
There was a risk in the investment, they accepted it when the bought in. 
All that then needs to be done goi g forward is to have an MTA with a balanced budget. It will be debt free.

They can then use the money they earned to buy the assets of the bankrupt companies at low prices so these assets can be used to make handsome profits.   

Somehow the country seems run mainly for the benefit of the leveraged buyout firms.  This shows the power of astute lobbying, propaganda, and political donations."

However, the Trump Corporation shows a supplementary survival initiative, go to the USG for stimulus bail out, even getting more that way than by staying afloat by using bankruptcy to clear out unwanted obligations to investors, employees and banks.

The key to this strategy is to arrange more favorable bail outs, loans, stimulus through lobbying and sweetheart connections than the less connected competition.

2020-06-19 00:19:30,"Someone needs to explain to me the virtues of the leveraged buyouts. It sounds a lot like the days of Michael Miliken where they saddled companies with huge debt and giving tos of cash to shareholders. Argument was that they weren't using their capital efficiently.  Well we know how that ended. Now  we have Blackstone, KKR and others doing much same thing. Maybe having excess retained earning in form of cash isn't 'efficient' but it sure helps weather a storm or economic downturn. We are quick to sing the praises of Capitslism, but on closer examination it has many flaws especially absent real government oversight and real competition. If we had 'true capitalism's and 'true free markets' we would not have government and Federal Reserve bailing out private companies. Bailouts can be justified to keep economy from collapsing but then government also is entitled to set rules and do oversight. Companies seem to want the aid but never the regulations that might prevent these problems or abuses."

Who needs these Johnny come lately experts? and how come they did not agitate to say don't shut down businesses for more than a week? What has made things worse is generous govt compensation for some workers not to work. Basically the govt poached the employees by taking away civil liberties of the employees and paying them not to work. 

I can now understand why govs across US ordered businesses to shut down. We were totally ill-prepared and unwilling to keep all businesses open because we were incapable of empowering adult US residents below 55 to take care of themselves by making adequate masks available because Dr. Fauci wanted to prioritize the availability of proper masks to the frontline health care workers and there were not enough sanitizers and thermometers available for the general public and not enough hospital beds and quarantine facilities. It is a shame that Gov. Newsom of CA, has only today made masks to be worn in public places mandatory. I can no longer stand to see sagging masks any more. This morning 2 ladies at the gas station were wearing sagging black masks like Newsom. I asked them does the company not provide you with proper masks? They did not want to answer. I told them that I am a self appointed mask police and with the limited power to implement proper masks to be worn properly, I am buying each one of you a proper mask and so I did."

Yes, a tragedy for those who have lost loved-ones, primarily people over the age of 60 and younger people suffering from an underlying health condition (full disclosure: I'm 71 years old so I'm in the ""at risk"" category) but an equally horrible tragedy for those who have lost jobs and may never work again because they don't have the skills that would allow them to work remotely, those who may have been teetering on the verge of homelessness four months ago and are now, officially, homeless, those who may have become so despondent over the loss of their livelihood that they committed suicide because they saw no future.

Many of these types of assets have been bought up by insurance companies, university endowments, municipal governments, and sovereign wealth funds.   The insurance companies probably did due diligence and bought the sounder deals, but the more naive institutions were probably sold the least desirable deals.   

The worst loans were probably sold in the international market, to Japanese banks and Arab sovereign funds.   They have lots of extra capital, and think the US is a good place to invest in.

The other is the Fed, 10 years of money printing and interest rate suppression triggered a global hunt for yield. Because there was a long line of investors willing to buy even the iffiest of debt, companies could keep borrowing more and more. Risk was obscured because maturing debt and interest could always be paid by issuing more debt. This risk never really went away because the pile of debt kept getting bigger and bigger. Now suddenly all this risk has surfaced and briefly in March, the debt markets froze.

In my retirement, I decided to work in retail as I did in high school and college. When customers were ready to pay for purchases, they opened their wallets with a collection of credit cards.

I forget who came up with the description, ""subprime"" credit card debt, (maybe, Paul Krugman?) but there now is nearly $1T in consumer debt with up to 27 percent interest, thanks to several years of pent-up demand followed by ""consumer confidence."" 

Then, does anyone remember when car loans had typical payment plans of 36-48 months? A few years ago, lenders and dealers came up with the 84-96 month loans in an effort to move those cars off the dealer lots. 

What no one expected at the end of 2019 was soaring unemployment in 2020 in the millions resulting in a surge of evictions and mortgage foreclosures, not to mention the food banks. With millions of Americans now out of work, and homeless, that means more bankruptcies from debt on credit cards and auto loans.

2020-06-19 08:48:33,"Unfortunately, besides the immediate negative effect for a number of companies and sectors, there might also be a long-time effect: the companies depending on exports or imports might be influenced by what happens in foreign markets and it might take time to trickle down.  And than there is the effect of the inventories and (lack ) of cash-flow; today's inventories and cash might help out for the time being;  if the economy doesn't pick up then we'll see the effect next year or maybe even later.  This is a global issue as these factors play in most countries.  It's time that smart people try to find solutions for what's coming to all of us."

2020-06-19 09:40:21,"This is a matter for senator Tom  of Arkansas supplicant to that stable genius.

I note that bond yields are dropping.

I think that means that expectations of returns are expected to be low. 

The QE policy of free money invites acquirement of splurging on assets that will ride out the current economic crisis.


Assets such as the family home with  mortgage are in the mix.

The  banks have the right to reclaim your home if you default.

Cashed up by Fed policy to claim assets.

Do the math.

You have 25% equity, the bank 75%.

The bank has an majority  financial claim on  your  home.

The bank may have an  interest in foreclosing and sell their assets  in property as majority owner.

With zero costs of borrowing and capitalising property values your home is a in the cross hairs.

Trump could if an effective president ensure every American has a home for life.

He could ensure every American is fed and educated.

 Trump has had a dream run, no Viet Nam or Cold War.

The guy is an economic luddite.  

 The next fifty years post Trump are arguments for contraception.

Not everyone can call an airconditioned upmarket hotel a home.

The gilded brat runs America.

Tom of Arkansas should compose a polite apology  to US allies for his obsequious supplication to Trump.

Decades of takeovers, buyouts, and excessively bad management ruined what would have been stable businesses. One can surmise the fancy MBAs were not even close to being as intelligent as the cleaning staff.

The day of reckoning has come. Businesses do NOT have a right to life and should not be bailed out. Time for private equity to eat the toxic waste they created. And yes, Jane and Joe Well Above Average and many other ""investors"" will feel pain. The system needs to be reset.

The Fed is trying to save people from themselves by keeping interest rates low to make the debts easier to pay, but that just encouraged profligate people, businesses and governments to continue borrowing. Unfortunately, an unknowable exogenous event - Covid-19 - emerged as the trigger that will bring the house down. In my opinion, the entire world is going to experience a depression of extreme magnitude as bankruptcies explode. Even the bankruptcy lawyers will have difficulty getting paid. The real unknown, however, is whether this will lead to horrific global warfare (shooting type, not cold)."

The good thing about being Australian is that historically we had boundaries.

Geographic and moral.

Our politicians invite derision and justly so.

The levels of poverty down under are measured.

20% of Australian workers cough would like more work.

The metric is clear.

20% of Australians have little chance of home ownership to raise a family.

The release of retirement funds has meant a $10 pizza will cost $1000 for our youngsters in the future.


I have no issue with American Presidents such as Roosevelt who dealt the new deal.

Trump is.

Sad to read that JFKs sister died today. 

She is not forgotten in Ireland.

And the free world.

She enabled the end to the Troubles.

As a Roman Catholic who observes holy days as a hermit we today lost Vera Lyn and saw Macron in London adulating that courage  and a message from General De Gaulle in London this day in1940 asserting France would be Free.

Add to that the trillions the Fed is doling out by buying the junk bonds these failing companies are feverishly printing before the well runs dry.

Even after all the free stuff, these companies are still carrying $10.5 trillion in debt. (What was that the GOP was piously spouting about real people being 'responsible' and having rainy day funds for situations like this?)

Before the KKRs, the junk bonds, and corporate raiders, American businesses (and their boards) did their best to avoid taking on debt.  CEOs made good salaries in line with their rank and in some relation to their labor pool.

They privatize the gains going up, then say, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all in this together‚Äù. We as a society need to stop worrying about poorly managed multi-billion dollar corporations, that have merely went on a spending spree, and repurchased their own stock. We can thank the Republican Party under Reagan, for rolling back that regulation, but then the SEC went one step further. They actually added what‚Äôs called ‚ÄúThe safe harbor rule‚Äù which means that even though they are manipulating their stock value simply by uttering the words, buy back. But buying back your own stock, really just takes equity out of the corporations and puts that equity into the pockets of the CEO and senior management, and the large shareholders. They have repurchased 5 trillion dollars worth of their own shares, but then tell us, they are too big to fail. If a multibillion dollar corporation can‚Äôt survive on its own for 9-12 months, maybe they should fail."

The fact that these athletes are also millionaires and celebrities who will receive the ""best"" care as they perform for the rest of us also reinforces the relation between economic stratification and ""safety"" from the pandemic.

I  think sometimes photos of New York Parks, or Florida beaches, are used mostly because they're nice pictures and not because they inform about the problem."
2020-06-18 13:36:32,"You can partly attribute this to the dissonant response throughout the country.  People like me and my family -- and, as far as I can tell, nearly all of our friends -- have avoided each other, socially distanced, worn masks, struggled to work from home, or to work at all for more than three months.  And now, encouraged by the fool in the White House, states that had never entirely shut down to begin with are opening up again. I can't blame people for wondering what the point is.  Around our house, we'll continue as we have for as long as necessary, even as our school years, summer plans, and work schedules have been demolished.

2020-06-18 13:44:43,"I'm not sure what you are trying to accomplish with this article.  Gov. Cuomo has gone to great lengths sharing the data on hospitalization rate, transmission rate, testing data, etc.  It is clear that many New Yorkers are making decisions based on the data.  In the absence of a direct order to stay indoors or any clear goal of what result public health officials are trying to achieve, is it herd immunity/vaccine/therapy treatment/all of the above (Mayor DeBlasio is very unclear IMO), it appears to me that most are taking risks they feel comfortable with, reassured by the new testing capacity that is available and wearing masks to minimize risks."
2020-06-18 13:46:41,"Spending the week in Florida, where I'm hard-pressed to see much evidence that there's a pandemic based on people's behavior (even though the state's cases are skyrocketing and deaths are likely close behind that).

Being a New Yorker amidst a population that's ignoring social distancing, face covering, etc., it's a daily challenge to hold the line on prudent measures. But then I remember the trailer full of bodies a couple blocks from my apartment and the fact that we could be back there in weeks or months if we're not smart.

Floridians never saw that and their GOP governor, like Trump, seems to think the virus adheres to political, not scientific, rules. But New Yorkers should know better."
2020-06-18 13:49:22,"There is no ending to this story besides this one. Not that many people will take a vaccine, even if it's available, and as the virus mutates, there may be multiple iterations of treatments and approaches, with no magic bullet anyway;  asymptomatic transmission is evidently rare. Catching the virus from surfaces it not apparently a serious threat. How else can the story end but by fragmentation, when the scientific narrative is already fragmented and so diverse, and contextual."
2020-06-18 13:56:11,"""...New York City has become a barometer, of a nation of pent-up souls eager for a change no matter what their governors or mayors think.""

That's a curious statement. Sure, people are longing to return to normalcy, but even liberal politicians are promoting a premature opening. Gavin Newsom has been trying to defend his re-opening plans, and this article even noted that Cuomo announced that he's going ahead with the next phase of reopening, despite clear evidence that it's way too early.

We have a political class that routinely prioritizes the needs of commerce over the needs of the people, and predictably, both parties are advocating premature re-openings.

There is so much that could be done, including public service announcements encouraging the continued use of precautions and education on the precautions (I see many not putting the masks over their noses). But with our leaders giving mixed messages about the consequences of premature re-opening, the quote above really amounts to victim-blaming.

Our leaders instead lavished trillions on corporations, while failing to provide a safety net for the public, as the mile-long lines at food banks attests.

A country that refuses to act in the best interests of the health of its citizens is a failed state."
2020-06-18 13:56:16,"Look at any mid-western states/Florida/other very open states.  No one is wearing masks, not in bars/restaurants, not on beaches,etc.  New Yorkers are probably the most responsible of the bunch... I don't think it is fair to come down on them so hard because if anything, they are doing the best job social distancing and wearing masks 95% of the time."
2020-06-18 13:57:18,"That's right. The overblown response is over, and the expected response --the one in which individuals take their own personally preferred precautions (as was the case with H1N1 in 2009), has finally begun, sort of. Businesses are still requiring masks or you can't come in, even though cloth masks do almost nothing to stop spread of an illness. And don;t talk to me about a single computer model study indicating the efficacy of cloth masks while social distancing is also in place. Mask wearing has become a fad at this point.

The case count will increase, the deaths will continue. As governors who opened their states up to commerce and business will deny it's reason to reverse course, given American culture instructs to never admit defeat, we will all be wondering soon if it was all worth it.

I still have one word for my critics: Sweden."
2020-06-18 14:02:58,I know the virus is very happy that social distancing and face mask are on the decline. It still has a couple of hundred million new friends it wants to meet here in the U.S. before herd immunity could kick in and spoil the party.
2020-06-18 14:03:42,We cannot stay inside forever. It‚Äôs true. The goal was to flatten the curve not to eradicate the curve or to wait for a magic vaccine that somehow skipped the standard 2-3 years of safety tests.
2020-06-18 14:10:15,"Federal, state, and local governments have mishandled this every step of the way. Cuomo and DeBlasio's bickering and backstabbing has shown, and people do not trust that either of these men are acting in the public interests. The national response has been pitiful, and Mitch McConnell has actively said that he is trying to punish New York during this crisis. Small business have received no real support that's needed to comply with close orders.

Why would anyone listen to these people? They can't even listen to each other. If the average person felt that the government was acting to help him/her and his/her family, then he/she would oblige. But every time a decision is made, it gets overshadowed by someone else; OR the truth eventually comes out and exposes the ulterior motive. 

I'm in my 20s in NY and have not joined in on the recklessness of bar hopping during a pandemic, nor have I participated in the protests. Most of us do recognize the dangers of this virus, but I also don't blame people for not following the rules. It's not just 'quarantine fatigue' or selfishness, but they simply don't know what to believe! 

Vote them all out. Cuomo, DeBlasio, McConnell, Trump, Maloney. Democrat and Republican - they're all letting this country fall apart. Chaos breeds power."
2020-06-18 14:13:10,"This is going on in SF too, and it's frustrating and troubling.  Outdoor dining is now allowed, and from what I've seen neither restaurants nor patrons are following the rules.  
As many have said and written- coming out of lockdown is in many ways harder than going in.  And for me, at least, it's much more anxiety ridden.   It's easy when it's clear what needs to be done and everyone you know does it (ala March& April).  June so far has been a real challenge for me as so many of my friends, including very close ones, have started breaking out and bending rules/interpretations.  It's contagious - you see someone else having a great time, close to friends wo masks on IG or at a local outdoor bar, why can't/shouldn't I be able to do it too? 
I'll be the first to admit that as a single, childless semi-introvert with a dog, who tends to be a rule follower, living in a reasonably large apt close to a lovely dog park, this process has been much, much easier for me than for many or most.  I am extremely lucky and I know it, and I try my best not to judge.
My friends with kids are going nuts, as are the children.  They feel they have to give for their family sanity.  I get that.
But the many who just HAVE to go to brunch/dinner/beach/wine country with people they haven't seen in months w/o masks or distancing are really pushing my patience. 
I fear what all this thoughtless, selfish activity will bring for both community health and friendships."
2020-06-18 14:16:20,"When over 1200 health care professionals penned a letter supporting protests as vital to the national public health, the flood gates were opened.  I knew that people were no longer going to be content with staying at home.   And that politicians and other health care workers, urging us to shelter in place, had lost all credibility."
2020-06-18 14:18:17,"Why would anyone take anything heath authorities say seriously when nobody complained when tens of thousands of people have been gathering to protest, all the while ignoring social distancing mandates with sporadic mask wearing? 

If I owned a business I would open up fully, without restrictions, consequences be what they might."
2020-06-18 14:26:00,"We need to keep up the common sense practices we have all been, mostly doing for the last several months.

Wear a mask
Social Distance if and when at all possible
Wash your hands anytime you touch something that someone else touched or is not clean

Stop going out to bars and partying with your friends as if nothing is happening.

The virus doesn‚Äôt care if you are bored and lonely.

The virus also doesn‚Äôt care if you are young and healthy.  It can have severe impacts to that population as well.

It‚Äôs also about protecting the more vulnerable in our population with preexisting conditions that make the virus much worse by slowing the spread.

And that isn‚Äôt just old people.  It‚Äôs everyone with asthma, heart problems, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and other problems.
    
But this social media driven me me me generation with an internet driven attention span of a gnat will be the end of us all.  Probably still on their parents health insurance so no worries for them if they get it and need health care.    Me, me, me, me, me.

Time to crack down and enforce distancing rules once again."
2020-06-18 14:28:46,"Being in the vulnerable age group and looking at the possibility of remote teaching come fall I am still taking precautions and follow guidelines seriously simply because my employer still thinks this is still a big deal at this point in time
In case being cautious (including wearing a mask)  acts as a big fat placebo effect in my being able to dodge the virus so far, then I am satisfied regardless of anyone who thinks it doesn't make a difference anymore
It's a small price to pay since there is no way to predict the severity of the damage that the virus would do to me or my spouse"

2020-06-18 14:39:15,"The Spanish Flu killed approx 675K in the US will this one exceed it, it very well may if people do not take it seriously. I still do and you should too. If everyone would do their part it would go a long way to tamping it down."
2020-06-18 14:40:47,"Unfortunately, the pandemic doesn't appear to be real unless you or someone you know gets sick from the coronavirus. It would be interesting for epidemiologists to include this behavior in their disease transmission models and see how many more people are infected as a result."
2020-06-18 14:50:52,"I take issue with this headline. The majority of New Yorkers are doing their best to stay safe and prevent the spread, but we've been doing it pretty consistently for three months so I suppose it's not considered newsworthy.

I work in public health and have been evangelistic when it comes to social distancing and mask wearing. Yet I also attended protests, as a calculated risk. Supporting the end of systemic racism? Absolutely worth it for me (as a relatively healthy young person who does not live with anyone in the high risk category). Donating blood? Also worth it. But I am not going out and clogging the streets to day drink because the reward is not worth the risk (not just to myself, but to others).

It is unfortunate that individual risk assessment and decision making are likely too complex for public health messaging, which is easiest to do for simple messages like ""wash your hands for 20 seconds"" or ""wear a face covering."""
2020-06-18 14:54:54,"My question is ""How are New Yorkers going to deal with the second wave?"", the one coming in the fall.
Will they ignore it like Trump?  Will they step up and become diligent again about distance and masks?"
2020-06-18 15:01:35,"Need daily firm but caring reminders & tips from governors, leaders (think Jacinta), mayors, scientists. DAILY.
Of course infection rates will soar, the virus is lurking, still very much out there.
People are bending towards others like plants to light (happens to us too, easy to understand) but we need to not let down our guard, no no no, not yet. Keep masked around anyone & everyone outside your home. Keep distancing. Don‚Äôt go into any building unless it‚Äôs an emergency. It is still a PANDEMIC killing thousands upon thousands."
2020-06-18 15:01:45,"It should come as no surprise that a shift to normalcy is occurring. Small business owners are desperately trying to salvage what they can. Many are facing financial ruin and like the 1929 stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression, taking a leap off the Brooklyn Bridge might seem like a way out. Desperate times call for desperate measures. It‚Äôs disheartening that we have come to the decision to take our chances with the coronavirus, despite its lethality, because the alternative feels just as deadly."
2020-06-18 15:02:44,"Living on the upper East side of Manhattan, 99% of people outside and inside are wearing masks. I don‚Äôt see large congregations. This phenomenon seems to be dependent on what neighborhood you live in.

Wearing masks, protecting the most vulnerable and avoiding large congregations seems to be the simplest way to avoid large scale transmission.  

Look at the data from Japan. 125 million people, minimal number of cases and deaths. They have been wearing masks the entire time."
2020-06-18 15:03:09,"As if there is any choice but to carry on as normal. With no end in sight and no guarantee of a vaccine, what exactly are public health officials asking of individuals? 

Are we supposed to remain isolated for years to come? Some models have only 25% of the population exposed to the virus after two years - a far cry from 'herd immunity'. But in the meantime we destroy the economy (especially for those at or near the bottom) and  our way of life?"
2020-06-18 15:03:43,"Dr. Michael Osterholm, one of the nation's leading epidemiologists, said on Wednesday evening he wouldn't gather in a confined space even if the four Beatles could be re-joined for a concert. I wonder what those who gather without masks or enter a confined space in New York, Florida, Oklahoma and Arizona  know that he doesn't."
2020-06-18 15:04:52,"‚ÄúBlanket lockdowns drew distinctions between permissible and prohibited activities that made little or no sense and left people exhausted by arbitrary dictates. 
In this context, it is hardly surprising that some people are rebelling even at relatively modest precautions when they are recommended by the same public officials who deprived them of their livelihoods and confined them to their homes. 
That reaction, while understandable, poses a real problem as we settle in for the long haul and wait for a vaccine to save us. Precautions that might have been sustainable without lockdowns may prove less tolerable after that bitter experience.‚Äù

2020-06-18 15:07:06,"If we had a competent mayor, there would have been serious discussions with key constituencies about how to best manage the official and unofficial re-opening of different venues in the city.  And there should be the room to experiment with different approaches.

Sadly, the best approaches -- including open streets and closure of blocks to create more space for socially-distant socializing -- have been stalled by a mayor who is incapable of making a sensible decision.

As a member of a family in the hospitality business, I fully understand the push by owners to get their bars and restaurants up and running. But it should not be left up to individual establishments to decide what works. Learn from each other to bring back the whole industry...."
2020-06-18 15:09:20,I have to say the Williamsburg/Greenpoint population has been -absolutely terrible- throughout the entirety of the pandemic.  I never saw widespread majority mask usage there. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that this is a highly gentrified/young/privileged area of NYC.
2020-06-18 15:10:26,I went for a drive around Manhattan last week and it was dead dead dead. So quiet everywhere it was deeply upsetting for me. Yes there were some blocks were there were people at restaurants outside but just a few areas. We are a long way from 'acting normally'.
2020-06-18 13:29:22,"Selfish, inconsiderate fools, who probably think they‚Äôre enlightened, progressive and better than everyone else. That is what these people who are willfully ignoring social distancing and face covering orders are. I‚Äôm sorry but your desire to shop, and have a burger and margarita outside can wait another week or two.

Don‚Äôt even get me started on De Blasio. In addition to fitting the description above, the man is totally incompetent and refuses to enforce the guidelines that are keeping us healthy. 

I am starting to think that the initial shelter-in-place was the easy part and that reopening/quickly responding to a new wave or pockets of infection will be a disaster because too many New Yorkers can‚Äôt obey simple and sensible orders to help keep us safe."
2020-06-18 13:59:00,"There are new cases in New Zealand, where just days ago they proclaimed Covid-19 eradicated.  New cases in China.  South Korea.  Are New Yorkers so willing to undo what progress has been made?"
2020-06-18 14:40:31,I‚Äôm afraid of being forced back into life as normal before it‚Äôs safe. What happens if offices demand their workers back into the office before July and midJuly the numbers spike again?! This disease can KILL! I don‚Äôt want to risk my life; I have too much to live for.

2020-06-18 15:11:58,"Most of the people shown in parks and outdoor cafes are under 40. The truth is covid is not ‚Äúan equal opportunity killer‚Äù as cable news pundits have claimed. Almost all COVID-19 mortality models focus on number of deaths, without considering age structure and comorbidities. This can give very misleading inferences about the burden of disease in terms of quality-adjusted life-years lost, which is far more important than simple death count. The average age of COVID deaths is 80+. In many states the majority were nursing home residents. These vulnerable groups need to be isolated to limit their risk. In contrast,  the Spanish flu killed young people with average fatality  age of 28. Its burden in terms of number of quality-adjusted person-years lost was about 1000-fold higher than the COVID-19. Younger, healthy people are not at risk of  dying from COVID. I mean ‚Äúnot at risk‚Äù the same way I would mean I am not at risk of dying as I drive to work, or my child is not at risk of getting kidnapped on his way to school i.e., it is so unlikely that it doesn‚Äôt paralyze me into fearful inaction, but I do take reasonable safety precautions for both. Younger people are not suited for extended lockdown, and will not wait for an unknowable date months or years from now when we get an effective vaccine or curative treatment. We will need to live with the virus as society functions."
2020-06-18 15:14:33,"This attitude became very noticeable in May, when the nice weather hit. Lots of folks went from crossing the street to distance...to tacitly declaring the pandemic over, as spring had arrived. Masks disappeared to an extent, as did distancing in parks, on sidewalks, etc.

With no unified leadership, no central voice of reason to get through to the American people that this isn't a game, we've been left to fend for ourselves. We're still in danger, but we're ""reopening."" Governors vs. mayors vs. a toxic two-year-old in a 74-year-old body...a completely fractured, rudderless society, kinda maybe wearing masks...or not. 

I've had a fantasy that there was a sane person in the White House who stood next to a previous president from the opposing party in a show of solidarity, and both looked into the camera and very solemnly said to us: This is not up for grabs. This is not a partisan political issue. It is a virus that can kill you or your loved ones. We ask you to rise to the challenge of the common good, to behave as responsible citizens. We know this is difficult, but it's necessary. We are in this together. There are more important things right now than having a cocktail on a street corner. But when the time is right, we can raise a glass as one, knowing that we looked out for each other. 

Instead, chaos, self-interest...and partying. No ""society."" Just selfies with our infection partners in the background."
2020-06-18 15:15:21,"I have yet to see a formal declaration that the pandemic is over. It is perfectly natural for people to feel liberated. The rules are clear, if things get worse, more restrictions may follow. We are learning as we go along. Many countries, states and cities are reopening and monitoring. Fear and shaming doesn‚Äôt help, particularly in NYC where people have sacrificed so much to flatten the curve. Being on the downward slope doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre done and most people know that."
2020-06-18 13:38:07,Honestly I don't see how 3 months is that long of a time. People are babies. There's some kind of all or nothing mentality out there.
2020-06-18 15:16:05,"A little more information can be a risky thing.  Three months ago most people were terrified, thinking any exposure to a surface not already in their home could infect them and any ""contact"" anywhere with a ""stranger"" could pass on the Covid virus.  Now we know that surfaces are not prime sources of transmission and that the prime source of transmission is prolonged (5 to 15 minutes) close contact (within 6 feet) with an infected person.  Some (those recognized to be vulnerable to severe illness) remain terrified, reasonably so.  Some, particularly young adults, appear to think the virus has given them a free pass:  they won't be infected, or if they are, it will be no more troublesome than a cold.

Hopefully, most will continue to follow the advice that has remained relevant throughout.  Rigorous, frequent hand hygiene, reasonable efforts to maintain social distancing and donning masks in crowded spaces, particularly indoors."
2020-06-18 14:32:31,"So how long are people supposed to be locked away? Of course people are not following social distancing rules. Human being are social creatures. 

Of course people should wear masks when they are unable to social distance but to say that everyone should continue to lock themselves away for an indeterminate amount of time is ridiculous."
2020-06-18 13:50:33,"The pandemic is not over but it has faded to a mere remnant of what it had been. I wish this paper would stop with the doom and gloom.

2020-06-18 14:00:19,"Stop fear mongering!!!! We are all mostly still safely isolating, social distancing, and wearing masks. The media loves to drive up fear. What do you want, NYC to close for the rest of the year? Enough."

Deblasio/Cuomo saga is worse than a soap opera. And deblasiois completely incompetent. Phase 2 opening set for Monday and no release of rules and guidelines. What is he waiting for? No plans/options yet for school reopening. Plan A, B and C should have been released by now. What is he waiting for? And who is performing the logic test on guidelines because some of them are just plain stupid. The whole thing is becoming a joke."

Why didn't the author publish this headline regarding the protests?

""But anyone stepping outside or taking a glance at social media has noticed a population already so far along on the journey to normalcy that they could be living in a different place.""

Did the author fail to notice the protests in the tens of thousands ?.

The hypocrisy  and double standard on the part of DiBlasio ,Cuomo, The New York Times Editorial  Board and writers, and others is  mind boggling.

Having  not only allowed  but also  supported tens of thousands to protesters to pack  the streets of NYC  in the midst of the pandemic, the expectation is that those  who obeyed the Executive  Stay at Home Orders are expected   follow the  social distancing rules , which protesters alone  are allowed to violate,


The double standard and hypocrisy is mind boggling.  

""I get that people, it‚Äôs been so long, they‚Äôve been through so much,‚Äù Mr. de Blasio said. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs a reason we‚Äôve structured the rules, there a reason the state has structured the rules the way we have, and that‚Äôs to fight back the disease and keep it out of our lives.‚Äù

Where was DiBlasio's concern for fighting back the disease and keeping it out of our lives in terms of the protests ?

His credibility is short, as is Cuomo's.

They are making fools of themselves at this point."

IS THAT SO HARD???) but more and more people are beginning to cut corners, and then of course there are those sociopaths who never did the rules because they take delight in flouting them and intimidating those who do follow them. To sum it all up, there are just a whole lot of people in a fairly limited amount of space. All types. But everyone (or nearly everyone) has to observe the rules in order for this thing to work."
2020-06-18 14:35:09,"‚Äú Since the start of the lockdowns in March, the city has handed out 11,000 warnings and close to 2,000 summonses, according to Joseph Fucito, the New York City sheriff, who helps oversee enforcement. ‚Äù

2020-06-18 13:50:07,"We have to get on with our lives, whether the pandemic is over or not. From this point on, those most at risk for having a serious case will have to take the personal responsibility of continuing to quarantine themselves while the rest of us go back to living our lives. Some of us will get sick, a tiny fraction will even die, but the overwhelming majority of us will not be seriously sickened. It‚Äôs NOT selfish to think this way. If those who are most vulnerable to having a serious case take personal responsibility and continue to quarantine, there is no way for those who have gone back to living to sicken them. And let‚Äôs get something clear: You‚Äôre NOT going to catch the virus from a person walking past you for a few seconds on the sidewalk outside, and you‚Äôre unlikely to get it from touching a surface at a store or from someone standing behind or in front of you in the check-out line. If you get it, it will most likely be from someone you have chosen to socialize with or have sex with. With the exception of the tight quarters of mass transportation, and other tight quarters, this is a sickness you are most likely to get from those you spend prolonged up-close time with."
2020-06-18 14:27:03,I would really love to get a haircut sometime in 2020. This depends entirely on my fellow New Yorkers wearing masks and depressing the curve to get us to phase 3. Help a girl out!!!

Well of course it does. And of course it provokes some nervous clucking. But does anyone really believe we can have a 100% sanitary re-opening? However, does it look the same as pre-COVID? Definitely not...we have become a society of collective germaphobes and our risk today, even with all the post-Opening congregating is orders of magnitude less than before."

I fully support BLM and the need to address and correct systemic racism. But after months of articles essentially saying we're in the end times and that any efforts to open were premature, the Times and the media in general took a 2 week vacation from acknowledging the pandemic.

2020-06-18 13:38:27,"The NYT has focused on the protests and different angles on it‚Äîall pro protest never mind the fallout in the midst of a pandemic with yelling and close proximity and super spreader events.  While the protests are super newsworthy and rightfully deserving of lots of coverage (though I wanted more than I think the one story on the minority and immigrant shop owners actually impacted and devastated by the looting‚Äîmore of this from more angles is also newsworthy) ‚Äî we are in a pandemic and  presidential race.   These deserve top story headlines ongoing as well.   We need balanced news.  Not an echo chamber.   

I worry about those who will get sick from these super spreading events.  These lives (which will include many protestors) will be hugely impacted.  What cost?  The message is received (and long overdue) but I fear ongoing protests in a time of a pandemic needs to shift towards public safety.  All these problems are complex and will take thoughtful responses.  With mass unemployment and pending evictions‚Äîand decimated local and state government budgets‚Äî what now?   NYT has done a bad job of balancing the issues.

The neighborhood has become a gathering place for this and surrounding communities. The drinking on the sidewalks has happened throughout, but now there are greater numbers of people. At night Domino Park is party central, during the day, it's crowded as well... there are now small Yamaha motorbikes speeding up and down the road inside the park and popping wheelies, and some riders go up on the elevated deck on their bikes. I'm not sure why motorcycles sit outside our building revving their engines for 15 minutes, radios are blasting out of cars, and fireworks go off every night starting around 8 in and outside of the park and again around 2 am (when my scared dog jumps into bed with me). The sidewalks are jammed. The other once ""undiscovered""  parks in the neighborhood are now also so crowded there are few places to go without crowds. And there are more and more people not wearing masks (mostly not wearing masks). I get the need to gather and be outside. It's also clear people most likely are not working, because it's now like this day and night.  But the gatherings have become too large. I understand the appeal of going to the waterfront, which should all become parkland. I would just ask everyone to be respectful, wear masks, throw their garbage away (not on the streets), and stop with the fireworks and loud radios."
2020-06-18 15:25:00,"New York is not unique. Other areas of the country are experiencing the same problem: citizens acting as if reopening means all is good. My neighbors who religiously wore masks and practiced social distancing last month have stopped wearing masks. They still socially distance if peer pressure gets to them. Some of my neighbors are having ""block parties"" that take over the sidewalk, such that I have to walk through the party or in the street to get by them. But I blame the lack of clear, national leadership. When our leaders don't wear masks and socially distance, we can't be surprised that our neighbors don't either."
2020-06-18 15:08:14,"This New Yorker is not acting like the pandemic is over. I will not be sitting inside or outside any restaurants or any crowded parks any time soon. I will continue to wear a mask and practice social distancing whenever leaving my apartment to run errands. Our collective nonchalance about this highly contagious and deadly virus is thanks to inept leadership. If Trump and Pence cared about preserving our lives and livelihoods, they would have worn masks in public and inundated us with a clear, unified message based on science and data every day for the past three months. Instead they‚Äôre acting like it‚Äôs over and we can all just go back to normal and MAGA. Ha! They are making America sicker and poorer and more miserable with each passing day. I just want to make America rational again. Is that really too much to ask?"
2020-06-18 14:55:19,"The denial of the ongoing pandemic described here is a major problem, and will likely facilitate the spread of the coronavirus. The New York Times bears substantial responsibility. The Times published a series of editorials with titles like ‚ÄúProtest is Patriotic,‚Äù along with many op-ed columns, strongly encouraging participation in mass protests against racism, triggered by the murder of George Floyd. The motivation was understandable, but the editorials and columns largely disregarded the pandemic, and did not emphasis the risk, and the need for masks. Judging by the photos of the protests, some wore masks, but many did not. 

This was irresponsible journalism by the Times, and may have done serious harm.

That said, we must be careful not to err too far in the other direction going forward. Draconian lockdowns slow the spread of the virus, and protected our health care system from being overwhelmed. But they also do tremendous harm, and have resulting in worldwide hunger and even starvation. As the Times has described, vaccination for preventable diseases has been put on hold. 

Moving ahead, normal will not return until there is a vaccine, but we must allow local and the global economies to resume, or the cure will be much worse than the disease. This means continued, but intelligently applied, social distancing, and, in many circumstances, the use of masks in public. Mass gatherings, including protests should probably be restricted."
2020-06-18 14:09:29,"Let's be clear here - the way that most NYers have handled this is absolutely extraordinary. I do not see that covered often - if at all - by the NYT, which is incredibly disappointing and, quite frankly, emblematic of a disturbing trend of focusing on bad news because that is what sells. Yes, there are people doing stupid things - that is always going to be the case. But the vast majority of NYers are in masks and are being careful about social distancing. 

There also needs to be some nuance here as we learn more about the disease. You are unlikely to pick it up from a surface. Risk of transmission is far less in an outdoor setting. We NEED to take those developments and use them to ease up slightly on the strict measures we have taken where appropriate, because total isolation is also detrimental to health. This virus is going to be with us for a long time.

The constant berating of an entire city that has been decimated by this disease, based on photos of a few blocks of the East Village or Domino Park, without acknowledging the sacrifices NYers have been making for three months, needs to stop. NYT, please do better with your coverage and considering the social implications of what you're writing about."

2020-06-18 15:10:04,The impact of tens of thousands of marching protesters on the spread of the virus has yet to be tested.NYC should delay re-openings for two weeks in order to determine if there is a spike in the spread of the virus from the hordes of protesters. If there is not it would be a validation of the re-opening.

Alas, this is not the case.....unfortunately.. regardless of what is taught in primary and secondary school our current society, especially here in the US, is infected with disease(s) more deadly than COVID 19: malignant selfishness and willful ignorance....thus the belief that ""the severity of the  pandemic is fake news' and wearing a mask is ""political"""

2020-06-18 15:29:30,"A couple of weeks back when the streets were filled with protesters, there were two alternatives. One, if what the government claimed was true, there would be a huge surge in infections and deaths. Two, if that did not happen, then everything the government said was a lie (a viewpoint most protesters were rather inclined towards anyway). Today? It's pretty clear who won that round.  It's a valuable lesson.  Maybe more effective then the one they originally set out to teach."
2020-06-18 15:30:11,"Most New Yorkers are wearing masks and everyone is wearing them inside stores.  Perhaps there should be more social distancing outside but deaths and hospitalizations continue to fall so it seems like the social distancing and mask wearing is working.  Despite these pictures I haven't seen any radical shifts in New Yorkers' observance of mask wearing or outside social distancing so it seems like the people that aren't doing the best at social distancing are younger less vulnerable people, and those people don't really interact with the elderly, probably because the latter are taking the necessary precautions and not interacting with young professionals and socialites. 

I note that I find this focus on (and the related hand-wringing about) generally young people congregating outside in groups (which is legal if they're below 10) very hypocritical. I haven't seen a single article in this newspaper criticizing the throngs of protesters who have completely abandoned any pretense of social distancing by marching shoulder to shoulder and chanting all the while (which presumably increases  the changes that the virus will spread) risking everyone's life.  The protests must be allowed to continue but the governor was and is free to impose restrictions on how the protests are conducted and completely failed to do so. Where are the articles about how these protesters are risking the lives of the elderly and the need for reasonable controls on them?"

What's required then is social solidarity.  Wear masks and keep distance. The failure of so many to do so suggests a widespread lack of compassion or discipline, or probably both. For me, this explains why we‚Äôre doing so badly in this but in many other realms of social and political life. We just don‚Äôt have what it takes."
2020-06-18 13:36:00,"Before we declare the sky is falling - these photos are mostly of outdoor gatherings and evidence suggests transmission is lower there. Most people are still sheltering to some degree and until we see some statistics rather than anecdotes, I‚Äôll continue to believe that. 

Avoid indoor gatherings, limit travel, work from home, wear a mask when you can. That should be enough to keep hospitals below capacity, which like it or not, should be our goal."
2020-06-18 14:12:01,"Six months into the coronavirus crisis, there‚Äôs a growing consensus about a central question: How do people become infected?

It‚Äôs not common to contract Covid-19 from a contaminated surface, scientists say. And fleeting encounters with people outdoors are unlikely to spread the coronavirus.

Instead, the major culprit is close-up, person-to-person interactions for extended periods. Crowded events, poorly ventilated areas and places where people are talking loudly‚Äîor singing, in one famous case‚Äîmaximize the risk.

--the above is from the WSJ, the NYT has published articles showing transmission outside is extremely low as well."

People are hungry for normalcy and business, I feel like everyone, government included, has tacitly decided that we can't all hole up forever in order to save a few. Not sure how this is going to end though."
2020-06-18 15:41:33,I think the question is whether people are wearing masks inside stores or other confined areas. If the answer is no then New Yorkers are really no smarter than Floridians when measured on the Darwin scale.
2020-06-18 15:43:56,"Has there been a spike in cases involving people that were at protest rallies?  Of the protests that I witnessed (and participated in) most of the people were wearing masks.  I've sat in parks with my family while we have maintained a social distance from other groups.  While I admit that there have been some larger groups of people that do not seem to respect the social distancing, I do not feel it is necessary to wear a mask walking down the street or while I am sitting at the parks.  There have been large crowds at parks on virtually every nice weekend day since the lockdown began.  All the while the numbers have been improving in NY.  Although it is incredibly hard to discern the data while we have an administration that is not really interested in it, it seems the vast majority of victims are essential workers or people in larger households.  I consider it imperative for people to wear masks whenever indoors.  While I think the Trump rally in Tulsa will probably result in a large number of transmissions I am not concerned when I see a picture like the one of this crowd in Domino; it does not seem like the viral load necessary to infect someone is there.  Please also remember this is at a time where many people around the country are not even wearing masks in grocery stores, bars, restaurants and while those numbers are going up- New York's numbers seem to be stable.  Would I walk through this crowd?  Probably not.  But do I think it is a super spreader event?  Nope."
2020-06-18 15:50:08,"I wear a mask while running although, based on my observation, most don't.  There is more and more evidence that brief outside encounters are negligible spreaders of COVID.  I do wonder can NYC open outdoor spaces for restaurants.  While diners will be outdoors, they can't wear masks while eating and most people stay at a restaurant at least an hour."
2020-06-18 15:55:57,"Looks like the folks in the photos are practicing social distancing,they are outdoors, staying within their circles.  Those within each circle may have formed a bubble as far as anyone knows.  This must happen.  Lockdown cannot last forever, the health ramifications of that are increasingly negative."
2020-06-18 15:56:03,"At some point, beliefs are trumped by physical reality.  So is laziness and intellectual vacuity.

We've never had this kind of a reckoning in recent history.  We could wage war from safe distance.  People losing jobs in factories were affecting Wall Street in opposite ways.  Voting for republicans had only positive consequences for Caucasians (because they got to see others squirm and experience pain).  Tribal identities offered psychological benefits but no costs as such.  

The virus does not seem to respond to beliefs, conjectures, speeches, announcements, tribal identities, religious dogma - nothing.  Just one physical reality of a virus testing people's ability to stay away from others - trying and economically ruinous as it is.

In pockets where reason and science prevails (some emergency rooms in hospitals), strict data-based protocols are applied, and the virus is mitigated despite closeness and proximity.  In pockets where reason and science are regarded as secondary to belief (which is much of America, and almost the entire bible belt), the virus will win.  Hands down.

We could finally shed beliefs, homeopathy, and other superstitions as a nation.  But we will not. We will keep this going by voting for Trump again; the more crazier he gets the more he likely to win.  Because democrats see both sides of the story.  On the one hand Trump is awful, on the other hand, they have to get off their duffs to vote.  The later is more painful."

One request: please publish more articles about those who are immunocompromised (ie, their ages, what percentage of the population this makes up, stories of those who were infected) as well as how prolific asymptomatic carriers are, how symptomatic are contagious 2 days prior to getting ill, etc. Too many people still don‚Äôt consider this.

2020-06-18 16:08:24,"COVID-19's key motif has been generational warfare, and the recent decline in social distancing (which is really a decline in social solidarity) is best viewed through this frame. For young people, sacrificing months or even years of activity in order to protect older generations is an unfair trade. What's in it for them?

After all, the generations most at risk of getting gravely ill or dying of COVID - baby boomers, the elderly - have accrued the lion's share of the nation's wealth and have buried younger generations in debt and financial precarity. While younger people deal with medical bankruptcy, those above 65 benefit from Medicare. While the young are burdened by high housing costs, older people have reaped the benefits of asset appreciation. While young people are yoked with student and consumer debt, older people receive income from pensions and decades of accrued asset appreciation.

As such, the notion that younger people should postpone the activities of life for an indefinite period of time in service of the old as a kind of moral duty is not so compelling to them, understandably. Where was the social solidarity on the part of older folks (and policy makers) when tuition increased well above general inflation, or when housing costs skyrocketed after the great recession? It's always been 'benefits for me, austerity for thee'.

We've degraded the notion of society and community and we've done so on the backs of younger people. And here we are."
2020-06-18 16:11:23,"This isn't unique to NY, it's happening in many cities around the country. I'd like to know if anyone tracked where protesters traveled from and where they ended up afterward.  Although most people were wearing masks, it was impossible for them to practice social distancing. The data would be beneficial to further educate those of us who care about the science and rely on data to make our personal decisions. I'm also curious to know why there isn't data showing how many people are currently traveling domestically and how it correlates to rising case numbers. I personally know of people taking leisurely road trips from TX to NY, FL to NY, VA to LA, FL to CO, CA to TX, NY to CO, FL to RI, and these people will eventually be going back to their respective home states. The place of attraction for New Yorkers who don't want to be in the Hamptons is Aspen, CO. These people aren't traveling all the way to CO to isolate themselves in another state, they are going because 1)most of them favor it in the winter anyway and 2)they know they won't be bothered by restrictions that will interfere with their social agendas."

I'm continuing to bike with a mask on since it's easy to wind up closer than 6 feet to another cyclist, especially on a bike path.

They were packed so tightly together it was hard to tell from where I sat where one person stopped and the next started.  To add insult to injury they were all yelling something continually; I couldn't make it out. I'm not sure what they were doing but it seems like this group of people have decided that the time has come to sacrifice the old and the weak.

These thoughtless irresponsible youth,  act and perhaps believe, that the virus will pass them by, or at least if it does infect them, they will get over it.
After all, it's only the old and the working poor who get sick and perhaps die. And as for the doctors, nurses, and hospital staff, well they can handle it.

Imagine how frustrating it was for those of us who have not left the house for three months to watch as tens of thousands of protesters jammed the streets and plazas, screaming out slogans and occasionally burning down a business or two just for special effect. They say it was justified because of the disproportionate killing of black men by police officers. But how many more people of all colors were likely to die because of their recklessness? I guess they feel it‚Äôs worth risking more deaths to make their point. I, for one, do not."

2020-06-18 16:55:48,"The stats in a few weeks will tell the story.  It seems to me overwhelmingly that it's young people who cannot control their urges to go out and socialize in close proximity with many other young people in ""public""  places, without wearing masks.  Maybe they should heed the warnings of the young girls who were infected with their entire group of friends and employees of a Jacksonville bar, which has now closed.

One question the virologist Dr. Rasmussen said at the end of the article ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still not really getting together with people,‚Äù - so that‚Äôs a direct quote?

Are we that impatient and undisciplined as a society that we cannot continue to cautiously re-open? The same virus that devastated us in March/April is still out there. Nothing has changed. There is no second wave, we are still in the first wave. We do not possess the will to do what it takes to defeat the virus. Look how China just reacted to the new outbreak at the fish market in Beijing; strongly and decisively. Think if your fellow Americans will do the same?

The same simple preventive measures must be kept strictly in place. Come the inevitable Phase 2 in late summer or fall, the newly ""liberated"" New Yorkers better have a backup stockpile of masks and get used to social distancing or even stay-at- home measures once again."

2020-06-18 17:10:21,"I disagree with the idea that New Yorkers are acting like coronavirus is over. People aren‚Äôt using public transport and most do wear masks when walking down the sidewalk or going to the store. The park is the only space left for both socializing and working out, so of course it is crowded. Yes, people take off their masks when talking to friends outdoors, but for many, this is the ONLY time they take off their masks in public. 
This article implies that New Yorkers have abandoned mask wearing in general, which is simply not true. The park is the exception, not the rule"
2020-06-18 17:23:45,"Take a look at the age group that is primarily flaunting distancing, and generally has been.   My daughter and I visited Robert Moses state park last week for some sun.  We were purposely a small family group, masks on hand, sat away from others.  Others were doing the same respectfully.

About noon, we started seeing these roving packs of teens and young 20's.  Arms around each other, hugging, jumping, sharing drinks in their party cups, roaming the beach.  Not just one rogue group, but multiple groups going back and forth.  Not a single mask or fleet of caution in the mix.  This is not one family out for some air, it is a member of 10-15 families, mixing all their potential germs.  If one had a virus, at least half now have it. 

I see this all over, always with younger groups of friends.  Who somehow can't imagine life outside this pack of friends.  And where are the parents who certainly know where their kids are?"
2020-06-18 17:24:36,"In my extended circle the thought process is basically ""since it was ok to go out and protest, and the protests were celebrated by media and political leadership, I'm going to the park with my friends and family.""  Hard to argue with that logic."

As of this morning, stricter rules are being implemented at all the casinos - now you must wear a mask while playing table games and/or standing within 6 feet of the game. Prior to this, the policy was mask-optional, and hit or miss depending on which place you were in. So the new rules are not the direction they want to be going in, I am sure. 

The Mayfair Supper Club at Bellagio closed overnight due to an infected employee. 

It's the same everywhere. Young people don't think the risk is worth the inconvenience. How do they not understand they're just prolonging the misery and delaying the economic recovery? 

Businesses may get some of their customers back, but they're not going to get all of their customers back until they decide to bite the bullet and get real."

We badly need an in-between solution with which people can actually live and will abide. Japan, which has had only 1000 deaths despite eschewing lockdowns, may provide the solution. Universal mask use, hand washing, and other basic measures could potentially be enough to reduce the reproduction ratio below 1, allowing the epidemic to end."

Just as Barack Obama had to clean up the financial mess George W. Bush left him, Biden will have to deal with the grossly mismanaged pandemic Trump will leave him.

Biden will set a good example by wearing a mask in public. He will ask people to make this (small) sacrifice to help protect themselves and others. He will explain to the whole country how important it is to practice social distancing. He will tell us we can beat this thing, we can get it under control, by following a few simple rules. He will lead by example. And he will let the experts speak for themselves.

2020-06-18 18:08:19,"How bout some numbers? Here are mine. Last week, I took a few 2 hr walks up and down Broadway in the Bronx, it felt like most people were not wearing masks, but I wasn't sure how many. Last night around 7 pm I took a 2 1/2 hr walk down Broadway (again, in the Bronx) and counted.

Of the first 100 people I passed, 71 were not wearing masks. Of the next 100, 59 were not wearing masks, but I'd passed a few stores with people waiting to get in and maybe trying to look cooperative. Finally, the last 100 people, which included a swing up into Riverdale so I could do the incredibly long set of stairs going up up up into it, 76 out of 100 were not wearing masks. Then I got tired of counting. So maybe two-thirds not wearing masks.

And from reading the NYT readers comments, I can see the excuses people were probably making for not wearing them."

My studio which is in Dumbo, is very quiet and the great majority of people wear face coverings. The iconic art bar 68 Jay St. Bar is struggling to survive as their business is down 80%. The Caribbean community and hipsters in Crown Heights are amazingly complicit. I think Williamsburg and Bushwick does not speak for the rest of Brooklyn."
2020-06-18 18:15:13,"I live in Williamsburg, a few blocks from both Domino park and Berry st. Despite articles like this, most everyone I see is still wearing masks, even outside, more so than I saw even back in April when the pandemic was approaching its all time highs. Back then white people were flagrantly walking around with no masks on while NYPD was only handing out citations in black and brown neighborhoods. 

I‚Äôm more concerned about people wearing their masks indoors and when there are large gatherings (read: protests). Personally, I tested positive for sars-cov-2 antibodies after being exposed to it, so I‚Äôm mainly wearing a mask at this point for optics and to make other people feel better. Is there really a risk to others or myself if I take my mask off at the waterfront for 20 minutes, particularly since I already had it?

Personally it seems like most New Yorkers are still taking this seriously."
2020-06-18 18:15:36,"I don't really understand why they always trot out and interview a virologist in these articles. The appropriate subject matter is risk analysis and cost-benefit analysis. Virologists try to tell us some of the inputs into this calculation but their discipline is not focused on determining what level of risk is ok for each person. So the virologist is uncomfortable with that level of risk and is gonna stick to her family. Maybe she is a natural introvert, is over 50, or has other risk factors, or someone in her family does. The article provides no specificity, leaving a judgy feeling at the end. The ""you could be a vector"" argument only applies if you yourself are going around interacting with random strangers. If you aren't, what these people do really doesn't affect you, unless the overall goal, which no one has ever suggested, is total eradication of this virus from the US. I believe that ship sailed by mid-March. Given that, the next best goal is to keep hospital capacity high until cure(s) or a vaccine. Nothing these people are doing looks inconsistent with that goal and this is why we are going to phase 2 in the city. Finally, another way to look at it, which is much more charitable but largely seems missing, is that all these 20 and 30 somethings who are low-risk are going to be the first line of herd resistance which will slow spread down later to give us more time for a vaccine."

It was packed with people many without masks and definitely not social distancing. Outside in front at small two person cafe tables sat two to four people crowded around drinking and eating again few with masks, many of them senior citizens. We all miss the freedom to go places, do things, to see and be seen but personally being in a high risk group I will not set foot in a restaurant, coffee house or an airplane until there is an effective vaccine, period. It is an easy decision to sacrifice some personal freedom rather than your life or that of someone else."

All I see everywhere is careless disregard for some very simple rules. Not only are people going maskless, they will not even step aside for you. If you want to stay safe, you are going to have to do all the work. 
What really upset me, is not only the people who may become infected, but all those who have already risked their lives battling this disease. Do we really want a return of the very recent days when hospitals were overwhelmed? What the chances of these health care workers surviving a second barrage of coronavirus to their systems? They are, even now, lucky to be alive. Please do not sacrifice their lives for a snack or a haircut."

If we had a coordinated, centralized federal response -- if we had an administration that would use taxpayer dollars to help actual taxpayers instead of billionaires and corporations -- then we might see better outcomes. If we had a coordinated national campaign to educate and inform people about the virus and how to wear a mask properly, we might see better outcomes.... I just read a quote from a young woman in Florida who contracted Covid-19 after going to a bar with friends because ""they were telling us it was okay to go back out.""

The Covid-19 data stream is in and shows that most people, but especially young people are very unlikely to be seriously ill.  The HC system is not overwhelmed and more targeted approaches need to be considered by the very few people who suddenly have immense power in their grasp.

Societies are not built to be isolation containers."
2020-06-18 18:39:48,"It‚Äôs heartbreaking to see a tragedy unfold in real time. So many of these people will be dead by the end of the year.

What is so disheartening is that even within the subset of people who ostensibly believe in science there is so much disagreement. There is no evidence that being exposed to the virus and developing antibodies to it confers immunity and yet there are many people of seeming gravitas in positions of power and influence who are willing to let millions more die because they cling to their belief of herd immunity with religious fervor. Meanwhile there have been documented cases of people and communities getting re-infected and many indications that this virus doesn‚Äôt behave like other viruses and that we‚Äôve barely scratched the surface of our understanding of it.

It‚Äôs time to face reality. Large social gatherings are extinct, a relic of civilization‚Äôs past. No more restaurants, sports or performing arts. If your job entails anything that isn‚Äôt directly serving the survival of your fellow humans you will lose it by the end of next year. If you‚Äôre single you will stay that way for the rest of your life. 

But that‚Äôs no reason to hasten our extinction. Please, everyone, keep social distancing and wearing your masks. Even if you don‚Äôt think life is worth living without our old social constructs don‚Äôt endanger other people who are just trying to appreciate what they have left of the gift of life."
2020-06-18 18:42:33,"We got great instructions about how to shut ourselves down. Starting up is harder. The state has guidelines for businesses, but for people it is harder.

We don‚Äôt have real solid info that helps us assess risk. Can I see a friend if I wear a mask? If we have both been quarantined for weeks? If some of us come from areas more open?

Are we able to expand our bubble? 

And what is the relative weight of riskiness if meeting for a walk or a comic. Meeting indoors distanced or masked?

It‚Äôs been over two weeks since protests started and we haven‚Äôt seen a spike in cases. So why should NYers continue to cower in fear? We‚Äôre beginning to reopen responsibly, so let people enjoy activities that pose little risk (gathering outside in small groups, kids playing on playgrounds) I just don‚Äôt understand why the NY Times and some in the comments continue to act like we‚Äôre still at 800 deaths a day, like in April, when that is no longer the situation."

An articles NYT published a few days ago about the peer review process got really thinking about why so much scientific information is at times conflicting; scientists are also working overtime to fight this thing.  In any case, I feel like this thing could go quiet for a bit, then come back.  I'm hoping that's not the case though.  I'd rather be wrong about all of this, and even the authors of the most pessimistic and gloomy scientific predictions on the final outcome of Covid-19 I'm sure would rather be wrong about it all."

He told and showed me all his life we were only as strong as our community. He was highly informed about and tried to help ALL members of his community. KNOW WHY? As a young boy he saw WAGONS FULL OF NEIGHBORS' DEAD BODIES go by in rural Tennessee. I am social distancing.

Managed quarantine has major gaps in it; and some of the gaps such as a homeless man sneaking into the hotel and staying there for two weeks unnoticed is quite funny. There's also two woman who were given compassionate leave to visit a dying parent who were not tested for the virus before they drove to Wellington. If NZ doesn't get anymore cases it will be luck and the fact that we're a thin, narrow, windswept nation surrounded by sea. I would be interesting if all 5 million of us kiwis were tested for the virus and to see the results. We also don't have lots of high rise buildings and like to live in houses with sections. We'll know in two weeks if there are other clusters around as we went from one case of covid-19 to one thousand in approx two weeks. Honestly, the flaws in our quarantine system are being exposed and I'm of the opinion everyone coming into the country should be put in compulsory quarantine in an isolated place where there is no incentive to leave or escape as it's a ;wilderness area with no transport or people, or shops, or activities."

Not to mention the fact that many New Yorks don't have the option to social distance even if they wanted to.  There is a certain callousness on the part of older educated NYTimes readers, the type  who have time to comment here (I guess I would be among them) that because they can social distance everyone can and the benefits to them (doing the easy thing) outweigh the hardships to everyone else.

2020-06-18 19:34:32,"Yesterday I ventured out after nearly a month of self-quarantine to go shopping (wearing a mask) for badly needed stuff (not prescriptions) from a drugstore, which happens to have self-checkout counters. 

Everything went beautifully until I got to the self-checkout counters which are lined up in effect less than 3 feet apart.

It made me so nervous (as an older person) that when someone else used the checkout next to mine, I wanted to finish my transaction soon, and as a result left $20 of ""cash back"" in the machine!

And no, I did not go back to claim what cash I left there since it was my fault. But for sure I will let the drugstore know that their self-checkout stations should be at least 6 feet apart.

This is a new world we are living in, folks! And it ain't going to end anytime soon. These viruses have been here for over 200 million years (scientific estimate), and we humans just got here."
2020-06-18 14:21:26,I am repeatedly shocked at the lack of discussion of individual rights both in this article and in the comments.  The commenters seem to be under the impression it is moral to force people to stay locked up because they (the commenters) themselves are afraid indefinitely.  It‚Äôs one thing to ask people to stay at home for a couple of weeks for the good of society.  It‚Äôs entirely another to require or expect them to do so for months on end with no end in sight.  Socializing with other people is a basic human right. Doing what we like with our free time also is.

2020-06-18 19:58:57,"You can open up. But it only works when you know the virus is under control and being suppressed. Otherwise it just starts another wave of infections and hospitalisations.
Being under control means that you need to still be doing loads of testing and tracing for outbreaks...and then quarantining those infected.
Look at what Beijing is doing. This is the unpleasant social reality of controlling the pandemic in large cities and urban environments until a vaccine arrives. 
I understand the frustrations but with any other approach you just have to accept that you are gambling with your life and the lives of those around you. It appears most American states think gambling is more productive than control. And I acknowledge that in some places there may be no choice but to gamble in order to survive, given the huge inequality in healthcare and incomes.

But if you do get it under control and suppressed, you get to this level of safety where both business and social activities can resume safely. It takes a well resourced hypervigilant approach to public healthcare to achieve this."
2020-06-18 16:54:44,"Unfortunately, I missed much of what I'm about to comment on,  on the morning news. But, what I did see, was what looks like the makings of the politicizing of wearing masks. Two sides of protesters; one in favor of the need to wear them, versus opposition, on the grounds it violates their civil liberties.
The apex of absurdity from the opposition, was a throwback to the Women's Lib Movement of the '70s; only instead of burning bras, this time some knucklehead burned a mask (to the cheers and delight of the protesters) in a cast iron frypan.
All I could think of afterwards was Trump's rally in Tulsa.
Anyone who thinks that  despite the pandemic, personal liberties take priority over common sense, are really ""that special kind of stupid."" And, unlike the Hasidic Jews in New York, who made the news recently, for refusing to wear masks at a funeral, on religious grounds, these protesters can't use the excuse that G-d will watch over them."
2020-06-18 19:29:18,"The most piercing perspective is given by Mr. Sugarman of The White Horse Tavern.  From the article, ""Mr. Sugarman said he had bigger worries: ‚ÄúSurvival,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think the industry is facing destruction.‚Äù ""

Bigger worries than Covid?  Reality check, yup.  20 million people are now unemployed and how many service businesses and accompanying livelihoods are on the line?  I read comments here from folks who live on the upper west side of society who can't for the life of them imagine why people are clamoring to open their businesses.  The entitlement espoused by so many pampered, self-righteous elites is as appalling as those who call this pandemic a hoax.

If you're in a high risk category and have underlying conditions, self-regulate.  Let the overwhelming majority of people go back to living their lives and let the kids go back to school and camp.

Enough is enough."
2020-06-18 18:38:27,"‚Ä¢ Most, if not all New Yorkers laughed when Trump said this insanity:  ‚ÄúWhen the warm weather comes, this virus will magically disappear, like a miracle.

‚Ä¢ Now that the warm weather is here, most, if not all New Yorkers, are out and about, suddenly believing that the virus has magically disappeared, like a miracle.

Beijing has a new outbreak. Even New Zealand.

As for New York, give or take 14 days and we‚Äôre back to the good old days when 800 COVID-19 deaths per day is the median.

2020-06-18 17:59:14,"I live in Chelsea and watched 2 protest marches last week on my street. What I witnessed personally was a march made of young people, half of them wearing masks, but half not wearing masks as they were chanting, thus spilling droplets of Covid out everywhere. About 85% white, which was a welcome surprise, but NOT ONE protester was social distancing. I'm all for peaceful protest, especially for these very important Black Lives Matter marches. EXCEPT, none of the marchers seemed to care if they were passing the virus around or catching the virus. And I watched thinking how many marchers during this ongoing PANDEMIC, will go back to their families and possibly pass on the virus to their grandparents, or aunts and uncles who are more susceptible!!! I've heard many protesters on air say, ""It's more important that we keep marching than not"". I'm pretty sure that MOST of New Yorkers would agree with me and demand that the protesters make sure they are social distancing and that NO ONE should be allowed to march without a mask. There seems to be no one in charge of the marches to make these precautions happen,from what I witnessed during 2 protest marches on the street where I live on. Protesters....care for older family members and friends. This also goes for all the selfish idiots that are breaking the rules of Phase One already, bars, etc. Phase 2 is opening this Monday....get over yourselves and wait until then."

2020-06-18 18:25:25,"It seems as if the best way to become infected is to mix oneself in a larger group without benefit of mask, by talking, singing, or exchanging handshakes, etc., something we haven't done for months on end. Sure, we miss it. But we need to exercise caution,  to ease into this newer phase and exercise patience which is not easily done in New York as we can see by people trying to break into playgrounds because their kids are getting on their nerves.  Aw shucks!  Whose kids haven't?  

They would do best to remember that their kids would be best served by social distancing at this point rather than missing them all together in the near future. A stark reminder?  Yes, but a reality.  We still need to wear masks in public places and when dealing with people we do not know.  A fact.
 
Patience is indeed a virtue, an attribute that we New Yorkers need to be proud of to get to the point that we have achieved. Albeit, hard as hell in some cases, and it need not destroy all the effort that we put into, because we are in a hurry now.  

Look at some of our neighboring states that went back too soon, they will regret that decision to get back into the past life now because they couldn't wait it out.  I hope that won't be our decision."
2020-06-18 20:09:22,"How long are people expected to keep up with the masks, distancing, etc?  Week, month, years or decades.  If people knew when the end of these things was, there might be more of a willingness to do these things.  Indefinitely is not an answer.  Give folks some hope that the end is in sight."
2020-06-18 20:19:51,"the pandemic isnt over but people are certainly over the pandemic. the powers that be have proven themselves completely inept. there is no plan. there is no vaccine. no cure. nothing. and there never will be. so, people are getting on with their lives. especially the young ones who realize they'll most likely not die from this virus. the govt as usual is a step behind and if they want to save lives they better stop thinking that people are going to keep blindly obeying the stay at home orders and start thinking of a way to safely reopen the country. cos its happening whether they like it or not."
2020-06-18 20:30:19,It's going to get worse before it gets better; especially the economy and jobs; I read yesterday that China has discovered a mutant strain of the virus - I'm not surprised as the more positive cases  of the virus around the bigger the chance of it mutating. Smart virus that seems to be one step ahead of humans.
2020-06-18 20:38:35,"Although perhaps anecdotal, the photos of violators of the rules of social distancing and mask-wearing in this article and similar articles seem to be populated almost entirely by people under 40 years of age.  The death-rate statistics of the virus dictate the behavior, it seems, as the vast majority of deaths from Covid 19 infection occur in people older than 40.  However, the vast majority of parents, schoolteachers, clergy, and workers are over 40 years of age.  It will be pretty difficult to open our economy if everybody over 40 has to fear catching the virus from those less vulnerable who choose to ignore the Covid 19 guidelines.  By that method of thinking, folks under 40 shouldn't be allowed to drive, since by the statistics, they are involved in nearly 60% of all fatal car crashes in the US."
2020-06-18 20:41:02,"Throughout this public health crisis I've followed the best advice available even as I've understood that it can change as more and more is learned about this virus.

In the end, the only logical reaction one can take is to take the appropriate actions regard social distancing, mask wearing and cleanliness routines for oneself.

While I wish most people would do the same, I am not at all shocked to see the foolish behaviorisms to the contrary of safety that are presented here.

In the end, as I can only take care of myself, I will do so prudently.  I will not tell someone who is acting foolishly to do otherwise.  I will simply avoid being anywhere near that person.

As a retiree I'm in the vulnerable category.  But it also means I do not have to be around people to got to a job.  And my bar hopping days are long since past.

I ask only one thing of these reckless people you display.  Just stay away from me.  Do as you please,  But just stay away from me!"
2020-06-18 20:42:26,"Go on the subway these days and you‚Äôll see maybe five people spread out as far from each other as possible, all wearing masks, not speaking a word. Just because a few people are socializing outside does not mean that things have returned to normal."
2020-06-18 20:54:47,"I think my brilliant friend, the writer Joe Keenan, said it best:

JUST PUT ON A MASK PLEASE

Death advances. Normal stops 
Fearful glances. Shuttered shops.
Doctors tell us: Masks for all.
Folks are zealous. Numbers fall.

Circumstances turn the page.
Grief. Finances. Boredom. Rage.
Caution dwindles. Masks are shed.
June rekindles March's dread. 

Youngsters tarry over drinks, 
As each wary elder thinks:
Death advances. Nothing's fine.
Take your chances. Don't take mine."

2020-06-18 21:10:34,"These elite journalists need to stop admonishing the rest of us. Four months inside without any socializing or backyard/outdoor spaces is enough. I venture to Domino regularly and find everyone at a safe distance from strangers, nobody feels uncomfortable and we all wear masks when not in conversation / eating. Those that don‚Äôt feel comfortable won‚Äôt be there, but it‚Äôs a slight sigh of relief to see energy in public spaces again - and for those that live here we all have our masks on. You keep photographing this park because it‚Äôs pretty, but it‚Äôs not unsafe or scary."
2020-06-18 21:10:37,"So many comments from people wringing their hands, anxious at the lack of total compliance with the government's policies. It begs the question: shouldn't the government's infectious disease policies reflect how people ACTUALLY behave, instead of how we'd like them to behave?"
2020-06-18 21:15:10,"I my local park where I exercise, last month I think we were seeing around 95% compliance with masks. Now it seems to be around 20%.

Here's why we're seeing so many people not wearing masks, in my opinion.

1-False sense of security that you've survived the pandemic so far, so you must be good.
2-General misconception that respiratory illness is limited to wintertime and cold weather.
3-Unfortunately, the American understanding of liberty historically involves the freedom to impose on others.
4-Failure to stay informed, and consume news.
5-Phenomenon of going stir crazy in quarantine lock down, and throwing caution to the wind.
6-The very American desire to live on the edge and take chances.
7-The American character has been continually weakened by pampering from consumerism and other frivolities to the point where we are reluctant to commit to even minor hardships for the good of our communities.
8-Above all, the utter incompetence, misinformation, and mixed messages emanating from White House. Zero pandemic strategy."
2020-06-18 21:24:16,"Absent a vaccine, which may take a few months or possibly never, life needs to progress.  The economy must stay open, society function, and the education systems operate.  For people  who are at high-risk, there is only one sure way not to be infected and that is to self-protect by staying home.  Unfortunately, the risk of getting infected at home if some is ill is 40%.  That's life.  People need to do their best to help by wearing masks when practical and try to social distance when practical.  Kids, teens, and young adults will do what they want - if someone is at-risk, they should probably stay well clear of them.  I love the expressions ""the virus determines the timetable"" and ""follow the science"".  People at low-risk have followed the science and realize they don't have much to worry about and they recognize the virus only determines the timetable for those facing a risk from it."
2020-06-18 21:32:54,"It all boils down to whether Americans are willing to sacrifice individual liberty for the greater good.  I don't think so, for several reasons.  The individuality of the Americans is something we are proud of, something engraved in the minds and hearts of those born here, and something that many came to this country for from places less fortunate.  The flip side of individuality is of course, selfishness, which often translates into blatant disregard and lack of concern for others.  It does not help that the country is extremely divided now. In my thirty years of living here, I have never seen such great of a divide-politically, economically and socially.  I would like to believe that we can win this war against COVID, but so far, it feels that the lull is just a temporary reprieve and it will take more time for the science and medicine to come up with a cure/vaccine, and even more time for us as individuals, to truly unite."
2020-06-18 21:38:08,"The COVID pandemic certainly isn‚Äôt over, nor should we expect to have a vaccine in the near future.

But the article does not mention the elderly in nursing homes, who have accounted for half of all deaths.

All staff in nursing homes need to be checked for COVID every week.  Low-paid nursing aides typically work part-time in multiple facilities, and are the primary vector for transmission.

Relatives of residents should be encouraged to visit, using masks.

Finally, low Vitamin D is strongly correlated with COVID complications.  Most nursing home residents do not get any sun, so they should take Vitamin D supplements, 1000-2000 IU daily.  Until we get a vaccine, it might help."
2020-06-18 21:56:58,I have an appointment next week to get my hair cut (after 4 months).  The salon I go to is limiting the number of clients and stylists they will allow on a daily basis. My friend who works at the salon said I had to stand outside the salon and she would allow me to enter.  I have to wear a mask.  I told her I would wash my hair and all she would have to do is spritz it a little to get it wetter.  I'm just happy I can finally get my hair cut.

Of course you should go ouf your house but wear a mask. If you don't like a  mask, perhaps you would prefer a ventilator. 

While we don't know enough about this virus, we know enough about the Spanish Flu pandemic 0f 1918. We can learn  from it or we can act like Trump and Pence and pretend there is no problem.

2020-06-18 20:30:40,"i have to agree with Gov. Abbott of Texas,  young people, arrogant young people, are now spreading this virus around. The picture of those kids in Williamsburg says it all.  It's not only these rich white outsider kids in NYC but also middle  and lower class young people, educated or uneducated. Here in Oregon down in Newport on the coast in  several fish processing plants a huge outbreak occurred  just recently. the culprits: young Guatemalans,  uneducated, , probably superstitious, and don't know either English or Spanish but speak an indigenous language called , ""Mam"".  The owners of the plants obviously didn't communicate to them the importance of wearing a mask, distancing, washing hands, hanging out in groups, etc, probably didn't even have translators to pass this info on to them, nor did the State of Oregon or local county health officials. The tragedy is, our true nature as humans has been shown and reflected back to us and most of us don't really care.  The selfishness, arrogance, greed and competitiveness are our dominant traits, not love compassion or intelligence or use of common sense.  It just may take hundreds of millions of us to die from this virus to maybe and i mean maybe finally get a hold of our ugliness in character  and then proceed on with evolving as a species."

As a mask wearing social distancing kinda guy I don't agree with what's I'm witnessing at local restaurants, parks, and beaches. Still, it seems obvious there's no way to keep so much built up frustration from expressing itself. Especially once the nice weather arrived. Thanks to so many volunteers, at least we'll soon have a much better handle about our situation by the end of the month. With the quarantine in place it was too easy for naysayers to dismiss the probability lives were being saved. It won't be long until we'll have enough evidence to make more intelligent short and long term decisions."
2020-06-18 20:48:20,"US population is about 4.25% world population. However, death due to COVID-19 is about 26.5% of total death world over.

They can spin the issue multiple ways, but people are still dying due to the virus infection."
2020-06-18 21:00:02,"For people wandering why their "" individual rights"" are curtailed, please understand that the US is probably the only country who's citizens are so individualistic and egotistical that the concept of "" public health"" has no meaning. Let me put it to you in a way ghat you ( might?) understand: when you breath in somebody's face you are taking that person's freedom to not be at risk of catching the virus. They are doing all they can to protect themselves and others and you are just taking away their freedom to choose health. It's really simple, unless you're a certain type of American.... The type that crosses the border into Canada under false pretenses ( oh, we're just passing by on our way to Alaska) and then has a vacation in Canada: no mask, no social distance, no respect for our rights to contain the virus if we so choose, and we do! 
Funny how all the people concerned with the curtailing of their individual freedoms have no second thoughts at thrashing other's."

How interesting that right before the pandemic one of the main looming financial crises was the fear that all of those ‚Äúundying‚Äù baby-boomers were going to bankrupt the country.

And while 100k deaths is tragic, we lose 3mm Americans a year. 500k from hypertension alone. The average mortality age worldwide is 80. Half the deaths are in nursing homes where the average life expectancy is 12 months. Mortality rates are decreasing by the day due to improved treatment (some say 40 percent reduction since March).  People are going outside and seeing friends or having dinner outside in restaurants because they see all of this information and understand that both the threat of overrun hospitals and the threat of death is a tenth of what we initially believed. And there is a good reason why our politicians have also opened up the economy everywhere. It is because the cost benefit analysis based on what we now know clearly augers in favor or opening up. There is so much profound judgment of those who ‚Äúgo to restaurants.‚Äù  Guess what. They are open for a reason. You won‚Äôt find me arguing to ignore current mayoral and governor guidelines. But there is a reason those guidelines have evolved. And the psyche of those traumatized from March needs to evolve with them."

Both their body language and verbal response was clear: go away. This was an extremely frustrating and demoralizing 20 minute conversation with two inhuman rocks. Why should we wear masks when our public servants don‚Äôt?

By this, I mean putting your fellow humans and society in general ahead of yourself?

What's wrong with that?"
2020-06-19 00:16:55,"""The Pandemic Isn‚Äôt Over. New Yorkers Are Acting as if It Were.""

The author could have written this as soon as the protests began.

Why didn't  he ?!"
2020-06-19 01:26:03,"Imagine being confined to a very small space, dependent upon someone for food, shelter, safety, your life and that of others, living in fear of being discovered.  Imagine that you cannot go outside, visit friends, go to school, the food market, your house of worship.

Imagine that this goes on and on.. For two years.

This is what Anne Frank endured.  We are complaining after 3 months?  

We are not as strong or unselfless as we like to think we are."
2020-06-19 02:12:43,"Of COURSE, people, once out and about, are not as diligent as they should (or advised they should) be.  While a lockdown may have been necessary at the onset of this pandemic - the strict measures, fear-mongering, and red-alert status for three months had the affect of making people feel like they just broke out of jail - which has the effect (on most people) of making them let go.  

Maybe, most people are not just careless but have weighed the risks of socializing (again) and are willing to take a calculated risk by following protocols, as best they can, so they can maintain the proper mental health the mayor and governor are always talking about.

To those pointing the finger at lack of leadership (i.e., President Trump) for the seemingly dangerous gatherings - yes, federal leadership could have been better, but NYS, supposedly had the best leadership in the country and these gatherings are happening here.  People, ALL people, have been provided with information and have to use that information to take care of their individual health.  Businesses need to take responsibility to enforce the rules that our elected leaders put in place to protect the citizenry, as a whole.  I see people, without masks, being waited on in the post office, stores, parks, despite warnings all over the place.  Shame on the people not wearing masks and shame on the businesses that let them get away with non-compliance."
2020-06-19 02:16:50,"I'm recovering from a broken ankle and today was my first trip outdoors in months, except for visits to the doctor.

Yep, I agree with the statement attributed to Heather Sumner, who repeated a phrase commonly heard these days, the password for entry to these speakeasies in plain sight: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stay inside forever.‚Äù

But, folks going outdoors, gathering in groups and not wearing a face mask are simply selfish individuals without any moral responsibility, civil or community concern for their neighbors - especially SENIORS."
2020-06-19 10:23:21,"I've been having this weird split experience for a while now. The scientist in me (my 1st career was nursing) believes that the danger is real and that the way forward is masks, distancing, self-quarantine as necessary etc., for the foreseeable future. 

Yet, for weeks now I have seen pictures of folks simply deciding to act as if the virus is a non-issue now that they are tired of it all. In some ways, they seem to be right. Remember Memorial Day in the Lake of the Ozarks? I haven't seen evidence of any great spread of cases from that crowd gathering (only a report of one infected person who was there). Even here in Illinois (we are in phrase 3) where masks are ""mandatory"" folks seem to be going without them more and more. I wonder - which of my reactions is right? Do I really need that hot mask?"
2020-06-19 10:46:53,"As much as people are yearning for social contact - an who isn't these days anywhere in the world?  However, we must be careful - especially in hot spots like NYC.  Like it or not, this is the reality.  Right now, I will wait to visit Spain and Italy, two of my favourite places in Europe.  And, I'm sure many of their citizens are happy I am planning to stay home!  Take baby steps and be sensible.  No one wants to be back at square one after coming so far.  Hey NY, I want to visit my home town in 2021 - don't let that be a fantasy for me - help me make it a reality for me and for so many of us living abroad missing friends and family in where will always be home to us."

The issue seems to be that way too many think that the openings mean everything is OK.  

Thehe openings are for economic reasons,  NOT because the pandemic is over, it's just getting started."
2020-06-19 12:25:35,"Perhaps if I was in the 30s or 40s I would perceive things differently. In those days I thought I was invulnerable.  I was rarely sick, and those episodes lasted a day or two.  I never needed to tap my medical benefits which were quite good.  But now I am in my mid 70s and have had some problems including pneumonia and A-Fib.  Thus, my outlook is totally different and I am very careful and will remain so."
2020-06-19 12:30:23,"I'm not sure when we started reporting news based on social media observations but this just isn't an accurate portrayal of New York City. I live in a highly-populated neighborhood in Brooklyn and the majority of what I see is people wearing masks and social distancing. Occasionally I'll see people pass each other too closely or a small gathering outside a coffee shop, but the vast majority of New Yorkers are following the rules. If they weren't, we would be seeing the numbers go up. There are always going to be a few areas that are not being careful (I recently left the city and there's people not being careful there too), but to write an article saying New Yorkers are acting as though the pandemic is over is just inaccurate, offensive and sensational for the sake of it. Let's be a little more responsible with our news, please."

There are way more people than limited green spaces can safely accomodate and yes, I agree that folks cannot stay inside forever. I also realize that as temperatures soar, wearing a mask will become more uncomfortable and I think we will see even less compliance. There really are no good options for city folk."
2020-06-19 14:07:17,"Once you release restrictions on people, never expect to be able to re-impose them. Cuomo should have known better. His descriptions of using the infection data to know when to re-tighten ‚Äúthe restrictions valves,‚Äù or when to ‚Äúthrow a circuit breaker‚Äù that would stop the re-opening process, were shockingly na√Øve for an experienced and skilled politician like him.

2020-06-19 14:44:04,"It‚Äôs not surprising that Americans are resuming normal daily life even though the coronavirus is still alive and hungry. The primary attention of the press switched from the pandemic to the nationwide protest against pervasive racism in law enforcement with often deadly consequences. The protests were justified.  Timing is everything,

From the start, Trump had a cavalier attitude toward the serious threat posed by the virus and confused the public in many ways:  an inability to lead; lies, disinformation, holding news conferences surrounded by leading medical experts and then contradicting or playing down their advice immediately after they‚Äôve spoke; gagging government‚Äôs top medical experts from speaking;  suppressing their original written guidelines (learned from past contagions and the latest scientific research) on how to reopen the economy safely because it would greatly restrain the rush to re-open businesses and; refusing to set an example for the public by showing through their own actions that they too were following the simple safety precautions.  

As with nearly all Republicans, profits come first, second and last."
2020-06-19 16:27:34,"Many of the other countries who followed their guidelines, have succeeded and are COVID free, operating within their imposed restraints.  Why couldn't we have observed and followed their example?

It's only  a matter of time until NYC, unrelentingly explodes again, and it'll make the last few months seems like child's play.  

And it'll make its way onto LI and upstate, like a bad dream.

2020-06-19 14:33:54,This is happening all over the United States including Seminole and Orange County Florida. This wearing of a mask is a simple request. Your rights are not being violated. Common sense should tell you that. But I guess common sense is not common anymore but your rights to infect others and spread the virus is more important. We live in a society not in a cage.
2020-06-19 16:47:39,"Americans did a great job upending their lives, in response to government decree, to flatten the curve.  Collective action we thought was impossible.  Really, we should all be encouraged by the citizenry‚Äôs confidence in government pronouncements, and the government‚Äôs efforts to soften the blow to the economy and those affected by it.  Problem is, there was no plan on what do do next.  We flattened the curve, at great cost, and now we‚Äôre kinda, sorta opening up.  COVID is spiking where people are acting like it‚Äôs over.  But it‚Äôs not and won‚Äôt be for a long, long time.  And there‚Äôs the problem:  we have no plan for the next step.  We can‚Äôt stay in lockdown or partial reopening indefinitely, and millions of Americans have lost their jobs and see no end in sight.  So now, government credibility, which held on impressively, is fractured, our nutjob president is exploiting the situation, the country is no longer unified and our moment of shared mission is lost.  That is a colossal failure of leadership, of course, but also of planning, and it‚Äôs not just Trump alone who should be blamed for that."

Being African American doesn't raise your chances of being infected with the coronavirus any more than being white, Asian or Latino does.

We are a spoiled nation filled with too many impatient adults acting like spoiled children who want what they want ""now"", with no patience or discipline. We are reaching the 200,00 mark of deaths; the pandemic is still alive, well and highly contagious. This does not seem to matter to too many Americans. It's time to grow up. It's really not that difficult!"
2020-06-18 20:29:37,"As much as this story horrified me, I find myself more angry at this country‚Äôs leadership than the foolish New Yorkers. We lack national leadership entirely. That vacuum of leadership meant we didn‚Äôt have the political will to lock down long enough and hard enough to crush this. You don‚Äôt see Koreans or Taiwanese starved for social connection, because they acted fast and they acted decisively. The political decisions of ideologically nutty governors and our ‚Äúinject bleach!‚Äù president ensured that the virus would bleed out of new, cavalier places and wouldn‚Äôt die out even in places like New York. As an introvert and someone with health conditions (and living with others who are even less healthy than me), yes I have still been extremely cautious about everything. But I can understand why extroverts and young people, deprived of college experiences and graduations, might be fed up and need human connection to stay sane.

Unfortunately, the virus is still very much with us whether we like it or not - cases are starting to trend up again and are only gaining steam, and it is SUMMER, where we can take more precautions more comfortably because the weather is nice. Regardless of how inhumane it is to coop social butterflies up for months, the virus doesn‚Äôt care - it will gleefully take advantage of complacency. This just makes me all the angrier about our lack of leadership since spring."

Absolutely. But I am less worried about this report, in part because there is little reason to hype this for financial reasons - it's an old, dirt cheap drug we have used for decades.

But I also think it is useful to keep in mind that this is not an antiviral treatment - if anything, it's the contrary, and may well lead to decreased / slower clearing of the virus. 

So it's definitely not to be used as prophylactic or even milder to moderate disease - it would likely to makes things worse.

It does appear to be useful in the way high dose steroids have always been useful - tamping down on a dangerous inflammatory response such as a Cytokine storm often observed in severe Covid-19. Indeed, in a substantial number of cases, it was apparently life-saving - first drug to reach that distinction for this disease (in contrast to Remdesivir, for instance, and much, much cheaper than the specific Il-6 inhibitors that also appear useful in the Cytokine storm)."

Before it is used according to the Trump Dictum of taking it in excess to ward off the evil demons, and as a treatment and maintenance drug and for fun, you may want to understand more fully what steroids in megadoses can do. 
Here is the caution: huge and sustained doses of steroids can have adverse impact e.g. cataracts, diabetes, hypertension, immunosuppression. Requires close monitoring of all the above plus liver, kidney and endocrine. 
My son had a viral lung pneumonia about 8 years ago, which presented in a manner identical to COVID, with ARDS, pulmonary emboli, cytokine storm, lung failure. It had an ""unknown etiology"", so he received dexamethasone (one gram/day; huge dose) and every antibiotic and antifungal known to humanity. The final diagnosis was ""viral"" for want of any actual diagnosis although I do not think UCLA thought to use broad PCR testing to identifying possible viral causes. I frankly do not recall what if any antivirals he may have received. In any case, all the above failed and his lungs deteriorated to 5-10% remaining function. Double lung transplant later, 6 years ago this week, he finished Cell and Molecular Bio degree and goes to med school Sept.

The real marvel here is that physicians in the UK have at their disposal an integrated health care system, the National Health Service, that can rapidly organize a large scale clinical trial AND at the same time begin stockpiling dexamethasone  in anticipation of the demand.

In some cases, presumably people with diminished immune systems, the virus infection has a rather long course. Often it seems these cases can suddenly turn very desperate perhaps accompanied by a ""cytokine storm"". Is it possible that in people who fail to clear the virus in couple of weeks or so, the development of antibody begins to occur, and it is the development of antibody that triggers the ""cytokine storm"". It is known for example that pichinde virus in Guinea pigs ( perhaps an animal model for lassa fever), that the Guinea pigs will die from shock  about 3 weeks after they have been infected.

2020-06-17 01:59:24,"Interesting, dexamethasone has many uses. Not sure which are off label or indicated in the literature; however, it stands to reason that a powerful steroid would be used in treatment of Covid 19. So it does seem odd that more cases weren‚Äôt treated with it or similar roid. Of course, any steroid long-term is damaging, especially to soft tissue. But this would be acute and, therefore limited use. Not having an M.D., perhaps there‚Äôs more risk and contraindication with this being such a capricious virus. If I were infected, though, I‚Äôd want dexamethasone. In my experience it‚Äôs been used for a family member repeatedly to tame bouts of a chronic skin condition with success, although the nature of the steroid means limited doses annually."

When historians write books about this, they will be in the headscratching section."

Desperation for a way to keep economies from collapsing Under the weight of Covid-19 could mean settling for a vaccine that prevents people from getting really sick or dying but doesn‚Äôt stop them from catching the coronavirus.

Although a knock-out blow against the virus is the ultimate goal, early vaccines may come with limitations on what they can deliver, according to Robin Shattock, an Imperial College London professor leading development of an experimental shot.

‚ÄúIs that protection against infection?‚Äù Shattock said. ‚ÄúIs it protection against illness? Is it protection against severe disease? It‚Äôs quite possible a vaccine that only protects against severe disease would be very useful.‚Äù

As countries emerge warily from lockdowns, leaders are looking to a preventive shot as the route to return to pre-pandemic life. 

Fueled by billions of dollars in government investment, vaccines from little-known companies like China‚Äôs CanSino Biologics Inc. and giants like Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc are in development.

Though often effective, a major side effect: the partial disabling of adrenal hormones that keep the immune system in check.  Which can cause a host of autoimmune disorders similar to the cytokine storms that serious COVID patients experience when their immune systems go into overdrive.   

With cancer, these reactions are treated by administering hormone replacement steroids like Cortef (synthetic cortisol, the so-called ""stress hormone"").  In serious situations such as an automobile accident, a massive dose of immunosuppression is required to minimize the additional shock from the uncontrolled immune reaction.  For such occasions, my endocrinologist prescribed a shot of dexamethasone to carry with me, along with wearing an identifying dogtag.  Ten bucks, if I recall correctly -- which should give pause to Gilead, the manufacturer of the far more expensive drug remdisivir I suspect is less effective."

Having been on it for 38 years now and counting,  I can attest to the fact that this type of drug has multiple side effects, a lot of them negative.  I have been carefully monitored over time, and doses adjusted accordingly

This study shows promise and is a good start.

However, I fear the drugs will become so prohibitively expensive because pharmaceutical companies will see them as a potential gold mine.  The drug, with my insurance, now costs less than $1/month.  Who's to say that the costs won't expoentially rise due to use as a covid treatment?  The same thing will happen with this drug as what happened with the drugs used for malaria;  they are also used for lupus and other  diseases, and those who needed them found themselves without, while the pills were being hoarded by  those who thought they could take them as a miracle cure.  

If steroids become a needed weapon against Covid, there need to be controls on who can purchase them.  No pills without a perscription, no pills without a demonstrated need.

In fact it should be prescribed under careful medical supervision and ONLY be administered to a select group of patients whose infection has progressed to the autoimmune chronic case with inflammation damaging organs, primarily lungs. What has become evident recently is that while over 95% of the confirmed positive COVID-19 cases of adults under 55 are CURABLE, those who have full blown symptoms have been difficult because they progress to a chronic phase with inflammatory autoimmune damage. This finding that Dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory, immunosuppresive drug reduces damage to the lungs is welcome news. There should be no confusion that the drug is not an antiviral and is no substitute for a much needed antiviral with no adverse effect that can block progression to the later stage contributing to death. This drug is not to be given to adults below 55 who have a mild infection with COVID-19 or have no symptoms. Only those who are likely to die due to inflammatory lung damage.

DEXAMETHASONE, an immunosuppressive steroid could be harmful if given to confirmed positive adults below 55 or persons in the early stages of infection. IT is not a wonder drug that will work wonders for patients exposed to COVID-19 or have mild symptoms or have no inflammatory damage."

Moreover, the release was posted even before results were elaborated in a public draft (no relevant -Rœáiv preprint). 

We therefore are asked to take the release on faith, in particular, faith in the lead research group and its ability to discern hidden shortcomings in the study design/data analysis. There are COVID case studies in misplaced pre-publication faith, though here it might be reasonable‚Äîas seen in the willingness of some to commit to action just on the release.

In clinical practice the use of dexamethasone versus hydrocortisone is rarely discussed i.e. they are often used interchangeably (yes, I know there are some differences, mostly unrelated to their anti-inflammatory effects). Early on I read that ""steroids"" were being tried but weren't helpful. Was the experimental ""low"" dose (6 mg/day) chosen at random? Could a higher dose have shown even more effect, or was that even tried?  Were there simultaneous blood tests being drawn measuring indicators of ""cytokine storm"" (ferritin levels, CRP levels) rather than just ""needed oxygen"" and ""on a ventilator.""

Dexamethasone may be a tool to help outcomes, but it's not a miracle drug, and we cannot change medical practice based on prelminary data from a single study. It may help reduce mortality in the sickest COVID patients, which is great, and I really hope it does, but like all medications, steroids are not benign and have been shown to be harmful in many illnesses. We need to see the final data, with all of its nuances, after it has gone through rigorous peer review. 

Please be careful with reporting preliminary, unpublished study results. Medical studies can be fraught with bias and difficult to interpret in the best of circumstances, even by experts who will disagree on what to do with the results of any study. Touting the preliminary findings of a single study prior to peer review and publication is one way we ended up with the absurd focus on hydroxychloroquine, which in turn let to a shortage of that medication for those who actually needed it AND dangerous misuse by people who listened to the president's reckless advice. Dexamethasone is a crucial drug for many other situations, and a shortage caused by increased demand based on premature action could be devastating."

Fortunately, the drug under discussion (dexamethasone) is inexpensive and given in short courses that can be given orally or intravenously. Yet there is an attempt, out of wide-spread anxieties over the virus, to trample on adequate peer review. 

There are big ifs and now--with a rush towards use most certainly created by the public press (including the NYTs)--it will be even harder to insist on expert data review and more carefully controlled clinical trials.

Tibetans were made to endure ""patriotic reeducation"" and even boiled in hot water. China's air force even bombed many Tibetan monasteries to smithereens in the 1970s.

Similarly in Xinjiang. Uyghurs are being forced to speak in Mandarin, give up halal eating habits as well as consume pork to prove their allegiance to Beijing.

However, now is actually the best time to support Xinjiang and Tibet. China's growth has slowed sharply meaning domestic pressures can build from now. Not only is the world more informed than ever of events within China's borders, Xi Jinping just scurried to a province in northwest China this month and interacted with members of an ethnic minority, which state media pointedly chose to publicise. 

Clearly, the pressures are growing within. It must be known that Chinese officials themselves scaled back the excesses of the Cultural Revolution in Tibet in fear that it would encourage separatism there..."
2020-06-18 14:03:23,What?! Did trump forget about the children and families separated to for-profit camps in our own country. Maybe we are all forgetting about them with all the noise drowning out their hopelessness.
2020-06-18 14:10:08,"Both countries imprison too many people.
Both countries use ethnic discrimination to decide who is in prison.
But the US, while ensuring more liberty for whites, has more people in prison."
2020-06-18 14:20:24,"Trump's incompetence and disregard for human rights in his dealings with China should not be a surprise to anyone.  All of Trump's foreign policy initiatives (Korea, Iran, Venezuela etc.) have failed because of his erratic bungling. I am still waiting for the midwestern farmers who support Trump to figure out that his chaotic China policy put their livelihoods in jeopardy without any gain to the U.S.  Perhaps Upton Sinclair's quote ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it"" applies to subsidized farmers as well as others."
2020-06-18 14:38:52,"Who else will stand up for human rights, if not US?"
2020-06-18 14:47:45,"If we as Americans can‚Äôt trust Trump, how much more suspicious must other countries be?  We can‚Äôt believe anything he says, how can they?   ‚ÄòWe do this all the time‚Äô said Mulvaney and he was obviously telling the truth.  This corrupt administration has brokered deals with dictators all over the world for his Own benefit, as he prefers dealing directly with all powerful leaders, democracies are so messy.  He can‚Äôt solve our crises here, so he must get help from abroad to be re-elected.  If the Republicans in leadership continue to turn away from this evil, they are no better than the officers who stood by and watched George Floyd be murdered.  No wonder why Rolfe thought he could get away with shooting Brooks in the back?  With these Republicans they are all ‚Äòlaw and order ‚Äò for everyone else, but they wouldn‚Äôt uphold the law and even hold a trial in the Senate to curb this ‚Äòlawless‚Äô president.  He and his administration have needlessly caused the death Of tens of thousands and looted our tax payer dollars for themselves and their donors much more than any protester.  Justice will be served.  The day of reckoning will come."
2020-06-18 15:08:35,"Even after 3.5 years, it's still mind-blowing that Trump has the audacity to criticize China's handling of the coronavirus. He should be his own chapter in psychology textbooks."
2020-06-18 15:20:16,The timing of this reminds me of the release of the Ukraine aide when Congress got the Whistleblower report.
2020-06-18 14:48:00,"Stand up to China? That would require a principled set of values and policies. As it stands now, the people of Trump Country only care about acquiring cheap stuff from Walmart, denying climate change even exists and denying rights to people of color. I don‚Äôt think the ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter‚Äù crowd cares about Uyghurs, Dreamers or the 543 species of vertebrates that have disappeared from the Earth over the last 100 years..."
2020-06-18 14:47:53,"If you talk to people you know who voted for Trump, the overriding theme that emerges is that he is successful businessman who knows how to get things done, and cut thru the red tape.

Well for all those folks who wanted a successful  wheeler/dealer type; you‚Äôve got it, and how did that work out for ya ?

In Trump‚Äôs world - everything is transactional. It doesnt matter if its millions of human lives at stake, etc; its a business deal. There are no sacred principles, anything and everything can be bartered."
2020-06-18 16:11:26,"There is no muddying - there was only one objective, to use China as a convenient boogeyman to win what seemed like a slam-dunk support. 
Then use any additional levers, be they Uyghurs or Hong Kong, or any large Chinese corporation seeking foreign markets, to force China to relent, and show a ‚Äòwin‚Äô. (Levers which Trump will readily hand over for more sales to China,  as stated by Bolton, so none of the laws passed mean much in practice).

Except it wasn‚Äôt so ‚Äòeasy to win a trade war‚Äô, not when US companies are already so leveraged and dependent on China (of their own accord), including Trump
and Ivanka‚Äôs own companies.  The pandemic only reinforced this truth.

And unlike Americans who can‚Äôt stomach much difficulty (see refusal to don masks), China is willing to go through the economic pains of the trade war.

So instead of being the tough one, Trump
gave even more power to China, all because he staked much of his candidacy and dealer narrative on getting China to buy more of our stuff, to the point of begging for it!  He may be the tough guy in NYC, but in foreign policy he is way in over his head."
2020-06-18 15:46:54,"This is all staged theatre. That's what Trump does, mindlessly as usual.

Bolton's revelation, that which any of use who can see through Trump's lies and accurately interpret his dog whistles and innuendo, already knew, show Trump as the Domestic Terrorist, TRAITOR and would-be American Emperor that he is. His unquestionable collision with Ukraine (for which he was justly IMPEACHED) was just the tip of that iceberg. His actions, and Bolton's confirmation, prove that Trump sought collaboration with China and Russia also, for HIS benefit, against the laws and Constitution of the United States.

Trump should never be exonerated for this. Beginning in January I would love to se an independent, truly INDEPENDENT, agency set up to investigate all that this traitor has done and the lasting effects not has had upon the United States. This can NEVER happen again. ALL involved - including all those Republican obstructionists who knew full well what was going on and what they were doing to maintain power - must be held accountable.

This cannot pass unresolved or it will send a clear message to others that it is OK to do it again, without consequence. As I remember, hanging is still available as punishment for treason."
2020-06-18 15:50:56,"Let‚Äôs be honest here. Trump doesn‚Äôt know what a Uighur is. He couldn‚Äôt find Xinjiang on a map. He‚Äôs never heard of East Turkestan. China does as it pleases. It‚Äôs kicking out foreign journalists, all foreign websites are blocked in China, it writes its owns narratives on everything from COVID-19 to the history of Tibet. The scope of its menace stretches far beyond its borders: from Canada to Australia, from East Africa to Eastern Europe, from The South Pacific to South East Asia. Within the country the people have no voice whatsoever - none. There is so much self-censorship; it is literally illegal to speak badly about the CCP, or to discuss the Cultural Revolution or The Great Leap Forward. The CCP has truly created a surveillance state where the government knows what you say, where you go, who you talk with, etc (and it‚Äôs nothing like what other countries‚Äô governments do). Mike Pompeo does talk tough on China. But what‚Äôs he really gonna do??"
2020-06-18 16:11:33,Trump wants to sanction China because he cares about the  Uyghurs. Don't make me laugh.
2020-06-18 16:20:55,"I grew up in Xinjiang. In early 1980s, to preserve Uighur identity, Chinese government set up Uighur schools from elementary to colleges but gave them options to be educated in Han schools. Twenty years later, Uighur students educated in Han schools were working in big cities or overseas. Uighur students graduated from Uighur schools remained in Xinjiang because insufficient skills in Mandarin and other fields. The whole China operates in Mandarin. The Uighur school educated Uighurs simply could not compete in other parts of China. One can imagine if US government educate Hispanics in TX in Hispanic schools for 30 years, what would happen.

 In rurals, the situation was far worse. The CCP did not have tight grip in rural Xinjiang. Starting in 1990s, extreme Isalm filled the void. Graduation rates in Uighur schools were about 30%. The one-child policy did not apply to China's minority races including Uighurs. Then Xinjiang ended up having big Uighur population which was sparsely educated. 

Most Uighurs in Xinjiang have being worked as street vendors, craftsmen, and farmers. Resentment to Han Chinese on economic development and income was widespread. Then Uighurs bombed buses, markets and train stations. They also stabbed pedestrians to death and therefore has been labeled as terrorists by the CCP.

Then China set up the re-education camps to brainwash the Uighur extremists, but also to teach them some living skills to make a living. My cousin is a doctor in those camps."
2020-06-18 16:27:56,"Oh brother, Trump just covered himself for one of the most egregious revelations. There's no muddying going on, it's another fake and a lie which Trump supporters don't need anyway."
2020-06-18 16:33:37,It will be USA companies to whom China is an important market such as GM that will suffer the brunt of Chinese fury. Which in turn will harm American citizens directly.
2020-06-18 16:36:23,"As always with this Trump, Inc. administration, this is about Trump creating a counter narrative to the well known reality of his appeasement of foreign dictators.  His cultists will ooh and aw at their soft-handed, draft-dodging hero, bunker-hiding hero.  Mission accomplished."
2020-06-18 15:33:31,"Is this law coming now because Trump's people have read Bolton's book, whose manuscript they have had since December 2019, and blocked progress on since March 2020?

While one should not create conspiracy theories, one should also not pretend to be a naive, ingenue when covering important news stories. Mr. Trump has made it very very clear that he is a calculating, transactional person, who lies with impunity. When writing about his actions any serious reporter must be very precise and careful - instead of saying, ""Mr. Trump is taking Hydroxychloroquine..."" you must say, ""Mr. Trump claims to be taking Hydroxychloroquine ..."" which is the provable thing. 

So there is probably no muddling here, other than what you are (unwittingly?) doing. Mitch McConnell does not allow anything to pass the Senate if Mr. Trump says he will not sign it. The Concentration Camp issue in Xinjiang goes back to 2017. That this ‚ÄúUyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020,‚Äù was passed and is now being signed 3 years later, just as Bolton's book with those allegations is coming out is not merely a coincidence.

Democracy dies in Darkness, acc to the WaPo. Maybe NYT should add a ""Democracy dies in Dumbness"" caution to your logo. Right now naivete and dumbness are killing our democracy. Please choose wisely."
2020-06-18 18:16:57,"Muddled or not, the China gambit was never going to work anyway as a burning campaign issue.  Most Americans don't know Wuhan from wonton and they like it that way."
2020-06-18 14:25:30,Laughable that we are pointing the finger at another country‚Äôs mass incarcerations of an ethnic minority. Don‚Äôt we have more people in prison than even China?
2020-06-18 16:49:32,Trump‚Äôs China policy (incoherent and narcissism based) is at least consistent with his virus policy (incoherent and narcissism based).
2020-06-18 16:59:01,"During his talks and discussions on many political topics, especially about Chinese diplomatic topics, Trump is notoriously known to divagate and meander through the labyrinth of rhe subject matter, and asides, but when it has come to re-election, he became crystal clear about his ambitious plans of winning a second term. What an incandescent idea! His alleged scandals and ramshackle policies in Ukraine, China, and Russia have been reeking of misdeeds and misadventures, our nation does not need to contend or deal with. 

It is disturbing to see the Dems, who have squandered away an impeachment opportunity, but then again, GOP senators were waiting in the wings, to acquit Trump, so he can continue with his gasconade unhinged. And so, Trump's rodomatading went on and on, much to the chagrin of many a neutral observer. Now the Chinese connection, of sorts, is raising its ugly head.

One wonders about the possible upshots of all these claims of Trump's shenanigans, impacting his re-election. It can potentially be an unreliable predictor of his success, since he still does have his committed base, God love them, and hence Joe Biden's success is never going to be guaranteed, by anyone factor or set of factors. 

China, of all other nations, with its flagrant human rights violations, should be eschewed at all costs, as much as possible. Its oppressive attitudes, towards its own citizens, who teeter o the edges of mutiny, have to be taken into account, before clinching a deal."
2020-06-18 18:14:28,"How is anyone still listening to anything Bolton says?  He has nearly a half century history of blatantly lying on record.  The only consistency to Bolton is that he will say anything to promote his ideological view that the US needs to militarily occupy the entire globe and to destroy anyone who opposes a US global military presence.  He never met a military intervention he didn't drool over.  Bolton is out for some quick cash snagged from the Trump is pure evil chorus while trying to take-down someone he sees as an impediment to the ""rightful"" US dominion over the globe.

And seriously, does anyone think Trump has ever been friendly towards China?  He's been talking trash about China since the early 80s, and that trash talk has only intensified.  For crying out loud, he spent most of the 2016 election cycle promising to be a thorn in China's side no matter what the cost (and has -for better and for worse- actually lived up to those promises).

I might not like Trump and think he's reckless and volatile, but he definitely doesn't have what it takes to engage in some elaborate conspiracy with a major world power (or anyone, for that matter)."
2020-06-18 18:04:10,"At least this administration is trying to do something about the fascist China, which is much more than can be said of the previous administrations.  Actions speak louder than words, and imposing sanctions is the right thing to do no matter the motivation.  But much more needs to be done, such as barring PRC nationals from studying and working in the US and Canada."
2020-06-18 15:16:05,There will never be a good time for any American to talk about China's outer regions and non Hans while BLM exists.  Trump can only dream about what real dictators can do.
2020-06-18 17:34:43,"The message being sent by this administration to President Xi isn't the slightest bit muddled. And it is one no doubt Xi understands perfectly well: trump is, best case, utterly indifferent to Xi's egregious human rights abuses and authoritarianism, and entirely focused on extending his own reign, at any cost, except to himself.

In a nutshell, trump is willing to give Xi a tremendous propaganda victory- a pro-concentration camp US is one stripped of all claim to moral authority- in exchange for the purchase of some bushels of soybeans."
2020-06-18 17:45:06,"How is Trump‚Äôs flip flopping on the imprisonment of Uighurs surprising? Nothing Trump says or does is informed by an ethical values system. 

Trump lives almost exclusively by the gut instincts of a wounded animal ‚Äî self-preservation, promoting himself, and increasing his net worth are all he knows. A moral compass that shows constancy and consistency is an unknown in Trump‚Äôs method of decision-making. 

Trump‚Äôs decisions on the most important challenges of our time can change by the minute depending on what serves his personal objectives‚Äî and are not based on decency or love of country."
2020-06-18 16:22:30,"Occam's razor tells us that 'of any given set of explanations for an event occurring, the simplest one is most likely correct'.

The Trump administration, taking Stephen Miller's xenophobic cues (wholly embraced by Trump) has had Bolton's book for months, long knowing well what it contained. They also knew Trump's early statements about the camps were bound to leak by the 'fake media' during an election year. Make him look 'bad'. So they decide to publicly change his tune with some fist-pounding new law knowing he basically had nowhere else to go. 

Xi is also facing unease at home. Especially after the latest troubling COVID-19 breach of Beijing. 

He must realise Trump is the impulsive ADD-addled buffoon that he is; and that Pompeo the shameless, boot-licking (read: blindly ambitious) sycophant he presents himself to be. 

Xi and Co. must try to make sense of how best to meet this challenge of a wild unpredictable adversary as they doggedly attempt to restructure a new world order led by China. 

The 'secret' in Hawaii, therefore, is no secret at all: they're all just trying to stay in power, cover each other's backs, throw some  meat to the press (hence 'secrecy') as each attempts to win at their own winner-take-all game of Risk, consequences and human collateral damage be damned."
2020-06-18 18:25:17,"China ""lashes out."" Trump ""lashes out.""

Any ""anti-China"" words coming from the WH are LIES, simply bait thrown out to the media, in a phony attempt to hide the truth (again).  Don't believe any of this nonsense.
MEANWHILE Kim is selling NK sand to Xi, so he can expand his South China Sea island military bases.
That's what's going on as the tweets poor forth from the WH."

2020-06-18 15:02:11,"Our President endorsed the existence of secret internment and re-education camps for ethnic minorities in a hostile state in order to get help with his re-election. Let that sink in America, because it‚Äôs you."
2020-06-18 19:55:22,"Trump has no plan , no strategies on relationships  with China and  everything else apart from his re-election and self enrichment.

He has been running ads against Biden indicating Biden is cozy with China whereas he is tough on them . Predictably Bolton‚Äôs book contradicts this as does Trump walking away from TPP. TPP was designed to reduce Chinas influence 

Trump is a total danger to this Country and the World and he is enabling China to be the next sole super power and that is not good"

2020-06-18 22:31:43,"Our sycophantic Republican senators should have removed Trump a long time ago. He lacks clear thinking. His decision-making is whimsical. He seldom tells the truth. He secretly supports tyrants. He is indifferent to human rights, here and abroad. He lacks a clearly thought out foreign policy. His decisions are mostly based on self-interest. He is damaging the reputation of the U.S. around the world. He is not making America great again. What does this say about the Americans who voted for him and the Republicans who continue to support him?"

The NWSL will restart in ten days with the Challenge Cup in Utah, with the games scheduled and detailed preparations for this unique situation underway - surely their commissioner might have some insight into these challenges? 

The WNBA and MLS will also restart in July and are releasing plans.

Imagine 5000 fans, spread out evenly, in a stadium that holds 50,000? A fan every 10 seats on average?  Of course families and partners could stick together, as they do at home, but what danger would their be of spreading a virus under such circumstances?"
2020-06-18 20:59:00,"Politicians are killing the return of sports.  Outdoor events like the US Open Tennis tournament and the PGA Golf tournament in San Francisco should allow spectators.

Considering that this very paper has written about the difference in the severity of cases between men and women it is certainly worth mentioning plans for return of women's and men's sports.

What a bore."
2020-06-18 20:11:37,"Each league -- and each player association, as well as each individual athlete -- has to make a risk assessment in this matter.  

The societal challenge is that virtually every sport is a communal event.  It is a team event for the athletes, and a community event for the spectators.  Whatever their sport, professional athletes are by definition among the most talented individuals in the world at their particular craft, and they will adjust to performing without being surrounded by fans.  

It is we the fans who will find it harder, especially for sports where the crowd is an elemental part of the experience: college football and basketball, soccer, and hockey.  The more pastoral (baseball), the more militaristic (pro football), and the quieter sports (tennis, golf) will fare better.

Can't wait to watch MLS and then hopefully some hockey -- as long as the players and all others present are safe."
2020-06-19 02:12:31,"All of us miss sports, whether it be the games played by our children, the collegiate competition or the major league play of all genders. Yes, sports provide a much needed distraction for its fans. But the game of sport also builds community and confidence, teaches leadership and sportsmanship, establishes, cements and promotes happy and meaningful traditions. But, aside from the few leagues who have managed to figure out how to put together a season despite the financial costs to every one in their game, I see none of the traditional intangible benefits of sports. Instead, I see leagues and players focused only on the health of their bottom lines by demonstrating an unbelievable and insensitive level of greed.  Why not, instead, use the time out to pursue and promote positive change, as suggested by Dwight Howard? Or, if professional play can resume without risking the health of all involved, why not require players to donate a meaningful percentage of their pay to social and racial justice causes and likewise require the leagues to donate a meaningful percentage of television revenue to those same causes? Why not help rewrite the painful history of 2020 through compassion and thoughtfulness?  Why not use the power and influence to lead by example rather than use that power and influence to  play like spoiled children on an elite playground?  Sadly, it may make 2020 sports look like a playbook designed by Donald Trump."

2020-06-19 12:06:59,"There is no practical way to start professional sports.

To have professional sports we would need to test all players, coaches, grounds keepers, maintenance people, trainers and all of the others who come into contact with one another in the game. Anyone who tests positive is out. Those who test negative will have to stay together and travel and live as a unit in a confined clean area to keep them negative. 

They will need to be sequestered together in a living facility like a hotel where all the hotel workers will also have to be tested and kept together lest they become infected. We'll have to find bus drivers who test negative to transport the athletes and their support staff, and get sterilized buses to exclusively transport players, equipment, and associated personnel to and from the hotels and the sterile sports facilities. They too will need to be sequestered. There is no point to letting these people roam at will as they can contract the virus immediately after testing negative merely by coming into contact with a positive or the leavings of a positive.

Point? There is no way to do this without exposing people to disease and death. Sports aren't worth it. I think we can live without sports for awhile."

To make things go fast, maybe either give the batters an extra strike, or let the team at bat provide the picher.

18 innings of excitement might sell some tickets. The hitting stats may even exceed a regular season's stats.

By agreement, the pitcher's stats will be expunged. The pichers who give up the most runs will get the Cy Young."

Whether the president has a ""good feeling"" about a particular drug means squat.

Given his comments, and that his pronouncements about trade economics reveal an utter lack of understanding of the issue, Navarro, ironically, is the poster boy for wrongheaded elites that Trump's base despises."

2020-06-17 14:06:54,"What needs to be driven home again and again is that whether or not hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine was effective in treating Covid-19, the reckless promotion of the drug by Trump, figures in his administration and his media surrogates - many of whom have absolutely no expertise in medical science or pharmacology - politicized the entire effort to investigate whether the drugs were useful from the start. From the moment Trump called it a ‚Äúgame changer‚Äù and asked ‚Äúwhat do you have to lose,‚Äù anyone who raised questions about it became a political actor, even if their skepticism was based purely on science."
2020-06-17 14:00:41,"I do NOT believe in hydroxychloroquine. However 2 negative studies have been revoked due to a false data basis. This puts studies back to square one, all trials must be restarted with lost date due to the test pause. I guess reliant data will be available only after the pandemic is over. That s the guilt of some fame ridden forging scientists. We lost time."
2020-06-17 13:13:11,"It's a shame and perhaps criminal that some people undoubtedly died from cardiac dysrhythmias from taking the drug, and we don't appear to know how many people with RA and lupus were unable to get it and had complications.

Don't toss it yet.  With climate change, malaria may be coming our way in a few decades. Maybe we will be better prepared for that than we were for Covid."
2020-06-17 13:46:22,This is not the America I grew up in.  I want my country back.  I want it run by competent public servants.  I think Trump does not understand competence.  He seems to have made his way by wheeling and dealing.  He has no respect for competence and does not understand why it matters.
2020-06-17 13:27:32,"Someone needs to get ahold of the financials of the Trump family members, and find out which one of them owned stock in companies that made the pills.

There are only 2 reasons Trump does anything: to make money and/or to cause pain to someone he views as weaker than him. And that‚Äôs it.

Trump is very open and up front when he wants to hurt someone. He will openly let the target know he is going to hurt them. But since that never happened with hydroxycloroquine I have to assume the reason for all the hubub was to make a lot of money.

66 million doses must have cost the government a lot of money. Who‚Äôd they buy it from? Who owns the most stock in that/those companies? Find the inter company emails and text messages etc. There‚Äôs a record of what happened behind the scenes, somewhere. Brave and ambitious journalists should go find it."
2020-06-17 13:19:31,"Mr. Navarro, who last I checked was Trump's trade advisor, appears to have no qualifications to address medical issues. Nonetheless, he would have been well-served to ignore the view that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective, if not potentially hazardous, for treating Covid-19. Rather he should have pointed out that the United States could not be in better shape for the next massive malaria outbreak. To coin a phrase ""Brownie, you're doing a heckuva job."""

2020-06-17 14:42:43,"I am a professor and physician. At the start of the pandemic, I predicted that all Americans would see the importance of rigorous scientific evidence. I felt that it would be obvious to everyone that science was the only way out of the pandemic. 

But I was wrong. Trump, Navarro and Pence think that magical thinking is the way to go. The concept that we are only seeing covid cases because we are testing is very close to insanity, and way past idiotic. 

We should be in the middle of the covid pandemic in the US, but we're in the beginning."
2020-06-17 13:54:06,"Oh, but when one combines the stockpiling of an anti-malarial drug with criminal climate change denial it all evens out: as tropical diseases, like malaria, move into once-temperate climes, we‚Äôll welcome the stockpiling of the drug as a prescient move. Genius!"

We know that the President is all about personal gain and so are the rest of them in the administration. Somebody made a bunch of money on this.
2020-06-17 13:25:57,"Hilarious.  Of course, the companies who made these pills knew this off-label use was bogus, and the investors in those companies will reap the profits.  Wonder, wonder whether anyone in the decision-making process to put this absurd medication in stockpile, and to recommend it widely leading to horrid and dangerous use by uninformed people and unscrupulous prescribing physicians, is likely to benefit from all these 'sales?'"
2020-06-17 13:29:31,"The question here is about the Trump family financial portfolio. Did Donald Trump or any corporation the Trump family controls hold stock or any financial interest in the drug company that manufactures hydroxychloroquine? This needs to be duly investigated. Did the Trump family benefit in any way in regard to the increased demand or government stockpiling of this drug? It appears very suspicion to me that this man of no substance in medical knowledge promotes a drug by name, out of the gate, and for no apparent reason. Why did he promote this specific drug? Why? Remember, he told us flat out that he would be the first President to actual profit from being President. He said it !"
2020-06-17 14:24:31,"Well, as US withdraws from WHO and other international organizations and tries to cure diseases with quackery, this maybe an opportunity to to distribute out these drugs free to its own suffering citizens(Hydrochloroquine is prescribed for things other than malaria -- just not COVID),  and the rest of the world, ex: where there is still malaria. Maybe Trump, a true entrepreneur he is, can get the money back from India returning it, the sane way he extracted it from India at gunpoint."

It may be rationalized that these groups will continue to persist because we have a democracy, but the DOJ has a responsibility to guard the well-being of Americans."
2020-06-17 14:16:34,"How much taxpayer money did we waste on building the stockpile?
The government should ask Trump for reimbursement.  Then they should reinstate the Federal official who was wrongfully terminated for disagreeing with Trump and fire the FDA official who approved the emergency use authorization."
2020-06-17 14:29:58,"This is such a replay of the lie that Iraq tried to purchase Uranium yellowcake, one of the many changing justifications for waging war against Iraq. There the administration refused to believe intelligence reports that it was false, but kept peddling it. I'd like to know where this idea about using Hydroxychloroquine came from -- it didn't start with Trump -- and why it was rushed into the purchase of 66 million doses for the federal stockpile. It's an abuse of just about everything: the FDA, Twitter, experts, and the stockpile itself, which should have been distributing PPE. I took one of those for malaria prevention and immediately stopped when I saw how swollen it made me in a single day. And enough with the Deep State talk. People who work in government are career workers. Just because Navarro and Trump are temporary workers doesn't make the rest of the government a ""Deep State."""
2020-06-17 14:35:16,"I‚Äôve been amazed throughout at the willfully blind obedience that Trump has received from formerly at least somewhat responsible government agencies and organizations. His slashing of those who oppose him at all from employment and demands of subservience from all who remain certainly has had this effect‚Äîbut the ease with which sane governance was overthrown speaks to a dreadful flaw: the result of decades of executive power amplified and now run amok, contemptuous of the other branches, and virtually unopposed in its near-dictatorial power. If democrats can unseat this cabal, new laws and standards, and adherence to old ones such as Congress as the declarer of wars and maker of laws, must be instituted. We need defenses against tyranny and its ills, as Trump‚Äôs trampling of reason and decency makes clear."
2020-06-17 14:38:31,"More Trump wreckage.
He could be gone tomorrow and it would take decades to repair much of the damage.
Frankly, two years of Trump was the limit IMO to fix things fairly quickly while damage was minimal. 
Now much of the damage is simply not fixable in the short term, it's permanent unless a huge de-Trumpification effort happens which will be a generational effort. 

2016 was the firewall, kids.
No easy way out of the Trump mess now."
2020-06-17 14:22:00,"If Fauci or any medical doctor had commented about Trumps Chinese tariffs as being an impediment to the flow of pharmaceuticals coming from China and consequently a threat to Americans health and well-being, Navarro would tell him that he shouldn't be giving advice in an area that he has no expertise. Navarro for the same reason shouldn't be recommending a drug when he's not qualified to do so. 
 
I'm also getting sick and tired of these Trumpers trotting out the ""deep state"" conspiracy or the ""fake news"" defense whenever there is something they don't like occurs."
2020-06-17 13:34:20,"Republicans claim to be all about controlling government waste and misuse of taxpayers' money.  How much did these 66 million ineffectual doses cost us?

Worst of all, Trump has destroyed the credibility of the entire government, including the CDC and NIH. His degradation of agencies that we should be able to trust will lead to popular rejection of the eventual actual, verified treatments and cures for this disease.

Meanwhile, Minuchin vultures in during a moment of crisis (as he did in the housing crisis), and distributes billions to who knows who, with zero accountability.  No wonder he always has a snide jeer in the place where a smile should be.  When this nightmare is over, I want investigations."

2020-06-17 15:10:45,"The FDA stocked up  hydroxychloroquine on Trumps orders even though there was anecdotal evidence that it could be harmful. Now that there have been studies to back up the claim on the potential harmfulness of this drug Trump should repay the treasury out of his ""billions"" for using our tax money on his whim."
2020-06-17 15:53:09,I'm a cynic. Someone very high up in our government was poised to make a lot of money on this if the drug was effective. That's why there was pressure to make this such a high priority.
2020-06-17 15:53:56,There is a tremendous need for chloroquine in the world. In the world malaria accounts for a significant number of deaths and causes significant morbidity.  We need to get it to the people who need it.
2020-06-17 14:50:08,"Do not take Hydroxychloroquine unless your Doctor is sure it will not hurt you.

Now... here is why there is still so much confusion regarding this medication:

I can tell you from my anecdotal experience in our private hospital and clinics here in Brazil that the portion of medical staff taking a reduced dosage prophylactically since the beginning of March have had no serious illness or death related to taking it, while the staff not taking it has had a few serious cases and one death that I know of. I am stating this from a very small population of approximately 500 care givers.

Another reason... he Medical profession's first responsibility is to do no harm. Nobody is yet comfortable prescribing this medication except as a last result. By then, we know it will not work and it may even harm the patient."
2020-06-17 15:33:24,It's a drug against malaria - just donate it to poor countries where malaria is a treat and medicine is needed. Let people work on drugs which are effective against covid19.
2020-06-17 15:37:40,"One silver lining: since malaria is a real threat in many parts of the world, maybe those drugs can be donated where they are needed.

But the fact that ‚Äúwe‚Äù bought into this is embarrassing and dangerous."
2020-06-17 15:24:55,"Well, jared needed to fill 'his' stockpile with something. And, if trump called it a 'game changer,' that's good enough for him; neither of them seems to think beyond the optics of anything."

How about providing some of those extra pills to the VA for the use of veterans who need them?"
2020-06-17 15:04:55,"As a malariologist I need to point out that chloroquine and its less toxic variant, hydroxychloroquine are not much recommended for use against malaria.  The most lethal form (falciparum malaria) is highly resistant to these drugs, which have long been replaced by more effective antimalarial drugs.  The other three (less lethal) malaria species (Plasmodium vivax, P. oval and P. malariae) are somewhat susceptible to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine but much more effective and less toxic antimalarial drugs are available. 

Aside from the amoral behavior of the Trump team, what I find most disturbing is that Bayer has been getting these pills from a non-certified factory in Pakistan.  Because of its outstanding reputation, I have always advocated buying Bayer aspirin but no longer!"

Dr. Bright was so correct.  The whole hydroxychloroquine thing was a Trump hoax - a real hoax.  I am also curious about Dr. Fauci and Birx!  They‚Äôve fallen off the face of American press!

I don‚Äôt for a minute believe Trump would be morally above a scheme like that, but from what I read, there just isn‚Äôt that much actual money involved in these old cheap generics.  What Trump really wanted to gain from this scheme was more political than financial: to appear a strong, in-charge leader to his supporters; to calm financial markets fearful of the pandemic‚Äôs economic consequences; to use a ruse to ‚Äúcall off‚Äù a panic he was unable to control with his usual bullying and skullduggery.

There was no scientific backing for Malaria pills and FDA should have made it clear to the public that Malaria pills have no proven antiviral activity against COVID-19. The only authority to approve drugs, vaccines and food items is the F.D.A. Not Dr. Fauci and not Dr. Birx or DR. Bright or DR. Vladimir Zelenko and not any politician or elected official. 

I am very concerned about the lack of clarity of the information that the general public is getting about medications and available treatments against COVID-19. First of all most adults as many as 95% below 55 are going be naturally CURED with treating the symptoms. Hyroyxchloroquine is an anti malarial to be used as a prophylaxis following exposure to malarial parasite or mosquito bites in a malarial infested area. The recent hype about DEXAMETHAZONE (DExa), an immunosuppressive steroid  is alarming. It is only to be given to COVID-19 confirmed adults on ventilators who are progressing to the chronic end stage of the COVID-19  infection. If Dexa is prescribed to a COVID-19 confirmed positive individual in the early stage, grave harm will be done to the patient's natural ability to clear the virus out of the body. Please be aware of it. Dexa is not a prophylaxis for any viral disease and will not provide any health benefit and will in fact render a patient susceptible to infections.

ONLY antiviral to COVID-19 that may be effective so far is Remdesivir."

It's a good thing that neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Navarro are nearly as creative as Mr. Heller.  I don't want any chocolate covered chloroquine.  Unless I come down with malaria, and even then I won't want chloroquine from an uncertified plant.

First, it is ridiculous to think that thousands of doctors around the world were using hydroxychloroquine  because Trump was recommending it. Actually they were already using the drug in large numbers before Trump go involved. But that after over three years of Trump they would follow his advice?

There was a reason for the FDA granting the drug emergency (compassionate care) status. I believe that the drug had shown a proclivity for killing viruses in the lab. 

But the main reason that hydroxychloroquine was in such wide use in March was because doctors thought they had seen enough instances in which it had been effective against COVID. 

The FDA doesn't like anecdotal evidence, but if there is enough of it among a variety of doctors it becomes the strongest evidence. When interviewed by Howard Stern on April 12th, Governor Cuomo admitted that the anecdotal evidence had been positive.

Hydroxychloroquine is not new. It is among the most popular drugs in the world for its use of treating malaria. It had no reputation for being particularly dangerous.

""More than 100 researchers and medical professionals have asked the journal to provide further details about data that served as the basis for a recent study which found that it ...  could have increased their risk of abnormal heart rhythms and death.""

And yet Oklahoma is one of the nine states ( Al, Ar, Fl, Nv, NC, OK, Or, SC, Tx ) that have the highest record of covid-19 cases for the past week since the premature opening of the economy. Pence claimed the second wave is being overflown while we are still in the midst of first wave. 

The coming Trump rally on Saturday in a closed arena Tulsa OK (against public health official advice for cancellation or move to a open arena ) is another "" Blood on your hand "" event."

If honesty is prevalent at the end of this, which I doubt, the reality of the manipulations and disgraceful behaviours of various parties will be astounding.  People's lives have been destroyed, and it isn't because of the virus.

In a desperate effort to save Trumps reelection chances, I expect there will be something called a vaccine, ready to inject into people before the election, with the results safely coming after the vote."

2. The time wasted by government procurement and public health experts who could have been working on solutions recommenced by, oh I don't know, maybe a infectious disease expert like Anthony Fauci?
3. The respect of our citizens and the rest of the world toward the US government.

Whenever I read the idiotic statements of this administration I feel the need to rinse off with antiseptic as Trump wrongly suggested for the virus, but it probably would not help to wash away the feeling of shame and disgust I feel either."

I'm self-employed and have been for over 25 years.  In business, when sales are lost, they are lost forever.  That is, the money that was not made during the shutdown will never be made up.  If a business has sales of $10,000 a month which goes to zero for four months, the next four months of 'normalcy' do not yield $20,000 a month to make up for it.  You would be lucky just to get back to the average of $10,000.  Normal sales could take a year, or until a vaccine is available.

But bills and expenses continue.  We have fallen into a deep hole.  The losses will haunt us for years as we try to dig out.

We just lost another 1.5 million jobs.  The hole is getting deeper and the deeper it gets, the longer is will take to climb out."

Who will feed the millions of unemployed and their children? Who will cover their healthcare and their children's healthcare when they get sick? If the government does step in to help (and I think it certainly should), will there be enough people working to finance this new degree of social welfare? We have to remember that the bonds issued by the US depend on Chinese savers, and China isn't doing to hot, so there is a very real possibility that the US won't be able to borrow its way out of this crisis."

Workers and employees need permanent protections, not temporary ones, in order to take the worry out of life for them. Such measures would give them a little certainty in a very uncertain world. It is simply unfair for the system to subject workers and employees to such uncertainty and worry. Many have families to provide for, and children to raise.

Such worker protections wouldn‚Äôt be the undermining of capitalism; rather, it would be the making of it. They would ensure capitalism‚Äôs longevity and stability."

2020-06-18 21:28:15,"Regrettably, the ACA remains in poor shape, and will leave many of the newly unemployed uninsured.

Besides the Census Bureau reporting only 91% insured, due to Medicaid non-expansion in 14 states, and other problems like the ""subsidy cliff"", the Census statistic is falsely high, somewhat like the recent unemployment numbers, but unpublicized.

That's because about 18% counted as ""insured"" actually have some form of Medicaid.  Either ACA expanded Medicaid, or a pre-ACA Medicaid.

In many states, all Medicaids, for people 55 and over, are not really insurance, even though misrepresented as insurance in the statistics.

They are subject to Medicaid estate recovery.  Medical bills are paid temporarily for a person, but need to be paid back by a person's estate when they die.  It's a loan until death for medical expenses, not insurance, and people with this financial bomb often are unaware, due to inconspicuous notice by the relevant agencies.

The problem exists in 10 or so states, like MA, NJ, and MD.

(Some states fixed the problem, partly or completely, starting in main ACA provision year 2014, by amending their estate recovery policies.  E.g.: NY and CA.  Making at least all ACA coverage real insurance.)

But many states did not fix it.

Thus, my own state of MA claims 97% of people have health insurance.  But about 4% have Medicaid as their ""insurance"" and are also 55 or older.  So the true insured rate is about 93%.

Well, he did it again.

A whole quarter of a year with unemployment filings in excess of 1 million every week.  13 whole weeks.

Yep, definitely the biggest and the best when it comes to unemployment, Donnie.  Another record. Yippee!

Nobody will ever break that record, especially if you keep adding additional weeks, Donnie.  I have every confidence that you, and only you, are up to it. 

The only other record that I firmly believe will never be broken is Johnnie Vander Meer's two no hitters in consecutive pitching starts, on June 11 and June 15, 1938.

Just wait til vaccines start to roll out and we get the anti-vaccine crowd stirred up.
I'm thinking of temporarily locating to Taiwan and working remotely til this gets resolved in the US.   That country is a democracy, but people seem to agree on following S.D., wearing a mask, etc.   So their daily routine and business seems to be running closer to normal with very low infection rates (a shockingly low 1/400th the per capita rate of the US)."

Over 25% of the deaths from Covid 19 worldwide, the vast majority caused by Donald Trump's inaction and ignorance of science and his lack of capacity for empathy, occurred here in the United States of America.

The deaths are tragic - period.  To call this anything other than an utter and callus disregard for life by Trump is to miss the scope of carnage his lack of judgement and leadership has caused to this country.

He is worse than a failed President.  He is a failed human being."

You ended up trapped between two systems (the Home Office and Serco) and their facilities were almost impossible to access in places.  I had to drive all the way across the country to even get what was an 'expedited' appointment that was weeks away for which I paid nearly $1,000 extra to get even that.  You could, however, pay even more and get a super duper VIP appointment where they served you coffee and cookies (but that was only available in London)."

There appear to be a number of private companies who despite being convicted of fraud and frequently failing to deliver what they were contracted to do, are continuously allowed to rebid or even-handed the work without competition. the common factor (beyond the expense) is that they all have close links to and donate to the ruling Conservative party.

One probable (in fact hopeful) result will be the dissolution of the 'United Kingdom' with Scotland and Northern Ireland breaking away leaving a rump of England and Wales (although possibly not even that in the longer term).

It is a union that has passed its 'sell-by date'."

""The government has denied that contact tracing was ever stopped"" - it sounds as if it never really got started! 

Serco - the ""service corporation"", operates in public sectors such as aviation, military weapons, detention centres, prisons, and schools on behalf of its customers (i.e. government).  In 2019, it had 3.3 billion GBP in revenues.  Low pay, no training and a contract awarded without any real competition. This Serco Group is too cozy with government and it smells.  It is appalling that the government is trying to build a parallel privatized system at the expense of the public system."

Johnson's eye (and his advisers / sycophants) was on the Brexit ball. He missed the bigger picture to the detriment of us all. There's a sad history of poor, expensive and endlessly delayed public tech implementation. That they would produce an effective track and trace system in time (forget budget) was always doubtful. And then, to their eternal disgrace, launched a trial before the system was anything like ready and used the announcement to distract from other uncomfortable criticism. Who does that remind us of? There will be a second wave. And I have little confidence they'll be ready even for that."
2020-06-18 12:58:30,"If you read The Telegraph long enough, you know what the problem is.  Boris (an otherwise intelligent individual) has been trying to ape Donald, and his response (or lack thereof) to the coronavirus.  That is not so much for ideological reasons as because he was hoping to get a good trade deal with the U.S. after Brexit.  They need it for negotiating leverage with the EU.  And when Donald said he would give them priority consideration, they believed him.  Big mistake.

That was never realistic, since they wanted carve-outs to their agriculture and healthcare industries, which take time to negotiate.  And a trade deal would have to get through Congress anyway.  There was never any chance of that happening on Donald's term.  Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, lowered the boom on them yesterday and said as much.  It has been obvious all long, but true believers believe what they want to.  The Brits now have the worst of all worlds: no trade deal and a high infection rate.  They will be forced to flee into the arms of the EU, denying it all the while."
2020-06-18 12:55:48,"‚ÄúThe government has dismantled, fragmented and eviscerated so much of its health service over the last 20 years that it was much more difficult to get a coordinated system.‚Äù

Disasters happen when free-market ideologues insist the business world can do a ""better"" aka ""less expensive"" job with governmental responsibilities than a national health service that has the distinct advantage of know-how and a genuine commitment to the welfare of its citizenry ... whereas a company like Serco has its primary allegiance only to the bottom line.

England and the US have each taken a path of cost cutting and when hit with a crisis that demands the best expertise that money can buy, these penny-wise but pound foolish countries are left careening down the road to self-destruction.

Meanwhile as the West bumbles along, attempting and failing at one quick fix after another,  Asian countries like China, S. Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore are playing the long game.  

They go to code red when a few dozens new cases pop up; in the US and Britain the same small number would be reason to reopen commerce and party big time.

After WW2, the US became the superpower largely because the competition had been laid waste.

China et al are now fully engaged in a great war against this pandemic ... while the West is praying for a vaccine and treating it like a series of skirmishes that will soon play themselves out.

So a good portion of the country seeks solace in a mix of colonial nostalgia and nationalistic hubris which gave us the Johnson regime, a bunch of incompetent Brexiteers.

2020-06-18 12:21:45,"The cause of this problem is the privatization of public services through firms such as Serco that have a history of failure, charging the taxpayer a premium price for the cheapest service that they can get away with, which is what they are now doing with testing.

And the root cause of the UKs failure in so many areas, including now the pandemic, response is an ideological belief not supported by evidence either in the UK or overseas that government is always bad and the private sector always good.

This ideological belief infected the UK from the US but fortunately sensible countries like Germany or countries in Asia like Taiwan, Japan, Singapore have seen through the stupidity of this ideology and have responded very well."

2020-06-18 12:50:06,Johnson and his cohorts are truly pathetic. Johnson has spent his entire life spurning transparency in order to avoid scrutiny and accountability. It‚Äôs also how he has tried to run the government. He has just run into a brick wall. In so many ways - thanks (if that is the right word) to his botched response to the pandemic - statistics are bubbling up all over the place that provide externally defensible metrics of his incompetence. Of course he hates it... he‚Äôs on the back foot... since for once he can‚Äôt change the conversation and bluster on.

The dumbing down of American is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance‚Äù"

2020-06-16 17:01:25,"It is not only ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù that question the double standard clearly demonstrated by the NYT and some public health officials.   There is no doubt that Trump‚Äôs campaign rally is ill advised under the current covid pandemic, but so are the gathering of hundreds of thousands of mainly young people in mass BLM public protests over the last week. These young people have parents and grandparents - in already hard hit communities - that they go back to and possibly infect.  It would be wonderful if the NYT would try harder to not let their gaping political bias show when reporting these various events and how they relate to possible covid spread.   Unfortunately you are contributing to the confusing public health messages that have so far been the norm in our country, and reinforcing American‚Äôs distrust of the media and of expert advise.  Please do better."
2020-06-16 17:12:25,"Having an indoor rally during a pandemic may sound mind numbingly stupid, but after a record number of pandemic cases, record job losses, record levels of debt, record number of government vacancies by institutions run by a record number in ""acting"" roles, and so on, what‚Äôs one more to such a record long list of incompetence?"
2020-06-16 17:02:05,What about the secret service and employees of the venue and Tulsa police? Did the Times inquire about what protection they were all offered and why they have to risk infection for this rally?

Methinks the rally attendees think that the coronavirus pandemic was a hoax. Time will tell."

2020-06-16 17:05:39,"Honestly, the absolute depraved indifference being displayed is breathtakingly terrifying!  Every single death as a result of covid-19 spread at this rally will be on 1) POTUS, 2) his handlers, 3) FB, 4) FOX, and 5) the attendees themselves.  All are complicit, and perhaps criminal charges will be warranted."
2020-06-16 17:06:51,Do trump followers who are going to attend his rally and sign a waiver need any more evidence that he only cares about himself and they are nothing more than disposable props to feed his narcissistic ego? It‚Äôs simply mind blowing.
2020-06-16 17:08:42,"If we needed yet another example of Trump‚Äôs disdain for the welfare of Americans we just got it. 
Holding a rally in these times is a sign of arrogance, ignorance and stupidity. 
Making people sign a waiver to protect himself from the health disaster that will surely result is a sign of an evil savage. 
I can‚Äôt imagine anyone so foolish to actually go and sign."

2020-06-16 17:17:38,"We are seeing the symptoms of Trumpmania. Sufferers throw caution to the wind to spend time in a packed arena willing to breath in aerosolized virus. The most severely stricken will not wear masks, use hand sanitizer nor socially distance while deluding themselves that Covid19 is a hoax. The main sufferer, Trump after whom Trumpmania was named, believes that his daily test for the virus somehow protects him from contracting Covid19. Tune in four weeks from now to see how Trumpmania has raised the curve. Will Trump finally contract Covid19?"

2020-06-16 17:30:43,"Free will, and the freedom to choose..  Those individuals who will decide to go to cheer the President should be free to do so, and let them take the consequences. The trouble is the consequences endanger the lives of those who choose to listen to science.   It is conceivable that they also believe that the pandemic is a hoax and a conspiracy, there are not alone in this . As DT often says ""lets see what happens"".
What a grotesque calamity this is turning out to be."
2020-06-16 17:30:53,"These rallies or large gatherings for any cause are dangerous now.  They also generate data on the potential of the virus at the time.  These are cruel experiments, but we should collect data on post-gathering increases in the disease.  Trump and allies should also sign the papers and shake hands with the crowd, juste to participate in the experiment as well."
2020-06-16 17:29:22,"Let the chips lay where they fall.

Hopefully its consequences will stir some reflection why they continue to support him.

As a practical matter, a triage system should give priority to those who did jot attend the event in the event of a massive spike that overwhelms resources. 

Otherwise it is not fair to those who practise self care."
2020-06-16 17:30:13,"Of course this rally should be canceled to prevent Covid-19, and there should be no other large gatherings at this point, political or otherwise. Similarly, the protests are highly irresponsible from a public health standpoint. We are still in the midst of a major global health crisis, and the US is still by far the hardest hit country, both by number of cases and deaths. We must not lose sight of what we still need to do to prevent outbreaks. This may require some more patience and discipline, but we can do this."
2020-06-16 17:18:02,"I'm pleased and optimistic that Republicans are choosing to remove themselves from voting for Trump in November, but saddened that they have chosen suicide-by-virus as the means. This will cause unnecessary hardship for their families, certainly the children, who are not to blame for Trump's evil. Still, it's for the good of the country and all humanity, so I say yes, please, knock yourselves out. More big rallies without masks and in tight quarters, please."
2020-06-16 17:22:55,Let them have their rally. They want to learn the hard way. Don't stop them from learning this important lesson on science.

2020-06-16 17:34:12,"Let them rally. They sign a waiver acknowledging the risks of the virus. Let them assemble. Although, I am not sure why they aren‚Äôt allowed to being their guns to these events? 2A rights and all that."
2020-06-16 17:34:07,The mass protests gave the green light for the rallies and loosened inhibitions generally. So that's one concrete accomplishment.
2020-06-16 17:15:37,"So many of these States and their leadership are such easy pickings for the Trump Administration. They know full well any GOP lead state will roll over and capitulate to any edict, no matter how dangerous."
2020-06-16 17:21:43,It will be like running through a minefield to attend this gathering.   The aftermath will ripple out across the region distributing the virus further and deeper into the surrounding communities.     If Trump would make sure that all those wanting to attend the rally were tested before getting in;then at  least you would know who to avoid.   Keep spinning that cylinder hoping for an empty chamber
2020-06-16 17:21:46,"Ask New Orleans- knowing what you know now of the cost, both financial and in lives- would you still hold Mardi Gras? And that is mostly outdoor, and the age skews slightly older at Trump conventions. 
If ANY other politican, especially a democrat suggested holding a rally like this, there would be outcry. How does Trump continually get away with this? There is still insufficient PPE, N95 masks even staffing! And it's OK for the American public for him to golf and ignore it."

It falls under the heading of ""what goes around comes around"""
2020-06-16 17:22:54,"POTUSDJT: ""No, I don't take any responsibility at all.""

VP Pence states that testing is the problem not Covid-19. If it weren't for the testing, we'd not know who was sick and who died from Covid-19. So no testing is the solution. If you die, it is God's will, not Covid-19.

To participate in the rally, one has to sign a waiver concerning Covid-19.

Isn't it obvious that in the alternative fact land of POTUSDJT, Covid-19 is a Democratic Party plot to discredit him? Why take precautions, when all the Covid-19 reporting is ""fake news?""

How soon will we all be gaslighted into believing that Trump's ""Easter Miracle"" actually came to pass and that the US is free of Covid-19?"
2020-06-16 17:33:55,"I cant think that any other President in the history of this country would be this reckless with the health of the countries citizens for purely political purposes, and frankly, in order to massage his own fragile ego."

2020-06-16 17:38:26,"Is it likely (or even legal) for health officials to be given the names and hometowns of those attending this and other political rallies, in case they spread the virus afterwards?"
2020-06-16 17:41:44,"Much like the protesters and looters I would like the age to be voluntarily capped around 45 and below.  

Besides, the rallies are just as energetic, entertaining, and enjoyable while streaming YouTube."
2020-06-16 17:42:42,"I have given up on trying to protect people from their own stupidity and bad choices. Most people in my state, Iowa, have chosen not to wear face masks and not to socially distance. The number of Covid-19pandemic infections and deaths in Iowa continue to rise. There appears to be no way to convince people to be socially responsible and wear masks or socially distance.

Let the attendees at Trump's Tulsa hate fest do whatever they want to do. They will anyway. Trump will encourage them to unmask and stand close. Let them be the control group that they want to be. Those of us who believe in science will wear masks and socially distance."
2020-06-16 17:17:04,The slightest degree of risk to public health says one thing quite clearly: Do not hold this rally.
2020-06-16 17:18:02,"I'm sure Trump has the best interest of the good people of Tulsa at heart. That's why he's requiring attendees to relinquish their right to hold him responsible for his recklessness. Pheonix, Moblie, get ready!"

2020-06-16 17:42:59,"It's not christian to wish harm on other people, but I cannot imagine how much more evidence people need before they finally reject Donald Trump. He has lied so many times, caused unnecessary risk for people facing the risk of virus, advocated injecting cleaning solutions, bungled the handling of the epidemic, and on and on. One wonders if these rallies are God's way of eliminating the people who will spread this virus.

It's difficult for me to change political parties after 41 years but I cannot in good conscience associate with any one or any party that would condone sending healthy people to an packed arena where they are likely to get sick and infect their families.

This makes absolutely no sense."
2020-06-16 17:27:37,If you gave a party no one would be forced to come. If Trump's supporters want to roll the dice with their health how are going to stop them? If they don't care about the burden they would put on family and services if they got sick how are you going to stop them?I bet  Trump is going to be social distancing himself. It says a lot about Trump's supporters.The fact that Trump is going to have them sign a waiver to attend says how much Trump really loves them. Caveat Emptor!
2020-06-16 17:27:39,I get the sense that there is a significant number of Trump super fans that are happy to risk contracting the virus if it means they could help soothe Trump's massive ego for a few hours.
2020-06-16 17:41:09,"If it weren't for the hardworking and selfless nurses and doctors that would have to treat these potential COVID19 patients (and perhaps get the disease themselves), I'd say let Trump and his followers have at it. 

This rally is a microcosm of Trump's followers and message - complete rejection of science, open racism & total lack of ability to think for themselves.

I'm so ready to move on from this hellish presidency - I just hope our country can be salvaged."

PREDICTION
Ultimately, they're either going to:
1. cancel/ postpone the event and pat themselves on the back for being so cautious, or 
2. move it outdoors, citing the 'unprecedented, historic demand, with ticket requests like no one has ever seen before,' and pat themselves on the back for being so cautious"
2020-06-16 17:40:25,"Prediction: he will refuse to cancel or move it, knowing that no one will call his bluff. He‚Äôll then let someone else cancel it and use that cancellation to keep the cauldron bubbling."
2020-06-16 17:42:51,"I am planning on voting for Trump, but I would not consider attending this rally, any more than I would have considered gathering in large crowds for protests as so many people have done recently and are still doing. Where is the common sense on both sides of the political aisle? I weep for our country."
2020-06-16 17:43:02,"Why are Oklahoma officials ‚Äúpleading‚Äù with the Trump campaign to cancel the Tulsa rally, as if they are powerless. Is it not state and local governments‚Äô prerogative to shut it down in the interest of public health? That‚Äôs what they should do."
2020-06-16 17:44:05,"i don't usually agree or read Paul Krugman often. I know he has large following for a lot of readers of the NYTs. I did see a comment he made a couple weeks ago that i thought was prudent that said, ""Most Americans don't have the will power to fight covic 19."" i agree. We are so spoiled in this country (all Americans, white, black, Asian, everyone) to do what we want when we want. One can say ""Trump shouldn't have these rally's."" But in fairness did anyone tell the protesters they shouldn't protest? In DC alone there was at least 4,000 protesters one weekend and that doesn't even include the rest of the country; it has been 100,000 of people. i am not saying they shouldn't have the right to protest. Give Trump supporters the same right to execute their beliefs. (that said i probay wouldn't attend but i respect the right of those who feel lead to).No one is forcing anyone to go to these events weather it be a Trump rally or a BLM protest.  Both contain risk in regards to Covit 19. Here is what we need to understand about people. They will always follow the depths of their convictions before following the heights of common logic and that is the truth for the left and the right."

2020-06-16 17:45:59,"The more that people try to explain why indoor rallies are superspreader events, the more Trump will dig in.  He's not going to win over a single vote with a rally; the only purpose is to feed his ego.  He does not have one single attribute of a good leader. Not one."
2020-06-16 17:46:25,Why is it that the leadership of Tulsa won‚Äôt step up and cancel the event?  Why not put your constituents first?
2020-06-16 17:46:49,"What is befuddling, and indeed disillusioning, is that Trump's supporters do not yet understand that he cares not one whit about their personal health and safety.  He, abetted by Pence, spin, misguide, and downright lie for self-glorification and adulation.  Here we have a Red state with a city which is showing an uptick of Covid-19.  Tulsa officials are not only warning of exacerbation and further spread but also, to quote, ""pleading"" to cancel the event.   Yet, Trump will not budge, not really.  Even if outdoors, even with masks and hand sanitizer, 20,000 of his supporters put themselves, their loved ones, their community at risk.  I do not wish any harm to come to these folks in Tulsa come this weekend, of course not.  But I do wonder that if there is an exponential spread of this virus one or two weeks from then, will they still believe that their ""president"" walks on water?  And I will await with disgust the hyperbole and untruths that will come from the Oval Office if the worst comes true."
2020-06-16 17:46:57,"Shut it down! This is a life and death issue that could affect thousands, possibly tens or hundreds of thousands of American lives and livelihoods. If this rally seeds need outbreaks that spread exponentially, we are in for another hellish ride and continued massive economic fallout. Why can people not see this?!! The local and state governments need to take control. People need to start saying NO to Trump or invoke the  25th Amendment. Lives are at stake."
2020-06-16 17:48:03,"Will Mr Trump finally slam into the wall of truth he has managed to evade all this time? A pity he seems intent on taking his base down with him, but they seem to be willing lemmings.

Then, in addition to this selfish act of ignorance, our President & Vice President want to pack the BOK Center, when our Coronavirus numbers are already on the rise. Also, Governor Stitt is welcoming these decisions! Unbelievable and very disappointed. 

Will these decisions impact our ability to open our schools in August? 

Only time will tell and yet again just a few examples in how our state is in the race to be in the bottom of every category. Education, incarceration rate, homelessness, etc."

1- not only his free speech rights 
2- but also to deprive would-be attendees of the opportunity to see these qualities and to adjust the arc of their lives so that they may be more like him. 

And why these enormous deprivations? To avoid the chance - which his efforts have already rendered  minuscule - of avoiding the disease the cure to which is so much greater.

A PA Senator insists that PA (in which coronavirus infections have declined) should reopen fully. He claims that PA has many more hospital beds available than are needed for all patients, in part because prospective hospital-goers have deferred elective surgery in far larger numbers than hospitalized coronavirus patients (most coronavirus patients stay home). 

Some elective surgery is very important. Should these prospective hospital-goers be encouraged to have it done if PA hospitals can accommodate them? 

Or is this PA Senator lying?"

I'd like to see Pence file a judicial argument like that in a ""right to die"" case.  Ha.  Never will happen.  Tulsa officials should require the two venues to remove seats so as to force safe distancing, keep a running count of those entering and lock the doors when each venue is at safe capacity."

2020-06-16 17:45:11,"Trump followers are suspicious and contrarian, fed a steady diet of Internet Rumor and Faux News or Fox News, whichever comes first.  Hence, when an informed person warns them of a risk they suspect another reason, a conspiracy to prevent thronging at the feet of the Dear Leader, as it were. 

The more they are warned the less they believe.  And its likely they will scoff and sign the waiver of suit without reading it.  Trusting souls.

Here we are in the Age of Russian ""Propogranda,"" the Internet and vanity in the national leadership the likes of which went out of style in the US centuries ago. 

As for the protesters, what are they thinking?  This virus does not run away from crowds."
2020-06-16 17:49:46,"Trump will cave on this because the heat in the kitchen is lethally hot.

As respiratory virus cloud will cross-contaminate hundreds of attendees and distribute the pathogen far and wide.

All of these individuals will consume expensive services with other people footing the bill. If participants sign a waiver that they won't sue the President if they catch the virus, how about agreeing to forego medical treatment when they get sick?

As we walked alongside the river I noticed there were no caution signs alerting us not to walk into the river. I pointed this out to the guide and told her that in America there would be warning signs everywhere advising people not to venture into the water. I asked why there were none there. 

She looked at me somewhat incredulously and said ""Here people have the common sense not to venture into that water."" Apparently in our country people do not have the common sense to avoid that arena."
2020-06-16 17:16:02,"It's time for state, and especially local governments to say ""Fine!  We've given you our best advice, showed you the figures, made our concerns clear.  Now, you must sign a waiver taking full responsibility for infections coming from your event, as well as increased costs for health care.  Or you don't get to use our venue.""  

That official is correct.  This is a train wreck in progress and we're all watching.  There are multiple people who can put the breaks on.  If not, they should be held responsible for the damages and deaths."
2020-06-16 17:47:52,"If state and local politicians do not have the fortitude to enforce safety measures like wearing masks and distancing, or using their healthcodes to shut down an obviously dangerous event, then front-line healthcare workers should start organizing and consider a work slow-down or sick-out to make it clear to the public/politicians that they are not going to be take for granted and are willing to take action to protect themselves and their families."

The gap between what they present and the reality of what is happening to real people, real citizens, is stunning.

Also, I don‚Äôt understand where these supporters come from. When a leader ignores the coming of an infectious disease, takes no responsibility for its spread, which destroys the economy, how can anyone celebrate that person.

I guess he is a war time president, but he has declared war on the U.S. and it appears he is winning. Very disheartening."

At any rally, people yell and scream and get pushed together, they exchange water bottles for example, the same with signs and things sold at these events they pass through many hands.
Local officials there are rightly concerned that a large group of about 19,000 or so is the perfect place for COVID-19 to spread. All it takes is one infected person to start the  'perfect storm' started.

I have repeatedly there after in my comments stated ""Fresh air an a balanced diet with robust intake of protein as your best ally"" When there was fear mongering by some ignorant people in the press and the main stream said that the peaceful protesters would spread COVID-19 and increase the confirmed positive cases, I said ""the outdoor peaceful protests by adults under 55 wearing masks will NOT result in spread of COVID-19 or deaths of protesters"". I have been to Tulsa, OK in last century but I have not examined the venue where the Trump rally is going to be held but if the roof is retractable with plenty of fresh air, temp. check and only those wearing a mask and leaving behind their guns are allowed in the it will not be a matter of life and death but a matter of Trump being able to make his case why he be re-elected."

He was, at the time, a young boy, and his father ran a dry-goods store on or near Black Wall Street in the prosperous section of the town.  They were in their house when the riot began.  Whites were chasing down blacks and murdering them, setting fire to the entire town.  It was a conflagration.  There were a few white folks living in the Black part of Tulsa, mostly Jews and other minorities.  My patient remembered crying and cowering in the basement of their house as it was set fire to.  Somehow they managed to escape, probably saved, ultimately, by the color of their skin.  The 'before' and 'after' pictures were reminiscent of the Cologne firestorm in WW2.  He went on to study geology at Harvard, and had a distinguished career in the USA and latterly in Canada.  But the trauma haunted him his entire life."

One could say that anyone attending would deserve no better than to get sick- but the problem is, when they go back to their communities which will likely be in Phase 2 or 3) they will infect other people.

2020-06-16 19:17:26,"What percentage of attendees will use masks? I'd put my money on 6%.

It's not that Trump's supporters think they are rolling the dice with their health by attending his rallies. They believe Covid is no different from the flu. They believe it's a hoax. They believe it's a liberal conspiracy to get trump out of the white house. Unfortunately, the only thing that will convince them of the danger of Covid is if they, or someone close to them, gets it and dies. And that means a lot of other people will get it and die, also. 

Such a shame, and so unnecessary."
2020-06-16 18:34:59,Funny that Trump rallies can cause an increase in virus numbers but protests don‚Äôt seem to carry the same risks.  Ridiculous.  Hope all these commenters voiced the same concerns a few weeks ago.
2020-06-16 19:00:24,"Trump may insist that attendees sign a waiver so they cannot sue Trump, BUT Pence is peddling Fake Fox News that the increase in Corvid cases is because of greater testing, which is absolutely false given the reopening of the State, and every attendee should be told they should sue Fox, Ingraham & Pence if they catch the virus. All defendants are guilty of gross negligence, if not criminal negligence putting lives at risk."
2020-06-16 18:34:24,"If Trump and Pence could care less about the health of these people volunteering to attend this super-spreader event, why is Gov. Stitt rolling over on this? Isn't he responsible for the health of his constituents? Gov. Cooper in North Carolina appreciated the risk of holding the Convention there and stuck to his guns. Since there is really no upside to this, why does it even have to be an issue? Of course, we all know why. We have a narcissist as president, who cares only about how many bodies he can lure to this event so he can brag about it later."

How sad that the leader of the coronavirus task force is either lying about Oklahoma's numbers or is ignorant of the recent trends in the state.  It is unconscionable that both Mr. Pence and the Oklahoma governor are ignoring common sense in order to assuage Mr. Trump's ego."

Another commenter aptly describes him as an ‚Äúincompetent and amoral megalomaniac.‚Äù  But what about Pence and the president‚Äôs apologists in the Republican Party?

It's our hospitals that are in danger of being overwhelmed, our citizens who are placed at risk--this catastrophe of a rally will endanger the entire region, not only the rabid supporters who pack the BOK arena. 

And that's in addition to the egregious race baiting of staging a rally in the place where one of the worst race massacres in US history occurred 99 years ago. Worst place, worst time for this event to take place."

Six month worth of effort not only blown away. Six months effort about to begin again because the President is homicidal.

You do realize this rally is all about Trump's reelection strategy, right? I don't mean stirring up his base either. He's setting off a coronavirus bomb intentionally. He saw what happened Georgia. The new Covid wave will disproportionately suppress Democratic voters. That's what this is about."
2020-06-16 19:43:13,"The campaign will call off the rally, and find a way to blame the Democrats. The current President is not a courageous man -- witness his high security walk to church in order to play tough guy bible-holder for the cameras -- and unless they can figure out how to position him in a sanitised air space within that giant viral playground, he won't be see within ten miles of Tulsa."

Those who encouraged the BLM protesters, largely members from one party, in a sense, made the Trump rally possible.

The Trump campaign, as well as many Americans, see as hypocrisy, the criticism of the planned Trump rally by some of the same people who endorsed the BLM protests."
2020-06-16 20:01:56,"Trump doesn't care, nor will he ever care about anything or anybody other than himself.  

Furthermore, his campaign does not understand that requiring rally participants to waive their rights to sue if they fall ill with Covid-19 is a waste of time.  It's well-established that personal injury hold harmless waivers are not worth the paper they are printed on as plaintiff lawyers are experts at quickly rendering them null and void.  

Around July 4th, we will start to see rally goers falling ill and overwhelming health care systems.  It's how Covid-19 rolls."

2020-06-16 20:36:56,"Surely The New York Times realizes that its almost invisible reporting about the dangers of hundreds of thousands of people marching elbow to elbow, coast to coast in protest over the death of George Floyd renders sounding the alarm over this Trump rally moot. You can‚Äôt cheer and encourage the Covid-spreading marches, and then be expected to be taken seriously when you stridently argue against gatherings of a different political stripe."
2020-06-16 20:56:33,"Perhaps an obvious question, but shouldn't the Trump campaign be required to obtain a permit for such a large event? Arenas this size, around the country, are not yet reopened for sporting events of this scale, so why doesn't Tulsa simply refuse such a permit? Or if they did give them one, revoke it. And if a permit isn't currently required, but officials feel it is a public health risk, simply say, ""No"". The Republican Party is not the Federal Government. They cannot overrule a local or state government's decision not to allow an indoor gathering which they see as a danger to the public."
2020-06-16 18:02:46,They should do us all a favor and let Trump hold the event as planned.  It'll be a practical lesson in science vs. blind faith in a failed leader.

For a science-challenged president and his equally foolish vice pesident to invite the virus to infect enthusiastic voters in a venue tailor made to be a super-spreading event is the height of arrogance and denial. All the release-of-liability papers in the world will not save Trump from the way this plays out when tracers chase the virus over the next month out of Oklahoma and all over the US - maybe even to DC."
2020-06-16 19:29:29,This president is only interested in the lives of those who vote for him. when that is done the interest disappears. Until the next election. Then there must be a meeting at all costs. How infinitely sad and a special form of senseless violence.

Back in the day, wearing a mask would be called ‚Äúcommon courtesy.‚Äù A small gesture intended to keep those around one a bit healthier. 

Akin to covering one‚Äôs mouth during a cough or sneeze. Or washing one‚Äôs hands after using the bathroom. Or not ‚Äúdouble dipping‚Äù in the bean dip, guacamole, or salsa. Or calling in sick, or at least advising those around one that you‚Äôre sick or not feeling well (‚Äúkeep your distance,‚Äù aka: social distancing). Not sharing toiletry items (combs, toothbrushes, handkerchiefs, etc...). And other small acts. 

These were the things my mother taught me as being polite and considerate of others. They cost nothing other than a moment of time, and are easy to do. Why wouldn‚Äôt one take the little bit of effort to try to help others stay healthy? 

Now, common courtesy (and, in trumpsville, common sense) is out the window. Everything, even the smallest of regards for our fellow human beings, is a political statement. 

A sad commentary on ourselves. And our society."
2020-06-16 19:28:20,Let this play out.  These people won't listen to reason or evidence.  Their delusions have to be popped with the experience of hard reality.  Their emperor with no clothes has to be discredited.
2020-06-16 19:32:21,"Imagine actually signing a waiver so the President and Republican Party cannot be held responsible if you catch a disease they say: (1) is a hoax and does not exist, (2) has run its course, or (3) isn't as bad as all that. 

It is exactly this type of cognitive dissonance that allow people who believe they hold superior religious values to support a man like Trump. 

Truly Orwellian."
2020-06-16 19:40:19,I believe the waivers Mr Trump is requiring attendees to sign could be argued as an ‚Äúintent to deceive‚Äù in a future fraud case.
2020-06-16 18:41:18,The President is going through withdrawal and is in need of a big fix. He craves a gathering of cheering devotees crammed to the rafters showering him with adoration and praise. He longs for the call and response as he delivers another wandering riff about how lucky they are to have one such as him to carry their mantle. The chosen one will have the chosen few arranged neatly behind him for the cameras. When it's over the masses will depart spreading out across the land. The President not yet sated will cast his eye to the next venue. One is too many and 10 is not enough.

If gross negligence is established, the click-through waiver on the campaign website will not protect them from lawsuits."
2020-06-16 18:02:25,Pence is outright lying about the growth in cases and encouraging state officials to do the same.
2020-06-16 19:44:31,"Perfect chance to study how the virus spreads in an almost perfect laboratory setting with many volunteers.  The Trump Campaign will have all the names and addresses of people in attendance.   Covid spread vectors can be traced more easily.

In a week or two, go back and sample who is sick and who is not sick.   Trump is doing us a great service."
2020-06-16 18:04:53,"Tulsa will reap what it sows. Trump moved the RNC to Jacksonville FL from NC because NC said the RNC must abide by Covid19 parameters. Tulsa has the option to say no to hosting the event - if the health of citizens has any standing against the states political leanings, it will be cancelled."
2020-06-16 18:24:54,"Okay, so the attendees waive their right to sue. But what about the people who are later infected *by* the attendees? They haven't signed any releases. It seems to me they would have grounds to sue. 

Yes, you'd have to establish that a given victim was in fact infected by a given attendee. But there will certainly be people for whom the causal chain can in fact be proven, or at any rate strongly inferred enough to persuade a jury."
2020-06-16 19:11:55,"I thought Trump turned the responsibility of this pandemic over to the Governor's? Now, Trump has the audacity to hold large-crowd campaign rallies in any state he wants and walk away from the damage."
2020-06-16 19:15:13,I just hope that someone sues the GOP party for sponsoring an event like this.   Courts should throw out the liability waiver since Trump supporters are not capable of making decisions like this without a lawyer present to explain what the writing says.

I don't think anyone thought the train would be carrying a biological weapon either. That's what we're talking about here. The President has ordered a biological attack on US citizens.

I don't understand why Tulsa city, county, state officials don't simply shut the event down though. Declare an emergency. Pass an ordinance limiting event sizes. Whatever. The citizens of Tulsa are at serious risk of disease and death. Why do we have a government if officials can't pull the plug a convention center event?

Again, think of the rally as biological warfare. What would homeland security do if they got word terrorists were planning to launch an attack on a large scale event? I think we'd see more response than the lament of epidemiologists everywhere. What was the ""War on Terror"" even about if we can't shutdown a domestic terrorist threat with full foreknowledge of the attack?"

2020-06-16 19:17:17,"First the obvious--this hydrochloroquine-infused buffoon would LOVE Tulsa or State Representatives to do take the sane,  medically-prescribed path and cancel the event.  I can hear Hanratty and his ilk rambling on about that for weeks. They wouldn't need shiny objects to distract people from the polling or economic numbers--like fantasy-based murder conspiracies. The wiser course is to remind all about the likelihood of transmission by symptomless attendees at such events (and their subsequent contacts), and to formally advise Trump's cash-rich campaign that they must post a bond commensurate with any anticipated uptick in the frontline medical costs any state or region that had rally attendees, or people who willingly came into contact with same. 

Call it a second wave or an extension of the first wave of infections but I pity the innocents in your country, secure in the knowledge that our borders will remain sealed and our US homes sold, even at a Covid-19 loss."

Of course, each and everyone of those people are forced to sign a waiver that they can‚Äôt sue him if and when they contract the virus. That, in itself, tells you everything you need to know about Trump and his administration‚Äôs motivations."
2020-06-16 19:09:07,"Such outrage over a political rally. Where was this outrage when thousands of protesters marched shoulder to shoulder, without masks? If that behavior was acceptable then, this rally should be acceptable now."
2020-06-16 19:12:22,"What I don‚Äôt understand is why officials in city or state government are even allowing this in the first place. They have the power to cancel this event, as does ASM Global, who runs the BOK Center.

As tens of thousands more die, week after week, and Trump talks of ""COVID-shaming,"" are we just lemmings? I mean, what is going on? 

Are we at the mercy of this megalomanic? How is it that there is no one in a position of power who can, or will, or cares enough to SAVE AMERICAN LIVES.

And providing masks is one thing, but will they require them to be worn the entire time? 
This is a medical disaster we all see coming. I can‚Äôt believe they can‚Äôt shut it down or at least move it outdoors. I guess we just mark our calendars for 14-days out and prepare our ‚Äúwe told ya so‚Äù statements."

The problem is where these people are allowed to go after this rally. Were there a way to enforce post-rally quarantines for the incubation period, protecting everyone else from contracting disease spread during this rally, then this should be acceptable.

Frankly, Trump supporters have given up their basic human decency. Sacrificing two weeks after a rally isn't a bigger ask."

Any doubts about Trump's callous selfishness are erased by the insistence that people sign a waiver not to sue if they get Covid-19 at the rally. Where is the empathy? Where is the compassion? The fact that over 40 per cent of eligible voters approve of Trump's performance is a powerful statement about how far America has fallen."
2020-06-16 18:34:25,"Trump and his thousands of volunteers will enable medical science to develop a better understanding of how the virus is transmitted in enclosed spaces.

One huge difference: no one person could have stopped the protests.  They grew organically in hundreds of cities, sparked by the killing of George Floyd. 

OTOH, deciding to hold the rally was a choice made by one person, whose actual job is to keep the country safe."
2020-06-16 18:36:47,"If the local officials and public health experts are really concerned about the risk to public health from holding a large indoor rally, why are they allowing it to go ahead?  Shades of Susan Collins and her ""concern.""

They're all very ""concerned.""  Fine, they're right to be concerned.  And what does their concern lead them to do to protect the public?  Crickets ...

If those officials aren't going to do anything to protect the public they're sworn to serve, they should be removed from their jobs and replaced by people who will actually do the jobs.

Also, Trump may be getting people to sign waivers so they can't sue him if they get coronavirus, but what liability do local officials have?  If they allow this rally to go ahead, do they not share liability if it then becomes a super spreader event?"
2020-06-16 18:46:07,"Remember in April when Trump stated: 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be up to the states to use that capability [for testing].  The states have local points where they can go and the governor can call the mayors and the mayors can call representatives and everything is perfect and that‚Äôs the way it should work and always should work,‚Äù Trump said.

He's using  the same playbook: I'll make a mess, but you'll have to clean it up."
2020-06-16 19:59:54,"The rally should go ahead as planned, unimpeded.  And I don't say that out of any ill will towards Trump supporters--this is what they want and what Trump wants. They were the ones screaming in state capitols to re-open, to free them from ""regulation.""  So give them their day, and don't try and stop them, which would only add more conviction to their belief. If they spark a Coronavirus outbreak as a result, they will deal with it. And it will be a blessing to the rest of us, sending a message to all Trump supporters about the validity of their leader's ""LIBERATE"" tweets."
2020-06-16 18:27:34,"This is where the president's experience in the business world comes into play.  He can assure his supporters that everything will be fine, while at the same time having them sign a lie-ability waiver, just in case."
2020-06-16 18:47:46,"There were TRUMP boat parades all over FL last weekend. Thousands of people on the water and lining the ICW cheering. The press barely gave it any attention. 
This is what Trump does to counter the day to day barrage of criticisms. It is how he fights and his supporters like that about him...they also love that energy.
His 2020 rallies will set records never seen before as far as crowd size political rallies go.(and we saw how the press constantly played that down in 2016) . This is the way Trumpers react in a full-blown revolution. The left has their way. On Nov 3, we will see how that fares,,,a side to side clear, stark choice on what we want as a country."
2020-06-16 18:16:47,"Is a trump rally really necessary for him?
He is the incumbent.
He says he leads in the polls.
So why the rally even?
I think it's because he wants to take back control of the daily soap opera, take away from the virus and also he is shaky in the polls and wants to build momentum.
I just hope that people who didn't attend the rally don't catch it from those who did, especially those with old people at home.
Is the chance of that really worth going to a rally or a movie or a concert or sporting event?
Why can't those wait a while.  What's the rush?"
2020-06-16 19:00:09,"Attendee waiver not withstanding, anyone who is infected at second hand by an attendee of this ""super spreader"" might have a plausible argument that the campaign has harmed them. Hard to prove a connection conclusively, but the payout could be huge. Campaign has very deep pockets."
2020-06-16 19:55:39,"There is a substantial group of Americans who not only don't believe experts but have contempt for everything they say and obdurate defiance against their recommendations.  They tend to be poor, high-school educated and conservative.  If you wanted to find one, Oklahoma would be a good place to look.

They'll go to Trump's rally not just for the excitement but to demonstrate their own defiance against experts and to listen to their leader who expresses the same defiance."
2020-06-16 18:29:47,"There is a level of devotion to Trump in Oklahoma that can't be measured in the Times.  These are the followers and their children of the faith healer evangelist Oral Roberts whose ministry started there, to whom they were hugely devoted  while he became enormously successful.  It is clear that the devotion to Trump will not stop followers from taking the risk and not stop him from exploiting their devotion.   Devotion is a powerful human emotion which leads people in various directions including, sometimes, martyrdom."

2020-06-16 19:57:32,"Let me see if I understand this correctly: two weeks prior to an outdoor commencement that was designed with social distancing, Trump was so concerned that 1,107 West Point cadets were divided into four groups with strict prohibitions against intermingling.  

But he isn't concerned about packing an indoor arena with 20 times as many people.  (Wanna bet there's a plastic partition between the masses and him?)

I don‚Äôt understand why anyone would put her/himself in the same room with the very person who is trying to take their health insurance away -- at the time when they will need it the most."

And oh yes, also no surprise that he chose his first rally post COVID and post national protests against police brutality and racism to be held in Tulsa, a city where hundreds of African Americans were murdered in 1921 by white mobs.
   Disgusting doesn‚Äôt even begin to cover it. Going to go out on a limb and predict more violence from many quarters this weekend. And Trump will be triumphant about it."

Meanwhile, far-right Governor Stitt has invited Trump to tour Greenwood, the Black neighborhood that was razed during the white massacre of Black people there; Greenwood is mere blocks from the rally site, still a Black neighborhood. If you understand the militias and boogaloo sorts looking for trouble, you may be sure it will come Saturday. And the Governor is bizarrely setting it up with that tour.

Please, please, from the moment you leave the venue, rigorously self isolate for three weeks and then get tested before you go out among people. That way you will infect fewer innocent people."

And third, even if it isn't exactly a hoax, they won't wear masks and they will not social distance because that's what democrat liberal socialist terrorists do.

So, let them gather in their big greatness. They signed away their right to sue trump if they are infected even though it's a hoax.

I wish they'd sign away their right to hospitalization and attendant costs to all of the rest of us since many of them probably don't have healthcare."
2020-06-16 21:15:17,"The Governor of Oklahoma, Kevin Stitt, should have told President Trump that Oklahoma would like the jobs and would love to help out, but unfortunately, the health of the people of Oklahoma must come first.  Sorry, no can do.  Just like the Govenor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper.  But unfortunately, Kevin Stitt lacks fortitude.  

Oh, right!  I forgot!  Party first and then the taxpaying  constituents."
2020-06-16 21:23:04,"Anyone who attends such an event deserves what they get. Sadly, the rest of the community does not deserve what attendees get. I do think trump will call it off at the last minute. After all, chaos is the ultimate mission and that already has been accomplished."
2020-06-16 21:43:08,"Given Trump's past history with campaign events, I think Oklahoma should get all money up front.  That would include money for the medical emergencies that will occur, for health workers, for first responders, for the venue, for its staff, and for all who become ill due to this reckless event.  They should also prepay funeral expenses for those who die.

A liability waiver does not cover the expenses of a huge spike in Covid 19 that will impact not just Oklahoma, but those driving in from out of state.

So danger pay up front would be one measure.  

Wouldn't you know that Trump who usually lives in a bubble only ventures out at the risk of others' lives?

He that rants and flies away may live to rant another day.  Not so his audience."
2020-06-16 21:57:10,"This rally will be one for the history books and not in a good way.

First there was Typhoid Mary and now we have Covid Donald."

2020-06-17 00:05:20,"This is not about anything that will benefit the country. On the contrary.  It is a political campaign rally, held indoors, with no rules about social distancing or masks, and it is likely to cause Tulsa to see a local surge in infections, plus the rest of the country will have attendees infected with the virus carrying it to their home cities.

As if we needed further evidence of Trump's stubborn, self-centered, irresponsible approach to the presidency."

Also alcohol and cannabis‚Ä¶your usual hunker down and ride it out supplies.  They want to be able to stay in or escape easily should things go south. This would include riots and clashes-guns at the ready in that neck of the woods, , people milling about in their front yards with no masks looking for a place to park and a spike in contagion. Lots of people from neighboring states are expected and no one is certain of what behaviors will be like given the polarization of attitudes. People do expect mass contempt for those ""sissy masks "" though. They are not happy to envision groups of shouting partisans with no masks roaming the streets and shouting, assembling inside and shouting, mobbing restaurants and hotels and breathing on everyone. They have said that there are places to gather outside but it is 94 or 95 degrees at present. Even the most passionate Trump fans will demand to be air conditioned. Loyalty only goes so far in these modern times.  As a person who grew up in un air conditioned S Texas in the old days I have to tell you that Americans have become unable to endure climate hardship. It is very irresponsible to hold this rally now. But as the scientists have said here in the comments  and in the article it is a goldmine for gathering data. To quote a certain someone : "" So sad ""."

I can foresee him continuing to campaign whether he wins or loses in November. God help us if he wins!"
2020-06-16 22:42:10,"What a shame if Trump's rally is altered or cancelled. I sincerely wanted to see what would happen if hundreds of over 60s cheering in an enclosed space, without the masks they so disdain, were allowed their ""freedom"" to behave in such a manner. 

Republicans have shamed and disparaged the rest of us who think that mask wearing, social distancing and shut downs are prudent to keep us alive, so I'd like to see if their way of ignoring this virus is a better way.  I really would. 

Maybe  Trump supporters are right and the virus is no big deal, maybe they are wrong. But I was really looking forward to seeing the results of this grand experiment."
2020-06-17 00:21:53,"With this rally, the party of Trump should officially be renamed the party of we don‚Äôt care about anyone else.

I know this doesn‚Äôt fit into Trump‚Äôs narrative and I suspect Fox News ignored it too. But you can read about it in any real news outlet.

They gleefully reported that 800,000 people had registered for Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally‚Äîlater that estimate was increased to one million. 

I signed up for the Tulsa rally myself‚Äîalong with six imaginary friends‚Äîwithout any intention of actually attending. It was my way of hoping for empty seats‚Äîa small protest against a president who has no regard for my health and the health of my state.

I‚Äôve learned since that mine is only one of thousands (and, I hope, hundreds of thousands) of NO SHOW rally registrations. May I suggest that before Trump and the GOP boast about MAGA crowd support, they consider that ANYONE can go online, register, and be a NO SHOW for their political circus‚Äîincluding angry Democrats!"

""It is likely to cause Tulsa to see a local surge in infections, plus the rest of the country will have attendees infected with the virus carrying it to their home cities.""

Commenters said the same thing about the ""spring break"" college kids in Florida. That turned out not to be accurate, and Florida today is way below average in coronavirus infections or deaths. 

Will OK be different?"
2020-06-17 03:30:13,"Apparently this all out concern by Tulsa County for stopping covid-19 is pretty new founded. As of June 16, 2020 reporting by the county, they have received revenue of $113,690,800 for covid-19 and have only spent $1,265,307 in expenses to address the virus concerns. $1,067,925 of which was spent on data processing equipment supposedly related to the virus, meaning that out of 113 million dollars they have spent less than 200 thousand addressing the virus itself. So why such concern about something they have heretofore spent so little money and attention on now that Trump wants to hold a rally?  And they want us to believe it's not political!"
2020-06-17 07:00:22,"I hope the indoor venue in Tulsa is charging the Trump campaign enough to pay for workers in hazmat suits to sanitize the arena after this horror show is completed. Maybe add on a few extra bucks to pay for lawsuits from sick arena employees. And since Trump is known for stiffing cities for the costs of these rallies, insist on a cashiers check for the full amount a day in advance.  

Trump will cancel in a heartbeat."
2020-06-17 09:44:10,"Pence said: ""the right to peacefully assemble, is enshrined in the First Amendment of the Constitution"" - Interesting that he remembers this in the context of Trump's rallies but somehow forgot about it when people peacefully assembled in front to the WH and were tear gassed and shot at with rubber bullets by police and the national guard, not to mention military without insignia or name tags, a'la Putin's 'little green men' in Crimea. It seems that for trumpists only people they like have the right to peacefully assemble. A surprising new interpretation of the first amendment."

Hey, stop giving Trump 24/7 promotion of his campaign stunts. Or at least make him pay for air time/page space. All I see and hear is 24/7 warnings about the possible result. Enough!
Any intelligent person has heard the drill about masks, distance, avoiding crowds and super transmission in enclosed spaces for three months now. WE GOT IT! One or two announcement articles about this stunt is plenty. Quoting the experts' horror about this feeding frenzy two times is enough. 
None of us who trust in Fauci hang with the MAGA crowd, so we are safe. If we see someone with a MAGA Oklahoma button or hat in the office or on the street, secure your mask, move to the other side of the room or street, and hold your breath until the threat passes."

They could care less who they infect as long as they can be entertained by Trump's circus act. Perhaps the only thing that will stop this blatant disregard for their fellow citizens is if Trump and Pence get this virus and must quarantine?
2020-06-17 11:28:19,"The longer people linger in a contaminated area, the more virus particles they can inhale, and Mr. Trump‚Äôs political speeches often last more than an hour.

‚ÄúThat virus, I guarantee you, will be present at the event ‚Äî someone will bring it,‚Äù said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ‚ÄúThe Covid virus knows no political affiliation. What it does love is large groups, indoors, close to each other for prolonged periods of time chanting and yelling.‚Äù

Good.  May Trump's speech be long and the arena packed."
2020-06-17 05:23:55,Trump will cancel the rally..... when he realizes the arena will only be half full.
2020-06-17 07:19:48,"Some weeks ago the mayor of Las Vegas, Carolyn Goodman, offered up Las Vegas as a human petri dish suggesting casino workers could be a COVID-19 'control group'.  Well, the mayor got her wish, as the Strip is largely open now. The Oklahoma rally will serve as a new control group, this time on the behest of the President of the United States. Meanwhile other countries around the word make sincere efforts to contain this virus. It boggles the mind."
2020-06-17 12:11:12,"All this is totally unnecessary.  Even holding a convention is a smack at the lives of everyone in the area.  Apparently being with a supportive crowd is more important than American lives.  Trump must have his ego massaged.  We know the result of the convention  Trump/Pence ticket will run in November.  The rest is just a party designed by its very nature to kill people.  Oklahoma will see the harshest result, and then the people in all the other states who will have delegates coming home with whatever they caught at the convention.  If the Democrats were doing this, I would say the same thing.  This President is not governing in every ones best interest.  So go ahead and have the convention and murder the elderly and those with less than stellar health.  He will claim after the death numbers are tallied, ""It's not my fault!"" 40% of the nation will agree. We are living in the darkest days of American history."
2020-06-17 06:22:55,"I believe that many Trump followers follow ‚Äúnews‚Äù media that tells those consuming it that COVID is overstated, a hoax, not a big deal, over. Take your pick. If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre told day after day and you live somewhere that is only recently hit, that‚Äôs what you believe. 99 people tested positive after a Pentecostal Church service here in Oregon even though these ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù lovers were not allowed to do so. I will need to stay in my place longer because too many people believe these lies or are suffering from magical thinking. When I see protesters, OTOH, most are masked.

Everything Mr. Trump does, anything Mr, Trump does, only means he is front and center in all media, every day and night. That is his purpose.

Early on in Mr. Trump‚Äôs presidency, websites, podcasts, newspaper reports, even magazines, reported, discussed, analyzed, investigated, even pontificated upon, every appearance of Mr. Trump or his minions. 

How many media hours, these past three-and-a-half trumpyears, were spent on this one individual? How many media hours were spent on substantive news about what this Administration has been doing with our Government... behind our and Mr. Trump‚Äôs back?

The Medium is the Message.

Mr Trump is the Medium. Mr. Trump is a Medium made up of all the media in sight or hearing. His, Shakespeare might say, ‚Äúis a tale told by an idiot; full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.‚Äù 

If Jesus H. Christ, Himself, were to return in a Second Coming, it is doubtful He would be able to get this much absolute publicity! 

So, change the channel, turn the page, get back to your life. If you want the news, learn how to research what is important to you... and do something.

All these demonstrations and protests aren‚Äôt about Mr. Trump, they‚Äôre about Justice. Millions of people, the World itself, is marching for Justice. Mr. Trump is just marching in place, banging a drum, waving his hands, hypnotizing all who gaze."
2020-06-17 08:02:19,"‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just nothing good about this, and particularly in an enclosed arena,‚Äù said Karen Keith, a Tulsa County commissioner who oversees the area where the rally is supposed to take place. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want people to lose a parent.

But ... but ... but, this is OKLAHOMA!  Trump territory!  Land of the free and the brave!  Sooners!  Cowboys!

We all know that Covid-19 is a ""Chinese hoax,"" right? (Or is it a ""Democrat hoax""? I get confused.)

We know that Covid-19 is going to ""magically disappear in April,"" right? (but which year was that again? I forget.) 

We know that ""‚ÄúIf we stop testing right now, we‚Äôd have very few cases, if any,‚Äù according Donald Trump. (or was that according to the Dear Leader or Der Fuehrer.  I forget.)

""What, me worry?"" Alfred E. Newman had it 100% correct. (or was that ""Spy vs. Spy""?  I forget.)

2020-06-17 11:09:05,"Herr Trump only cares about one thing, himself.  After so long a period of public negativity, he is in desperate need of an ego boost that only a crowd of his blindly obedient lemmings can provide.  Whether they get sick and die is no matter to him or even his lemmings.  His lemmings are all willing to follow him to the death if need be, which is even sadder than Herr Trump himself."

2020-06-17 11:55:01,"Is his new campaign slogan, ""Just Let Em Die, Trump 2020""?

Trump is a classic sociopath, of the corporate CEO variety.  He is gratifying his own sick need for adulation at the expense of his own supporters.   He will kill his victims and will feel no remorse for doing it.  

He's like a mad man in a horror film."
2020-06-17 11:59:26,"Another way to look at this is the Elite has blown its credibility with its hypocritcal zig-zagging. First, they were threatening to arrest religious Jews in New York who had a small gathering. Terrible! They shouted.  Then, massive Left-wing protests.  Awesome! They re-assured us. Now, Right-win (peaceful) rallies are dangerous, they warn. Masks are bad! No, they're good! Hand-washing is essential! Nope, now it's it's not. Beyond Coronavirus and BLM, we are seeing the total and utter bankruptcy of our country's technocracy.

Two of my best clients were Tulsa companies. They were concerned about health care costs and they were proactive.

One of my clients even arranged for me to present to a meeting with the Tulsa Chamber of Commerce.

I learned, from them, a deep respect for businesses in Tulsa.

I am now retired but I believe that Tulsa businesses must be horrified by the Trump Rally threat to health care costs in Tulsa.

Instead of poisoned punch Trump‚Äôs followers will get a good dose of Covid 19, which is OK as long as the dear leader gets energized and has the needed photo op for his re-election campaign. To quote Sun Tzu on the Art of War - ‚ÄúThe general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.‚Äù Trump as ‚Äúthe take no responsibility‚Äù President, is not a General and not even a Private, just a self-described ‚Äúwartime‚Äù and now ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù president who dodged the draft five times.

The protesters and rioters, by the thousands- all over the Country, cannot spread the virus, but a Trump rally is out of the question. The protesters who rallied at Governors' mansions because they wanted to go back to work so they could support their families, spread the virus, but the protesters and rioters trying to make a political statement, while holding hands, walking shoulder to shoulder and swapping sweat, are encouraged by the Dems and the CNN's of the world. In Virginia, D. Gov. Northam is concerned about hoards of people standing in line, waiting for seats in restaurants, while every day and night, for weeks now, protesters have been all over Richmond, Virginia-by the thousands- protesting and rioting, tearing down statues, destroying public and private property, while the police stand down. In Virginia 4% of people who had the flu during the 2019/20 flu season, died from the flu. So far, only .3% (point 3%) have died from the coronavirus. It is sad that anyone has to die, but nothing is ever shut down for the flu, and the percentages, certainly in Virginia, are scant compared to the flu. As for masks, I saw a post the other day that said, ""We can pass gas through a pair of jeans, and smell it, so how does a mask work to protect us""? (Sorry). This virus is just a means for the Dems to keep this Country shut down. The protests and the virus keep Biden in his basement, and Trump rallies shut down. How convenient."

Tulsa May be a large city, Tulsa May have dangerous area, but Tulsa is a community that cares about its neighbors. 
Many of my friends are terrified about this huge gathering. These are nurses and other medical professionals in Tulsa. This is going to be a super spreader and Tulsa will have to pay for it.

However, in this country, Florida, Texas and Arizona ""set records for the most cases they have reported in a single day"" but no decisions were made to halt the ease in social distancing or limit the number of businesses to re-open.

I was shocked to read that Texas never issued a statewide mandate to wear face masks when out in public.

New York, New Jersey etc are only good in comparison to where they were I.e. in a completely out of control panic. What the rest of the country did was ‚Äúmitigate‚Äù the out break to keep our health systems viable. The panic in New York (our media hub) may have caused the rest of the nation to over react and go to a total shutdown when a regional shutdown would have been sufficient. We will never know."

The US would love to be in that situation, but alas our recent outbreaks are on a different level. Florida, Texas and Arizona have far more cases per day, with FL and TX having similar populations to Beijing.  AZ is much smaller.
Soooooo....  looks like the scientists were right in warning the US states (and seems mostly red ones) were re-opening way too early.

2020-06-17 18:01:08,"What no one seems to want to reconcile is how we can continue to have the same number of cases nationally for almost 6 weeks during which time the number of deaths has dropped over 50%.

There are only four possible explanations I can think of to reconcile this contradiction:
1) The virus is now less lethal than it was in April.
2) The medical system has developed better treatments.
3) The composition of who has acquired Covid-19 is changing.
4) increased testing has revealed more of the asymptomatic cases that would have been overlooked previously and, in fact, total cases are DROPPING in the US.

1) We have no evidence the virus has mutated or is less lethal.
2) if the medical system has better treatments that are reducing death, then we should care as much that cases are stable or increasing.
3) As with 2), if the composition of cases means more young people and fewer elderly people have Covid-19, then who cares if the cases are increasing as long as the vulnerable aren't getting ill.
4) Our ability to extensively test is now revealing many more cases than  we found in April.  The mortality rate/case is not changing, therefore, by definition, the number of REAL (not confirmed by testing) cases must be dropping.  Our ability to test is actually masking an overall decrease in cases.

#4 is actually the most plausible hypothesis that fits the evidence best."
2020-06-17 18:07:38,"There is a solid rational reason for reopening elementary schools and day-cares in the Fall -- the virus is negligible to children, and children don't appear to readily transmit it to others.  Granted, there still are conflicting opinions on the latter fear:  but data -- not opinions -- may soon come to clarify exactly what the risk of that is.

On the other hand,  there appears to be no excuse for ignoring social distancing and not wearing masks by others.  We are still in the 1st Wave,  and it is very possible that the 2d Wave will be far worse ... unless we attempt to mitigate it by letting reason guide our actions now that we have experience."
2020-06-17 18:12:15,"I hope all of our fellow citizens in Florida and Texas believe their trips to the beaches and bars are worth it. And that they realize there is a price (literally) to be paid for not wearing a mask or practicing safe social-distancing.

It won't be long before many companies start seeing proposals from their health insurers for 2021. The insurers will be basing their rates on their experience with medical costs in 2020. When they incur higher hospital costs, especially  for emergency and intensive care rooms, those will be reflected in their bids to employers. And given the losses in revenue and profits those companies have had this year, their employees then should not be surprised to see dramatically higher health insurance premiums deducted from their paychecks next year. 

In essence, one way or another, they'll pay for ignoring the pandemic rules and guidelines."
2020-06-17 18:22:14,"Looking at the COVID-19 data, Dr. Fauci‚Äôs claim that the U.S. is still undergoing the first wave is unassailable. Looking to VP Pence as a scientific resource is laughable and needs to be called out as such.

Also, given Dr. Fauci‚Äôs data-driven concern of rapid COVID-19 spread within enclosed spaces, has any Trump party member consider the danger posed to Trump in his enclosed space indoor rally? How about the possibility of having to support Pence as their 2020 candidate?"
2020-06-17 18:22:49,"Some of the confusion is over terminology which can be confusing and perhaps I concede, though a medical doctor, I could be mistaken. "" Cases"", as I take it, means number of positive tests which could and likely does reflect some increased testing. ""Infections"" is ambiguous since it could mean positive tests or illnesses (current), ""percent of tests that are positive"""". This has been rising and is concerning but may reflect younger people ignoring guidelines. They have mild illnesses or are asymptomatic. "" Hospitalizations"". This is ambiguous also since many hospitals with falling occupancy rates are now allowing non-coved admissions and elective procedures and I have read that hospitalizations are up while Covid admissions are down. Finally "" Deaths"". This is a hard statistic and a good metric of what we are dealing with. This is generally down. As to waves I think that is a semantic question. Unless there is a large increase in deaths I doubt the reopening of America will be halted or paused. People have decided that for themselves. For vulnerables, like me, the watchwords are caution and staying safe."

Had people worn masks and kept up the distancing we'd be far better off than we are.  The real news to report about Pence is that he and his boss stand in the way of making progress fighting the worst pandemic this country has seen in 100 years.  This is a factual statement.

Easing restrictions on local businesses was long over due. It is safe to say, there is very little fodder left for that menacing COVID-19 rascal to feed on and kill. A lot of smart NYers who could afford to leave, left NY at the right time. NYers in the front line may have also acquired immunity from micro exposure to the virus. I would like to see a random check of the antibodies of the population of NY. 

As far as the spikes in states like Florida, Arizona and Texas, no surprise there. Most people don't wear proper masks properly. Most people do not observe safe distancing and most people do not adhere to guidelines for hand washing or sanitizing. Those who don't understand viruses, thought summer will kick COVID-19 out of our planet were dead wrong. COVID-19 is a hardy virus that can survive summer temperatures easily and spread as quickly as it did in NY. So it is a combination as to why hot states have a spike. Hot air rises and moves rapidly around spreading infections of heat stable infections.

Fauci has said that COVID 19 is his nightmare and I think most of us can relate to that. 

But Fauci, Birx, Pence, and Trump all have a bully pulpit and what they say and do counts. And yet they do nothing and what they say is muted and ineffectual. In the case of Trump and Pence it is untruthful and damaging as well.

Consequence: Congested hospitals and emergency rooms, increased employee absenteeism, reduced business productivity, reduced tax revenues. Oh yes, summer is about to start. Increased temperatures will mean more forest fires in the West, more hurricanes, torrential rains, and floods in the East, driving sick people to crowd for shelter, more disease spreading all around.

We are seeing that here in Washington State, where our own governor reacted promptly and competently to the pandemic. We are seeing that in Florida where the Republican governor has just, for example, fired their data analytics chief for putting the state's actual statistics on the state dashboard. We are seeing that even in New York City, where the residents surely should know better. In Washington which was an early hot spot our numbers are low but flat rather than falling. Florida's numbers are already four times Washington's, and are now spiking. New York City's numbers are falling, though health care experts there are already anticipating a frightening second surge. This process of smartly responding to the pandemic is difficult, painful, tedious, lonely. But it's not the flu. It will be with us for a long time. We will need to follow the physical distancing guidelines for the foreseeable future. We need some real leadership, folks, and now. We need that especially at the national level, though the odds of that happening before January 2021 are exactly zero."

2020-06-17 18:48:14,"I'm having real trouble figuring out who to trust, Mike Pence or Dr. Fauci? I mean, Pence has an incredible scientific track record, but Fauci is an actual doctor, so... I guess I'll just watch Fox News for some real guidance on this whole thing!"
2020-06-17 18:49:38,"@NYTimes, it's ok to say that Pence is dangerously misleading the country and attacking media neutrality at the same time. Also maybe say dismisses facts, instead of dismisses fears."
2020-06-17 18:52:03,"Pence, Trump's faithful lap dog, thinks he knows more about the pandemic than Dr. Fauci does. Trump's gotta be proud of his loyal V-P."

Um ... does this guy even hear himself when he speaks?!?

Sorry ... guess that was a rhetorical question ..."
2020-06-17 19:14:57,"Of course there is no ""second wave"", the first one never ended.   We reopened too early, so the cases will increase again.  a second wave means the virus is just about gone and somehow from somewhere in reemerges.  This virus  hasn't reemerged.  We and mean most of the world with a few exceptions botched this big time . Why?  Afraid of economic collapse.. It looks like the Lt Governor of Texas and other right wing nuts will get their wish after all: the elderly, the ""Non contributors to society"" will be left to die.

Not even physical distancing, hand washing and face mask? How nasty can Pence get, all to emulate his cruelly irresponsible boss? A government in disarray, I suspect as a distraction so folks won't get a chance to really know the price of incompetence and corruption....until it becomes too late but for further deaths from coronavirus...and the crying!"
2020-06-17 19:06:33,"4 months later, and Trump/Pence are still in denial! Fauci has it right, we‚Äôre still in the first wave. 15 cases, and next week there‚Äôll be zero, I take no responsibility!"

Dr. Fauci has been the LONE beacon of truth & this is why he no longer addresses the public with updates. Dr. Birx sold out & while she's very knowledgeable, she has acquiesced to serve politics instead of public health. What could possibly go wrong?"
2020-06-17 18:33:18,"You have to listen to the experts, like Dr. Fauci, who is the expert. Mike Pence is a Trump toady and will say or do anything Trump tells him to do. Pence can not be trusted."
2020-06-17 19:02:50,"It's obvious this is still the first wave. The second wave will be when Florida.Texas, Arizona and the South, bring it back North.
Include the protesters without masks and the ""What Covid? It's a party and I want my beer and haircut? groups and you got your second wave followed by the flu.

There are so many people in my part of the city without masks it is demoralizing. Apparently COVID doesn't exist until you or your loved one dies or needs a double transplant.

I pity our brave health care workers."
2020-06-17 18:35:43,"It is really quite an insult to the integrity and superior knowledge of Dr. Fauci when put in the same sentence yet alone compared  with Mr. Pence.  One man has had years of experience and many lifetimes of observing, diagnosing, treating, and predicting the trajectory of all things epidemiological.  He also is a man of ethics who transcends politics - and lies - to speak SCIENTIFIC truth to power.  Pence is weak and a coward as is his boss.   He like Trump has lost all sense of reasoning and morality, sacrificing them both on an altar of power and control.  Yet the onus of such transgressions is also upon those who are silent or willing accomplices as we see in our Republican Senate, with governors in Red state, and sadly with almost half of Americans who refuse to see that they are but pawns in this game of politics run amok."
2020-06-17 19:02:36,"We are not doing a very good job testing. You can easily find global testing data on the internet, sort by testing per capita and you will see our unimpressive performance.  We are supposed to be such a great nation but its just a load of nationalistic nonsense. This administration repeatedly says we are the best ever blah blah. They lie like I play the french horn. I wouldn‚Äôt let Pence walk my dog."
2020-06-17 18:39:01,"I guess I no longer understand why they haven't fired Fauci...

I should probably lead with the fact that *I* like Fauci, along with trusting in science and common sense regarding transmissible viruses. At this point thought, the task force is all but gone, the briefings have ended, Trump is going full ""tweet reality away and tell people we're doing super awesome with the virus"", and Pence is literally writing Op-Eds in The Wall Street Journal pre-denying a second wave.

With that being said, the Administration has already decided fighting the virus is irrelevant, they're just going to tweet away their responsibility for the terrible results and try to frame the ever rising American death toll as a ""Win of Epic Proportions- I mean we shut down Gyna so early~!"". So, if we're being led by an Administration who is going full blown gaslight mode, why the heck do they bother having Fauci around to fight their la-la-land narrative?"
2020-06-17 18:47:56,"The only reason Mike Pence doesn't think it's a second wave is because he can't count that high.
This is why Trump keeps him around, when Donald says greatest, biggest, largest, ect., Mike always believes him."
2020-06-17 19:05:52,"I am currently living in Austin, Texas, and I can attest that a lot of people here seem to think that ""reopening"" means ""go back to doing everything just like before."" I was standing in line at a store the other day (that I had to go to), wearing a mask and spacing  out 6 feet from the person in front of me, as required. Then a 20-something came and stood probably 12 inches behind me, and did not  take the hint every time  I tried to move up from her slightly, she *followed me* forward, so I could not get any distance. She was wearing a mask as required, but loudly clearing her throat the whole time, and when I shot her a look she said ""don't worry, I'm not sick."" Well, I hope not! Then we had to have some workers in our house the other day, for reasons beyond our control. One of them didn't wear or even bring a mask, and the other brought one but took it off when he came inside! I mean, what the heck? We have been trying our best to be safe, but even when we run the occasional essential errand or have to have something repaired, we put ourselves at great risk because other people around here just don't seem to care. It's very, very disheartening."
2020-06-17 18:37:28,"Some modern Republican suggestions on how to improve law enforcement:
 
Reduce length of batons by half-an-inch, 11 oz cans of mace instead of 12, lowering taser voltages by 3%, replacing Desert Eagle .50 handguns with traditional 45's, putting a cap of 3 armored tanks on any law enforcement department with less than 20 officers, re-branding of chemical irritants as ""eco-sprays"", requiring more flexible soles on tactical boots, mandatory purchase and viewing of a Trump Corporation produced 5 minute de-escalation and sensitivity training video, phasing out use of barbwire handcuffs, putting an end to affirmative action police force quotas, new salutes, two week waiting period before dishonorably discharged military service members can apply to the police force, two week suspension (paid) for any officer with three consecutive domestic violence/abuse convictions, happy-face arm bands for riot squad members, mandatory five second ""time-outs"" before indiscriminately shooting unarmed protesters with rubber bullets, body cams may not be turned off or have their footage deleted without ""reasonable cause"" such as low battery power or faulty solid state memory modules, discouraging the use of high-five's after excessive use of force incidents, new decaf coffee protocols, jodhpurs.
 
Of course all these new regulations are void anytime President Trump is within 3,000 miles of any individual officers precinct."
2020-06-17 18:50:06,"No one could blame Trump and Pence for the virus itself but their administration's response and lack of clear action, taken as a whole, has been ridiculous and frankly heartbreaking to behold.

The United States has willfully become a laggard in response and recovery by any objective measure.  Our population is divided, squabbling and flailing in ways Americans used to only see in news coverage of other far off places.  The most basic public health measures have been rendered partisan, naturally following a stunning lack of education and example from the Federal Government.  Dems should maybe start a benign PSA campaign about basic toilet habits at this point just to see the GOP's sadly predictable (pick an issue) ""if it's bad for you it's good for me"" propaganda in response.

Russia and China are gloating.  GLOATING.  We spiral and diminish within and continue to throw away hard won (over DECADES) leadership by action and example abroad.  They must doubly love the irony of merely using our technology against us after chasing, trying to keep up and duplicating it for so long."
2020-06-17 18:47:35,"Whenever I feel ""quarantine fatigue"" I summon my rage at this administration. Keeping on my distancing has become my own personal form of protest. I'm not going to get sick or worse because of this bunch of clowns. I'm not even going to forfeit my career because I have no childcare. 

I'm going to get up, split work and childcare shifts with my husband, keep paying the nanny who we only see on Zoom, wipe down my delivered groceries, and then give the finger to every Republican everywhere."
2020-06-17 19:13:41,"‚ÄúIn Arizona, where the number of known cases has nearly doubled since the start of June, more than 1,500 people believed to have the coronavirus were hospitalized on Monday, the highest number of any date in the pandemic and almost double the number from a month prior.‚Äù

Does this mean that all indicated 1,500 Arizona cases were admitted to hospital on this past Monday, or does this refer to how many infected were in Arizona hospitals as of this last Monday? Lack of attention to such a detail, which should reasonably be considered good journalism when reporting on this justifiably important story, is concerning and makes me think of those folks who suspect the media might sometimes be playing with and sensationalizing numbers‚Äîand not necessarily unknowingly so‚Äîfor readership points."

They have sacrificed thousands of American lives needlessly in pursuit of power and many thousands more will die.

These are the same people who will - Mitch McConnell tipped us off to it - cut your Social Security and Medicare if Trump gets re-elected.

Here's hoping the Romneys and Kasichs can rebuild the GOP or produce a loyal, patriotic party that cares about Americans' lives and well-being."

2020-06-17 18:44:22,"Cuomo in his statement said NY is the teplate on how to open up again. NY has been doing better than other states. It is true NY is an example. The positive rate was 50%, poor communities has infection rates of 50% the antibody tests are known to woefully underestimate infection. It seems clear the emergence of some level of herd immunity is suppressing new viral infections. NY broke their hospital capability, had more deaths by far that any other state, even on a per capita basis, and had one of the worst outbreaks in the world. Because of this great suffering, NY is immune from further substantial outbreaks no matter how many protests seem to take place. So is Cuomo suggesting everyone else follow the lead of giving covid to everyone and allowing all the people that would die to do so as soon as possible? Only someone so incompetent that he doesn't understand what he did wrong would make that recommendation. Or someone dripping with hypocrisy..."
2020-06-17 19:15:33,"For the past 3 months, We trusted Dr. Anthony Fauci‚Äôs advice about mitigating the spread of Covid-19 by wearing masks and social distancing. 

We distrusted President Trump and VP Pence for calling the pandemic ‚Äòa Democratic hoax‚Äô and sneering at the wearing of masks as ‚Äòpolitically correct‚Äô.

The proof of Fauci‚Äôs learned opinions will be when Trump‚Äôs campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma spreads the virus among his thousands of redcapped fans the day after Juneteenth 2020. June 20, 2020 is a day that will live in infamy in American history."

A political animal with an anemic scope of understanding ."
2020-06-17 19:07:57,"We don't have any reliable data on the prevalence rate of COVID-19.  To say detected ""Cases"" have doubled in Arizona does not mean anything about the prevalence of COVID-19 as such.  

The deaths curve in Arizona appears to be linear for the past 2 months (no increase in deaths per day).  In Texas, the signs are more hopeful.  The deaths there have been linear since April 7, but has visibly slowed in the past 2 weeks (fewer deaths per day).  This is all from bing.com death charts.  It is important to realize that increased detected cases do not imply more people are dying of COVID.  People seem to be conflating detected cases with the prevalence rate, again."
2020-06-17 19:11:07,Our Federal Government's response to this pandemic has been nothing but a three-ring circus. It would be a catastrophe if it were not for some really hard-working Governors and their teams. (Trump abandoned our country a long time ago.) Look at NYT's  statistics page to see what is happening in other nations. It is no wonder Canada and Mexico have closed their borders to essential U.S. citizens.
2020-06-17 18:33:29,Confusion is intentional. Distractions are purposeful.
2020-06-17 18:40:21,"Sorry Pence but you cannot ""will"" or lie away a pandemic.  Reality is what it is, and making people think it will all go away will not actually make it go away.  If we stop taking this problem serious, it will just give COVID-19 space to expand and hit us all that much harder.  When that happens people will realize that the Trump administration decided to place higher value on its own survival than their health and survival."
2020-06-17 18:56:30,"Pence represents the Trump Administration which has (0) Zero credibility.  That mean for me ignore what he says. 
First wave, second wave, the  virus is still here .
Trumps only motivation is to get himself elected not to save our skin."
2020-06-17 19:07:43,"So happy to see Pence taking a lead on this. He will be around longer than Donny, so it's better if he shows all the folks that aren't sure, exactly who he is. Stable Genius #2."
2020-06-17 19:12:48,"Biden will be wise to announce that if he‚Äôs elected president he will nominate Cuomo as a pandemic czar. Not only has he provided tremendous leadership in containing the spread of COVID-19 as governor, but he would also be a great asset for the Democrats to win big in November."
2020-06-17 19:01:52,"Whether this country is in the first wave or second wave of COVID-19, what I think is paramount is that fact that STILL how many states do NOT mandate the wearing of face masks in public or social distancing?  How many bars are packed with folks, regaling in an atmosphere akin to ""happy days are here again"" attitude?

The number of new cases continue to increase as do the number of deaths.  And yet, much of the country seems almost ignorant of the consequences of opening up too soon.

So many states merely ""strongly suggest"" or ""strongly encourage"" either action by people.

As long as this insidious virus is here and has NO plans on ""disappearing"" any time soon, why would or should such simple actions like wearing a face mask and keeping one's distance be disregarded with such regularity?

Who knows how much worse this scenario will evolve once the flu season returns in the autumn."
2020-06-17 18:37:50,"Trump and Pence have to stop treating Covid-19 like it's a CNN commentator who can be shouted down or brushed aside. They would rather listen to spin doctors than real doctors. Of course we're still in a first wave, which is fortunately subsiding in those places where people continue to take precautions seriously. There probably will be a second wave and the strength with which it crashes onto our shores depends on how well we stick to the most effective preventive and containment practices. But given the carelessness of far too many people, we had all better start stocking up and saving money as much as we can."
2020-06-17 19:26:26,"It seems to me that just counting numbers of cases per state doesn't always tell the full story. In my state, Wisconsin, overall cases have started to decline in the past 2 or 3 weeks, due to declining rates in the urban centers. But the more rural northern counties are seeing significant growth. The county nearest to me with a major hospital has seen 25% of its total cases in the last week. The county where I do most of my shopping has logged 50% of its cases in the last two weeks. The county with the hospital where my husband had brain surgery a year ago has seen 50% of its cases in the last week.  

The case numbers are small, but the rate of exponential growth is extremely troubling. (At least to me. I'm not sure anyone else is paying attention). And next to nobody wears masks or practices any type of social distancing. 

The war doesn't end until every side stops fighting."
2020-06-17 19:44:14,"Most countries are struggling with Covid19 spread vs loss of jobs and downturn of economy. Most countries are trying to reasonable about how they manage this. But I just don't get US government's response. Its as if they believe that by just lying and twisting facts they can make the virus go away. Corona virus is truly a big challenge and Trump administration had a chance to win over people by sane policies. For instance, Trump could have ensured that 6 months into this pandemic, US had ample supply of N95 masks that are available to whoever needs them. Basic messaging from the government about keep safe, staying indoors, wearing a mask while outdoors could have saved lives. But Trump is holding a rally with 20K people (and yes, the BLM protests are also definitely going to have an affect on Covid numbers.) A sane, pro-science and pro-people government would be such a nice thing to have."
2020-06-17 15:42:13,Nothing else will matter until there is a safe vaccine found and administered. Politicians come and go. Think of your lives first. Wear the masks everywhere. This is not over!!!
2020-06-17 20:03:27,"Wow! According to Gov. Cuomo, over 60,000 people in NY yesterday but fewer 600 test results turned out to be positive. When the number of positive results is that low, the officials need to pay close attention to the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tests they deploy. After all, even a 99% accurate test would generate 600 false positives when applied to 60,000 people. Best to re-test these 600 people using a different diagnostic test/method just to make sure."
2020-06-17 18:01:15,Vice President Pence needs to start wearing a mask. Until he does he clearly isn't showing the seriousness required in the face of a deadly pandemic for others to begin taking him seriously.
2020-06-17 19:19:45,"How about if Mr. Pence travels to several meat-packing facilities in Iowa, then a few nursing homes, finally a couple of federal prisons to celebrate the great outcome of his leadership as head of the Coronavirus response!
No need for masks, and then he can return to the White House and personally report to the person who plays a President on television.
Anyone want the other side of that bet?"
2020-06-17 19:37:28,"""Vice President Mike Pence argued in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that concern over a ‚Äúsecond wave‚Äù of the coronavirus was ‚Äúoverblown‚Äù and that ‚Äúwe are winning the fight against the invisible enemy.‚Äù""
  These statements can be put right up there with Trump's earlier statements about it just being a couple of people from China, we've got it under control, anyone who wants to get tested can get tested, and bleach as the savior."
2020-06-17 19:40:58,"As though we don't have enough controversies, the NYT contributes to another one: is it the first or the second wave. As other commentators have pointed out, the idea of waves came from the the 1918 influenza pandemic which waned then resurged. So why try to fit this corona virus pandemic into that influenza pandemic model?

But what does it matter which wave we're in. The point is infections and hospitalizations are rapidly rising in some states and their hospitals are starting to be overwhelmed.

And we still don't have a coordinated, federal system with a pro-active testing and contact tracing programs to identify and snuff out further flare ups. These are the powerful tools other nations have used to snuff out flare ups.

It's analogous to wild fires; they need well equipped fire departments, not individual homeowners with garden hoses. And regardless of new outbursts or de novo fires, they need to be stopped with public services, not individuals.

If Fauci is our main epidemiologist, I wish he would stop just making comments correcting Pence's and Trump's misstatements. We have a pandemic to fight. 

Is there no epidemiologist or public health department that can be the fire department for this virus. I wish the NYT would start writing about our missing in action public health department. And please stop thinking of Fauci as THE public health expert. He works in the NIH, a fantastic think tank. It is the CDC which is our public health institute.."
2020-06-17 19:59:11,"Aside from K street, does Pence really expect to have any future in national politics after this landmine explosion called Trump?"
2020-06-17 19:45:40,"On one hand, we read Pence, who's job is to ""lead the coronavirus response"" stating that the ""second wave‚Äù of the coronavirus was ‚Äúoverblown‚Äù and that ‚Äúwe are winning the fight against the invisible enemy.‚Äù 

On the other hand, we read of Fauci, ""the government‚Äôs top epidemiologist, also said that the country was not in a ‚Äúsecond wave,‚Äù but for a very different reason: he warned that the nation was still in the first wave.""

Is it any wonder why this country is always at odds with EVERYTHING that emanates from this administration?

A basic and simple message such as categorizing this ongoing virus as either a ""first"" or ""second"" wave cannot be agreed upon AND such disagreement is in a public forum.

Even though I tend to trust and believe the doctor, the fact that mangled and contradicting messaging coming from the White House continues to confuse and mislead people every single day.

For once, just once, I wish Trump and his administration would get their acts together and tell the truth.  Oh wait, that's such a big ask, I doubt they would even know where to begin."
2020-06-17 19:54:42,"To Mike Pence and Dr. Fauci:

No one cares what you say anymore.  Your words mean nothing.  It would be quite the thing to see a business run the way the US is run now.  

Could be fun for awhile though.  Every employee would just do what they pleased....but after awhile all would fail, everyone would lose, and there would be no business.

Get the correlation, people?  

The US is doomed.  All the military service of our ancestors, for what?  They fought the hard fight, but now that has all changed."
2020-06-17 19:34:53,"Today, the state of Georgia surpassed 60,000 cases. When the governor announced reopening on April 20, I created a model that predicted 60,000 cases by July 1 based on the parameters of his reopening plans. On that day, Georgia had 18,947 cases. 

The state has tripled the cases in less than 2 months and is now two weeks ahead of this model. At this rate, there will easily be 125,000 cases by August 1 because cases continue to climb as Georgians bowl, go to tattoos parlors, dine in restaurants, get haircuts and pack into movie theaters like a bunch of fools. And then, the cooler fall weather and corresponding flu season will bring a horrible wave of new infection, the likes of which we haven‚Äôt seen.

So with all due respect to the anti-science Vice President who believes the earth was created in six literal days, the second wave will hit in the fall. We‚Äôre not even finished with the first wave yet, sir."

2020-06-17 20:07:08,"Vice President Pence is on record that he does not believe in evolution.  SARS-CoV-2 is a demonstration that evolution is a real and tangible thing. Could there be any less qualified individual to lead the coronavirus task force? Well over 110,000 deaths of Americans tell us how amazingly incompetent Pence is. And now Pence is declaring victory as 800 to 1,000 Americans die every single day.  No this isn‚Äôt the second wave this is still the first."

2020-06-17 19:22:22,"By now we can pretty much ignore whatever Donald Trump‚Äôs flunky Mike Pence has to say regarding the coronavirus. 

Pence is not a conveyer of truthful reporting so much as a lopsided seller of good news. New coronavirus cases are on a reported uptick in many states, a fact Pence patently refuses to honestly convey. 

Pence suggests all we need to combat the coronavirus is a good attitude coupled with an unswerving belief in Trump to get us through the day. And if you get sick? Well, your faith in Trump just wasn‚Äôt strong enough. 

The cynicism of men like Pence and Trump is remarkable."
2020-06-17 19:24:29,"Pence vs. Fauci? Let's think about this. The subject is a pandemic. Mike Pence has never studied medicine, has no training at all in the field of epidemiology, and generally repeats whatever his boss says. Dr. Fauci, on the other hand, is a medical doctor, has studied pandemics for decades, and has no reason to take a side on this issue except for the scientific evidence. Gosh, it's a hard choice.

Dr. Fauci should just focus on getting US a safe effective vaccine against COVID-19 fast and until then just stop baseless speculation and fear mongering. 

Vice-president Pence's op-ed dismissing fears of a second wave in Wall Street Journal are directed to those playing the buy low sell high stock market games and has little to do with comforting average Americans public health concerns. What Pence says applies to those working remotely from their homes or trading in the tech sector which is doing just fine."

He may have given us a tax cut, but we're paying a big price."

2020-06-17 19:57:08,"It's not a second wave.  As Fauci said, the first wave is still ongoing.

This is what pandemics do.  They burn through one area (e.g., New York), then move on to the next susceptible region (e.g. the red states).

If having died down in New York the virus should re-surge there, well then that would be a second wave."

In 2015 in the small town of Austin, Indiana, over 200 people were infected with HIV. 

What happened is that then Governor Mike Pence failed to act in response to increasingly urgent signs of a significant HIV outbreak, and he was adamantly opposed to a free needle exchange program that would flatten the infection curve until he was pressured into accepting reason, but only after he  said he would ‚Äúgo home and pray on it.‚Äù

Among public health experts, the Indiana AIDS outbreak is considered a failure of state response, and an example of how poor political leadership can actually make a crisis worse.

Pence is now doing for all Americans what he did for Indianans....spiking the curve.

I have no doubt they are alarmed, concerned, or even phased by the fact that over 117,000 deaths have occurred due to this virus.

The country continues to get no clear direction or decisions from Trump, Pence or their administration when it comes to COVID-19.  All we seem to hear are half-truths (and that's being generous) and many falsehoods from this group.

In the meantime, the numbers continue to climb.  

Boy, November 3rd cannot arrive soon enough."

I'm so glad that Trump is making America great again, at what I don't know but I'm sure he'll tell me soon.  Of course if enough of us come down with the virus and die he'll tell us that it's Obama's fault that he, Trump the GREATEST, couldn't cure us.  Obama didn't leave him the right keys to the White House, or some such nonsense.

The pathetic thing in all of this is that it didn't have to happen this way.  People would have died but not as many.  People would have been unhappy about restrictions but we might not have seen them lasting so long.  And Trump could have been a hero if he'd listened to the experts.  Our standards are so low at this point that almost anything would have made us happy, assuming he could have brought himself to admit that there was a real crisis brewing. 

At this point I want him out, him and his entire administration.  They have wasted nearly 4 years of our lives and set us back at least 100 years in terms of social progress.  They have wasted our tax dollars.  If Trump were a CEO he would have been shown the door in the first year.  At the very least his powers would have been curtailed severely.  

If there is a God she's not happy with us."

They are all going to be out of office before the ""second wave"" hit's it's peak.

That's what's more than sad about this ... it's criminal. They can't be blamed for the initial pandemic, but they sure as heck can be blamed for the lack of response to the first wave ... and the entirety of the next wave."

The argument as to whether our country is still in a first or second wave ‚Äì I vote for Fauci's opinion ‚Äì is almost moot when you see so many Americans of all ages and walks of life refusing to take just common sense approach to help limit the spread of a deadly virus. In the beginning non-compliance in wearing masks, gloves and even eye protection (sunglasses, safety glasses) was understandable given the mixed messages from government leaders and the CDC because of the ludicrous shortage of available PPE (which is still a problem). Now there is really no excuse for Americans not to try harder to do their civic duty and comply with CDC protocols. But the fact is, sadly, a lot of people need coaxing, so a relentless public health campaign with slogans and ads on par with the highly successful ""Don't Mess With Texas"" campaign would be in order. Yet that starts with real leadership at the top where we have none: just liars and incompetent sycophants like Pence.

P.S. Bolton, you're partly to blame for the catastrophe we now face. You should have stepped forward to testify. But like Trump you placed personal gain above national interest. That makes you complicit."
2020-06-17 20:14:52,"Pence is an inveterate parrot and a first class dunce. Like Yogi Berra (i.e., someone infinitely wiser and smarter than Trump and Pence) said ""It ain't over till it's over."" And this pandemic is nowhere over. And every day brings new information about it's draconian ways along with promising mitigating medical interventions, i.e., dexamethasone. In the interim we would do well to continue listening to Dr. Fauci  and publications like the Economist who unequivocally state that masks are a life-saving necessity along with social distance and discretion when in large groups, the more circulating fresh air the better, e.g., outdoor restaurant dining."
2020-06-17 21:08:37,"Pence has become the liar in chief for Trump-lying about the obvious uptick of cases in states where evidence says the opposite. it has come full circle now-Trump and Pence only care about re-elections issues and not about the health and lives of American citizens. Many would say that Trump and Pence are on the border of criminal behaviour as they diminish the threat of the novel coronavirus in the face of overwhelming evidence against their claims.  

The basic fact is that America is leaderless at the federal level as the virus continues to wreak havoc across red states now. It is amazing to see a developed country enter into denial about a pandemic when the country has the means and talent to defeat the viral threat. 

Dr Fauci is becoming the modern day Ignaz Semmelweis as the country turns its collective back on science and politicians promote false cures and false information. As a scientist, I am trying to understand how a developed country  can act like some country in a medieval time frame when lives are at risk. If this is what millennia of human evolution and development has produced the world is in deep trouble."
2020-06-17 21:08:50,"How can US media and politicians be obsessed with waves and masks and rallies, while missing the really important story hiding in plain sight: most of our allies and economic competitors are safely rebooting their economies because they successfully contained the pandemic. We're being left far, far behind. 

The US already has the world's highest deaths. While other nations like Germany, Korea, Japan, China isolate the sick so the healthy can get back to work, our infection rates are exploding across a third of our territory. We have no idea if our stores or factories or schools are safe. While other countries have driven daily cases down by 80 to 90%, to barely tens or hundreds of infections, in the US, we're still infecting tens of thousands, and rates have stopped declining.  

As the rest of the industrialized world recovers and pulls ahead, our Federal Govt under Trump has ensured we will continue to be ensnared in this pandemic long into the foreseeable future.  The gross incompetence in the White House was entirely predictable.  The lethal complicity of the GOP across the nation is deliberate, done with full knowledge of the consequences, and inexcusable."

I know it‚Äôs great to live in a nice home and have everything done for you with lots of Secret Service protection, but someone should tell him it‚Äôs going to come to an end.   At that point, he will have to live with the fact that he sold his soul (and Mother‚Äôs) to be part of the administration that has not had one accomplishment in four years that could be said to make America great.  In fact, they have caused a decline in those areas where it was even good.  Now he even lies about the spread of this deadly pandemic.  There really is no bottom for this crowd."

Dr. Fauci, a learned scientist, apparently is not on board with the politics of Trump and Pence, therefore, is apparently no longer heeded by many, including the very stable genius.

But, as they say, karma will visit in the form of a virus that leaves corpses in its wake.  Alas, Trump said it was no worse than the flu, and he was believed.  The virus will be gone by Easter.  And his uneducated statement was believed by many.
Open the states he ordered.  And the GOP governors did just that-obeyed the edict from the high perch of Washington.

If, for no other reason, his declining health will not enable him to continue in office.

An early departure as POTUS by Trump would leave the office open for Pence.  Therefore, Pence will attempt to deceive the

The statistics are the statistics.  Without a vaccine, people will continue to be infected and some will die.  A death is a sad event for a family that loses a loved one.  However, the corona virus is a natural occurrence.  It is not a terrorist attack, mass shooting, or act of war.  Without a vaccine, there could be up to a million deaths in the US or more.  The country cannot play the ""let's wait two more months because the vaccine is close"" game and destroy the future prospects of those not at-risk with a hobbled economy and closed schools.  Let's put our adult shoes on and do the smart and effective thing:  1) wear a mask 2) follow proper hygiene practices 3) provide solid protection to people who are at risk.  Let's ensure that adequate hospital and hospital surge capacity is available as well as the right protection for healthcare providers.  Drop the blame and get in the game."

2020-06-18 00:00:38,"Wearing a mask back in ‚Äúmy day‚Äù would have been called ‚Äúcommon courtesy.‚Äù A small gesture intended to keep those around  one a bit healthier. 

Akin to covering one‚Äôs mouth during a cough or sneeze. Or washing one‚Äôs hands after using the bathroom. Or not ‚Äúdouble dipping‚Äù in the bean dip, guacamole, or salsa. Or calling in sick, or at least advising those around one that you‚Äôre sick or not feeling well (‚Äúkeep your distance,‚Äù aka: social distancing). Not sharing toiletry items (combs, toothbrushes, handkerchiefs, etc...). Getting vaccines for children. And other small acts. 

These were the things my mother taught me as being polite and considerate of others. For the most part, they cost nothing other than a moment of time, and are easy to do. Why wouldn‚Äôt one take the little bit of effort to try to help others stay healthy? 

Now, common courtesy is out the window. Everything, even the smallest of regards for our fellow human beings, is a political statement. 

A sad commentary on ourselves. And our society."
2020-06-17 22:25:37,"It‚Äôs about leadership and the level of education of the citizenry. 

Americans chose this path when they elected a President for his ability to entertain and bully and not for his competence. 

The government is done fighting this and worse yet, they don‚Äôt know how. Notice how China (100 cases) and New Zealand (2 cases) took decisive action once they detected additional cases. Case numbers that are negligible compared to any state in the USA. 

The American people are so preoccupied with entertainment that they have completely forgotten how to critically think. That‚Äôs why people think this is the flu, cite low fatality rates and eagerly follow an incompetent President that pushes hydroxy and bleach as therapeutics. 

The future of this country is in the hands of millennials and younger. Gen X and Boomers don‚Äôt have it in them to lead.

For anyone, yet especially a U.S. vice president as Coronavirus task force head under Trump, to claim they have somehow succeeded in handling and containing this novel virus; despite 117,000+ Americans' deaths, along with over 2,000,000 positive U.S. cases having occurred in 2020 to date; is of Trump insanity stature. It depicts both being totally clueless and non caring; plus only concerned for their own political survival, including if it comes at the expense of Americans lives, including their own supporters.

No better proof as per Trump's and company's health risking to all, upcoming weekend's indoor sought for Tulsa, Oklahoma rally; posing the highest risk of spread of this Coronavirus.

Their denial of Coronavirus since prior to Day One of it reaching the U.S. is just one of the potentially deadly ""threats"" which all Americans face under mask less Trump, Pence, and their like incompetent and irresponsible administration. 

Now exactly just 20 weeks away from yesterday for our chance to ""Make America Great Again"" for real; unlike that 2016 Trump campaign slogan we already knew back then was a lie; due to Obama The Great when leaving his second full term, having already left America ""Great"" for the ""Lawless & Disorderly"" Dictator Trump's cheating arrival."

You need contact tracing programs and mass masking.  But, like everything else I have said about this pandemic, it will take 3 months from now for you to finally do it.  Meanwhile, thousands of people have died and millions of dollars in economic activity has been lost.  Again why is Mike Pence talking, and why is anybody listening to him?"

There is ample scientific evidence that the guilty have intentionally ignored known measures that would have prevented the excessive deaths that we have seen in the recent past, are seeing now and will see in the future.

In addition to this, the evidence that the US has far higher deaths per capita as well as overall infection rates when compared to similar countries that were no different than the US other than the negligence of the governing individuals.

All our wonderful community events are cancelled for the summer. Favorite gathering places are cautiously re-opening. Many local businesses closed while they worked out how to pivot their business model. They are reopening. Our community is supporting them by patronizing them.

We have had Zero cases.  Zero.   

Today, while pumping gas (masked and gloved), two out-of-state cars pulled up to do the same.  Both had license states from states with significant outbreaks. No one bothered to wear a mask or social distance. (We were within 6 feet of each other.)

2020-06-18 02:08:14,"From the ""Hate To Say I Told You So"" Department:

Some weeks back, maybe a month or so, when some of the RED States were talking about ""opening it all up,"" I sad that in late May to early June there would be a surge in Covid-19 infections, and that a week or two later the numbers of deaths would skyrocket.

Well here it is in mid-June, and for about a solid week, the infection numbers have been steadily increasing and setting daily records in many RED states.

Now we will see the numbers of deaths start to increase significantly.  (I am not WISHING that on anybody.  I am just stating what the time-dependent data from other ""hot spots"" tells us.)

If I can accurately make such predictions, and I am not a pandemics specialist, how come our fearless leader in Washington, DC, who has access to ""the very best people"" (or at least hose that he has not yet fired in pique) cannot get that through his thick skull?

And how about ""Father Mike Pence"" (you know, the guy married to ""Mother Pence""), the self-proclaimed Christian, who cannot find in his heart the decency to try to warn and to protect his fellow citizens, not even the conservative ones?

These two, Trump and Pence, are beneath contempt.

Voting AGAINST them should be an easy decision for anyone with an ounce of respect for his or her fellow man or woman."

2020-06-18 02:40:32,"A global pandemic required a global response. Unfortunately Trump has displayed a monumental lack of leadership.

    In May the CDC determined that most cases in the United States arrived from Europe, not China. Throughout February and March three million people from Europe flew into JFK airport in New York City, and no one knew what they were carrying. The virus flooded into America, through JFK, and New York State was inundated as a result.

   New York went into lockdown on March 16th. Covid deaths peaked at 799 in 24 hours in mid-April. Today there were seventeen. 

   The success in New York was due in large part to strong, intelligent leadership by Governor Andrew Cuomo. He has been open with the facts from day one. He has set seven criteria that must be met in order to begin to reopen. It's all science based, and it's working.

   Imagine if Trump had done the same? Countless lives would have been saved, and the economy would be reopening on a solid, science based footing. Instead, we have states all doing there own thing. The virus doesn't know if it's in a Red state or a Blue state. It's just a deadly virus looking to spread. 

   Cases of Covid are spiking in Arizona, Texas and Florida. That's what happens when you don't have a coherent national standard to guide reopening. Trump is failing. I just hope we can make to to November."

He doesn‚Äôt mandate masks, he allows others to mandate masks (so he gets to act like he is taking action while making it a municipality issue). The big issue where I live is that people are filling bars in scottsdale on the weekends. What will a mask ordinance mean in a place where people are eating and drinking in crowds: nothing. I‚Äôve yet to see people eat through a mask. You have to close the bars and restaurants to make an impact on public behavior and disease transmission. Our governor is unwilling, possibly because the republican president is coming by soon. This is ultimately a political posture to get the news to stop talking about AZ. We need real action."

I‚Äôm a clinician at a major academic hospital and I‚Äôm starting to think that every time a large crowd gathers indoors, without masks- we should call in sick.  Or have everyone there sign a release stating they won‚Äôt seek medical care, including a ventilator, should they become sick.

Over 600 medical workers have died caring for Covid patients, and that number is low since we don‚Äôt have the official tally.  

Police stop working because they don‚Äôt *feel* like this is the environment they should have to work in?  Folks go to large, indoor gatherings and governors say ‚Äòindividual responsibility‚Äô rules the day?

Folks have shown up to work, at great risk to themselves and families, to treat every single person, every single day-regardless of PPE availability and poor ‚Äòindividual‚Äô choices.

It is clear that, since the virus struck five months ago, little else is important to the president. Like a sailor on shore leave, the president has thrown off whatever restraints there were in terms of cautionary measures against spreading the virus; it's called contact. 

Tulsa is Saturday; Jacksonville looms; hot cities both. The mixed messaging is the only feature of the administration's ""concern"" with the plague as it moves inexorably from urban to rural areas. No human being has ever stopped the wind, and the COVID-19 is cackling at our puny attempts to curb it.

Doctors Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx have been crystal-clear for months that some kind of face covering and ""social distancing"" are the only ""fail-safe"" measures known to us now, absent a Jonas Salk-like vaccine that defeated polio. But that halcyon day is months, if not years, away. Still, the president wants to bask in the sweltering glory of klieg lights and the deafening cacophony of his groveling worshipers as he moves toward a date with the American voter.

The president's message to all of us is ""you're on your own."" He and his top officials are tested often but that practice has yet to become a substantial practice of communal safety going forward.

It occurs to me, that since the NY Times automatically adjusts the Y-axis on its curves, some of the state trends don't look as alarming to the untrained eye. Texas is a good example. While the trend is distinctly upward and exponential, the scale was just adjusted from 2000 maximum level to 4000 to accommodate the rocketing number of cases. This has the visual impact of ""flattening"". Of course it is required otherwise the latest data would be literally ""off the chart"".

And the world response is also a disaster in many countries."

USA‚Äôs population is 9 times larger than Canada yet it is experiencing 16 times the number of deaths per capita and, much more disturbingly for Americans, 55 times the number of new infections. This means that right now Americans are 6 times more likely to catch the disease right now than Canadians. Assuming roughly equivalent demographics of these two neighbours, this situation can only be caused by behaviours. Canadians largely are united, trust our experts and the science, practice mitigation methods and are shocked, horrified and saddened by what we see south of the border with people egregiously defying disease control advice ... and we re-commit to not acting that way. IMHO, it should be the other way around ... where Americans look, see,  and act appropriately according to places where virus control behaviours are effective. What is it with the American psyche that people can feel empowered to act any way they want to their, or their vulnerable loved ones, destruction?  One anecdotal observation, how is it possible that no one in Tulsa has sought a restraining order to stop the indoor Trump rally on Saturday due to enormous public health risks??"

I just think something really fishy is going on.‚Äù

He listens to a lot of talk radio. That‚Äôs not an assumption he‚Äôs told me he listens to a lot of talk radio. My assumption is he watches some pretty obscure YouTube videos and gets some pretty far out there emails from Reddit newsletters.

And then Republican governors, instead of blaming Trump, blame liberal conspirators for increases of cases in their states instead of basic healthcare policy failings.

The United States under Trump reminds me of the Soviet Union at the time of Chernobyl. The Soviet Union was so possessed with protecting its image, the Soviet leadership wound up destroying an entire city in the world‚Äôs largest nuclear accident, which contributed to the fall of the USSR.

As people further believe the virus is no longer a threat the recommended practices of distancing and wearing masks are a thing of the past.  And we see the results in the rise of infections.  Oops, I forgot.  Mr. President said the numbers would not rise if there was no testing, therefore, no more virus to be concerned about.  This is the same person who claimed wind turbines will cause cancer.  Think about it.

Sorry, Mr. President.  I‚Äôll take the advice of scientists or a charlatan snake oil salesman.

Now the masses are slowly catching up to reality as red state infection rates boom and 'mask' is not quite the dirty word it was yesterday to Trumpsters.

A real President would have embraced reality a long time ago, but America doesn't have that...it has a tiny, little snake oil salesman looking for a quick sale and fraudulent profit.

Now he‚Äôs holding a rally of his own ill informed and gullible followers that will no doubt cost some of their lives for that precious photo op. All of this during the worst pandemic in 100 years. These people will leave this rally after yelling and screaming at each other for hours with no masks. They will stay overnight on stationary cruise ships, where they will drink and carouse with each other into the wee hours. Then, many will board planes where they will continue to spread the disease so that they can spend days spreading the deadly virus among their neighbors and friends.

However, I am sure even some elderly Fox News viewers are taking the pandemic seriously and altering their behavior to minimize their risk and won't go to the rally or even go to the convention if they are a delegate.

Still no wearing of face masks by Trump, Pence or other members of his administration.  And forget about any kind of social distancing at that rally.

I used to be baffled at how Trump could twist facts into his version of ""alternate facts.""  But now, it seems to be game on in the total denial of this virus continuing to spread and gather speed and steam.

That's expected as testing becomes more widespread and the economy is reopening.  But the kicker is, it doesn't matter, as most cases are asymptomatic or mild.  The meaningful number is the death rate, and that is definitely going down, either because the virus already killed all the more vulnerable or because, like most new viruses, it's adapting to the human population, mutating, and becoming less lethal.

As someone who loves history and has read widely and deeply about the 1918 pandemic, reading today's headlines is surreal. With no effort, I can picture these ledes sitting in a future history book. They will have the same unsettling power to startle then in the ways we do now when we look back on history's botched and bloody moments caught in the headlines. 

Because *if* we ever return to a normal in which logic, fact, science, data, the truth, and ethics matter, no one will be able to grasp how a nation ever allowed itself to fall under the spell and power of such a dangerously benighted man. They may well call this the Second Dark Ages.

To grasp how we extricate ourselves from a nightmare in which a sitting president demands that the citizenry do the opposite of what will keep it safe, we have to have the courage to own what went wrong. Collectively, we did this to ourselves. We must start to fight the myriad forces that would have us believe false equivalences, straw dogs, outright lies, convenient falsehoods, cooked up conspiracy theories, and deeply malign beliefs. 

To do that, politicians must be held accountable, fact-checkers must be deployed like an army, journalists must hit higher standards for what they cover and how (the coverage of the campaign went a long way to electing this man) and punditry must take a backseat to objective truth-telling.

Brazil is in the process of giving the world the ""gift"" of seeing what happens when the national government of a very large and very populous country (with some modern infrastructure and access to medical care) completely fails to protect and guide its people in the midst of a pandemic -- and when the population (to a large degree through no fault of its own) does nothing to change its behavior in response to the emergency -- no social distancing, no mask-wearing, no meaningful testing, no tracing, and no isolation of those who have fallen ill.  In short, Brazil will show us exactly what happens when the coronavirus is left to its own devices.

Here in the U.S., it's obvious that what we're seeing is a segment of the country following in the footsteps of Brazil,  and a separate segment of the country taking reasonable and responsible measures to combat the coronavirus.  Already, the health consequences of these separate paths is apparent.

Politically speaking, COVID handed Donald a perfect opportunity to win reelection. All he had to do was hire someone competent and get out of the way. Donald could have taken all of the credit for the accomplishments of his staff and cruised to reelection. Along the way we would have had Contact Tracing like S. Korea, fewer deaths, and a healthier economy.

Unfortunately, Donald wasn't smart enough to see the opportunity. Rather, he chose the macho bravado approach which resulted in many deaths and dealt a crushing blow to our economy. What's worse, Donald didn't learn from his mistakes so he's organizing public rallies which guarantees the spread of COVID. The economy will continue to suffer because spending will be constrained by those of us who can afford to remain separated. I sincerely pity those folks who cannot afford food, medicine or rent.

     President Trump has been horribly wrong almost every step of the way during this virus crisis. As cases and deaths keep rising he will revise his numbers but virtually all of his predictions have fallen flat. And one of the few weapons we have in fighting this scourge, masks, he refuses to embrace, because he doesn't like the way it looks.
   When will his supporters realize he has no clue what he is doing. How many wrong predictions does it take? If a coach loses every game he plays eventually he gets fired. Yet Trump supporters see every one of his covid 19 prediction blow up in his face and yet they still trust him. How much failure can they take?"
2020-06-18 14:58:57,"Fascinating that his followers have to sign a waiver that absolves him of legal culpability should they become sick at his rallies. You'd think they might pause and consider what that says about 1) the risks and 2) them. Perhaps it's confirmation of his jaw-dropping statement--one which helped him win (?!?)-- that he ""loves the uneducated because they love me."" 

 But this raises a provocative legal point for the rest of us. Should our neighbor or co-worker choose to attend, choose to not wear a mask in some sick point-scoring game, get sick, and infect us or our children, do we have legal recourse?

We might consider recording the names of those who attend and do not wear masks and making it a matter of public record. In another time, this would seem too Orwellian to consider, but given this president's overt campaign to endanger all of us, it may be time to consider radical steps. 

The only way reopening has a chance is if everyone abides by commonsense safety protocols. This is no longer about punditry and parties. It's about saving lives. It's not just about them; their choices affect all of us. We're talking life and death, not ideological niceties.

If they have a right to go maskless and refuse to socially distance, do we have a right to hold them accountable should the worst happen? Inquiring minds want to know."

Of course, over this period, we have heard countless interviews with fanatical Trump supporters, most of whom STILL believe, the virus is a hoax and the people who have died from the disease really didn't die.  These are the people that will turn up in droves to one of his rallies, ultimately, being a danger to themselves and those around them.  The question is, going forward, how does one deal with such ignorance and departure from reality? I am not sure you can.

Clearly, there is a certain percentage of the country that have to be strongly considered as ""write offs"".  Whether you call it ""cognitive dissonance"" or the ""Dunning-Kreuger"" effect, with this group , it seems to be ingrained in their DNA."

Moreover, like ripples in a bathtub, waves will rebound, such that infected persons from the South and Southwest will bounce back to other areas, and the Northeast will almost certainly experience a resurgence as businesses and schools reopen in the upcoming months. 

No, the disease is not fading away, no matter how hard or desperately Mr Trump wishes it would. Wishes don't work, sir. Hard science does. But Mr Trump and Mr Pence's suits are not critical thinking. And so it goes."

And yet the anti-Trumpites are doing the same thing with the coronavirus. The pandemic ended at the end of April. Any increases in hospitalizations today are not necessarily due to Covid, esp in urban areas. People are being hospitalized because they didn't get basic medical care for 3 months. Now they are sick. Maybe they also have Covid, found incidentally because all hospital admissions are being tested. There isn't a run on the hospitals, we aren't running out of ventilators, and the dead aren't being stacked like cord wood in the streets. ""Cases"" in a vacuum aren't meaningful. The sick and dying are. The majority of those who were going to get sick or die did so by the end of April. Many will become positive. Few will become sick and/or die. And my proof? 3 weeks since the Memorial Day parties and the protests and the sick and dead numbers are steady or decreasing exponentially. We are being sold a bill of goods. (I know, wait 2 more weeks. it's always 2 more weeks.) In any event, according to their timetable the deaths should be kicking in by the end of June at the absolute latest because of all the flouting of social distancing guidelines since Memorial Day. If they don't, will they concede this is all a lot of nothing? (Of course they won't. ) Like Trump said, ""who you gonna believe, me or your lying eyes""?"

Thanks to our ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not responsible‚Äô president.  Even putting aside all the mistakes and inactions since the pandemic, given the hold he still has on  the reluctant, conspiracy-mongering part of the population, he could actually convince them to do the right thing, and start wearing a mask himself, instead of deriding those who do (as seen in a Trump ad showing Biden with a mask, labeled ‚ÄòSleepy Joe‚Äô, associating masks with a lack of vitality).

What we've done, and evidently will continue to do, is like acknowledging that the house is burning down and putting out part of the fire, figuring ""Well this area over here is fine, so what's the big deal? There's just some stuff smoldering over there. Let's go have a beer."""

There's no mistaking the fact that we are a divided country. There's no mistaking the fact that the divide has been created with intent. There's no mistaking that a swath of the population on both sides revels in the suffering of the other side and are making an active choice to inflict the suffering grounded in ""righteousness"" and ""liberty"".

Next in line when it relates to culpability are those governors who risked their citizens' lives and health so as not to lose ""favor"" from their boss in the Oval Office.  And of course that translates into votes from their MAGA family constituents.  Now we face too many states opening up too soon for the sake of the economy.   Livelihoods are important, indeed crucial.

2020-06-18 14:52:26,"President Trump says ‚Äúthe coronavirus is fading away‚Äù. If only he would just ‚Äúfade away‚Äù. A few days ago I watched a video interview with him shot in the 1990s. At that time he was very sharp and as smooth as the proverbial cucumber. 

Then I saw him today. His acuity has obviously declined a great deal. In 2020 our president just makes stuff up as he goes along. He  appears incapable of differentiating between reality and the way he wishes things were. 

Bolton‚Äôs book should force Republican Senators to accept the fact that our President is becoming less coherent and more of a racist  mad man every day he remains in office. 

Trump will be under increasing pressure as we approach November. When half the country realizes we opened up for business too soon. our economic outlook will revert to where it was in April. And as the coronavirus hits harder again in parts of the country that lucked out early on, investors will finally absorb the fact that our economy is wrecked. The DJIA will collapse to 10,000 or so. Kindergartens through graduate schools will be hit hard in September and October. 

As this perfect storm demolishes our economy as well as our president‚Äôs equilibrium, November will be a historic low point in American history rivaling the Great Depression.  And we are ALL to blame because we installed Trump as chief executive!"
2020-06-18 15:21:40,"First Trump disputed the facts of his inaugural crowd- so desperate to be bigger than Obama's. Then he promised a tax cut for everyone that feathered the wealthiest nests, kept firing staff and high level appointees until chaos- not competence- dominated the NSC & cabinet. Then Putin, Un and debacles of faux diplomacy leading to Zelensky & Ukraine impeachment. Then the failure of courage to face the pandemic with foolish briefing blather & disinformation. Then QAnon tweets..and the virus is ""fading away.""
By only protecting himself and hopes for reelection, Trump has betrayed his oath of office and the American people. He may wage the most vicious campaign against Biden- dredging up every slip & gaffe- but there is no way to erase the cumulative disgrace of his presidency. The Emperor has no facts."

No, it is not really the fed govt, it is the states that should decide what to do in close cooperation with the fed govt.

But he‚Äôs not just obsessed with winning: he fears facing criminal prosecution and possible conviction and incarceration if he lost presidency on 1/20/21 because many of crimes with which he may be charged has a 5 year statute of limitations. If he wins, he‚Äôs insulated from prosecution. If he loses, he loses that protection.

I take at least three things away from these quotes. One, while our leaders claim the virus is fading away, they don't really think it is because they expect people to get sick, therefore the need for waivers.

Two, if people do get sick, they don't want responsibility because they clearly don't care about their constituents.

And, three, the people who are deluded enough to go to this rally and take this risk without protection and recourse are truly part of the reason this disease is still getting worse in many states, including some of the most populous. In fact, the state hosting the rally has just had its worst day of infection increases since this all started. 

All of this nonsense, on the part of this deluded leadership and their blind followers, according to the article will lead to 200,000 deaths in the US by September. I guess for these folks, as long as they are not one of those 200,000, who cares. Not to mention the 100s of thousands that will fall acutely sick and overwhelm the health system once again.

The strategy is predicated (cynically) on convincing  Americans, in the face of medical and scientific evidence to the contrary,  that the worst is over and the economy can now be kicked back into high gear. In his mind when the numbers begin rising he'll take credit and try and ride that horse back into office in the fall. So, the question is: Are you willing to Die for Don? Are you willing to Get Sick for Don? Do you want to be part of the great American return to work and maybe get sick program? Of course not.

When I was in Vietnam serving in the Army occasionally experienced grunts would share their survival advice with us scared and nervous new arrivals.

If there was a group many of us would eagerly surround him and listen intently to every word of advice.  But there were always a few that would meander off - totally disinterested. 

Why? You would think we all share the same basic instinct to survive. The answer is simple: they just don‚Äôt care. 

So don‚Äôt be surprised if some ‚Äì or in my experience - many ‚Äì of those around you dismiss learned advice from the experts regarding how to maximize their chances of surviving the COVID-19 Global Pandemic.

But Arizona doesn't only have to contend with an inept gov. We're also cursed with Sen McSally who refused to commit to additional financial support for state and local governments during the COVID-19 pandemic, saying taxpayers should not bail them out their mismanagement.

Some gullible Americans actually believe him, much to their detriment.

States, like Florida, Texas, and Arizona, that are ignoring expert guidance and claiming that they had ‚Äúno Federal instructions‚Äù are just passing the buck. Their Governors are either incredibly stupid or playing lethal politics with the lives of their constituents. So much accurate information has been, since the beginning of this pandemic, readily available to anyone that has an ounce of intelligence and is not blind and deaf (or severely brain-damaged). Trump and his fellow thieves and liars have done everything they could to prevent Americans from seeing the truth by distracting, calling FACTS ‚Äúfake‚Äù and personally playing Doctor with a doubt digit IQ at best. TRUMP FAILED at dealing with Covid - and he FAILED MISERABLY. FACT! He is now avoiding the issue, which he knows will not bode well for his re-election campaign that he has been running since his inauguration (such hubris and sociopathy!).

The CDC has solid guidelines out there on how to try and minimize exposure, which includes social distancing, the use of masks when that isn't possible,  keeping store capacity at 50% of normal and requiring masks and distancing. 

The real problem is the governors of those states are afraid to be called out by Trump as weak or a loser, they are afraid his sub moronic base will retaliate against them, and they are afraid to act without Donny Dimwit giving them the okay.

My son lives in Houston and not only do people not use masks and distance, they actively harass those who do; and guess where they get that from? 

That doesn't excuse the governors, though, at this point it is will known what works and what doesn't, the problem is that they aren't leaders, a real leader who has concerns for those they lead will act as they think needs to be done and will take the consequences for it. It is ironic, a Texan, LBJ, is a classic example of this, he got the civil rights and voting rights bills through the Congress and when he signed it, said he was giving the south to the Republicans."

Stuff isn't changing at all in Tulsa. At the Donald J. Trump Kool-Aide ball, masks will be optional, physical distancing will not be done, the pandemic hoax will be over, and a waiver will absolve Donald J. Trump of responsibility for the sickness and deaths of attendees. 

The waiver won't cover the tens of thousands of folks who get sick and die, whom the attendees infect. The waiver won't cover the doctors and nurses who get sick or die. The waiver won't cover the residents of Tulsa who had nothing to do with the Kool-Aide ball, who get sick or die.

You could save some lives. Florida Governor is only concerned about supporting Trump and has said that he will not close down again.  NYT reported elsewhere in a linked article, that Florida has been classifying many cases of Covid as only pneumonia. There is a big uptick in reported pneumonia, that is completely inconsistent with incidence of reported pneumonia in prior years. You reported that the state official who was responsible for reporting morbidity and mortality data refused to misclassify Covid cases as only pneumonia, and she quit rather than participate in this deception.

He does think it's the government's right to interfere in women's most personal decisions, which carry life-long consequences, including the risk of injury and death - consequences he would never suffer.

Even when faced with a pandemic, with uncertainty and grave risk, if it isn't something Americans think will impact them personally, they just don't care.  It makes me very, very sad. And scared. 
And trump, ultimate con man, who cares nothing for anyone other than himself, knows this and delights in playing into it. Why else would he seek the thrill of packing 19,000 people into an arena to cheer for him.  He is the god, the creator,  reveling in the power to out all of his followers at risk.

The report, albeit it small, that antibodies in some Coronavirus patients may last only months is discouraging as it raises the possibility that a vaccine may be of limited value. Coronavirus deaths and hospitalizations are falling. The increase in all hospitalizations evidently reflects admissions for other illnesses.

Anyone who tests positive is out. Those who test negative will have to stay together and travel as a unit to keep them negative. 

They will need to be sequestered together in a living facility like a hotel where all the hotel workers will also have to be tested and kept together lest they become infected. We'll have to find bus drivers who test negative and get sterilized buses to exclusively transport players, equipment, and associated personnel to and from the hotels and the sports facilities. They too will need to be sequestered. There is no point to letting these people roam at will as they can contract the virus immediately after testing negative merely by coming into contact with a positive or the leavings of a positive. 

Point? There is no way to do this without exposing people to disease and death. Sports aren't worth it. I think we can live without sports for awhile."

We are going to see over a million friends and families find each other after they've grieved. Which will turn into anger and rage - and action. I really think Trump will have met his match with those who lost loved ones to COVID-19. It's clear as day that he ignored this because it'd make him look bad for his re-election. And every day we get a little bit more information that he lies about everything, he's been undercounting the numbers so people just shut up and go back to their $8/hour jobs, he's not sending out any more stimulus checks to anyone, and the extra bit we got from unemployment I'm sure will be gone soon enough. 

We need to be ready. This first wave showed us which governors are truly desperate enough to do anything for Trump. All have said they're not shutting down again no matter what. Think about that for a moment. Our lives are expendable if it means Trump and his rich friends would get more money squeezing the life out of us, $8/hr at a time. And I'm seeing more jobs get laid off. Permanently. And these are good jobs!

I digress, he will not follow the law or tries not to, but the Supreme Court seems to rein him in. he does not seem to understand what the protest are about and he thinks force will work against the power of the people (think Vietnam). if he gets reelected I think our Democracy is doomed.

And even if it isn't a hoax, it's just the flu. It will disappear, like a miracle.  Some people may die, but they would have died someday anyway.

And there wouldn't be so many cases if we weren't testing.  So, we should stop testing immediately and all the cases would go away.

And even if it isn't a hoax, and some people get sick at trump's rally, they have signed away their right to sue him for showing up.  There's no illness, but sign here anyway.

I wish we, on behalf of the front line healthcare workers and those who otherwise bear responsibility and financial cost for their treatment, could get trumpites who get sick to sign away their right to medical attention.

Right now the reports of positive cases among athletes is almost exclusively coming from states that either were aggressive in opening or never really locked down (Kansas as an example). Some of the schools did not test the athletes as they came on campus for the first time if they showed no symptoms which frankly is just stupid given how among the young they are more likely to be positive and asymptomatic. 

Sometimes in life if you want one thing bad enough you have to sacrifice. That will be the question for these athletes to answer until there is an effective vaccine."

But that younger age group tested positive at almost twice the rate as the state as a whole, according to FDOH's new pediatric COVID-19 case report released June 12.

Statewide, 3,407 residents under age 18 have tested positive, or 9.2% of the 37,211 tested, compared with the overall 5% positive results (73,650) among Florida's residents who have tested for the virus. Including non-residents, 75,568 people have tested positive, or 5% of the 1.4 million tested.

As of June 15, 77,326 residents and non-residents of Florida had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, and 2,938 have died from the disease, but none of those deaths were under the age of 18. According to FDOH's June 12 pediatric COVID-19 case report, however, 103 (3%) of the children under age 18 who tested positive for the virus had to be hospitalized.

These are facts that Trump and Pence cannot ignore or talk away no matter what they instruct the governors to do. We all want this pandemic to end, but ignoring the consequences of mass gatherings without social distancing doesn't mean the virus spreading will abate.

We should be in a position, after shutting down, to do the tracing and testing that is necessary to stamp out embers. But so many places squandered the shutdown, acting as if that was the cure, not the delay necessary to put long term plans in place. We won't be able to do so if we have a lot of large gatherings, events that lead to superspreaders. 

And the federal response was lame, if not outright inept. We don't have enough medical grade masks for medical workers - not just N95s, but basic moisture resistant surgical masks. We don't really have adequate testing, fast turn around and lots of supplies. We could, but the government is afraid of ordering the capacity and somehow turning into Venuezula.

And we don't have enough disposable masks for the public. As summer burns, people won't wear hot, cloth masks.
 
Trump is holding rallies, masks optional, chanting and massive photo op required. Las Vegas is open, as a commercial told me last night. In NY we have not only the possibility of spread through good faith protests, but from people gathering at bars.

Why not give us all the facts so we can see the situation for ourselves and judge Pence's claims on their merits?

The testing data should be presented where you have everything else so we can see positive cases as a percentage of tests done, which is the only metric New York cares about if you've been watching the governor recently.

A caveat that ""states have had recent growth ... in part because some have recently ramped up their testing capacity"" tells us nothing except that the analysis fails to provide the whole story and just serves to leave enormous wiggle room for politicians to make misleading claims.

2020-06-16 11:10:08,"Of course Pence is downplaying the virus. For him, as for Trump et al, it is all about trying to proclaim victory, take credit for the 'great' handling of the crisis, and win re-election. Upticks in hospitalizations in places like Arizona are not simply about more testing.  The more they proclaim victory, the more we see throngs of folks on beaches, in restaurants, in stores, cafes, and malls without masks or distancing. 

Even here in Illinois where both the gov and Chicago's mayor have been extremely cautious and careful with opening up I am seeing more folks without masks and less being careful about distancing. 

We, as a nation, may have to learn the hard way that simply because we have decided we are done with the virus does not mean that the virus is done with us."

2020-06-16 11:09:38,"In a way, the administration has a point. The same would be true if we stopped Pap tests. There would be fewer cases of cervical cancer. If we stopped mammograms, fewer cases of breast cancer. Stop colonoscopies, fewer cases of colon cancer. So simple. 

More deaths, of course. Just fewer cases of reportable diseases. 

You first, Mr. Pence"
2020-06-16 11:11:00,"The administration has adopted the position that the American public is stupid, that we don't read or understand what we read, that we can be deceived into undertaking activities dangerous to our health.  Even if testing were indeed partly the reason we see a spike in cases, that means the virus is present and we can contract it. There are also increased hospitalizations.  How does the administration spin that inconvenient truth?  The tragedy here is that we still have no national plan.  If we had had humane, intelligent actors in the White House back in January, we would not have seen so much chaos and death, so much more domestic abuse, so many people not seeking health care for other serious illness.  The consequences of this pandemic go beyond the 115,000 deaths, and they are bad enough, but all of it, including economic devastation, is the result of the current regime's incompetence and self-regard."
2020-06-16 11:08:44,"Just use the number of hospital beds devoted to Covid cases to gauge our progress. And that is increasing now, not going down in hot spots around the country.

If I were him I'd want testing to determine who could attend. But like a child who closes their eyes to make an angry parent disappear, trump believes not testing will make the virus disappear. Well, what you don't see can kill you. Clouds of aerosol virus particles will be there. Is the Oklahoma governor, Tulsa mayor or local meat plant owners going to make trump sign a waiver should he be infected?"

2020-06-16 11:19:49,"We could really use a Constitutional amendment to prevent presidents from serving a second term. Much of the machinery of government can and often does get distorted to promote a sittiing president's re-election. This is of course to the detriment of the people and of the morale and continuity required for effective career civil servants. In the context of a pandemic, the effects can be widespread and tragic.

Government is not primarily an exercise in PR, and incentives are paramount when constraints are ignored. The presidency is too important and too powerful to be splitting its authority between governing and re-election."
2020-06-16 11:22:10,"Pence would be correct if results were given as the total number of positive cases in a State.  Obviously, as more people are tested, the higher the number of cases that will be found. But results of testing should best be presented as ‚Ä†he PERCENTAGE of a population that is positive. Thus, if there is an infection rate of say 1% positive throughout a large homogenous area, you would still end up with 1% whether you tested 1000 or 1 million.  But places are generally not homogenous for infections. In New York City there may be neighborhoods with infection rates of less than 1% not far from other neighborhoods with rates approaching 50%.  Thus, if you tested more people from 1% as opposed to 50% neighborhoods, you would end up with an overall lower citywide infection rate, whereas if you tested more from the high infection neighborhood, your overall citywide rate would show a higher percentage of infections than actually exist.  So, Pence needs to present infection rates as percentages rather than total numbers in order to properly compare infection rates over time."

Please explain to the Governors and the American people why it is that a state  like Pennsylvania for example where testing also has increased but 'viola' the numbers for those testing positive have not. 
Could it possibly be that a sensible Governor locked down the state 2 weeks before your Stable Genius did anything other than play Golf and rally his troops.
 Or perhaps the same Governor despite the Bullying Tweets from the Stable Genius refused to open , the state up before it was safe to do so. 
Or maybe Mr VP its because the wearing of masks is mandated state wide when you enter a public building, or you are unable to Social Distance outdoors. A rule your boss chose to ignore on a visit to a plant that makes Masks , refusing to wear one in front of the media, this from onewho calls Liberals thinned skinned.

So No Mr VP, the Spike in infections rests at the feet of yourself , your Stable Genius boss, and the woefully stupid Governors and citizens who listen to the lies that comes out of your collective mouths.

I was not obfuscating but clarifying. Is there anyone who seriously doubts that opening up will not cause more infections and, conceivably more deaths ( a critical metric)? The task of Governors and individual citizens is to gauge the percent increase in the most significant metrics to make individual decisions and government policy. The economy is a factor to consider, individual small and large businesses will consider all this too. No one should doubt politics will play a role. It should not."
2020-06-16 11:20:44,"Mr. Pence:

This is nonsense. The rise in testing is confirming that there are more cases then previously known.

By your logic, testing *causes* COVID19. The cases exist, testing or not. The more we test, the more cases we will officially identify. Whether we test or not, the cases are still there.

Think of it like a DUI checkpoint. With or without the checkpoint, the drunk drivers are out in exactly the same number. The checkpoint or the test is a public warning. They do not change the facts, they only highlight them."

For Pence, this is the Indiana HIV debacle repeated. The people who die are not worth saving. In the case of HIV, it was drug users and gays. In Pence-think, they made their choices and they need to suffer the consequences. In this case, the poor, the elderly and people of color all suffer disproportionately, but in Pence-think, it's just their fate to suffer, so why try too hard to fight it? The poor choose their lifestyle of poverty by refusing to find jobs. The elderly have lived good lives and should be proud to sacrifice their lives for American Greatness. And people of color just need to stop complaining and overcome their obstacles, like Oprah or RuPaul or Mark Rubio. They made it, so anyone can... in Penceland.

Yes, this number is slowly decreasing nationwide and yes, more people are seeking the care they‚Äôve delayed so hospitalizations overall are increasing. But it‚Äôs important to be precise when quoting these figures. And it‚Äôs important to look at hospitalizations at local levels as a good indicator of community spreading. 
Then the other idiot: ‚Äúif we didn‚Äôt test, we wouldn‚Äôt have cases.‚Äù They‚Äôd still be there! Even babies understand before 1 yo that objects still exist even if they can‚Äôt see them!

So even though a virus spreads whether you test for it or not, to them the virus cases didn‚Äôt exist until they tested for it.  It‚Äôs the cutting edge science behind the peek-a-boo game that one plays with an infant.

But it makes sense that they think this way, scientists have proven over and over again that extended and repeated use of Non Disclosure Agreements numbs one to what actually exists and what doesn‚Äôt.

Let's say you test positive? Are you confined to your home? How about going out, is that prohibited to you? Will you have to wear a little yellow star if you're allowed out? Do you get arrested? 

It's a big fake. It's spinning our wheels because we don't have anything else to talk about in connection with the virus until a cure and a vaccine come along."

This is much like the ""spike in crime"" in Chicago when a new mayor began honest reporting. In that case of course, they ""fixed"" it by resuming the lies. Perhaps Pence thinks to use the same ""fix"" for new virus reports."

And for what? These guys? Propaganda, American style, just as deadly as any Enemy of the State of the history of the USA, all home grown and calmly labelled as fact.

USA has a politicized public health response which has led to the highest number of infections and deaths in the developed world.

It takes a lot of work to contain a deadly virus and we aren‚Äôt up to the job.  The real problem is we have a political party that really is a religion, an anti-science, highly superstitious religion.

2020-06-16 12:13:33,"For all practical purposes Trump has decided that allowing  ""herd immunity"" to occur is the best way to deal with the coronavirus. He  has ""moved on to campaigning  telling hospitals and hospital workers: ""you deal with it""."
2020-06-16 12:06:41,"Due to differences in population density, the path of the virus through the southern and Midwest states was never going to look like that seen in the big population centers in the northeast.    One could have predicted that the case growth there would have been more tempered but likely more elongated, as people in the south traveled and mixed with one another.   Now, since venturing out (without regard for masks or distancing) has become a political statement, these states are seeing the problem up close and personal.   And the conduct of Trump, Pence, is acting as an accelerant.  As several of these states are already approaching ICU capacity,  I think Mr. Trump should expect blowback from these red states in the run-up to the election."
2020-06-16 12:08:04,"It's worth remembering that when Pence speaks, it is the voice of the Koch brothers and the VP is not about to bite the hand that finances his political life.  Why would he serve the people when he has his own interests to protect, not to mention the interests of his handlers?"
2020-06-16 12:32:20,Linking numbers to testing is perfect logic.  More testing = higher numbers. Less testing = lower numbers. But it does NOT mean lower incidence of infection.
2020-06-16 12:39:50,"Painful as it undoubtedly is for partisans here, Pence is probably largely correct.

Comparing the UK, France, Italy, Spain, and the US, the number of tests per 1000 population is much higher in the US than in all of the others except Italy which is a little higher that the US.  The number of virus cases per1000 population is very much higher in the US than in all 4 of the others.  However, the number of deaths per 1000 population from the virus is very much LOWER in the US than in all 4 of the others.

Unless you are going to admit that medical care for virus patients is far superior in the US compared to the socialist medical care in all 4 of the others, then it sure looks as though the US is simply identifying more cases but the incidence of the disease is not really greater.  Indeed, the incidence of the disease is probably less in the US since so many fewer deaths have resulted from it."
2020-06-16 12:40:52,"While it may be true that more testing is resulting in more positive results, it's also true that more positives means you get the hospitalizations and fatalities that come with it."
2020-06-16 12:22:40,Hang on. There is some data here that the reporters are ignoring. The mortality rate in the US is falling very fast; much faster than the daily new case rate. This is happening globally. No one is talking about this and it isn't likely due to increased testing. The virus appears to be mutating into a less lethal variant.
2020-06-16 12:34:34,"The important number to look at when testing is the percentage of positive new covid-19 cases one gets from each new batch of covid-19 testing that is done.  For example. If NY tests 100,000 people on Monday and finds of that group 15,000 new cases of positive covid-19 cases it means the rate of infection is 15%.  If on Tuesday NYS tests 120,000 people and finds 18,000 new covid-19 cases in Tuesdays batch of testing it is clear the number of cases per day went up by 3,000 from Monday to Tuesday. However, the increase is still at the rate of 15% positive of total tested. That means the increase of 3,000 new positive cases is purely the result of more testing because the rate of positive cases of those tested in the Tuesday batch is the same as Monday's 15%."
2020-06-16 12:38:54,As a mathgeek I usually like statistics but the virus stats are confusing and misleading.  No stat is more misleading than the number of cases -- as that clearly depends strongly on the number of tests.  The situation may be getting better or worse but the number of cases -- in a vacuum -- tells us nothing either way.
2020-06-16 12:24:58,"I feel like because the results aren't automatic - you don't immediately fall ill or drop dead upon contact with someone with Covid - people are often incapable of grasping the risk.  To understand the spread over a course of 2-4 weeks, that an event a month ago is causing today's outbreaks, you have to not only believe in science, but understand it, and also believe in and understand the scientific methods used by the experts in explaining the spread.  I fear that a large portion of our population, particularly among our government leaders (Republican especially), are incapable or unwilling to digest this."

2020-06-16 12:16:59,The article didn‚Äôt even begin to explain why the Vice President‚Äôs analysis is incorrect. Increased testing doesn‚Äôt change reality. Increased hospitalizations doesn‚Äôt change reality either. You can have both without increased numbers of people who actually have the virus.
2020-06-16 12:27:44,"In my opinion, the worst thing is that trump and pence expect people to believe these statements.

I‚Äôm sure they tested the theory by making the same claims at campaign rallies and they were not questioned.

Albert Einstein is reported to have asked his fellow physicist and friend Niels Bohr whether he realistically believed that 'the moon does not exist if nobody is looking at it.' To this Bohr replied that however hard he (Einstein) may try, he would not be able to prove that it does, thus giving the entire riddle the status of a kind of infallible conjecture‚Äîone that cannot be either proved or disproved.

The difference here is that the coronavirus confirms its presence by killing its victims. The families and friends bury their beloveds. It‚Äôs the exact opposite of an infallible conjecture."

2020-06-16 12:24:36,"As a physician, hearing of this blatant attempt to manipulate data by Mr Pence, I am appalled at the ongoing callous disregard for science, the vetting of actual facts and the dissemination of lies to fit an agenda. This affects real people and has real consequences. 

Just a few days ago, I had a patient from a small town in Colorado angrily trying to convince me that COVID was a 'vast left wing conspiracy' and that 'they' were out to discredit trump and take over the country. Nevermind he was 72 years old and suffering from pneumonia. He was angry because he needed to be tested for COVID. After listening for a minute, I stopped him to describe how we had several critically ill COVID patients on ventilators in the ICU and that when he was finished ranting, I could take him to speak to their family members where he could try to convince them of the malfeasance of those nefarious lefties. That quieted him down immediately, although I suspect he still believes the trump narrative. 

Pence's actions are more evidence that this administration is utterly incompetent in so many realms, and, like trump himself, functioning exclusively from the stance of pathologic narcissism. Everything they say and do is about their attempts to cement power and force reelection.  What better way to do so than to sagely hammer lies that support the cultivated beliefs of the faithful, those unwilling to actually do the requisite study of the issues. 

Failure to think critically will be our undoing"
2020-06-16 12:32:38,"President* Trump lied initially and we have over 100,000 deaths alone in this country.
Trump encouraged, through belittlement and insulting, the governors to ‚Äúopen‚Äù early, or, convinced the weak-minded and science deniers that opening would be fine and dandy.
Many did and now we see the result.

From the day Ms. Conway stated nonsense about ‚Äúalternate fact‚Äù we have been living in a country driven by president who appears to not be able to discern real facts from, well, alternate facts.

In Trump‚Äôs zeal and push to prove he made the best economy than other presidents, that he is the best leader, bigly, that has walked the face of the earth, we suffer in that zealotry.
And the masses cheer.  We know this due to masks are rarely seen-and our leader sets the example.

There may be some skewed data, but, given that few are wearing masks, social distancing and gathering in large crowds the virus, corona virus, was just waiting for opportune time and find willing participants in the dance of death.

It is unbelievable that Pence would encourage the governors to engage in a blatant lie.  But then, the sad abomination of an administration lives in an alternate universe."
2020-06-16 12:38:37,"These are not deeply intellectual leaders. They see facts and data as something to ignore or downplay whenever it doesn't serve the narrative.

It feels very much like a repeat of the Jonestown tragedy is upon us."

2. New Daily cases are still less than the rates seen during the shut down.The shut down had little or no effect on the daily rates of new infection or deaths. Shut downs did little to reduce hospitalizations ( the sole reason to institute them) which were declining before the time experts said we would see a reduction From shut downs.
3. The death rate is declining.While much of that is due to the New York death rate falling off, it also implies that the most vulnerable have already died off or recovered. Of course the virus may have mutated to a less virulent state.
4. There has been no Lake of the Ozarks outbreak.
5. After 2 weeks of riots, protests and mass gatherings across the country no significant new Centers of outbreaks have been noted.
6. Yesterday Texas had 20 new deaths, Florida 7. Death rates in both states are not increasing.
 The bottom line is that COVID-19 was never the health crisis it was purported to be and is certainly not behaving like any predictions from ‚Äú experts‚Äù Claimed it would.
Continuing shut downs and restrictions now is only sustaining economic damage without any medical benefit.

The more important and promising data, however, are the continuing decrease in the death and hospitalization rate from the virus.

On top of that, Trump's failures have crashed our economy and millions are out of work.

Trump and his administration are burying their heads in the sand about the extent of the infections and deaths by discouraging testing and reporting to make ""the numbers"" appear better than they really are.  They think by denying reality and endlessly lying they can somehow make the virus disappear. I also find it revoltingly ironic to hear this statement coming from Mike Pence, whose disastrous mismanagement of a health crisis in Indiana caused a surge of HIV infections in his state.

These are the worst possible people to have in charge during one of the most deadly events in our history.

I look at three factors:

- Deaths--numbers and trends and where they are occurring.
- ICU Capacity-this number is not a good barometer because it depends on hospital capacity per capita. But it's still a reflection of what is happening in the wider community. If the ICU beds are filing up, you have a pandemic in your hands.
- Hospital admissions.... are they rising? What is the Covid ratio?

Prior to reopening, in Indiana, testing was extended only to patients being admitted to hospitals. Patients who were suspected of having mild cases of Covid-19 were simply told to stay at home and self-isolate.

Now there is state provided free testing at convenient locations in primarily rural counties.  So, there are more positive test results. But, the most important metric is number of deaths. As long as that is going down, there is no reason to suspect a resurgence.

Of course, there are 50 states and each state will have a somewhat different story, but, it is hardly misleading to say that more prevalent testing may lead to higher number of positive cases without the actual rate of infection increasing.

Of course, the New York Times has its experts (unnamed) who may say otherwise.  If so, why not name them and quote exactly what they say about the Vice-Presidents comments."

Hospitalizations are a lagging indicator, true, and we need to pay attention to that statistic.

‚ÄòIn fact, seven-day averages in several states with coronavirus outbreaks have increased since May 31, and in at least 14 states, positive cases have outstripped the average number of tests that have been administered,‚Äù
How can this be in 14 states? How can one have more positive cases then tests? Unless they conclude one has the virus without testing for the virus.

His shtick got old, he is overexposed, has jumped the shark, figuratively, obviously, as he can barely walk let alone jump.  

The thing that remains is Trump's access to power.  If he changes military leadership to YES men at this point, it indicates a clear plan to remain in the Presidency despite the election results.  We also have to watch the postal service now that a Trump ally is in charge; I worry about them tampering with absentee and vote-by-mail initiatives.

Because if the numbers are higher then transmission is also more likely to be occurring  than previously believed. And if that is true then public health measures are called for.  At the end of the day the Trump administration's mix of lies, denialism, and magic thinking that has enabled the virus to kill over 115,000 Americans is not going to get the country out of this mess.

She fell, wound up in a 'rehab' facility and died within a couple of days. As far as I know, she was not tested for Covid, but sounded unable to breathe when last we spoke.

It‚Äôs possible 20-50% of the US population has already had covid 19, and didn‚Äôt know. Since it was a new virus (man made IMO) there were no tests available, at least not in mass quantities, to test the whole population. Would have been the same regardless of which party governed. The swine flu of 2009 depleted the national & state stockpile by 75% and was never replenished.  You also realize as we find out more people have had it and didn‚Äôt die, the death rate % will drop even lower, meaning it‚Äôs not as deadly as everyone thought. Focus should have been given to the most vulnerable, nursing homes, elderly, and prisons. Something Democrat Governor‚Äôs did the exact opposite."

On March 6th, Trump lied when he said, ""Anybody who wants a test gets a test.""  Even now there is inadequate testing provided by the federal government.  States on going it alone.  

Having more data allows better data analysis.  Trump's Administration never wants to know the extent of the coronavirus pandemic because Trump ignored it for eight weeks.  He received a PDB warning of a lloming pandemic on January 3rd, then on February 26th said, ""And the 15  in a couple of days is gonna be down to close to zero"".

Today more than 2.2 million Americans are  infected with  coronavirus and 116,108 have died.  The rate of spread is increasing in 20 states.  Trump ignores these statistics because they evidence his failure as a leader.  

Pence and Jared, both designated by The Donald to ""solve"" the pandemic, have offered no solutions.  Mike Pence falsely attributing more cases to more testing ignores a failure to contain the spread which is the true reason for more cases."

2020-06-16 13:22:53,"And the Trump Administration misleads the American public, with Pence contributing to the misrepresentation.  The date changes but the underlying story doesn't.  There is a few small grains of truth here.  The more the public is tested, the larger number of asymptomatic carriers will be detected.  But how does Trump and Pence explain away the increased number of hospitalizations and deaths.  The far right has to now, and continue to claim that there is an overcounting of deaths due to the novel coronavirus.  Actually there was an undercount because the pro-Trump states refused to attributes deaths to coronavirus unless there was a test result showing otherwise.  So there should be a rise based on testing.  Trump and Pence should explain that away."
2020-06-16 13:10:11,"Just look at deaths (or hospitalizations) rather than ""cases"" -- those are more-or-less independent of testing. Those who die from COVID-19 tend to have COVID-19 symptoms and are all tested since the beginning of the pandemic.

Daily deaths are still north of 800 in the US and hardly coming down. It is a lagging indicator and with the reopening craze right now it is likely to not to drop below that in the long run. So, any middle schooler can confirm 200,000 deaths by October.

Per million this makes about 2.3 per day for the US.
The same per-capita number in Germany is now 0.23 -- that is a *tenth*, even as that country is far more densely populated and was nearby the worst outbreak centers.

So, for an industrialized country the US is doing really poorly and any one with 8th grade education and internet access for basic data can figure out this is not ending well."

Right on the face of it, ""increased testing"" can't be a reasonable explanation for these rises in infections, since testing really hasn't increased much.  For example, Oregon has seen a recent increase in Covid-19 infections.  Eyeballing it from graphs on the state's web site, perhaps an 80% increase in daily infections has been seen since late May, a period where daily testing only increased perhaps 10%."

These men need to be brave, to suck it up, to put ahead of themselves, to be willing to sublimate their own ambitions and egos for the sake of the country.  

Embers?  Yes, many covid victims are embers, once they are cremated."
2020-06-16 13:46:58,"This seems a false controversy. Testing simply identifies new cases. Nationwide we have now tested something like twelve percent of the adult population. If our testing was more comprehensive we would have identified many more infections. The idea of blaming testing for anything makes no sense. Testing is just neutral tool to document the spread of infection. What you make of the data and how you choose to respond is something else. But it isn't controversial either to realize that increased economic activity and the dropping of precautions and loosening of social distancing will likely result in a highly contagious virus continuing to spread. Everyone, I had thought, understood this. This is why people should continue to exercise appropriate caution as economic activity resumes. And we should continue to test."

So it is obviously a bit more complex than more testing= more cases. Being led by the people who sit at the corner of the bar would be funny if people weren't actually dying."

When I was young, many moons ago, mothers would have chicken pox parties to expose their young children to the disease.  They didn't know better at that time.  This latest idiocy of the Republicans is almost unbelievable in light of what we know about this virus."
2020-06-16 13:48:36,"Trump doesn't want to count the number of COVID-19 infected and deceased Americans because it makes him look bad (as if that's the only thing that makes him look bad).

Yet, he probably has 10 accountants counting every penny of profits he's made while being President.

If you don't count them, they're not sick.  

And the Trump pastor, Mike Pence, thinks we all believe this garbage.  Unfortunately, close to 40% do believe this garbage."
2020-06-16 13:31:14,"Don't they wish!  Trump and Pence, that is.  I guess they haven't noticed the crowding, the failure to wear masks, the hugging while greeting.  They're like the guy released from the hospital this week - he was on a ventilator and could have died - saying with a bewildered look on this face, ""This is really serious!""  People such as that and such as Pence and Trump help Covid spread.  Thank goodness for Fauci and Cuomo -"
2020-06-16 13:39:38,Whenever I see an article from The New York Times I have to take it with a grain of salt and realize it comes from a place of extreme prejudice and agitation. This is one of the media outlets responsible for stirring up fear and hate in this country.
2020-06-16 13:47:06,Serious question: Why can‚Äôt you be clear and call a lie a lie? So many linguistic backflips to avoid using that simple word when describing Trump and his administration‚Äôs ... lies.

2020-06-16 13:47:55,"OK, Am I a complete idiot here? I read that testing shows there are people infected with the virus and if they weren't tested the numbers would be lower, duh! Really? Testing surely  lets us  know if we have the virus and if we do how to deal. Testing and tracing should go hand in hand. Most of the world has rebounded because they did that and the US is banned from going to a lot of these countries because we didn't and haven't dealt with it in a responsible way. I still just can't believe the numbers are up because of testing, are we supposed to hide it away and not let anyone know?"
2020-06-16 13:34:09,"ÔøºDr. Deborah Brix should be shunned by her peers in the medical community. VP Pence is a martinet. They push false narratives that put public health in dire risk. More than 1,000 Americans are dying each day, yet their canned lies pander to our intellects. One solution is to have Brix and Pence and their Fearless Leader show up maskless in Tulsa. That‚Äôs one favor that this pandemic trio can perform as a public service."
2020-06-16 13:35:01,"Note the body language in the pic.    Trump is closed off and attentive to the spin of VP Pence.    Pence is a sincere liar, who may believe his own story.    He has no knowledge beyond what he wants to believe.    Bill Barr has more intellect than the lot, but simply swallows his disgust to achieve his evil goal to support the supreme leader of the Republican Peoples Party."

2020-06-16 13:38:45,"Well, I guess there is a huge difference between having Covid-19 and officially having Covid-19. Stop the testing and there is no virus. The pandemic is over because we said so...we are the government. If there is anyone whose word I turn to in an crisis it's Mike Pence, Grand Poobah."
2020-06-16 13:43:05,"The most likely reason for the COVID spikes are thousands of protesters who gathered unsafely, ignoring social distancing and protective masks."
2020-06-16 13:31:35,"I guess Vice President Pence hasn't been following Governor Cuomo's briefings if he could say that ""as we speak today, because people are going back to hospitals and elective surgery and getting ordinary care, hospitalization rates may be going up. But according to our most current information, hospitalizations for coronavirus are going down across the country.""

Every day for the past two weeks or so, as NYC eased into reopening, Governor Cuomo has shown graphs of New York versus graphs of the rest of the U.S. and other individual states (e.g. Arizona, Florida). While the rates of Covid-19 cases and Covid hospitalizations in New York continues to go down (and is being carefully monitored now for spikes following reopening plus the protests and lax social distancing in some places), in the rest of the country it's the opposite. The data clearly demonstrates that cases across the country are on the rise. Looking at the graphs of the U.S. and other states vs. NY puts this in stark relief.

In contradicting the data that is already out there to the public Pence is following the Trumpian directive of ""Don't believe what you see or read. It's all Fake News.""

To me, that Trump message at his rallies, which he and the GOP and their mouthpieces hammer home constantly, is the single most detrimental thing that Trump has inflicted on our body politic. It is the Big Lie that undergirds all other lies, big and small, 20,000+ and counting.

It is killing our citizens."
2020-06-16 13:36:18,"This is the new 'Laurel and Hardy Show.' 
The vice president also said that the virus‚Äôs spread was now well contained, and he adopted a term that Mr. Trump has used for the virus ‚Äî ‚Äúembers,‚Äù which can be quickly snuffed out.
One of them says something that is immediately reinforced by the other and none of it makes sense."
2020-06-16 13:43:11,"How does someone sell their souls to such an overt, transparent con-man like trump?  How can a person not see what is so obvious?  Turn off the sound, and it's there in his angry face and gestures; turn off the picture and just listen, and it's there in every word.  There's absolutely nothing in that man that is genuine, not a single characteristic that suggests he cares about anything but himself.   Pence clearly has no idea what it means to ""serve two masters."""

It is crazy land!
2020-06-16 13:37:56,"The pandemic has brought out the worst and most corrupt people and politicians of our lifetimes.   We fear for our lives and we fear for our democracy and our country.  We see Trump scraping the bottom of the barrel for people who will do his bidding in an autocratic manner.  Trump was impeached and he was investigated by Mueller and a shocking abuse of power was shown, yet, his Senate majority refused to acknowledge any of it because they, too,  have become corrupted and terrified of losing their power.  God forgive us for what we have done."

Is it okay to for our government to kill?  It is like the childhood sibling game of ""stop hitting yourself."""
2020-06-16 13:38:57,"Of course Trump calls U.S. testing a ""badge of honor"", blithley glossing over 100,000+ American deaths, irrespective of his not knowing the term ""per capita"" - all statistics being important but sterile terms with the horrific Covid19."
2020-06-16 13:33:14,"Isn‚Äôt this fantastic news?  Cases going up (meaning we‚Äôre advancing toward herd immunity) and hospitalizations and deaths going down. Seems to me this is the best of both worlds. Why the negative spin?  Ohhhh, I know."
2020-06-16 13:38:24,"There is one old saying: If a cat closes its eyes, it will think the entire world has gone dark. In the present scenario, it roughly translates to:  If zero-testing is done, only zero-case will emerge. Ignorance is not bliss, as far as this virus is concerned."
2020-06-16 13:32:36,"Of course they're claiming hospitalizations are down; they are if you include NY in the data. If you take NY out, they are going up. 

Upshot of declaring Covid 'an ember' is that you can say that you don't have to pass any more monetary help for those who need it. Just get back out there an work and consume."
2020-06-16 13:32:55,"I can see why Pence was an unpopular governor. Leading the lies is not usually what someone heading a task force does. They stay on top of information, implement the latest medical recommendations, and provide resources.

In his state, Pence required women to pay for the costs of burials of fetuses of medical abortions, cruelly punishing them and prolonging their suffering.  Trump blocked FEMA disaster funding for COVID victim burials.

Embers are part of any fire no matter what your state of denial."

As a line from a Marx brothers movie, that works well.  As something the President of the United States said, after 100k plus deaths, it's horrifying.  It should be cause for invoking the 25th Amendment, but--the Republican party.  It certainly should be headline news.  Every elected Republican should be forced to respond."

2020-06-16 13:34:39,"Like many others, I have been following the pandemic closely and it is very difficult to understand exactly what is happening.  Of course the statements by Pence and Trump do not help.  But I do think it is important to know if cases in a particular location are concentrated in a prison or nursing home or if they are spread throughout the community.  There are prisons where more than half the inmates have tested positive.  While this prevents a risk for the broader population, it is obviously also a different kind of challenge for public health officials.  It also is important to be able to track COVID hospitalizations.  I thought that the bed counts presented were just for COVID patients.  The president is implying that other patients are being counted.  How about someone from the NYT sorting this out?"
2020-06-16 13:43:09,"If Pence had actually asked Governors for their data leading to the rise in their states, he would have discovered that contrary to only the testing increase states are looking at person to person contact, asymptomatic infections, rise in hospitalizations, and rise in the need for ICU beds.  I believe Vice-president Pence has been deliberatively deceptive giving Americans a false sense of well being."
2020-06-16 13:42:38,"Just more cover ups. But unlike the Russia and Ukraine scandals, the virus cannot be silenced, and it will be hard for the GOP to give cover for this cover up. This pandemic is serving as a magnifying glass to all the bad leadership, vulnerabilities, and injustices in our world. Just look to the countries who handle it well compared to those who don't, then you can clearly see all other issues also handled better. Trumps poor handling is reflective of his disasters on every front."

The Trump/Pence strategy is ""Pretend everything is great, and the voters will believe it is.""  Nothing this administration does is anything other than re-election strategy.  Protecting public health? Reducing the wealth disparity? Safeguarding the environment? Routing out racism and discrimination? Improving public education? Justice for all?  Don't be silly.

They want to pretend that nothing is happening, as if ignoring the virus  will make it go away. Mr. Pence says that there are more cases because testing for the virus has increased. Mr. Trump says that if there were no testing there would hardly be any cases. Can't they understand that this means that the number of cases reported is not accurate because there is not widespread testing? Do they really think that what you don't know doesn't affect you?  It is disgusting that for the sole purpose of shameful politics these people and the political party they represent are ignoring the reality around them. Their attitude brings to the spotlight the little respect they have for the life of the constituents that voted for them looking for a change. Is ignoring the social reality of our country and making the US the laughingstock of the world how America intends to regain its prestige and greatness in the eyes of the world? I think they are driving in the wrong direction and it will backfire at some point.  There are lots of intelligent people in the GOP  that are not blind and deaf fanatics and will think twice if they support their party and reelect the people that have sunk the party in the worst crisis in decades. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence make their best effort to show us they are unfit to occupy the position they hold right now."

I suggest that people examine their own states' data rather than relying on national case counts. When taking all of the information into account, it is clear that in NC the increase in number of new cases is not simply due to increased testing.

2020-06-16 14:15:50,"To bad our leaders are so weak in math.  If the percent positive rate goes up with greater testing, the case increases are not due to just increased testing.  In many of the spiking areas e.g. Arizona, the percent positive rate has increased significantly even though the testing rate has remained high for the past several weeks.  I was there mid-May when they opened and the crowds to get into restaurants and bars were very large.  Still the republican governor doesn't want to enforce masks. With a high minority population at increased risk, this is a terrible lack of humanity.

I hope the Governors have the good sense to explain to their constituents what percentage of tests conducted are positive now as opposed to earlier in the pandemic. That way a true increase in cases can be distinguished from more widely available testing effects. Oh. Wait. Can't do that. There was very little testing available earlier in the pandemic, so only the sickest people were tested and therefore more were positive. That's just one more big issue Pence lied about.

Trench warfare, battles to gain pieces of ground regardless of cost, ordering masses of bodies to surge against fusillades of opposing bullets and cannons.  The outcome was a stalemate, little ground was gained, many lives were wasted.

Today the President is commanding states to compel their citizens into the trenches of retail trade and other commercial venues.  His order dooms masses of citizens in what is a foggy war between advocates for public health versus economic gains, where the fog is laced with the COVID19 virus.

What outcome can be expected from these orders by the Commander-in-Chief?  Masses of citizens infected by COVID19 in his campaign to gain electoral votes, a stalemate that will not win him ground but will waste many lives."

I had said over 3 months to anyone who cared to listen that we will not be home safe, free from COVID-19 menace until we have eradicated the virus entirely from all lives in our planet. So no surprise that spikes will be seen and spread will continue sporadically and continuously for many more months.

Yes the vaccine will help a great deal but in the meantime, panic will not be productive and our response should not be such that it cripples the livelihoods of millions or paralyzes our abilities to provide health care for all the other illnesses and causes of death."

2020-06-16 15:04:34,"The strategy of ""stay at home"" was to ""flatten the curve"" of spreading the infection. Its purpose was to not overrun hospitals and medical resources. Remember in the beginning deblasio and Cuomo screaming about how ny was going to be overrun. Deblasio screamed so loud the USN Hospital ship Comfort came to NYC and Javits Center was turned into a hospital. These measures were basically unnecessary and the ship is now somewhere else. We also knew that once we started to reopen, cases would increase but that hospitals wouldn't be overrun. That was the original plan. We also knew that as we increased testing, cases would rise b/c mild or non symptomatic cases would be discovered that were not discovered earlier in the crisis.  So yes, cases are increasing, as we expected they would, due to lifting ""stay at home"" AND increased testing. I'm not sure how or why ""stay at home"" changed to ""when there's a vaccine"" or how people now only expect to see cases continue to go down like we are still under ""stay at home"". We knew that was never going to happen. At this point, it's not running rampant and people need to decide what level of risk they are willing to accept. An article this week reports that food shopping is one of the lowest risk activities. So people can shop for food but maybe you dont want to eat out. That's your choice. But to expect we were going to completely eradicate the virus is, and always was, fully. Now it's time to move forward, slowly, but forward."

Pence should focus, better yet, on going over the New Testament so that when The Donald sports the Holy Bible he can know a thing or two. 2nd Corinthians sounds better than ""2 Corinthians (""go into a bar"", insert your favorite start to a stand-up bit).

Dr. Birx is quickly losing any credibility she once had and acts begins to act like any other Trump sycophant. Statistically, if the hospitalizations are increasing the mortality rates increase on a time delayed basis. If the number of cases go up the hospitalizations will increase proportionately.

Note that it says ‚Äúa reason,‚Äù and not ‚Äúthe major reason.‚Äù

Most cases of covid are aymptomatic, and will go undocumented without testing. Increased testing will, indeed, detect many aysmptomtic cases, and lead to higher cases counts. I don‚Äôt myself know if this is one of the explanations of the reported rise in numbers, but it seems plausible.  Frankly, it's more complex than this article indicates. I await the word from experts.

One thing that the article gets right concerns masks. Masks are an effective way of reducing spread of the virus, and it is disturbing to see photos of administration officials not wearing them.

It is notable that the Times is guilty in this regard as well. The Times printed many columns and editorials encouraging mass protests in response to the murder of Mr. Floyd and racism. Most such protests violated legally binding lockdown and social distancing requirements. Further, the Times did not emphasize the need for masks. Many protestors wore masks, but many did not."

2020-06-16 14:46:53,"A concern, perhaps a quibble, about the headline and the wording of the article, particularly the prominent use of the word ""misleading."" Doubtless, the Pence message is shaped by politics--all is well in the world and getting better. But I am not sure that the overall statement--the number of positive tests is largely a function of a greater number of tests--is false.
 
For instance, in Louisiana, we have per capita done a great deal of testing. We have seen some increases in the number of infected persons reported each day. But for example, there have been instances when the higher numbers were the result of an extremely high number of lab test results being reported for testing done four to six weeks ago.
 
My point is that the interpretation of the testing data is complex. For me, the real number to consider is the number of people hospitalized because of Covid-19. If truly the number of people being infected is materially increasing, that increase should be reflected in the number of hospitalizations, which is a relatively hard number.
 
And I offer this comment because I am concerned about this newspaper taking an increasingly adversarial role in its news articles towards the Trump administration--especially in the wording of headlines and articles. The most precious thing any newspaper can have is a reputation for excellence, accuracy and fairness. Don't tarnish it."

A while back, you could not even get tested without having symptoms. Now the article points out a rise in asymptomatic tests results.

2020-06-16 16:37:48,"The strategy of ""stay at home"" was to ""flatten the curve"" of spreading the infection. Its purpose was to not overrun hospitals and medical resources. Remember early on deblasio and Cuomo screaming about how ny was going to be overrun. Deblasio screamed so loud the USN Hospital ship Comfort came to NYC and Javits Center was turned into a hospital. These measures were basically unnecessary and the ship is now somewhere else. We also knew that once we started to reopen, cases would increase but that hospitals wouldn't be overrun. That was the original plan. We also knew that as we increased testing, cases would rise b/c mild or non symptomatic cases would be discovered that were not discovered earlier in the crisis.  So yes, cases are increasing, as we expected they would, due to lifting ""stay at home"" AND increased testing. I'm not sure how or why ""stay at home"" changed to ""when there's a vaccine"" or how people now only expect to see cases continue to go down like we are still under ""stay at home"". We knew that was never going to happen. At this point, it's not running rampant & people need to decide what level of risk they are willing to accept. An article this week reported that grocery shopping was a very low risk activity. So you can go buy your food but maybe dont want to risk dining out. That's your choice. But to expect that ""stay at home"" was going to completely eradicate the virus was never the expectation and is utter folly. Time to move forward, slowly, but forward."

At issue: Trump's obsessive urge to encourage premature reopening, ignore experts' advice to wear masks and observe social distancing, launch new culture wars against Democratic governors and legislatures, and hold rallies.  Behind all this is Trump's driving need to be re-elected, plausibly to leverage his position for even more money for his family and himself, and escape punishment for crimes in office.  The main reason for the surge in infection is the reopening, not the increase in testing.  But when did Trump or Pence ever care for facts which didn't suit them?

Most of the coronavirus/Covid-19 cases, especially the severe cases, were spread in the nursing homes, live in care facilities, hospitals, other healthcare related services,  and prisons.

I know of three persons  who were infected with Coronavirus, all while working with Covid-19 patients in a hospital without adequate PPE.

Sadly,  two individuals infected their families at home, resulting in deaths of parents and siblings. 

This is not community spread.  This is management incompetence in healthcare and live in care facilities. 

This detailed data needs to be added to the published reports. 

Healthy, working/school age people have nothing to fear, but need to take precautions around family members who may be vulnerable, and work with them to improve their health. 

If you're not healthy with preventable chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity,  start eating a healthy diet and exercise.

Sugary, salty wheat, soy, and corn based processed foods and drinks need to be banned. This will reduce the deadliness of future Coronavirus, annual flu, and future nursing home population by 80 to 90 percent.

2020-06-16 17:15:15,"""If we stop testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any."" This is Trump's prescription for ending the Covid-19 epidemic in the United States. Essentially he is saying that if we refuse to face the situation, it will not exist. 
As anyone with any sense knows, the key to getting Covid-19 under control is a rigorous program of testing, contact tracing, and quarantine. Absent that, there is absolutely no way of determining who is ill and no hope of halting the spread of Covid-19. 
Bear in mind that is is a virus to which none of us has any immunity and for which there is no vaccine. The long-term effects of contracting it are yet to be determined, although there is evidence that previously healthy individuals have been ill for months and others who have recovered from the respiratory aspects of the disease have later died of virus induced strokes.
The lack of strict enforcement of mask wearing and social distancing, combined with the absence of a rigorous testing program leaves all of us vulnerable. Even those of us who have been conscious about social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing, and remaining at home can not be sure that our efforts will not be undone by an irresponsible person who does not take the situation seriously.
Trump and Pence have no concept of the seriousness of the situation and simply do not care about the health and safety of the average American."

In a few coastal states, cases have gone up at a rate that can be explained by the increase in testing, and percentage positive cases haven‚Äôt increased there.

But in MANY states, cases have increased while testing has decreased. Or cases have increased markedly in a way that exceeds the increase in testing.

Being nearly 70 years old with multiple known underlying vulnerabilities  I was anxious to get tested, but the county ""health authority"" seemed more interested in NOT testing, possibly to keep the number of reported cases at only 7 as a boon to tourism. So while I agree that the reported numbers in this country don't accurately reflect the true extent of infection, it's probably WORSE in some areas than what is reported."
2020-06-16 22:22:57,"The irrational focus on the percent of tests that return a positive finding as a trigger for further reopening is the problem here. The daily repeat testing of healthcare workers and other frontline workers that continue to be (thankfully) negative serve to dilute the positive results from the general public and lower the positive percentages if officials choose to do so.

What's important instead is the per capita incidence of covid disease among the state or county population, both over the duration of the outbreak and also especially on a recurring weekly or biweekly basis. highlighting new infections. Is the extent of infection increasing or decreasing? 

Persons with symptoms seek testing while mostly those without symptoms don't, skewing the percentages. Conversely, as mentioned, those in most danger of infection due to professional exposure get repeatedly tested to ensure they are continuing to be negative. How one corrects for these two realities to interpret tabulated test findings and learn the frequency of covid infection among a general population is unclear to me. Find a better metric to measure success toward reopening."

According to the antibody testing done by NY's health department, essential workers in NYC had a lower percentage of positive cases than in the general population.  That is an indication that the personal protection they used made a difference and may say something about the diligence of essential workers compared to the general population.   Using zip code data for comparison is misleading since zip code populations vary.  The article indicates that the percentage of Covid cases wasn't ""particularly high"" in these neighborhoods on a per capita base.
There was no reason to reference ""Rich New Yorkers"" in the title of the article.  First, the article doesn't even prove they left in the areas surveyed.

Despite his rhetoric, this has in no way changed under the current mayor - and in fact he is also a toady to real estate interests. His complete managerial incompetence obviously does not help. It is obvious that this will especially plague areas like much - if not most - of the Bronx, and I clearly recall that well into the onslaught of the virus we were still seeing photos of quite crowded subway cars on the downtown  2 line originating in some of the poorest Bronx (and Uptown Manhattan) neighborhoods."

The brave and resilient people who now reside there are the same as those that preceded them.

The wealthy people of Manhattan should take up the petition to grant you these overdue benefits.

Apparently, their aberrant behavior was at fault.  Even Gov. Cuomo seemed vexed as to why people were still getting infected in their homes.  It didn't seem to occur to him that many had no way to isolate themselves from family members who were still going out to work.

But all the PR or fake news is not going to change the basic reality that the liberal elite are no better than the supposed conservatives they attack endlessly in their paper day after day. The liberal elite have not helped the working class or middle class but have instead engaged in an condescending paternalistic effort to buy their silence and obedience-- they pretend that by calling themselves liberal that they are the good rich exploiters of other peoples' labor not like those conservatives. Really? Are the liberal media so stupid to think that anyone actually believes them--they can't even convince themselves which is why they have to constantly find ways of hiding it from the masses.

Manhattan is a PLANTATION where people-of-color take the subway to and clean the toilets, care for the kids, do the cooking, clean the houses, run the errands of rich mostly white people. Mayors Bloomberg + de Blasio killed a great city. The fact the New Yorkers aren't outraged by Manhattan speaks volumes.

A sizable portion of the working population will not go back to their former occupation and need to be trained for different skill sets.  Many will be forced to retire if they are eligible or just drop out of the labor force.  These are the economic and real life consequences of this insidious and devastating virus.  Governments, federal and local, need to plan for the aftermath of this pandemic.  Are they up to the tasks?

The supply side is just waiting and will realize its benefits shortly. Now, there will be parts of the world economy which will not recover soon or possibly ever as there is already increased automation in a number of areas, including meetings where travel has been required, and as automation typically leads to lower costs of production and services it also means the consumers will benefit at the same time a higher percentage are unemployed.

 Obviously the total lack of leadership in this direction has resulted in tens of thousands more Covid-19 cases ramping up the still surging numbers of cases and deaths. This is not just humanitarian in sentiment, but makes good economic sense as stopping contact between people for at least two months will pay off considerably in the long run by reigning in and eventually stopping the virus. But, in order for that day to happen, we must not mingle together for awhile.

2) The McConnell Senate needs to get going now and allow all necessary funding, or extension of such, to all American businesses which are or will be suffering losses due to a nation-wide pandemic emergency. The employees of those businesses can then stay on payroll without the bureaucratic delays of paying each employee who has been forced onto unemployment. Pretty straight forward, folks.

""Stimulus"" in this case meaning significant money, sent periodically over a period of months.

Funds that go directly into the economy (70%-plus of which is based on consumer spending) to pay bills, buy food, clothing, pay rents and mortgages, support local businesses, keep restaurants and services open.

Sending cash to every American will work faster, work cheaper, not require the extension of already top-heavy bureaucracies, short circuit massive corruption among corporations and lawmakers, and stand the nation in good stead going forward.

So, Don and Mitch will never agree, Republican legislators will fret over economists' fantasies like ""negative incentives"" discouraging people from work which doesn't exist, and socialism or communism, or whatever bogeyman they need to spice up their night life.

Mr. Pence, the coronavirus has not gone anywhere. The warm weather will be the fuel on the fire as more and more people shuck off warnings about social distancing and face coverings. The president doesn't wear a mask (and neither do you, sir), so why should MAGA nation heed the Chicken Little warnings of the blue state (and some red state) governors?

It's an element of the disingenuousness of your evangelical background that is morally indefensible. Elected leaders should obfuscate the truth; they should nudge and urge skittish citizens back into the public. Increases in infections are ""intermittent."" Liar.

""The president often talks about embers,"" Mr. Pence said. That, sir, is untrue. Donald Trump doesn't know what an ember is. But he's right about the smoldering fires that will soon be torching America because of his lust to showcase a robust economy.

I'm not a medical doctor, but if you or a loved one is offered dexamethasone, you should have a frank discussion with the doctors and come to an agreement with them.

However, we need to be aware of important distinctions.

There may be things that prevent infections.

There may be things that keep an infections from getting to the stage of hospitalization.

Those things may be very different from what works in the hospital for people already in deep trouble.

This is because one drug may prevent the virus from getting in. Another may prevent it from running away to spread massively through the body. A third may prevent the runaway viral infection from having the effect of killing the patient by shutting down organs.

The point of a vaccine is to prevent it getting in at all. There were suggestions that some other drugs might also have that effect, at least in part. That is not at all what a steroid drug might do at stage three, keeping someone alive in a hospital bed.

Of course we need all three levels, and probably it would be best to have more than one option working at each level."

My cough was been symptomatically treated by my regular long-acting combination asthma inhaler, plus a nebulizer was added.  The cough was  getting worse even after adding the nebulizer.  I continued for weeks with loss of taste and smell, chills, body aches, and lesions.

When a Z-pak and prednisone was added, the cough improved, and when both courses ran out, the cough started again, even while continuing the two asthma medications.  Only when I started up the prednisone again did the cough subside.  Finally, after three weeks on prednisone, not too high a dose mind you, I was able to taper back and now am at a few milligrams with no cough and no nebulizer.

As far as I can see, there was no consideration of trying a corticosteroid until I was bad enough to go to the ER (which I did, but no pneumonia so they sent me home with severe COVID-19 bronchitis, oxygen saturation ~90).  I almost had to beg for the prednisone.

I do think my life was at risk (oxygen as low as 82) because they were holding back the steroids.  Is it not obvious that after the initial infection, lung issues are more likely due to inflammation than a random ""lingering cough"" that should be treated like any others?  My main problem was actually getting the asthma medication into my lungs, a systemic steroid was needed.  I did have and still have asthma but no longer the COVID-19 cough."

This finding that Dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory, immunosuppresive drug reduces damage to the lungs is welcome news. There should be no confusion that the drug is not an antiviral and is no substitute for a much needed antiviral with no adverse effect that can block progression to the later stage contributing to death."
2020-06-16 14:39:32,"The use of corticosteroids in patients with severe pulmonary inflammation due to Covid 19 and its effectiveness in reducing deaths was predictable based on previously reported observations that the overwhelming immune responses to the pneumonitis and the sudden deterioration of some patients late in the disease course indicated that the body's hyperactive immune response in some may have actually been the cause of many of the late course deaths. Chloroquine probably did help some patients in the late stages by suppressing the immune response  as it does when used for autoimmune disease. But ask Dr Trump if you want to know for sure.  Of course Chloroquine has some bad adverse effects on some and is probably less effective than coticosteroids for suppressing the Covid19 immune response.

How can it be to his advantage to infect a large number of his supporters?  Surely many will realize that he has been trying to sell them snake oil and hydroxychloroquine, and really does not care whether they live or die.  That really is a covid shame."

As soon as her first symptom showed up (anosmia), she got on the phone with her doctor and was prescribed a round of prednisone and a z-pack to try and mitigate any asthma complications. After that her symptoms never progressed beyond the anosmia. We're not sure if it's because 1) the virus somehow weakened after hitting me first, 2) she just has a better immune system (I always get respiratory illnesses every year while she doesn't typically), 3) the prednisone, or 4) some combination of those factors.

Trump's gut told him this virus would damage him politically, that it would probably not be such a big deal and that even if it was, like his boast of getting away with shooting someone on 5th Ave., his supporters would still love him and his exceptional genuis at convincing people of alternate realities would once again carry him through unscathed.

That's the bad news. The good news is that medicine is getting better at treating severe cases, and the case fatality rate is decreasing. 

(There has also been progress on vaccine development, and it's possible there will be a vaccine in less than a year.)

The questions our leaders face are how long to continue the draconian lockdowns and sanctions. The policies in effect today have flattened the curve, and for the most part protected our health care system from being overwhelmed.  But they have also caused the global economy and world trade to collapse. This has caused mass hunger and starvation to develop, and major increases in other treatable diseases worldwide. The US is dependent of foreign production for many essential products (most medicines in the US come from China, for example).  We need a functioning world economy.

We cannot return to normal until there is a vaccine, but at the same time draconian sanctions and lockdowns are probably doing much more harm than good. 

We need to find compromises. Mass gatherings should be severely restricted, and masks should usually be required in public. We need compromise rules on social distancing, and more testing with stay at home requirements for those who test positive, along with contact tracing.

So this Covid I‚Äôm sure has the potential to carry long-term lung damage consequences. The sooner you can prevent it from getting to the point of it heavily attacking the lungs  the better off we will all be."

2020-06-16 16:01:55,"It makes sense that a steroid would be beneficial because of the intense inflammatory reaction caused by the cytokine storm. This could possibly alleviate the pneumonia is associated with the virus, and enable those sick with the virus to avoid intubation and prolonged hospital stays. Of course, anything that dampens the immune response could make it impossible to develop antibodies for immunity, and steroids do make people more susceptible to other infections. So, like everything else in life, the drug could prove to be a double edged sword. What we need is a vaccine, but Dexamethasone may help us help ourselves until a vaccine is both available and effective."

2020-06-16 16:10:24,"Dexamethasone is 6 times more potent than prednisone - so it is heavy duty stuff and has lots of side effects and should not be used by anyone unless closely supervised by a physician. 

I had a severe upper respiratory plague in early January - Prednisone along with high dose advair and albuterol brought me through in two weeks. I don‚Äôt know if I had COVID- there was no test back then."
2020-06-16 16:12:47,"It's great that they have identified an effective therapy, but the news scares me a little, too. Many people are already quite complacent, and this will only increase as news gets out. Meanwhile, this steroid treatment is not a cure-all; it reduces deaths by a third, which means many, many more will die, especially if everyone decides to take off their masks and get back to ""normal."" It also means many more will face debilitating side effects. We still need more leaders to promote smart practices, even if death rates go down!"
2020-06-16 15:49:00,"Steroids have been used for years to cut back on out-of-control inflammatory response in sick patients, especially those with pulmonary disease.  So, this report is not surprising.

What is a little surprising is that it has not been reported before.  But that said, steroids are cheap and do not make much money for the for-profit medical profession.  Only designer drugs that have the potential for being billion dollar sellers get the headlines.

Perhaps the news does not want to report mundane treatments that are not very flashy."

A group that inevitably inhales steroids. This should also clue in researchers that the right way to address this disease is by reducing the inflammatory pathway and not necessarily by slamming the virus hard. Perhaps ensuring all people are taking necessary vitamins in the first place will prevent the virus from taking hold in a nasty way. 

But fabulous news! Well done and I hope it showcases the advantage of socialized medicine for all. Folks in the UK are looking for practical, economical alternatives while we are searching for things that get dizzy on the stock market."

He also has some signs of neurological aging with balance issues, a mild senile gait, and possibly some tremors in his hands holding a cup of water. He has a prior history of likely ADHD and some degree of dyslexia and has likely some mild cognitive impairments judging by his deterioration in his verbal fluency and frequent errors and mispronunciations.
However, I don‚Äôt expect him ever to do the right thing due to his excessive narcissism and deep fears of inadequacy and failure.

They are now deliberately distorting data and promoting fraudulent studies like those from Harvard/Lancet/NEJM/Surgisphere.    Liberals mocked Trump for wanting to reopen by Easter.   A month later, 50 states were in various stages of reopening.   They don't talk about testing anymore.   Instead, Mayors are begging their constituents to get tested.   If you back out NY/NJ/CT, the U.S. death rate is below Italy, Spain and France, and inline with Canada.    The craziness in all of this is that as the progress is being made, the press is ignoring the data and touting ""increases"" and ""spikes"" and ""second waves"" without context, all to promote fear.

Perhaps steroids in combination with other drugs could reduce the death rate enough for us to feel comfortable going out and about . But it doesn‚Äôt increase our current comfort level. .

2020-06-16 17:25:27,"When it comes to finding a new miracle drug to help patients with coronavirus, it makes big news, and Big Pharma celebrates.

But you never hear about how simple supplements can also help, because Big Pharma cannot patent a simple supplement like Vitamin D.

There are lots of stats about people getting sick or dying from Covid-19 who also seem to be deficient in Vitamin D (in other words sunshine). And yet the medical community sneers at the suggestion that people should start adding D to their diet, or at least spend more time outdoors.

The mechanism appears to be that Vitamin D is a key in modulating the immune response, and one benefit is to avoid or at least lessen the shock of what they call a ""cytokine storm,"" which is where the immune system over-reacts to the presence of the virus, and produces antibodies that overwhelm the system, including death as an outcome.

And even if you are a skeptic, there is nothing wrong with adding some D to your diet, or spending more time outdoors.(Vitamin D is not typically rich in foods.)

Hint: I take 5,000 units per day of liquid D, and a walk on a sunny day is always a gift."
2020-06-16 18:25:47,"All infections induce an inflammatory response of some kind.   

The pathways leading to the inflammation are numerous and complicated, but the end result that we observe clinically is the same.

It became obvious early on from autopsy studies that this virus induces a peculiar inflammatory response, and that tamping down diverse proinflammatory mechanisms might be helpful.       

That is why an experienced old dermatologist like me uses prednisone for a bad lower leg cellulitis:  many of the symptoms are due to proinflammatory chemicals from both the bacteria and the damaged tissues.       The use of the steroid can dramatically decrease the severe pain and clinical inflammation.

For many years I have self prescribed prednisone (at a dose of 40mg daily for 4 days) when my wife and I experience a really bad cold with pulmonary symptoms and constant cough.    

Such intervention does not cure the disease, but surely mitigates the miserable symptoms."

I wonder if in the case where people initially have a weakened immune system, if they fail to clear the virus for a period of time, and if they don't then begin to develop an antibody response; and perhaps it is the developing antibody response to a persistent covid-19 infection that triggers the cytokine storm and severe lung damage."

2020-06-16 19:42:45,"As with any treatment particularly in the case of a patient with serious COVID-19 the treating physician should be aware of their other conditions when selecting a steroid like dexamethasone. For instance, in diabetics it will affect blood glucose levels and adjustments to other meds will be necessary.  I would think that this was done in the Oxford situation. 
Even then additional treatments are needed to improve the survival of patients receiving ventilation and oxygen and their long term health even after they survive."
2020-06-16 19:47:18,"I have dozens of (out of date) Dexamethasone pills left over from one of my Dachshund's herniated disc issue years ago. They're so cheap and generic that the animal hospital didn't bother charging for (unneeded) refills.

Once the immune system has been breached and the virus has taken hold to the point of causing oxygen deprivation, immuno suppressing drugs are much more important than boosting the immune system. It seems that, in general, only very old and weak die quickly and directly from the effects of the virus... the rest of us will suffer or die due to an autoimmune response well beyond what is required to defeat the virus. Immune suppressants .. as anti-inflammatories ... can be extremely effective at that point."
2020-06-16 19:58:01,"What ever happened to basic reporting where every big question is anticipated and answered? In this case, the big question is who makes this drug? Are there many manufacturers or a few? What are their names? How much competition is there to keep prices down. The questions matter if the drug turns out to be effective. There will be huge demand for a generic already said to be widely used."

In the US, the POTUS is hosting a vainglorious 20,000 person COVID petri dish gathering while approximately 20,000 new cases are being reported throughout the country on a daily basis.  

The Tulsa rally seems downright criminal.  The GOP convention plans are even worse.  The attendees will leave these incubation gatherings and spread throughout the country.  Trump is a clear and present danger to the health of our county."
2020-06-16 19:39:29,"The protests were outside. As dangerous as they were, at least there is that. Trump wants to equivocate that as the same as inside. It made ght as well be held on an ocean liner."

2020-06-16 20:30:09,Not many complaints about the massive daily and nightly protests throughout the nation. Of course it can be argued that the rally is outdoors (not counting the looting early on in stores) but National Guardsman caught the virus so Dr. Fauci was right about being concerned with lack of distancing and many without masks. The main distinction is political sympathy.

2020-06-16 20:20:20,"When I was very young, a friend of mine committed suicide. 

At first, I was numb. I didn't know what to feel. I felt abandoned. I felt dead inside. 

Then I felt anger, it was the irresponsibility of the gesture that enraged me, to destroy so much for no reason, to completely ignore the pain it would cause those around you. 

The anger continued for a long long time. 

Finally I felt the truth. 

Beneath the emotion I realized that I had been ignorant of something within my friend's experience of life and that it had made him very different to me.

While foolishly I had imagined that his notion of being and his level of joy and pain were similar to mine, in fact, in some way which will always remain outside my knowledge he was completely different from me.

I feel this same way about my country now. It has seen fit to throw itself off a precipice, for no reason with no gain or logic. It has chosen collective suicide without being swayed by any argument of responsibility or potential for the future.

My friend suffered from a deep mental illness then. The parallel with my society is just crushing. I'll never really understand these people. Awoken to my previous ignorance of them, I'll never overcome the anger completely."
2020-06-16 21:07:56,"There is no drug that ""cures"" a Covid-19 infection. People who recover do so because their immune system doesn't get overwhelmed and it gradually defeats the virus with your own natural antibodies.

What mainstream media has avoided are the established methods of strengthening the immune system and lessoning the viral load. Anything that reduces the viral load increases your immune systems ability to fight it off.

Hydoxychloraquine does not prevent Covid-19 but it slows down the viral load. Doctors in Costa Rico have had considerable success with it given at the beginning of the first symptoms along with zinc and a Zpac. 

Doctors in Europe have been using IV vitamin C at very high doses, along with vitamin D. The vitamin D helps prevent the blood clotting that has been a major problem for Covid victims.

The anti-inflammatory steroid is once again an evidence based method because Covid causes massive levels of inflammation.

Front line doctors have been reporting on all these methods but have been too busy with patients to write it up.

While we wait for a vaccine that meets all standards of safety and efficacy, these treatment methods should be explored."

I accept the fact that  I am not going anywhere for a while  (Fortunately, I can work from home). But constantly pointing out that the number of coronavirus cases keeps increasing is not news.  No sane person in Florida claims that opening up the economy will not result in increased numbers of infected people.  Of course it will.  The point is that while the rate may be going up, the curve is not steep so there is little, if any, chance of hospitals and the healthcare system being overwhelmed.  If and when the cases surge to the point where that is no longer the case, local officials here in Miami-Dade County will shut down again if necessary."
2020-06-16 16:51:45,"Statue-toppling has gone too far.  Christopher Columbus is not remotely comparable to RE Lee, and the people who erected their statues did so for very different reasons.  The triumphal statues of Confederate generals were erected by intransigent whites determined to maintain their grip on power in defiance of all the principles of democratic goverment and civil decency.  The racial connotations were obvious and intentional.

In contrast, the statures of Christopher Columbus were erected by proud immigrants from southern Europe who celebrated their cultural background and their new status as citizens of a democracy.  Most were unaware of the larger demographic implications of CC arrival.  In a larger sense, the 16-19th century expansion of European culture and its interaction with other cultures has been one of the great milestones in the history of our species; it deserves to be remembered for its positive results as well as the negative.

By toppling CC statues, we are saying that our narrow passion of the moment outweighs the commendable aspirations of those immigrants 100 years ago and erases memory of an important event in human history.  We are simplifying history that, good and bad, needs to be remembered in its full complexity.  Ultimately our precious self-esteem, protected by removing historical symbols, begins to look like arrogance.  

Yes, I know this has little to do with Covid 19, but it needs to be said."

He is all in with Trump having his convention here. No masks, no social distancing and nobody wants him anyway. Even worse, last I heard they will have to bring in cruise ships because of our limited number of hotels. And thank goodness nothing ever happens on cruise ships.

2020-06-16 22:11:04,"This administration, and Republican state governments, whether they understand it or not, have decided to take the herd immunity route, without knowing what herd immunity is, and without data, and without telling the country. They have disbanded the Covid emergency working group, sending the various agency representatives back to their agencies, without explicitly saying so to the press. (I have a friend who was on it.) Trump tried to be explicit about shutting it down, and sensible, concerned people rebelled, so they just did it quietly any way. They now have no data feeding their actions, which are stonewalling and gaslighting only. They intend to pretend that new cases means simply more testing. 

If you aren't smart enough or able to protect yourself, you're going mano a mano with the virus. Luck plus your health factors decides whether you get no symptoms, mild symptoms, severe symptoms, extended symptoms or death. Your location and personal wealth determine whether you get decent care or not. Your wealth and social habits determine whether you are exposed, or yourself become a superspreader. You. Are. On. Your. Own. This virus is not going to stop until it's denied new vectors - that's you. Vote, if you are able by November."

I think this is a terrible decision on behalf of the Trump campaign, but I find myself hard pressed to answer some in my own family who have posed this question to me and others.  Isn't this a little bit of a double standard, having leaders of large cities not only not stopping the protests, but condoning them, and in the next breath condemning a political rally? Both are equally dangerous and self-serving, in my opinion."

Everyone is so sure."
2020-06-16 22:35:04,"If we face the fact that another shutdown will meet intense opposition, can we all agree to wear masks? Research shows tranmission is reduced by some 95% if everyone in a space is wearing a mask. 

This is not an unreasonable compromise; it's not like people are being asked to plant victory gardens much less send a child off to war.

2020-06-16 22:40:05,"Florida governor opposing another business shut down is more justified than the previous shut down. The shut downs are useless if there are some who comply 100% and take proper precautions and many others are defiant or careless. 

Simple practice of wearing a proper mask properly. how many do you see doing that. As an unarmed self appointed mask police, I have no authority to  enforce compliance with the requirement to wear masks properly. All I can do is remind the same people several times. It is just pathetic. Always some excuse. Ill fitting under wears are no one's business but ill fitting masks or no masks are a collective responsibility. Airlines will continue to scan for whats in your under wear and shoes but only now they are going to start requiring masks and temperature checks. If only they had done that from the beginning of the year we could have cut the confirmed cases to a tiny fraction.

When I see someone causing potential self inflicted harm at the gym, I would say Hey Don't kill yourself"" Now if they are not wearing masks I have to say ""Don't kill others"" But what can one do about those being non compliant and careless about their own safety and that of others? Definitely not destroy some one else's livelihood or job. somethings never change and will not change and will not be worth trying to change. Just the way it is. So Gov. DeSantis go for it. Business shut downs will not save a single life, if people are irresponsible and ungovernable."

2020-06-16 22:50:16,"I previously thought Tulsa's BOK Center had an open roof and a disaster was unlikely due to higher humidity and sunshine - it's next to impossible to catch this virus outdoors.

Then I saw that the BOK Center is enclosed and believed this rally would be a disaster because 99.7% of transmission occurs indoors and the Center will be packed with screaming people.

But now I believe there will be no disaster because Trump got lucky - Tulsa should have 55% humidity on Saturday and that will create larger moisture droplets which will fall and not hover in the air waiting to be inhaled.  

A study found an increase in humidity of 1% decreases coronavirus transmission by 6%.

Trump does not know the above - if he did, he'd have all his rallies outdoors - because imagine what would happen if his rally was a disaster - it would be his Waterloo.  

No one would show up ever again and viral deaths directly attributed to Trump would bump up.  He'd lose the election.

The Canadian government paid people who had been laid off due to Covid 19 to stay home.¬† There was aggressive advertising on ways to protect yourself, both publicly and privately, business that were allowed to stay open had to adhere to strict rules to guarantee self distancing between customers.¬† Banks were prevented from penalizing customers, even taxes were deferred.¬†¬†
It is not my intention to boast.¬† You already know the failures that led to the high death rate in the US. It's the same reason De Santos wants to remain open despite the influx of new cases in Florida and the spikes in the other states.

¬†What I feel is anger, and disgust at the epic failures of the current US administration to protect the people. It is estimated that %90 of the deaths from this virus were preventable, over 100,000 deaths could have been avoided if the Trump administration had put the health and lives of the people over profits and the economy."

When people talk about national decline, this is what it looks like. The nation that went to the moon, that eradicated polio, that built the infrastructure of the internet, that maintains a global military empire....that nation has turned into one where containing the pandemic - a task at which several countries, even ones that were hit as hard we did, have accomplished - has given up on defeating the coronavirus because it's too difficult and inconvenient.

The pollution of Trump's politics are literally killing people.  Georgia now permits sports, full occupancy restaurants and bars, and conventions with no restrictions.

The list goes on and on.

I must say, I'm happy to be in the Australian/New Zealand ISO bubble.  I have every confidence in our Prime Ministers re-opening our economies in s manner calculated to provide their citizens safety.

Florida's cases are sharply up. But its death are sharply down.  As a 14 day average, Florida's cases look like a hard climb up Mt. Everest, but its deaths look like a descent into the salt flats of Badwater Basin.  This makes no sense.

The number of deaths reported is lower than the number of deaths expected.  The latest daily death counts look far too low give the large number of cases. E.g., only 7 deaths vs 77,000+ total and 1,700+ new cases on 6/15. 

Are ""died at home"" untesteds being reported as pneumonia or heart attacks on death certificates?  Are nursing home victims left out of the count?

Wearing a mask is the most pro-life thing you can do right now, refusing to wear one is like hoping you will spread the disease to others.

We in Oregon may actually have fewer cases than before but we have more positive results because of the record number of tests performed.  Normally, a case is someone currently infected.

Social distancing: should be PHYSICAL DISTANCING, not social ‚Äòisolation‚Äô

Medicare for All: scares the doctors etc, and the current medicare-covered people. The younger people DO NOT even KNOW what Medicare is."
2020-06-17 00:28:09,"This virus epidemic has become an undeclared generational war.

The virus does not scare or even concern most people under 30.  For many of them there are no symptoms at all.  The symptoms are mild for those who do get them.  Hospitalization is rare and death rarer still.  Those rare outcomes are much, much less likely than the risks of a accident while driving (traffic accidents kill about 30,000 annually nationwide).

But for persons over 60, the virus is a very serious threat of severe symptoms, high probability of hospitalization, and substantial probability of death.

The consequence is that when I now go to the grocery store, the majority of customers are not wearing masks.  Those without masks are almost entirely under age 50.  

It would not be so bad if older people could at least protect themselves with the effective N95 masks.  But such masks are not available to us regular people because they are all being redirected to medical workers (there is a shortage of N95 masks because American companies like 3M betrayed all Americans by building factories in China to make critical medical products like masks, then China prohibited shipment of the masks to the US when China caused this virus by its cruel and inhumane animal practices)

So I wear 2 of the less effective masks that us regular people are allowed to get, one on top of the other.  Plus I wear a plastic face shield."

2020-06-17 00:47:26,"A lot of effort being put into finding excuses for the increase in coronavirus positives now that we're two to three weeks after ""reopening the economy"" in many areas. 

Seems like it would be easy enough to make a statistical adjustment for the number of tests, and get to the -real- spread prevalence in that way. Positive test results per 100,000 tests administered might isolate that, in the same way that auto accident stats are done ""per million vehicle miles"" so driving more or less doesn't skew the numbers.

Of course, if your desire is to -hide- the increase in cases due to the ""reopening the economy"", to make less explicit the trade-off made between economy and deaths... then you'd say just about what many governors and federal officials are saying.

Go ahead and go out, go shopping, go to bars, don't wear a mask. Go ahead, get on that airplane, no mask. Go to that political rally. Then please stay far, far away from me - I'll be staying home as much as I can, and wearing a mask, and I sure wish you all would too.

We are far from done with coronavirus, even the ""first wave"" isn't finished spreading, and spreading at an increasing rate. Welcome to the law of exponential numbers, people... deny it if you like, the virus doesn't care. Stay smart - stay safe."

Our Oregon county has not even entered Phase 1 yet. Our teeny family business has been shut now for 14 weeks straight, and we still have not heard a peep concerning our PUA unemployment application. I suspect that they rushed to open nationally b/c of not wanting to incur economic damage, and cheating out on supplying citizens with aid relief. COME ON THOUGH! $1,200 for 14 weeks of living expenses? How low can you go?  So far, we are fine, but so, so concerned for so many."
2020-06-17 00:50:01,"It is not just those under 30 who are flouting the guidelines here in Texas. I see people of all ages and visual ethnicities not wearing masks. The proportion depends on the store you go into as well as the store's policy. In the Houston area Costco requires you to wear a mask to enter the store, but some people then take them off once in and no one is being asked to leave. A friend, who is very high risk, went to Costco because the policy. She wore an N95 mask and a full face shield. Customers started making fun of her. She will not go back to Costco. At Woodcraft today, the sign said masks recommended. When I entered with my mask, the emplpyees looked, then quickly donned the masks that they had around their necks. Most other customers did not wear masks at all, but there were few people in the store. The Texas governor refuses to let localities require masks--he feels content to just make sure the hospitals are not overwhelmed. Unfortunately, by the time they are overwhelmed, it will be too late. He really needs to be held accountable for the increase in numbers and deaths."
2020-06-17 01:08:24,"How is it legal for a public official, especially the president of the country to put so many lives in danger both directly, and indirectly?  Large scale gatherings such as sports and events have been on hold for a reason. I don‚Äôt downplay the risks of outdoor protests either.  A mandatory waiver acknowledges the risks of the virus, and it may abdicate the responsibility of the Trump campaign organization. But the responsivity of a public official, in this case, Trump, the president who took an oath to protect the people of the country, can‚Äôt be relinquished with a waiver."
2020-06-17 01:14:06,"In order to determine whether increased testing is responsible for the dramatic one-day increase in the daily case rates, it is straightforward to check the COVID Tracking Project data for the three states in question.  In Florida there were 2,783 new cases listed today with a 9.2% positive ratio compared to 1,758 cases yesterday with a 8.3% positive. In Texas today had 4,058 new cases with a 12.2% positive ratio compared to yesterday's 1,254 cases with a 6.7% ratio.  Finally Arizona had 2,392 cases today with a 26.4% positive ratio compared to yesterday's 1,014 cases with a 14.1% ratio.  These numbers give the lie to any contention by President Trump or VP Pence that the jump in case numbers is purely a result of increased testing.  These are hair-on-fire day-to-day comparisons which if they persist for a few more days are catastrophic for these states."

2020-06-17 01:10:36,"The Oklahoma Governor needs to find the back bone to say ""NO"" to Trump and his rally.  People's lives are more important than Trump desire to feel the love from his base (although, I am sure his fragile ego is desperate at this point for some tender loving care).

The fact Trump knows how dangerous this rally is and yet he is going forward with it, shows the man to be incapable of compassion and concern for his fellow man.  All Trump cares about is Trump.  Narcissism at it's worst.  

And what does this say about the Republican Party, that no one is shutting the President down?  They are equally responsible for every person who becomes ill or dies at the Republican rally.  Saying nothing, does not eliminate the Republican Party of blame or liability.  It just shows the world what cowards they truly are."
2020-06-17 01:13:09,"All Republican states.  What is most disturbing is the total allegiance these states have to the Republican Party.  They have x‚Äôd out healthcare, lie constantly, give tax breaks to a higher income bracket but still they vote Republican.

The United States was founded by religious fanatics.  This is true.  Now we have a Jim Jones situation (my mother was engaged to the Senator who died there) and still we have a sycophant situation that will end badly.

Tens of thousands are dying because the head of the Corona Virus Task Force is lying.  George Floyd is one of thousands murdered at point blank range without consequence.  QHow much death can we stand?"
2020-06-17 01:04:43,There‚Äôs so little leadership in Texas right now that lobbyists couldn‚Äôt pay off someone to take charge.
2020-06-17 01:14:19,"DeSantis has obviously learned a thing or two from his idol. He knows full well the increase in cases comes from the rapid reopening and slow closing of the state accompanied by his administration‚Äôs lax reopening guidelines. 

And, as a citizen of that state, I place the fault squarely on his inept shoulders. As soon as restrictions were lifted a fair few Floridians in my current corner of the world acted as though they‚Äôd never heard of Covid-19. I can‚Äôt speak to the actions of the rest of the state, but I suspect they‚Äôre not much different. 

Eighty percent of the people I see when I venture out to grocery stores don‚Äôt wear masks. Many stand so close to strangers you‚Äôd think they were trying to get sick. And the local mall parking lots look like there‚Äôs a holiday sale. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the restaurants. I went to pick up carry-out at a popular neighborhood restaurant and not a single member of the wait staff was wearing a mask. (I canceled my order.)

On the flip side of this, we‚Äôve had peaceful protests since the Friday after George Floyd‚Äôs death. They take place around a busy thoroughfare that leads to the beach. Ninety percent of the protesters wear masks. 

Now, I realize people have to be responsible for their own behavior, but when I compare Virginia, Maryland or New York‚Äôs response to Florida‚Äôs, I get absolutely disgusted. But I suppose that‚Äôs what is to be expected when Trump‚Äôs barnacle is elected to the governorship."
2020-06-17 01:22:13,You're headline makes it sound like testing increases the number of diagnosed cases when in fact increased testing has very little to do with an increase in cases according to various experts. An increase in cases has more to do with...more cases.
2020-06-17 01:18:39,"What a surprise. TX Gov. Greg Abbott is oh so eager to take credit for bringing back Texas jobs but blames ""young people"" for making Texans sick when he was the one who opened our economy back up too fast in the first place. He learned from the best (actually the worst); his teacher Trump. Such a contrast from the comcerned governor of Alaska. He requires anyone entering the state to quarantine. Cases has only increased slightly there. Although it's a hassle for me to go through it when I go up to work, it's better to do that and keep others safe."
2020-06-17 01:24:18,"If you increase testing you‚Äôre going to get more reported cases, it‚Äôs happened every time testing capacity has been expanded significantly.

2020-06-17 01:29:13,"The sooner people get out and about, including going back to work, the sooner we'll reach the 70% of Americans infected that is required for us to achieve herd immunity.

2020-06-17 01:32:20,"The testing results still seem to be driving confusion because they don't show full statistical picture of the situation.  The reporting tells nothing about the location of the case or the demographic of the cases.  For example, if you run a concerted testing campaign in the prisons and find a lot of new positive cases, there's less risk to society since that population isn't mobile.  If you test scores of college students and they all test positive, that's less concerning as they likely won't end up in the hospital.  On the other hand, if you find 2,000 new positive cases in Dallas among 65-75 year olds, that's a big potential problem."
2020-06-17 00:47:19,"Maybe it's the protests in Miami, Tampa, Austin, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix......? The very definition of super spreader events.  The 14 day gestation period has surely passed."
2020-06-17 00:40:02,"Gov. Ron DeSantis.... it is amazing how stupid smart people can be when they have an ulterior motive for what they do. In his case, he wants to pander to Trump, and help Trump get re-elected by trying to boost the economy, at the cost of lives in Florida. Again, the ""Masses"" have been dooped!"
2020-06-17 01:25:18,"First of all, this 'myth' that the virus cannot spread well outside is the epitome of left wing speak and is not supported by the facts. (I am an empiricist and don't care to defend either side of this childish battle). On Sept 28th, 1918, the health commissioner Krusen allowed the Liberty Bond March to proceed. It was organized to sell bonds to support the war effort) It was outside, tens of thousands attended, and by the end of 10 days over 1000 people had lost their lives. Krusen, then did an about-face and locked things down and things stabilized. The point is Trump's rally should not proceed, but the irresponsible protests for the past three weeks never should have been so encouraged by both media and it's hired physician mouth pieces who contrary to the past few months when 'large crowds were dangerous' did a pretzel logic turn around into a sort of 'well, this cause is so noble, just wear masks.' Science is science and when either side takes a political point of view, lives are often lost. (And please don't say lives will be saved by the protests. For every life potentially saved there will be many hundreds lost to the disease.) And we are beginning to see the effects of the spread in Florida (huge marches in Miami over past few weeks) Texas (huge marches in Houston- where spread is greatest).

This should be easy and will save money.  Some people will still need nursing homes.  Not all people in nursing homes are old.  Many elderly people need not be trapped in nursing homes.  Research by AARP shows that most people would prefer this.

There are vested interests in keeping nursing homes as they are, since they make a lot of money for their for-profit owners.  They've gotten worse over the years.

All these healthcare workers, including homecare workers should be paid a decent wage for this hard work.  It's part of our national shame that our healthcare system only pays for people to be in nursing homes."

I probably found like 10 people, outside of corporate employees, who were were wearing masks. It doesn't matter what age they were or what establishment they were in. Complete defiance was in the air. I also saw few pickup trucks with Trump supporting flags and writings. One of them said ""spay and neuter Democrats"". There was also some Vintage Car sale/exchange program, which I was told was cancelled by the County but people showed up anyways in huge numbers. The whole place was full of vintage cars and older people.

It's an attempt to cover up the following I have first hand knowledge of; The F.B.I. uses mental health personnel to conduct long term unconstitutional interrogations and to undermine the credibility of witnesses against them, government, and the police. Now they are promoting wide scale police use of the practice. Trump is guilty."

2020-06-17 02:31:19,"30 years ago my mother who was 84 and asthmatic came down with the flu.  She spent a month in the hospital.  She survived and lived another 10 years in quite good health with two exceptions: her hearing was somewhat diminished and she had a number of basal cell carcinomas appearing almost over.  I am quite sure the doctors saved her life by using some kind of steroid in large doses, In fact they may well have been in IV drips.

Putting all those people in an indoor rally and because you refuse to wear a mask (great example there, pal) Im sure almost everybody there won't be wearing them. Now we all know that your fragile ego desperately NEEDS these rallies - you crave praise and applause at all times and lately you've really been getting justifiable criticism and push back as you double down on embracing the Confederacy, so we know you - once again - don't care about the safety of others - you only care about yourself and always have. But it would make so much sense not to hold any rallies for now. And how ironic that you won't wear a mask in public because you don't want to look ""weak"" and yet you struggled to drink a glass of water and walk down a simple ramp this past weekend."

19,000 screaming people in a small enclosed arena this Saturday night could result in thousands of additional infected Americans, driving, jetting and busing back to every state in the country. Tens of thousand new infections. Why? To scratch the Republican itch. But not to worry, the RNC has asked everyone to sign legal waivers of responsibility. Seems like they know what‚Äôs coming. Poor folks back home probably didn‚Äôt sign the waiver, though.
Stop the madness.

There seems nothing to prevent those third parties, and their families, from suing Desperate Don and perfect Pence for the damage thereby caused, as desperate don and his sidekick have no immunity from prosecution except from the audience."
2020-06-17 02:13:07,"I cannot speak for Florida or Texas as for Arizona, there is no mandatory mask requirement.  Many merchants and their employees wear mask and we the patrons are encouraged to do so. I have emailed the Cochise County Health office about making the wearing of a mask when inside buildings and received no response.  I even sent a message to our illustrious governor and got the same no response.   A local radio host on KNST referred to people wearing a mask as sheeple, which I find kind of ignorant.  


I have read stories where the pandemic is called a scam-demic. All designed to unseat Trump, and destroy capitalism.  I for one will continue to wear a mask for as long as necessary when out in public.  I appreciate all the store and shop owners and restaurant workers wearing mask to protect the customer; I just do not understand why the public seems to not want to do their share when indoors.  Seems sort of selfish to me.  Although I am a Republican, I do not see this as a political issue.  I see it as a common sense issues.  Maybe I am in the minority.  Maybe I don't agree with everything I hear on talk radio or read in the press.  Maybe I disagree with Trump who apparently dislikes the mask. Maybe Mom raised a bright kid after all (I'll be 70 this year).  Thanks Mom!"

Rushing to open up  the economy undoubtedly increased virus cases, but Trump echoed by Pence proclaim, no, not more sick cases, just the reverse. It's the tests  pointing out more sick people. Only the tests make it seem like more, but not more hospital patients.  Really? How explain the overflowing hospitals?  Actually, more tests would cut hospital admissions, as those shown to have the virus would isolate themselves earlier and infect fewer .  Also when counting the number of tests PER CAPITA, the only fair way to compare our testing to that of other countries, we are far behind the safer countries."

The attitude of distrust of elites was prevalent when Andrew Jackson was president and now many years later it has occurred again, this time during the presidency of Donald Trump.

Cases have spiked in my county and the surrounding ones since reopening, and I have to wonder how much of this is attributed to the fact that people have to grocery shop in-store unless they can drive a long away away. 

Why aren‚Äôt grocery stores requiring people to wear masks? I‚Äôm simply not going back inside a grocery store when they don‚Äôt require masks. Seems like a simple fix.

When Trump's supporters hear that The Virus is killing people of color at an alarming rate they take that as they are getting a pass.If they would drill into the numbers maybe they would rather watch their great leader on Zoom. African Americans are 13 percent of the population but 23% of the deaths from the virus.That meaning it is over seventy five percent other than African Americans dying from the Virus. Even if you subtract  the other people of color White People attending Trump's rally are playing with fire. My money is on Trump will not be wearing a mask in some fake effort to show his followers his Machismo. Trump knows everyone around him is tested daily so his mask less face is not a sign of courage in the face of a deadly virus.As Trump looks out on his mass of followers they will try to prove to the Great Leader they are Macho too. They will be sans mask and shoulder to shoulder just to get the chance to be in close proximity to The Great Leader. They will all be carrying a copy of waiver the that The Great leader made them sign.To get a chance to tell their children they had a chance to be in the presence of the Great leader they had to promise him they would not sue him if they get The virus. It would be tough for a screenwriter to come up with a plot like this. I doubt if Trump will walk the rope line doing Selfies .
2020-06-17 04:16:28,"""Florida, Texas and Arizona Set Daily Records for Virus Cases""?

Florida, Texas and Arizona are all part of ""Trump nation,"" or at least they usually are.  Maybe there IS something to the ideas of so-called ""herd immunity"" and ""Social Darwinism""? 

Sorry, I really don't mean to sound callous to anyone's suffering with disease.  

But it's infuriating to have people in these states rant about the evil tyranny of government-mandated mask or face-covering rules and claim that the pandemic is over once and for all.  Especially when all experts wan that the pandemic is *not* over, and there could be another spike in major illnesses from reckless political and personal behavior.  

The people that could be sickened from the foolish and reckless behavior and notions of people in these states (and others) would well spread to any of us, anywhere, despite the fact that we've been following rules and trying to limit the spread of the disease in so doing.

Maybe the anti-mask, anti-home-stay, and anti-science part of the nation *should* be allowed to secede from the rest of the nation, as they seem to want to do?  

Provided that we put up a wall to keep *them* out of the rest of the nation, without a 14-day quarantine and a documentation of good health!  Let's see how how they like that for themselves!"
2020-06-17 03:38:42,"I suspect that Trump is not going to run for re-election. He loves rallies and posturing as a big boss, but he has blown the two biggest challenges he‚Äôs faced, the pandemic being addressed so that it would not do it‚Äôs worse to our country, and another death by police perceived to be unjustified triggering civil disorders. Both have had effects that just expanded into national crises from local ones without any effective actions by the national government to minimize the worst effects. Both have just spread and local governments have had to deal with them however they have. In addition, Mr. Trump shows more signs of exhaustion and declining health."

So, supposedly we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it‚Äôs ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn‚Äôt been checked, but you‚Äôre going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you‚Äôre going to test that, too. Sounds interesting, right?""

""And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it‚Äôd be interesting to check that, so that you‚Äôre going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me.

2020-06-17 04:40:25,"Yeah there is another path out of this pandemic, and it's letting the virus die in place instead of having people die. Lockdowns do work because the virus dies en masse when it's not spread from person to person. It doesn't live long on surfaces. It's air droplets that spread it most. The path of travel of the virus must also be accounted for. If it is spreading through manufacturing and transportation networks, then the places that are getting it now need to do some lockdowns. Leaders will have to eat their hats or risk decimating their people."

Unfortunately for the President, he has endangered the lives of his own constituents by encouraging them to avoid masks and social distancing. The figures for Texas and Arizona, in particular, will damage his favourability ratings in those key states, not to mention his beloved swing state, Florida, where he has spent most of his presidency cheating on his golf scores.

As for attributing the spike to more frequent testing, the only thing that needs testing is the president's brain, you know, that ""unique, superior brain"" that knows more about any subject than anyone in human history. It's ironic when he says ""God Save America."""

With that kind of ‚Äòleadership‚Äô, no wonder so many Americans can‚Äôt understand that the more effort they make, the sooner we can return to ‚Äònormal‚Äô, or at least keep people from becoming ill and spreading it ?  

Instead these whiners can only complain after a couple of months or so of ‚Äòstay-at-home‚Äô (which, for those with houses and gardens, and warm weather, is no real confinement, unlike us who live in dense, cold Northeastern cities).

Trump's inability to obtain test kits, PPE  and other medical supplies has hampered medical personnel fighting this pandemic.

Why has caring about money more important than saving lives. DeSantis pretty much says what pence says as if pence is pulling his strings to make him talk. We all know testing will indicate whether someone has the disease or not, but if your positive, you still have it. The real test is whether the hospitalization rate increases (Which by the way     already has)."

As long as they can keep slinging their hash, what difference does it make if that hash kills people, right? After all, they get to keep all the money they made of slinging it in the first place - and that's all that really counts. The money. Too bad so many voters refuse to accept the truth about that."

Repeat After Me: "" If We Had Less Testing, We Would Have Just As Many Cases but We Just Wouldn't Know It.""   In keeping with Trump's ""what you don't know won't hurt me"" shtick we are in the grip of an Orwellian administration which appears to have jiggledstatistics to make the pandemic look somewhat dangerous.  The DeSantis administration denies it but their denials are not persuasive.  

On the other hand, Palm Beach County and the city of Boca Raton appear to have taken matters more seriously than the Governor.  I hope they will slow down the opening in order to keep community transmission from exploding.

Then again the nursing homes are not reporting anything in some places and that's where the most deaths usually are.  Or they are being misreported.

2020-06-16 23:40:39,"What do you expect when those idiots at the beach, bars, gas stations, grocery stores and everywhere else refuse to wear masks.  I can understand the protesters because that is a matter of life and death way beyond the virus, but for those who find it tiresome, or a matter of inconvenience, wait until one of their love ones die because they brought the virus to them. One last thought, most of the protesters that I saw had masks, way to go protesters."
2020-06-17 02:45:02,"COVIC-19 spikes in Arizona, Florida, Oklahoma, Texas and Nevada! That's horrrrible! That's shocking!! That's natural selection."
2020-06-17 15:27:58,"The surprise will be if there  is no significant spike in the Tulsa area following the  extended ""two minutes of hate"" that is a Trump rally."
2020-06-16 13:18:39,Thank you for this excellent reporting.  I wonder how many Trump supporters are aware that Smithfield is a Chinese-owned company.  Trump's relationship with China is extremely complicated--Ivanka's TM voting machines in the mix!--and I hope NYT will pursue it.
2020-06-16 13:29:17,The American public gets water and land pollution.  China gets food security or at least lower food inflation.  And a handful of ultra wealthy people get even richer.
2020-06-16 13:38:00,"In addition to the increased Covid-19 infection risk the workers and communities supporting the meat plants are exposed to, the ramping up of meat production causes even more pollution. 
The vast manure ponds holding the urine and feces of the millions of pigs raised in North Carolina and elsewhere are sources of air pollution, groundwater poisoning and mold and bacteria. States have enacted laws that prevent victims from suing. While the Western world has effectively exported its industrial pollution to China, the country is exporting its agricultural pollution back to us."
2020-06-16 13:41:02,"We are making money, don't we?  But that could change shortly after Beijing discovered resurgent virus infections due to imported food lately. In this unpredictable times, anything could happen fast.

After all, China still needs to buy a lot to fulfill its trade agreement. Pork is definitely a item they need and want to buy from us.  Smithfield is just in the right place at the right time.  Blame Trump to reach a trade agreement with China to buy from us."
2020-06-16 14:00:28,"There are several things missing from this reporting.  You can't stop an animals gestation cycle just because a pandemic hits.  Shutting down processing plants causes a glut of animals which must be taken care of.  If they get too big the processing equipment cannot handle them and they have to be euthanized.   If you do stop production the gestation period for a hog is four months then it takes an additional six months to make it market ready.  All at once you have large amounts of hogs which need to be processed coming to market at plants that have been closed for the better part of a year.  

Who owns the processing plants is inconsequential.  It's America who is supplying the product, not the Chinese.  They need our pork.  Ask a processing employee if it makes any difference to them where the pork is going or better yet if they'd be willing to quit their job if they knew Smithfield was Chinese owned.  It doesn't and they won't."
2020-06-16 14:23:20,"After everything, these mega-corps/farmers want financial backing from the Fed, the Treasury and Congress.  Guess what, they'll get it.  We the American populace are certainly dupes in the game.  I have nothing against ""farmers"", you know the family run kind.  They deserve every help we can give them.  They are fighting for their livelihoods and life as they know it.  But the big Corps. aka Smithfield, Purdue, Del Monte... all know that both Repubs and Dems love their money and hence Congress will always pay..."
2020-06-16 14:41:31,I have noticed a lot of unbranded chicken for sale in the supermarket. It makes me wonder if Tyson is hiding from a consumer backlash to their actions.
2020-06-16 14:41:53,"Slaughter houses do not  need to survive to ""feed Americans."" The animals we eat are euphemistically labeled as something else ""...to meet demand for fresh pork, bacon and the company‚Äôs iconic Genuine Smithfield Ham‚Äù from U.S. consumers conveniently overlooks that these are living, sentient beings brought into this world for no other purpose than to satisfy someone's palate. No thought is ever made to the millions of these beings who are mindlessly sacrificed yearly, when plant-based alternatives are readily available for our consumption and survival. Sorry. All lives matter."
2020-06-16 14:43:04,"No surprise here. Let‚Äôs face it, American values have shrunk to a small universe: money, money and lobbyists. I‚Äôll be taking a nice, long vegetarian summer through Labor Day."
2020-06-16 14:43:27,"To Usok:

Nowhere in the many articles I have read  does it state unequivocally  that the spread of Covid-19 in Beijing is due to imported food.  There are many theories one of which the spread may be due to infected food."
2020-06-16 14:55:40,So Trump declared meat cutting and packing to be an essential industry? And meat-packers were aided with tax-payer dollars? To feed China?
2020-06-16 14:58:02,"Wait.  So the 'limit 1 please' signs at the grocery store weren't so much due to lack of supply as they were due to shifting domestic-bound product to export?

Well I suppose they got away with it.  If anything they will get an 'attaboy' for maximizing profit."
2020-06-16 15:12:15,"An American company is now Chinese owned, and seeing its workforce decimated by the coronavirus, wants to continue its lucrative production for the Chinese market. So it says to Americans, either you allow us to continue to put the health of our workers and the supporting communities at risk, or we will cut back on the amount of our production made available to the American market. In the meantime, exports to China not only are maintained but set new records. And they snooker Trump into loudly supporting this. The Dems should really light into Trump about how easily he is manipulated by the highly competent business people of China, the real stable geniuses."
2020-06-16 15:14:50,"So The Trump Show has blamed China for virus, pulled U.S. from W.H.O.  due to its relations with China, yet the Trump Show failed to stop meat exports to China. Not only did it not stop exporting meat, but they exported record numbers of pork in April when Americans were experiencing meat shortages. Then when the virus spread through meat processing plants, Trump show says we will take legal responsibility off of companies because it is essential for Americans to risk their lives to feed China. 
Just another PERFECT response by the Trump administration"
2020-06-16 15:25:07,"You say how many workers got covid-19.  How many are there, total? It is hard to understand the meaning of the large number of cases."
2020-06-16 13:45:15,Why are we allowing China to play us.
2020-06-16 13:57:45,So much for Trump putting ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù!  Even our food supply wasn‚Äôt protected by him.
2020-06-16 14:05:22,Whoa. So it was all a lie. And workers died. The moral corruption is breathtaking.
2020-06-16 14:19:24,"China , having lost half of its pig population due to African swine flu , is now importing from France thousands of pigs flown in by a Russian cargo airline , to create new breeding with a genetically different type of swines."
2020-06-16 14:31:14,China can't even feed itself.
2020-06-16 15:09:50,"Big business gets special treatment to ""help the country"".  Could be feed the country, plow $ gifted by taxpayers into creating jobs.  Yet we consistently find the hand full of owners diverting the $ to their own purposes.  Stop giving them our $!  Why is it ok to have Socialism for the wealthy?  Is it because they'll return a favor and give you some of their $ for your elections?"
2020-06-16 13:45:55,"This was known at least in the Upper Midwest a month or more ago while I saw our meat counters empty out.   

What do you expect from a Chinese owned company?  We are allowing a new imperial nation to make us into its colony.  

The first thing during a food shortage must be the cut off of exported food to nations that are not our allies."
2020-06-16 14:19:20,The meat industry is a disgusting empire that is making us all sick.    This epidemic makes clear how toxic and uncaring they are in doing anything but continuing to produce their addictive product.  The meat industry should be treated like the tobacco industry.
2020-06-16 13:35:07,"The Chinese can have the pigs feet, but the hind quarters should be restriction to American consumption. This story reminds me of the Irish Potato famine, as Irishman died of starvation, the bulk of  crop was being shipped to Britain. The highest bidder gets to eat!"
2020-06-16 14:03:56,Hideous deception by companies not protecting workers. How many lies does the American public have to tolerate?
2020-06-16 14:47:07,How much money did the secretary of transportation's family make from this? Need to ask Mitch and Elaine.
2020-06-16 15:20:14,"The Chinese are well on their way to widespread hypertension, heart disease, obesity and diabetes thanks to their newfound dietary habits and American exports."
2020-06-16 13:48:21,"So US workers are forced to risk their lives, forced to work while covid runs rampant through their work places, so their employers can make money sending pork to China?"
2020-06-16 13:31:02,"If you're missing pork on your plate maybe you can try some of those vegetables being plowed under by US farmers. And Smithfield is owned by a group of transnational investors including Goldman Sachs, not just the Chinese."
2020-06-16 13:52:42,"So while there were pork shortages at my grocery store a while back, Chinese consumers could buy American pork.  Something's very wrong here.....  

Think that from now on I'll avoid Smithfield pork whenever I can."
2020-06-16 14:50:52,"The American Farm Bureau is headed by Zippy Duvall, a Georgia hog farmer and Trump sycophant. This isn't surprising as the entire American Farm Bureau, that is, the state organizations included, is a wicked Republican apparatus. 

The National Farmers Union, with state chapters such as the Wisconsin Farmers Union, is the progressive organization in support of smart, fair agriculture."
2020-06-16 15:08:29,"I'm not seeing anything in the article about public aid sent to meat companies. Assuming there was no aid, can you blame them? They can sell to whomever they like. Being Chinese owned might be bad for PR but it's not a crime. If the US gave some bailout money though that's really bad."
2020-06-16 15:34:53,"Here in SE NC hog farming generates more waste than the city of LA, except they have zero waste treatment plants. It is then sprayed on fields. It rains a lot here, so the waste runs off into the Cape Fear River basin. Or the retention ponds leak into the same watershed. Along with GenX, a carcinogen produced at the Teflon plant upriver, there is a nice toxic sludge in our waterways. Hope everyone is enjoying their bacon! Meanwhile, China is playing it perfectly; pollute another country to produce their food. #maga"
2020-06-16 15:36:02,"‚ÄúBut the meatpackers, including Smithfield, which China‚Äôs largest pork producer bought in 2013, did not emphasize, at least not publicly, that keeping the plants open would also protect their long-term investments in exporting to a country that is vital to their growth.‚Äù

Why are we bailing out global companies?  Stop it.

Help the workers not the owners who are global."
2020-06-16 15:40:05,"I thought China is required, and still has failed so far, to buy a certain amount of pork from the US under the phase 1 trade deal, which was supposed to help the farmers?"
2020-06-16 15:49:20,"Our meat producers are anxious to keep supplying their foreign customers because these customers can always go and establish business relationships elsewhere; whereas American customers are seen as ""captive""... so they have to do without."
2020-06-16 15:54:44,China made brilliant moves to obtain our food production industry.  Our government gave them the ok years ago.  Why is this even an issue?  The Chinese are acting in their own interest.  In our country we call that nationalism.
2020-06-16 16:03:21,"If the export data from the meat industry is incomplete, what other data about our economy is incomplete or not transparent?"
2020-06-16 16:20:36,This should have been expected as we sold our meat supply chain to China and Brazil.  What did we expect would happen?
2020-06-16 16:24:33,"How about this:

1. No meat can be shipped out of the country while there are domestic shortages.

2. No meat can be shipped out of the country until we've ensured a safe work environment for everyone in the meat industry."
2020-06-16 16:28:42,"The most powerful tools I have as a citizen and consumer is my vote and my wallet. The day I read the announcement of Smithfield being sold to the CCP and other assorted global interests, I spoke with my wife and we agreed to not purchase any Smithfield products ever again.  Thanks to piggish corporate greed, in the guise of globalization, our options at avoiding the Made in China label were limited but in this situation using other options like the local butcher were doable.

I was already discouraged in the 80‚Äôs by witnessing how the corporate heads of meat producers had decimated the legal and Unionized labor force of the Midwest by exploiting illegal labor further fattening their bloated compensation. 

So now in 2020 it‚Äôs no surprise that Smithfield is ensuring that the CCP gets its pork while Americans pay more for a product owned in part by China and produced by illegal labor. 

The wrong pigs are being slaughtered."
2020-06-16 16:28:51,"1) Why are people allowed to continue eating beautiful other-than-human animals?

2) Isn't it well past time we moved beyond the idea of growth to sustainability?"
2020-06-16 16:33:44,"Remember when Theodore Roosevelt passed the Meat Inspection Act in 1906? Now, Trump is in the process of undoing some of these rules that have long protected workers and consumers. He has authorized faster ""line speeds"" (the number of animals killed per minute) for poultry plants, and has begun attempting the same for beef. Additionally, Trump has cut 40-percent of government inspectors and delegated inspections to employees, who may not have undergone any kind of training in food safety!
To make it simple:
faster line speeds + less inspection = more food contamination.

Remember: self-regulation in industry and business never works."
2020-06-16 16:36:34,"The meat industry is controlled by a very few very large processors. To believe what they say is akin to believing in Santa Claus. Many of their employees will suffer and many will die of covid-19. No matter to them or the Trump Administration, as the bulk of industry workers are immigrants, and in their view, expendable."
2020-06-16 16:15:46,Greed runs through it.  #AmericanAcceptualism
2020-06-16 14:36:44,"Why can't China produce enough Pork in China? They are big pork eaters so why not raise it themselves at home? The fact that Smithfield was sold to a Chinese business tells that story. They have destroyed their own environment now they will destroy ours w/ even bigger factory ""farms"" producing extraordinarily higher levels of raw sewage and feces from sick pigs raised on hormones and antibiotics....really not fit for consumption by humans or dogs. And our Govt subsidizes these foreign owned companies? Why?"
2020-06-16 15:43:38,"So let's get this right - we are exposing workers to COVID and letting many of them die so we can send meat to China?

Greed is good!  Greed works!  America is truly great."
2020-06-16 16:05:07,"Smithfield is a wholly owned subsidiary of a Chinese pork producer, so it's not surprising that China gets most of its pork. As for Tyson and the rest, it's called profit-motivated capitalism. Forget all this theatrical China-bashing by Trump, Navarro and Pompeo. It's all hot air. Follow the money."
2020-06-16 16:09:14,"I'm shocked, shocked I tell you to discover that Big Meat USA is catering more to their customers in China than concerned with feeding the US population. ...and of course stunned, absolutely stunned, to discover they are using both US citizens and undocumented immigrants (and then throwing them out with the offal) to assure they kowtow sufficiently. Mostly in those proud, flag waving, MAGA hat wearing, ""China's our enemy"" GOP controlled places, too. I am so, so surprised."

2020-06-16 16:24:46,"So China scooped up millions of our PPE, so we had a shortage for our medical workers, putting them at even higher risk.

Then Americans were ordered to work and be at high risk of death, so tons of pork would go to China, not feed Americans.

2020-06-16 16:29:55,"The level of anti china sentiment here is just unfathomable.  When China buys American goods, from pork to high tech products, China gets blamed for taking advantage America.  When China stops buying, China gets blamed for the trade deficit.  What‚Äôs China supposed to do?  Pay top dollar for American junks that absolutely no one wants here?  (Like China has done for many years in the past importing American trash/recycles)."
2020-06-16 16:13:48,"China doesn't care about the rest of the world or about the well being of the planet. This is the country where the pandemic started and they are unabashedly taking advantage of the crisis to gain more power. They are responsible for driving species to extinction, building outposts in the South China Seas and taking over fishing grounds, strategically acquiring large companies abroad in order to fuel their growth, and using surveillance to clamp down on dissent. It's mind boggling that the rest of the world not only looks the other way while China goes about their dirty business, but willingly allows itself to be controlled and enslaved by this pathologically consumptive society in the name of the ever loving global economy.  It's also time we stop venerating out of control economic growth and stop overpopulating the earth because it is killing us. And it's time we stop eating so much meat, but China doesn't have any plans to."
2020-06-16 16:00:39,"There is so much I could say about this information. OMG the staggering number of these sentient beings being butchered per year! I mean, think about that-millions and millions of these smart, aware beings. Its heartbreaking. In addition to their suffering, what about the environmental pollution, the antibiotics and hormones that humans ingest by eating these creatures, the negative effects on human health, the mental and physical consequences of the poor workers performing this death duty every day at maximum speed? I wish I could un-know this stuff."
2020-06-16 16:03:41,"In other words Trump ordered the plants to stay open, and US citizens get sick, for the benefit of China."
2020-06-16 16:17:28,"Well, there it is.  The indisputable evidence that this is not about ‚Äúfeeding America‚Äù.  This is about profits and shareholders.  No one is surprised I‚Äôm sure, but it‚Äôs rare to have such clear facts.  Please everyone, please think about going vegetarian.  This greed, inhumane treatment of animals and lack of care for their employees has to be enough, doesn‚Äôt it?"

It's not going to invest in its consumers, or else, empowered, they might make real demands on ""their"" govt.  China has built about all of the useless domestic infrastructures--think uninhabited cities--that it can.  And it has oversold such infrastructure to third world countries, who now have the ticklish problem of overwhelming debt secured by, say, their ports and natural resources.

So, all that's left is shifting capital into first-world countries and buying our assets.  So, capital controls on foreign investment, esp by China, would do more to solve our trade deficit with them than tariffs and, as to US agriculture production, technology, or medical supplies and drugs, would empower US corps to decide how much to export to China at what price and when."
2020-06-16 17:19:06,"A few take-aways here: 1. Ractopamine.  I never heard of this before.  Given US  history of dealing with chinese provided baby formula and antibiotics I'm surprised to find they  ban some chemical compound that we freely use.  2. Exporting pork parts, and whole carcasses while claiming the US will run out of meat is a prime example of companies lining their pockets at the expense of the US consumer.  They can have the ""parts"", but if we dont have beef, we'll eat more pork and maintaining adequate supplies in the US is paramount. (I do think Smithfield's ""retooling"" is as much a PR tool as anything else) FWIW I suspect the beef industry is guilty of the same sort of things the pork industry is."
2020-06-16 17:20:45,"The meat packing industry need to be exposed for what it is - a concentrated oligopoly that makes the price of meat to consumers too high, and also squeezes what it pays to farmers.  Nothing in this article is surprising given Chinese ownership of Smithfield Farms.  There used to be many smaller meat processors around the country - these were all bought out or squeezed out of business by these giant firms.  Lack of competition has harmed both farmers and consumers.   People should know most poultry producers are ""integrators"" - the farmers do not own the birds, the rations and growing practices are dictated by the processor.  The farmer though takes all risk for mortality.   The entire meat/poultry industry is pretty rotten and Congress could do everyone a favor by having meaningful hearings and also instituting agricultural policy that would encourage returning to smaller, more localized processors.  Unfortunately this won't happen though."

2020-06-16 16:52:09,Smithfield has also deported undocumented workers before paying them. They are they leader in animal and human cruelty. Support a local or sustainable farmer or eat less meat. It‚Äôs that simple.
2020-06-16 15:22:31,"One subtext here is the number of workers who got sick (25,523) or died (89), along with all of the non-workers, including family members, whom they infected and who subsequently got sick and possibly died. Without better information, it is reasonable to hypothesize that their own infections resulted in the infection of at least twice as many others (>50,000 more) of which at least twice as many died (>180 more). 

Another subtext is China. No need to rehash all of that again here. It would, however, be nice to set aside the usual Trump racism and xenophobia. All other things the same, it isn't wrong to produce food and sell it to other countries. Even countries where un-white un-Trumpy Americans live.

All other things aren't the same, of course. The pork producers are big polluters. Meat production makes greenhouse gases. China is our largest pork buyer. The workers are mostly immigrants. 

Given the risks that pork plant workers were facing, a competent, ethical administration would not have forced the pork producers to stay open without guarantees that the pork would stay here. During the pandemic, they shipped 32% of their meat to China. The true motive was money not national food security. 

How many people should have to die or get very sick for a cheesy corrupt lie? For cold hard cash alone? And, yes, the un-white folks who work in these plants are people, too. Trump and Miller and the Trump base are still a little confused about that last point."
2020-06-16 16:38:32,"I wouldn't let anything from Smithfield even in my house let alone my body.  Now that I know China's biggest pork producer bought it out, I will not even get near it as I walk by in the grocery store."
2020-06-16 13:27:23,China should not be allowed to own essential industries in America. Allowing that opens the door to Smithfield someday heeding their Chinese masters and not selling pork in the US at all.
2020-06-16 13:28:08,"Smithfield was sold to the Chinese in 2013, during the Obama administration. Any attempt to blame Trump is pure liberal idiocy.  

Trump wants to bring back the production chain to the US and give Americans jobs.  If you can find fault with that, good luck."
2020-06-16 13:29:20,"The bottom line is that those that profit are the global mega rich who invest and the minimum wage immigrants who do the work.  There is no US national interest here, whatsoever.  The pig farmers will do just as well raising pigs exclusively for America.  

Or, we could all pay slightly more for our pork and workers could make more, and consume more, making the mega rich richer and their lives more equitable.  But hey, jeez, isn't that socialism, progressive, balanced?"
2020-06-16 13:37:16,"Smithfield is owned by the Chinese, so what is the problem there?  As for the others, all they want to do is to pump more money out of Americans.  It is almost like the drug business.  I can go to Mexico or Canada and get brandname American drugs for less that I can buy them in the US.  The pathetic thing about animal raising is the way that they are treated.  Hogs are not meant to be in pens that may hold hundreds and chickens are not made tome confined and force fed.  If you force feed a caged chicken for a while, her breast will be larger than Dolly Parton's."
2020-06-16 13:25:23,So much for MAGA lol

2020-06-16 15:28:16,"Well isn't that precious?  US citizens are unable to buy food because the owners of the food are sending it overseas to our enemies so the owner elites can can make money.  

Wait, there is more, the owners are often not US citizens.

Wait, there is more.  The pork production barns are spoiling our environment.

Wait, there is more.  The workers at the plants and pork barns are poorly paid people often on food stamps and medicaid that US citizens subsidize.

Wait, there is more.  The agribusinesses that own these facilities get USDA subsidizes to raise and export their pork.

Wait, there is more.  The republican party passes legislation to allow this to happen.

Wait, there is more.  The republican cult refused to shut down plants because of a deadly Covid-19 at the plants despite endangering the lives of thousands of rural inhabitants.

Wait, there is more.  During the Irish potato famine, the Brits shipped Irish potatoes to Britain while the Irish starved to death.

Wait there is more.  Does this sound like the US is being treated like a banana republic by the republican cult headed by djt and strongly supported by every one of the republicans in the Senate?  

This party is unpatriotic, authoritarian scum and needs to be removed in November.  Vote for freedom and liberty in November, vote Blue-Democrat."

2020-06-16 16:51:08,"So Trump wanted to be sure the Chinese did not get shorted pork. Trump is showing a commercial saying Biden is a China "" lover"" when in actuality once again it is Trump who is sucking up to the Chinese government. If Trump accuses someone else of something you can bet it is actually he who is doing whatever. Trump points one finger but 3 fingers are pointing back at himself. Trump and daughter are so tied to China it is hard to comprehend the extent. Trump has a hard time deciding who he rather betray the US to Russia or China. Trump is an Enemy of the US!"
2020-06-16 13:32:36,"Trump is the biggest liars ever. He is attacking VP Biden about China when he himself ( Trump) is so tightly wrapped with China it is disgusting. Trump as usual points the finger at someone with 3 pointing back at himself. Trump accuses others of what he is guilty of.  The people supporting Trump seem to have an amazing ability to rationalize and deny Trumps glaring lies and his deceit.  Trump poses the Greatest Danger to the existence of the Republic EVER in our history. Trump Only cares about himself and he is so Narcissistic no one else even exists.  God Save the Republic!

Secondly, as a corollary,  a local producer has the right to sell his business to a foreign entity to get the most money, [The exceptions are in high tech and not in meat supply]

Thirdly, consolidation is a natural phenomenon of a mature industry. [You can call me a Marxist but even Capitalist economists think the same]

2020-06-16 19:11:20,"We live in a world of global commerce, cross-ownership of businesses and large agro-business food supply. These trends have been apparent for the last 75 years, accelerated by convertible currencies, container ships, increased affluence and purchasing power in Asia and advanced information and communication systems and technology.   Trump, a man who made a living selling apartments to foreign money launderers, only offers sloganeering and political theatre to address the situation and the blunt and ineffective tool of tariffs to encourage exports and limit imports.  The export of pork to China and the poor treatment of immigrant workers in meatpacking plants are logical consequences of Trump's policies.  They should come as no surprise to anyone."
2020-06-16 20:15:46,"China's domestic pork production was devastated last fall by an outbreak of African Swine Fever Virus, which went under-reported in this country. I suspect the ASFV was an intelligence operation in the context of the Trade War, and there are plenty of documented cases of the US Intelligence Community carrying out such operations against Cuba. In any case, the outcome was to plug some of the imbalance of payments and to establish Chinese food-security-dependency on American exports which would forestall a US Currency collapse. If the dollar were to collapse (something inevitable) the US would be in a position of food overproduction. I don't think the authors of the article serve their readership by constructing a scandal and faking outrage out of something clearly sanctioned by the US Government. What we have is a situation where one lie has been stacked upon another lie and upon another lie all to explain away the current situation so nobody has to admit to lying."

What a remarkable absence of humane sensibility.  It's the second  New York Times article within a few weeks to examine meatpacking  that managed to ignore the terrified, screaming victims wheeling around the kill floor. For a paper so keen on serving the oppressed, that takes real talent."

2020-06-17 01:45:15,"The principle should to keep global trade moving. If America were to ban pork exports this sets a bad precedent. China may then impose its own import bans and this could escalate beyond the two countries. Before you know it, Mexico and Peru will ban exports of Avocados to the US. Then your truly and other fellow loyal NY times readers won't have anything to eat with their toast in the mornings."
2020-06-17 04:00:19,"So, Trump essentially forced low-wage laborers who work in these pork plants to stay at work under unsafe conditions, risking covid-19 infection (89 of them have died, and tens of thousands sickened), so that these companies could produce high profit sales to China, while threatening U.S. consumers with a fabricated meat shortage.

Why am I not surprised, given an administration that bends over backwards to appease big corporate donors."
2020-06-17 05:25:17,"Its a sad day for the American consumer when corporate America creates a false narrative of food shortages so they can secretly ship their products overseas at huge profit, meanwhile Americans are rationing supply at home. Doubly   concerning is dupping our government to keep business open during COVID 19 and exposing workers to health risks unnecessarily in order to rake in large corporate proffits.  I say time to boycot those corporations."
2020-06-17 05:45:06,"Fortunately, China is not a democracy. Otherwise, someone could run there for president, or start a News organization,  claiming that the African swine fever epidemic in that country had been started by the US as a conspiracy for making money by selling pork to China. Such a claim could quickly poison the relations between China and the US (let's hope Putin does not use this idea for setting up China against the US).

I am not in favor of such conspiracy theories. There used to be a rule (I do not know where) that it is forbidden to call 'fire' in a theater because the resulting panic can have severe results. With the Internet, it is very easy to spread rumors, and conspiracy theories are effective. Trump has started his political career with his birtherism of Obama, the big lie approach.

It does not bode well for this world when those politicians with the smartest lies and disinformation gain the upper hand over politicians that try to find practical solutions for the problems that their nations are facing.

It seems that the public wants to be amused; people are now literally 'amusing themselves to death' watching the horror of the current pandemic on their screens. Because of information overload, people cannot focus on what is important anymore and just stare at the headlights of the car that is about to overrun them."

This article clearly demonstrates that Trump and Trump supporting Republicans do not care about you, your community, the USA Constitution and our Country. These people need to be voted out and held criminally liable for this behavior. It's behavior indicative of corrupt Banana Dictatorships.

2020-06-15 17:10:28,I‚Äôm confused and upset that there was no mention of police force using tear gas on protestors and how incredibly dangerous that can be for the spreading of the virus. A substance that makes every facial orifice run and the transmittal of bodily fluids unavoidable. Not to mention the repercussions on respiratory health. Unfortunate omission Donald McNeil.
2020-06-15 20:27:26,"When Michael said ""the pandemic feels different from two weeks ago and I dont know why"" I couldn't stop laughing. You mean when the protests started happening and you never said a word about how dangerous it could be due to the virus? He made an entire episode about how black people are dying at disproportionate rates because theyre subjected to racist doctors and nurses and he never felt the need in any of those episodes to say something to protect black lives from contracting the virus and then have to experience racism or even death at the hands of doctors and nurses. Either he just doesn't believe that or he has a double standard.

This is a good piece on it: <a href=""https://spectator.us/cant-rally-riot-protest-democrats-coronavirus"" target=""_blank"">https://spectator.us/cant-rally-riot-protest-democrats-coronavirus</a>/"
2020-06-15 11:12:43,Very disappointing - very superficial. There was no talk about who are the groups at risk and how most of the spread is taking place. We actually do have a lot of this information. It would have been helpful to share this with listeners. There was little hopeful in this podcast - a lot of doom and gloom -  the guest was very fearful.  There are positive signs but clearly the NY Times Daily is not interested balancing this with the challenges. There is so much to be hopeful about after spending so long in fear.

I'd like to hear why cases there never declined despite early lockdowns. Is there something we need to be doing more of, in addition to lockdowns?"
2020-06-15 13:41:58,"Particularly as we confront a second spike in the Fall, it is important to know not just how many infections/deaths we are experiencing, but who in particular. We should know by now what people are becoming disfiguringly ill and/or dying, and who is recovering or even being asymptomatic. In short: can we roll the dice by letting some groups have occupational and social free rein, while keeping other groups consigned to social distancing and non-enclosed places and transport?"
2020-06-15 13:54:16,"Today's transmission could almost be described as terrorism.  How can you present a position that is so strongly ""pro-lockdown"" without offering any kind of counter argument? The person interviewed says that there is not enough fear.  He even says that we have become used to death AND dismisses the economic disaster faced by many people without any willingness whatsoever to address it as a legitimate issue.  What's more, not even Barbaro questions the interviewees orientation - even only for the sake of the function of journalist as devil's advocate.  It's like listening to Fox News."

2020-06-15 19:50:15,"I appreciate Donald McNeil's expertise and his found his assessment very helpful. But I was surprised by his decision not to see his new grandchild now or until a vaccine is available. Assuming he could walk or drive to where the grandchild lives, wouldn't it be possible for him and the grandchild's family to self-quarantine for two weeks prior to a visit? This is what my husband and I (both 71 years old and healthy) did before the birth of our now two-week-old granddaughter. Then we drove to their home (three hours away) to take care of our two-year-old grandson while they were in the hospital. There was a slight risk to us that they would be exposed while at the hospital, but we decided the risk was small enough to make it worth taking. Most of my friends are being similarly cautious, but still finding a way to see their grandchildren."

2020-06-15 23:19:11,"Donald McNeil talks of aerosol transmission through ""...tiny droplets that hang in the air inside a room for hours [that] can hold enough virus to transmit this disease..."".  But has it been scientifically established that droplets small enough to remain suspended in the air for hours contain sufficient virus particles to infect persons spending a few moments or a few minutes in the vicinity of those particles hours later?  I am a layperson, but this sounds like the infectiousness of measles, not Covid-19."
2020-06-16 13:35:47,I fear that contact tracing will remain toothless in the US unless the government agrees to compensate the positively identified and quarantined for the losses of job and income.

Perhaps the MTA can partner with Grayline, the tour bus company, and use their open air double-decker tour buses for local transport.

No one hardly wears a mask or practices social distancing. Many doctors are worried but. we live in Texas and unfortunately I think many people will get used to it. Those who can afford it, or make smart decisions or who can stay home will survive it but many will suffer. It should have never become political, but it has."
2020-06-16 07:11:23,"Thank you for informative episode.  Sometimes there is little good news, that doesn't make the reporting false.  As a Swede living in Stockholm,  me and my family have taken more precautions than required since early March. Sweden have a very high death rate per capita - among the highest in the world. Things are clearly not going well here. Several European countries have closed their borders to Swedish citizens this summer because of this. Don't blame reporters and scientists for lack of good news. We hope some good social  change comes from this too. We support the BLM protests, and hope people won't get sick. 
As for the environment: our trees have never looked so good, the sky is more blue than everyone - no airplanes, only  emergency helicopters flying Covid19 patients between hospitals."
2020-06-16 20:27:36,I appreciated this podcast. It‚Äôs everything that those of us in the high-risk category already know. But I had a question about one of the numbers that was mentioned.

Hundreds of people gather shoulder to shoulder, some without masks, spitting, yelling, touching all around them, sweating in heat in some paces, tear gas causing people to cry in some places, people taking packed busses together- and yet in your professional opinion its okay to protest in a pandemic because it is outside. No matter where you stand on the issue center of protest and understanding it is the publics right to protest you have to acknowledge the consequences, the casue and effect- it is what it is. You protest all across the country numbers will spike. They will rise. We took away righ to worship, right to education ext for sake of quaratine. People must of thought it was the right thing to break quaratine for protesting but during coverage of protest the NY times never addressed the obvious- what about the virus spread during protest? And finally the conclusion- the spike in young people isn't due to protest because it was outside. I'm a R.N in critical care in So CA it is very important that we convey a truthful message in regards to spread of virus. Come on Michael!"

Prisoners have the right to equal dignity without discrimination. They have the right to security of person.  The pandemic has been in our face for over 3 months. Haven't we learned anything?  There is no trial and error here.  These are known incubators and the spread can be halted.  Yes they are prisoners and they are serving time; however, a heavier penalty, in this case death, cannot and must not be imposed."
2020-06-16 16:43:30,"This is the most core issue for me. My family has a beloved relative in federal prison with health issues. He is there for a first-time, non-violent crime, and been a model inmate for one year. Most articles, including this one, that we can find are about state prisons, and do not discuss federal ones. State prisons at least have some saner governors in charge In April Bill Barr, who is the Overseer for the federal ones, wrote two memos suggesting that federal prisons release non-violent inmates with good inside records and solid homes to return to be sent out, to ""home confinement."" But he left the decisions up to individual wardens. The mentality inside prisons is not unlike police force, in that people are set in their assumptions and cautious to a fault about anything innovative. Yet there IS an obvious answer. State and federal prisons were NEVER set up for the kinds of quarantine, safe lockdown, and release to home confinement that are necessary now. What we get instead are people in prison who are a) likely to get sick and likely to die, since medical care there is thin to the point of tragedy, b) these people are living in wards for the most part, not cells, so those who call for social distancing inside of prison are asking for the impossible, and c) doing nothing puts every single American at risk, as this is exploding now and will further. It will reach the communities around these prisons. We need to rethink criminal justice at every level, not just police. NOW."
2020-06-16 16:44:04,Certainly seems like cruel and unusual punishment to keep inmates confined in a way that exposes them to high risk of a dangerous infection.
2020-06-16 17:30:26,"This poses a number of questions. There are tens of thousands of prisoners behind bars for non-violent crimes that could serve their sentence under house arrest. 

But, there are also tens of thousands of murderers, rapists and other really bad people that can't be trusted in society. Who makes the decision who is let out and who must stay in? These will be tough decisions with difficult ramifications."

Forget about focusing on the virus; disregard the risks prisoners, nursing home residents, and others who have to work in close conditions (to revive his economic numbers) while the number of cases continue to mount.

2020-06-16 21:32:17,"If CA prisons cost 12 billion per year (!) and there are about 131,000 state prisoners, then the money spent on each person is over $91,600 per year. How is there not enough money to test everyone (including the guards who are bringing COVID in), and segregate the infected from the general prison population? 

If ever there was a population that should be completely controllable it is those in prison. All guards should be wearing full face coverings to protect themselves and the inmates, do they? Why is it taking so long to test then let out the people who are short term, non-violent offenders?  

Dramatic prison reform is long overdue. For those who have served enough time but still have lots of time left for non-violent offenses, release them, give them $40,000 per year for 3-5 years to live and train for a job. Then take some of those saved billions and put them toward the care for the mentally ill and the addicted."
2020-06-16 23:27:04,"Clearly the answer is to put those prisoners who  are non-violent offenders on cruises. 
With social workers and not corrections officers.

Then Sheriiff Arpaio should be brought back on the federal level at the CDC to advise consumers setting up tents in prison yards to decrease population and increase fresh air."
2020-06-16 23:26:26,"Caring about the conditions of their inmates, including their medical health, goes against the culture of American prisons.

They have had such practices as refusing to segregate prisoners with hepatitis C, incoming, uninfected prisoners.

With a will to do a good job, prisons could have found a way to have protected most inmates from covid: no population is more controlled.

American corrections practices and work force culture, is what the defund movement is about. We need to deconstruct, top to bottom, the criminal justice system, especially prisons.

Incarceration costs $30,000 per year, but doesn't buy healthy food, fresh air, clean facilities, education or training, counseling, or decent medical treatment. 

Inmates sick with the virus, (which is 10x more painful than a common flu), can't count on being given Tylenol. 

After the expense and inhumanity of a 15 year sentence, an inmate is transported, often in prison garb, to a big city with $50, and released. Surprise! Our recidivism rate is 78%.

Please educate yourselves and support measures to end this cruel and broken system."

WCI have not offered inmates cleaning supplies in over 4 weeks,  WCI staff and inmates are not wearing face masks and gloves. WCI said they are doing extra cleaning on the housing units but in truth they only clean up twice a week. WCI limited our shower's to 2 showers a week and no one is cleaning the showers in between users, they have limited our ability to use the phones so that we can tel our loved ones what is happening in here. Recently there was a major outbreak here in WCI and all  inmates are on lock down. What is upsetting the most is being left in the dark in the midst of all of this, WCI does not tell us anything in regards to the outbreak here at WCI. We get information from local news or a verity of email services. Which puts us at a higher rate of risk for contracting Covid-19. We have no current information to help us defend ourselves against the virus and we fear for our safety and well-being, The community has a right to know what is really going on in here and my only hope is in doing this, that our voice will be heard by the right people and action will be taken to correct the wrongs being done here at the Waupun Correctional Institution.
Respectfully, Michael A Lanke #516838

No testing is being done & there's little to no effort by the jail to combat the spread of the virus.

This pandemic should cause law makers, Congress and Trump administration to reconstruct the judicial system in America. There's no reason to have all of these people incarcerated for offenses that are not a violent or sexual offense. This is only causing the spread to increase.

A nonviolent person that does not harm or is not a major disturbance to the community should not be detained & considered a criminal.

2020-06-15 19:13:51,"Is  ""migrantophobia""  even a word? 

 I think ""anti-immigrant sentiment"" would better explain the situation in Russia."
2020-06-16 00:47:42,"When visiting Russia some years ago I was amazed at the casual disparagement of various ethnic or geographic groups that I heard while there -- not just by what we would call Russians, but by the various groups talking about each other.  According to a Bashkiri woman I stayed with, Chechens were ""crazy"", Tajiks were ""lazy"", people from St. Petersburg were ""snobs"", etc.  But according to the latter, people from Bashkortostan are ""liars"".   Provincial and racist attitudes are not the exclusive possession of any one country."
2020-06-15 10:37:50,"It is no wonder that cases are back on the rise.  Two days ago I went to two small local stores.  One, none of the employees were wearing mask and about a dozen people, none of whom were wearing masks, were hovering over and breathing over open bins of donuts, the whole time crowding each other to get their pick.  The other store, while the employees were wearing masks, they were not stopping anyone from entering the store without masks.  Even worse, two deliverymen were there, neither of them were wearing masks.  They weren't any local ""hucksters"" either.  They were employees of CocaCola Bottling and Lays, to large corporations obviously doing nothing to abate the risk with their employees or their customers."
2020-06-15 10:52:31,"In April, when the president was impatient with the slow-moving economy that was essentially frozen by the spread of the virus, he began putting out there, for Americans' consumption, the fear of weakness and a call to strength. What he should have done was to caution Americans that this pandemic was in its earliest stages and that fighting it would take time. 

But he doubled down on his impatience and his nationalism. He exhorted those resentful of stay-at-home measures and and the advocates of caution to ""liberate"" their states. Timid officials then began to comply. The breakout, as it were, is now manifesting itself in what medical experts warn is likely to be an even more virulent strain of the initial one.

The president's gubernatorial allies in Georgia, Florida, Texas, Arkansas and through the South and other right-leaning states pulled the plug on the caution. With the warm weather now turning hot, viral infections have begun to rise. The stock market, seemingly impervious to the vagaries of illnesses and medical catastrophes, hummed on. Now, with the very real likelihood that, no, the virus has not gone away because the president and his friends wished it to, an even more disastrous second wave outbreak is likely to test our resolve in ways that many Americans angrily thought were burdensome and intrusive just a couple of short months ago.

Until a reliable vaccine is in place to cross swords with the plague, it's ""game on.""

And right now, we're losing. All of us."
2020-06-15 11:01:54,"According to the CDC, 80 percent of Covid-19 deaths have been in people over 65. As well, nearly half of deaths have been in nursing homes. Perhaps this population can continue to self isolate (and I think most want to - you don‚Äôt see older folks partying in the streets or not wearing masks too often) and the rest decide for themselves? Will the younger population get sick? Yes of course. Will our hospitals get overwhelmed with under-65 cases? Unlikely, as the illness is mild in 8 out of 10 people. How do we know? Beyond what has been studied in the past 4 months, the massive worldwide protests, comprised largely of young people, will be the proof in the pudding. Let‚Äôs see how many need hospitalization. So far not many."
2020-06-15 11:28:08,With the protesting and related violence slowing down and effort is made to ratchet up the Coronavirus again. No one should be surprised as more testing will find more people with it. The only numbers that matter are serious hospitalizations and deaths.
2020-06-15 11:30:05,"Ironic that the  picture shows an empty (locked?) city park picnic area of many acres, well socially spaced, when in fact that's exactly where people should be, instead of congregating on sidewalks.  Does anyone in city or state government have any idea what they are doing? I think the people are answering that question on a daily basis."
2020-06-15 10:35:48,"Where are the outbreaks in the Ozarks?
Minneapolis?
Pennsylvania?
How many new deaths in Florida yesterday?
Six.
How many new deaths in Texas?
Seven.
This out break is coming to an end.Of, of course we will continue to see new cases; but what we are now seeing is simply a regression back to a bad flu season equivalent- the vast majority of new cases being asymptomatic or minor illnesses.
We never closed down for the flu; hospitals were never overwhelmed.
The shut downs were pointless and caused nothing but economic pain."
2020-06-15 10:59:49,"The fact that Trump and the right wing media politicized mask wearing as something that liberals wear and that make you look ""weak or unmanly"" is why we are here. Look at Japan: a society that wears masks in public.  They did not have to shut down their country and this simple gesture is one of the reasons.  

We don't deserve to have nice things in this country, look at how a large portion of our population acts day-to-day."
2020-06-15 11:08:47,"Once again, the experts told us what would happen and then it happened. The virus is not affected by our wishful thinking, impatience and lack of political will."
2020-06-15 11:25:44,"It‚Äôs bad. We watched unmasked party after party this weekend in our building‚Äôs shared courtyard - including about 2 dozen adults and children celebrating a one-year olds birthday. Trust me, the one year old is not going to hold it against his parents for not having a party. 

I‚Äôm seriously shocked at how people are in denial."
2020-06-15 10:55:12,"The problem here is one that the readers of the NYT don‚Äôt want to admit: Homo sapiens should not live in mega-cities and travel around the world indiscriminately. In mega-cities, mass transportation, places where large number of people are entertained, served food, and congregate for other reasons is essential...it cannot be avoided: Grand Central Station, Broadway, the N.Y. Yankees...the essence of New York. Mega-cities are hubs for National and international travel. 

Potentially lethal viruses pop up sporadically in the human population. With the growth in the world
population, these random events occur more frequently. I‚Äôm the pre-mega-city, pre-easy accessible travel human society, such viruses would flame and die out before the fuse ignited an epidemic or pandemic. Now, the conditions are right for these random viruses to take hold in a large segment of the human population and cause havoc. We have SARS, MERS, and now COVID-19 just within the past decade. Expect more."
2020-06-15 10:15:59,"Interesting.   They are flouting the rules in Manhattan and the Hamptons.  Governor Cuomo don‚Äôt punish the rest of us who
For the most part are sacrificing for the common good.   Shut down Manhattan and the East end townships where arrogance is in abundant display.    Finally I remind everyone that West Point is in NY.   When one group flouts the rules right or wrong everyone has license to do so."
2020-06-15 11:06:30,"‚ÄúAnd as strict social distancing wanes, some leaders in New York and Texas are threatening renewed lockdowns in an effort to get people to take the persistent threat of the virus seriously.‚Äù ‚Äî where, oh where was this concern for public safety, in the media or in government, when tens of thousands were marching in the streets, and looting commercial district after commercial district?  The hypocrisy and double-standards are clear. Middle class people having a group cocktail = threat to us all. ‚ÄúProgressives‚Äù en masse for days on end = no problem.  Looters = ideal behavior!

For the record, I agree that mass cocktail hour is a bad idea. No masks in stores, also bad. 

But the failure of the media to criticize the mass gatherings of the past two or three weeks - is indefensible."
2020-06-15 10:35:53,"New behaviors take time to learn and become ingrained. We are about to enter a phase of rolling lockdowns as infection spikes occur when people become lax in their preventive measures. Like or not, this will be the new normal for the next couple of years."
2020-06-15 10:55:18,"This all goes back to Trump calling the virus a hoax with 15 cases going to zero. 

Just think of the difference it would have made had he listened to the intel in January ‚Äî on that alone, he could have effectively secured his re-election for 2020. 

It is not that he is a bad leader ‚Äî he is not a leader at all and yet he is still the worst; a unique distinction reserved only for a Trump."
2020-06-15 11:09:20,"I got scolded by a woman in my local super market, as I mistakenly went down the wrong way in the bread isle - new instructions that I momentarily forgot. She was so rude. I apologized briefly and was grateful she didn't whip out her phone to put me on social media."
2020-06-15 10:35:43,"Here in NY, the photos of Central Park would put any zombie movie to shame.

No masks, no social distancing, not a hint of hand sanitizers.

Methinks everyone has swallowed the Trump lie that when the sun comes, the virus will disappear like a miracle.

If Cuomo is listening to experts, he needs to impose another lockdown now as obviously no one is no longer taking the virus seriously.

In South Korea where sanitation is a national sport and hygiene is a national pastime, they have to close bars and restaurants again after two days of reopening to arrest a second wave."
2020-06-15 11:17:55,"Yes, the lockdown should continue. A voluntary lockdown down of the at-risk population. Everyone else needs to go work, to school, to church, to the store and do their part to stay healthy. Any suggestion to the contrary is tyranny and nonsensical. 
And those who claim anyone wanting to open up society is heartless and trying to kill aunt Betty needs to stop with the propaganda. This is life."
2020-06-15 11:43:42,"The article says, ""There has been frustration as people flout restrictions related to the virus."" This is incorrect. I live in TX, and people aren't flouting restrictions because there are few restrictions to flout. Most businesses are open at 75% capacity at least with masks ""encouraged."" So people are walking around in busy businesses buying products sans masks. And testing is more available, but people aren't getting them because there's no point with everything opening up anyway. The number of cases are skyrocketing because we reopened too early and too much."
2020-06-15 10:34:19,"To me, the United States has never been sadder.  

Over 100,000 dead from a pandemic, many who never even got to say good-by to loved ones. Many who never even had a funeral but their bodies were stacked in refrigerated trucks.  

Healthcare personnel have seen atrocity that they never dreamed of. They didn‚Äôt even have protective gear at times.  

Communities depended on leadership from Washington to tell them what to do. Instead they got a mix of lies, advice and stories that changed on a daily basis. Their own president would not even cover his face and advised people to use a drug that was far from proven. Their VP was supposed to be in charge, but didn‚Äôt know which end was up either. Now the US leads the world in COVID cases, over  2 million. No more advice - everybody just does their own thing. 

Then the country was brought down to its knees by the murder of a Black man right on the street, a murder by a police officer - someone hired to keep citizens safe. The country has stood up to that, cried out, taken to streets, suffered painful loss, once again.  And people were poisoned for gathering on the streets so a president could hold a Bible upside down.They were harmed by police who should have been protecting them.

People are jobless.  Where is the next dollar while the wealthy were given billions by our government. Others carry on and get sick, unprotected.  

Young people, don‚Äôt even know about school. Will it be? 

The US. Confused. No one in charge. Empty. Sick."
2020-06-15 10:50:10,"People behaving like this virus has magically disappeared and for them to start to congregating in beaches, restaurants and bars is just mind boggling. Lockdown was difficult for everyone so why not practice some restrain to make sure we‚Äôre not super spreaders only to force the local governments to make the tough decision of locking down again? Why are people so utterly selfish? Why can‚Äôt you hold on dining at a restaurant or going to the beach or the bar?"

2020-06-15 11:56:14,"On May 8th Trump tooted that this virus ""is going to go away without a vaccine.""

Well . . . still waiting for this virus to ""magically go away"" Mr. President.

In the meantime, new cases continue to emerge in many, many states.  And I continue to see more people NOT wearing face masks nor keeping any kind of social distancing.  Don't think for a New York minute that those cues were not ""inspired"" by Trump's refusal to even consider wearing a mask from the very beginning."
2020-06-15 12:00:29,"This is not a second wave, this is the first, and it's continued upward incline will far exceed where we've been.

Until we have a unified national program, and adequate PPE for healthcare workers and private citizens, the death toll will only increase.

For whom the bell tolls, it tolls for all of us. No one is immune - not even you, ""President"" Trump"
2020-06-15 11:58:03,"Why not divert some of the $3 trillions stimulus package into creating the jobs that we desperately need people to do right now, such as contact tracing? COVID-19 has changed the world, and we should divert stimulus spendings into creating jobs that the future economy would need, not just to stimulate what is left of the old economy. Just to safely reopen the society, we would need to boost contact tracing capabilities across the nation, and it would be wise if some federal stimulus money is spent now to create a national corps of contact trackers under either FEMA or CDC who can be quickly deployed to contain any new viral outbreaks/hotspots when the local county/city health department would be otherwise overwhelmed. It would be quite a shame if, after spending $3 trillions, the United States, unlike countries such as Germany, South Korea, Vietnam, New Zealand and Taiwan, still lacks the basic public health infrastructures to safely reopen its civil society."
2020-06-15 11:57:45,"I hope Cuomo makes good on this threat, frankly. It would send a strong message to the people who are behaving so recklessly while others among us continue to stay at home as much as possible, keep 6 feet apart and wear masks in public. You‚Äôd think after all that NYC has gone through people could exercise a little more restraint and common sense."
2020-06-15 12:02:11,The disastrous chaotic results are a result of the lack of leadership from Trump.  He values money over life.
2020-06-15 11:52:29,"We, the people, will not be forced into another lockdown.  We will ignore the so called expert's advice and we will continue to work and feed our families. It you want to commit economic suicide, so be it."
2020-06-15 11:54:25,"Americans will never be able to behave as a group in a way that will benefit their community or country as a whole; they have largely lost that ability; sacrificed it at the altar of individuality and narcissism. Once it's gone, it will never come back. America is, I am afraid, doomed."

2020-06-15 12:07:01,Isn‚Äôt the administration‚Äôs argument that expanded unemployment benefits do not incentivize people to go back to work clear evidence of the need for a living wage??
2020-06-15 12:07:05,"It's time to reassess all COVID responses in light of what is now known. The IFR is much lower than initially supposed, in line with seasonal influenza - the CDC's latest estimate is 0.26%, but that's heavily skewed to the oldest portion of the population and in people with pre-existing co-morbidities. Our rulers should question whether global lockdown is justified in those circumstances, especially when we have so much data now available on the costs of lockdown - which might include increased fatalities from COVID itself. There should also be serious attention to all those actual costs - on mortality from untreated conditions, on educational losses that have affected nearly a third of the population, on mental health, on hope for the future, on freedom of movement, on public confidence in health care and government itself.... There's more to government than COVID."
2020-06-15 12:07:15,"The issues in this crises are multiple and connected.
I‚Äôm a bus driver in a large city in Texas. Yesterday I worked for eight hours and serviced about 100 passengers. I counted five passengers wearing masks. 
The transit agency provides five masks at the beginning of every shift. I handed out all of them within two hours. 
The transit agency where I work does not mandate mask wearing for passengers. This places not only my life at risk but everyone aboard the bus. 
So what then is to be done? Mandate mask wearing and thereby give the police another vector through which to brutalize people? 
What we are witnessing is the beginning stages of the global triage of humanity. Some will be able to shelter and greatly reduce exposure. Most will not be able to shelter and reduce risk of virus contraction for many reasons: lack of shelter, lack of income and provisions, imprisonment, state pressure to go to work under threat of eliminating and acquiring unemployment insurance to name a few. 
This is the crisis of our age. It is defined by capitalism‚Äôs inability to generate incomes for the majority of humanity, to provide jobs and meaningful social roles, end fossil fuel emissions, and translate revolutionary biological advances into public health.
These are convergent, inseparable crises and must be seen in their complex ensemble, not as separate issues.
We are quite simply failing to marshal the productive forces necessary for species survival."
2020-06-15 12:15:27,"I ventured into a big box hardware store yesterday.  Very few were wearing masks.  My next stop was a discount department store.  Again, very few wearing masks and that included those in high risk age groups.

I heed the warnings this virus is deadly and take the advice of those professionals to practice safety over the politicians, especially one in particular.

The counter argument is we need to get on with our lives and cannot be held hostage.  I somewhat agree.  But, we need to be diligent in our conduct.

But, this was no worse than the flu, will be gone by Easter, we have it more under control than other countries and very few in this country will die.

And people believed that nonsense.  And I need no attribution as many will recognize the source.
Don‚Äôt believe what that source says."
2020-06-15 12:24:45,"What happened to the concern for healthcare worker?

I realize this is so ""2 months ago"" but is there enough PPE, ventilators, staff support for the state healthcare systems to deal with what New York went through?

Is this how a society treats it's heroes?"
2020-06-15 12:25:37,"For the duration of this alleged pandemic, governments and media have been reporting deaths ""from Covid"" as if those deaths were directly caused by the virus. Statistics from multiple countries show, the vast majority of people who died 'from Covid' actually died from serious underlying health conditions and, if present, Covid may have merely 'contributed' to these deaths, or not. This scenario plays out every year with other seasonal flu-like viruses.

The same would be true for Covid-19, if it were not for the fact that in early March, the WHO and the health authorities of major nations decided to 'upgrade' Covid-19 to a notifiable disease, thereby making it reportable on death certificates as the underlying cause of death. In addition, memos were sent by the respective health authorities attending physicians with new guidelines on how to fill in death certificates with instructions  that physicians were to write C19 as the underlying cause of death if a patient had symptoms that matched the vague diagnosis guidelines regardless of whether or not the patient had been tested for C19.

One week before the UK lockdown, the Italian health authority knew that at least 99.2% of those who had died 'from' this virus had serious comorbidities. 50% of those had at least three. So why did the governments of the UK, France, Spain, Germany, US decide, against all reason, to impose a punitive lockdown on their entire populations, in the process causing untold suffering and to so many?"
2020-06-15 12:25:59,"The trouble now with Beijing is we have to assume a multiplier of anywhere from 3X to 16X to get the actual number of new cases. So, if they report 70, then 210-1120 is the real number."
2020-06-15 12:31:27,"Per C.D.C.- there are over 480,000 smoking related deaths per year in U.S.  this means that there have likely been more than twice as many smoking related deaths than Covid-19 related deaths this year.  We have shut down great swaths of the economy to try and limit Covid- morbidity and mortality, but even during the strictest lockdowns, cigarettes are still legally and readily available."
2020-06-15 12:35:17,"It pains me to say, but given the gross mismanagement of the ongoing pandemic in the US, both at the state and federal levels, combined with the opening up of economies in Europe, the EU should seriously consider imposing a mandatory 14-day quarantine on anyone arriving from the US, including travelers who have recently visited the US but may be arriving from a non-US point of origin.

Perhaps the one time that ‚ÄúProudly Made in the USA‚Äù is to be shunned: the risk of importing a US-based second wave is too high."
2020-06-15 12:45:46,"Hanging out on the stoop, as mentioned in today‚Äôs article, reminded me of my childhood in Brooklyn, where neighbors in the Boulevard Housing Project would all gather on the wooden benches in front of their building on a warm summer evening and talk, laugh, tell stories, and generally commune. No reason that couldn‚Äôt be done today, with strict adherence to social distancing and adequate mask protection- it‚Äôs the socially responsible democratic way!"
2020-06-15 12:45:49,"WEAR A MASK: I fear that this behavior is happening everywhere. Every tweet, every Instagram post, every tv interview about ANYTHING should begin with a reminder to WEAR A MASK. Since we don‚Äôt have a president interested in keeping Americans safe during a pandemic, anyone with any influence should start every public statement with WEAR A MASK."
2020-06-15 12:48:31,"No one is focusing on this but by default, Trump‚Äôs national policy in action is clearly herd immunity. There is no appetite to talk about the virus much less spend any money on testing, tracing, and thereby reducing infections. He‚Äôs trying to manage the perception, not the reality."
2020-06-15 12:49:09,"So we have more than 2 million coronavirus cases, about a quarter of the world's deaths and Dr.Fauci's prediction that the pandemic will be with us for at least another year. To which the Trump administration responds by urging a yet more quicker reopening without a vaccine, without universal testing and without a concerted national effort to increase contact tracing. What, I wonder, is an acceptable casualty count?"
2020-06-15 12:49:56,"The lack of leadership and clear unified communication at the federal level has left it to the state and local governments to be the adults in the room.

As much as I admire Gov. Cuomo's efforts, after moving here from a state who's Governor told people to just pray, I see people not paying attention any longer to either wearing masks or social distancing.

Sadly, we are a people of very short attention spans and desire for instant gratification and led by a President who only cares about his ego and income."
2020-06-15 12:44:43,"Barring development of an effective vaccine, the only way America gets a handle on this is to make mask-wearing in any and all public places mandatory, no exceptions. Any business or public accommodation permitting unmasked patrons is shut down for a week on the first offense, closed indefinitely on the second. However, we lack the political will to do this."
2020-06-15 12:25:17,"It appears the pandemic will be like everything else in this country. It will create winners and losers.

 It is extremely unlikely there is anyone left in America who isn't aware  the virus continues to rage and that  there are easy steps  to minimize the risk of infection and death. Way too many people  continue to ignore those rules at their own peril with a strong underlying notion that this is a ""free country."" 

State and local governments ought to conclude this is a fight no longer worth having. Unfortunately the leader of this country lends them no support and actually encourages people to put their lives needlessly at risk. Consequently, if people value their lives that little, who are we to judge?"
2020-06-15 12:53:39,"Beijing government two days ago quarantined quite a few residential areas adjacent to a large fruit, vegetable, and seafood market due to recent discovery of 45 people with virus infections.  Strictly lockdown was in place. A systematic virus testing started on all residents in these areas.  They are very serious.

Compared to our own federal and local government responses, we seem to be very relax and business as usual.  And we still expect someday this virus will go away just like magic. Or a sliver bullet like a vaccine will suddenly appear to solve all the problems. 

Since when do we become so inept and risk tolerant? In my opinion, this is unacceptable to handle this pandemic."
2020-06-15 12:19:54,"So, just running some numbers for the Republican convention in Florida: 50,000 attendees for a week in an inclosed space, all screaming and yelling. Most would not have taken the PCR test before entering. Thermometer checks don't tell you if you are in the early incubation phase, therefore some number of people will carry the virus in. Most visitors won't wear mask, being good Trumpies. 

And since we know in a choral rehearsal of 1.5 hours, one person can infect 50, it is reasonable to assume EVERYONE in the convention center will become infected.

The death rate is 3.5% of those infected, so 1750 attendees will die."
2020-06-15 12:37:35,"Our government officials and not just Trump have failed at an elimination strategy and are prepared for hundreds of thousands of deaths. We squandered the lockdowns and people are painting a picture of the inevitability of infections and Sophie's Choice between economic disaster vs limiting the virus.  This is a completely false choice as has been demonstrated in the country after country.  Since China is being painted as evil and the boogeyman, go no further than the white, democracy of Australia.  They have virtually no new cases and only 102 deaths.  If AU had a comparable population in the US, it would be approximately 1500 deaths as compared to our ~11500 deaths.  We are adding about as many deaths on a population-adjusted basis every 2 days as AU has had the entire time.   Japan (with a very old population) has had ~1000 deaths (comparable to ~3000 vs US).   If the US would simply 1) Mandate masks 2) Mandate masks 3) Mandate masks 4) stay 6' apart 5) Keep closed select businesses that act as superspreaders - arenas, beaches, gyms, etc, we could keep  95% of the economy intact and not sacrifice other 100K Americans to our own ego-driven lack of policy."
2020-06-15 12:57:44,"I have met a lot of people that think this whole pandemic problem is nothing more than media hype.  Mostly the elderly.  Young people for the most part do not fear the virus thinking it is no worse than the flu.  We know who we can thank for the denials.  Isn't loss of life much worse than loss of work?  But what do I know?  Such a simple task to wear a mask or practice social distancing.  It is a new way of life until a vaccine is available.  Speaking of vaccines, I read that only 43.5% of adults bother with flue shots.  Disturbing."
2020-06-15 12:59:44,"Until we have an accurate antibody test,  we will have no way of knowing  whether we are close to achieving any of our several definitions of ""herd immunity"".  

At the moment,  we are in the waning stages of Wave 1.  We are unclear as to whether the steady decline back to our starting point is attributable to lockdown practices,  to herd immunity, or to seasonal change in which UV radiation, heat, humidity, and greater dispersal of the virus when people interact outdoors.

It is a very uncomfortable state of missing information."
2020-06-15 13:02:59,"How can the experts determine that states opened ""too early"" against the residents not taking adequate precautions?  Another narrative is spreading among the president's allies - that the protests created the spike.  Rather than fight about causes, maybe we need to redouble our efforts at providing the unifying message that all experts have agree from the beginning and never waivered: distancing, masks, hand hygiene are the key behaviors.  These elements should be universally enforced indoors, and also outdoors where conditions may be crowded.  The word has been socialized that there are no documented cases of outdoor transition in China (why do we still after all this time only see research from China?), but people in China were uniformly wearing masks outdoors.  Still people share this to convince themselves that outdoors is safe, without acknowledging the mask component.  We need studies of crowded outdoor conditions quickly."
2020-06-15 13:02:59,"There is no way that a second lockdown will occur. The benefit of the lockdown is likely fewer infections and illness/deaths. However, the costs of the lockdown are astounding. First, there are economic costs. These include the trillions of debt we are passing to future generations as well as a further split of society into the haves (technology workers, the highly educated that can work productively from home, etc.) and the have-nots (those working in the service economy who cannot work from home). Second, there is the pain, trauma and likely deaths from eliminating one of the most basic needs of human life - socialization with others. When in lockdown many people are alive, but are certainly not living. For many, being in lockdown is no different than being in solitary confinement in prison."
2020-06-15 13:03:39,"If we could stop the spread of COVID from person to person for two weeks it would be gone. Several countries have controlled it effectively. But we need sustainable countermeasures. Most businesses can operate quite safely if everyone wears masks consistently, maintains distance and is financially able to stay home if they are sick. Meat packers should be directed by OSHA regulations, not allowed to ignore OSHA ""suggestions"". Restaurants have to increase spacing and disinfect tables between customers. For bars there is no solution as people have no judgement when they are intoxicated. It only takes a second for someone to cough on their hand, shake your hand, and for you to touch your face. 

We don't need lockdowns, we need sustainable infection control. We need to tell the public the truth, motivate them to take precautions, provide enough high quality masks, and make it possible for anyone with symptoms to stay home."
2020-06-15 13:04:31,"So we either:

1.  Continue to avoid infection until a vaccine appears or 220 million inhabitants of the US slowly catch the flu. 

Or

2.  Give up on mediation and get on with herd immunity, accepting that suffering and death are inevitable in either scenario. 

I am not expecting a vaccine so, Fast or slow?"
2020-06-15 13:03:21,"Really wondering what situation I will be in the end of July when these benefits run out. I‚Äôm a professional sports and wedding photographer...I don‚Äôt have a single gig booked, all events cancelled until further notice and let‚Äôs say they do come back, what was once a lucrative sports photography gig could be completely wiped out based on how they proceed. We used to photograph 1,000 kids a weekend in gymnastics events and now how will that work? I‚Äôve been applying to amazon and the like for weeks and haven‚Äôt heard a peep. I guess being internationally recognized sports photographer for 15 years doesn‚Äôt translate well on a resume to minimum wage work. Already see the large crack I‚Äôm about to fall in and have saved every cent of this 600.00 a week to survive the coming drought but that won‚Äôt last very long owning a home on Long Island with a wife who is also on furlough possibly through the end of the year."
2020-06-15 12:12:42,"There will likely be no new lockdowns.  They would completely destroy the economy, which is hanging on the Fed and money printing anyway, a few wrong words from Powell, and it will go down the drain, already half way there.

If the worst comes to the worst, there should be no indiscriminate lockdowns and you better forget stay at home orders or ideas.  Besides, there is zero scientific and apolitical proof that the first stay-at-home fulfilled its role.  Masks, gloves, social distancing should be made mandatory, no large gathering but forget about shutting it all down at all.  Speaking of large gathering, the protests should be stopped.  Just stopped, by any means needed."

Now, even though those guidelines have not be relaxed, many residents here have decided that enough is enough. Restaurants, stores, hair salons are doing brisk businesses indoors, leading me to think that this could lead to an uptick in cases. The battle between restricting one's normal lifestyle and abandoning advice from epidemiologists is palpable. We are still following CDC guidelines but I understand the frustration."
2020-06-15 13:24:11,"I'm surprised and disappointed to hear that in so many parts of the country people are not wearing masks. It's such a simple way to make a positive difference. I'm proud to say that when I venture out of my home in northern NJ, I see everyone wearing masks, and all businesses complying with the ""no mask, no service"" guideline. I know that this is partially because Bergen County was so hard hit, but you'd think people would learn from what happened here. Do they really need to see their own communities devastated before simply slipping on a mask in public?"
2020-06-15 13:27:56,"The government is playing with psychological fire because what they're doing with their politburos and their lockdowns is usurping the natural freedom of the people. This, quite literally, is a policy that goes against nature. 
What that means is that the government is going to increasingly be faced with a choice: Enforce the lockdown at the point of a gun or lose control. Either way,  government loses all legitimacy. 
The shutdown/lockdown was the worst policy error in the history of the world. Doubling down on that shutdown will lead to anarchy and the warning signs are already so clearly in evidence, one wonders whether anarchy is the goal. 
Why foment anarchy? 
Anarchy will cost legitimate government workers their jobs and pensions, so it is hard to see how the policy will help government. On the other hand, some financial interests might well benefit to a very extreme degree once the legitimate government is out of the way. 
Just some thoughts..."

And, if it‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre fooling us, then why are we letting them get away with placing people in this type of tin-can environment for hours at a time? Many thanks to those people wearing masks, and correctly."

2020-06-15 13:18:06,"I am the only person who finds it ironic that the so-called party of ‚Äúlife‚Äù is practically eager to throw millions of Americans under the bus rather than take common sense measures that could allow the economy to move forward AND protect public health:  a short, but intense, lockdown, coupled with mass testing and contact tracing through QR code apps, and universal wearing of masks. New Zealand, Australia, South Korea and other countries that did this now have the freedom to move about and return to business with reasonable precautions still in place. By contrast, the anti-leader in the White House inexplicably refused to pursue a comprehensive federal response to COVID-19, has made wearing a mask a political issue rather than a common sense health protection, and insists COVID is behind us. As a direct result, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Americans will die needlessly.  The right wing‚Äôs selfish refrain of ‚Äúliberty‚Äù  to get a haircut and not wear a mask endangers us all and will hobble our economy for months, of not years, to come. 

Vote a straight Democratic ticket at every level in November to restore sane, competent leadership."
2020-06-15 12:10:44,"This is a failure of messaging, which has been a failure of our pandemic response all along. First, no one in charge sounded the alarm early enough. Then the alarm was mild: we were told masks weren't necessary and schools didn't need to close. Not enough people took ""social distancing"" seriously because it sounds like something Gwyneth Paltrow made up. (Why we didn't just encourage everyone to go into ""quarantine,"" a word people understand, I don't know.) Then all of a sudden masks became necessary. There've been confusing messages about how the virus spreads, and who's most vulnerable, etc. Now, our leaders trumpet ""reopening"" and they're surprised when people start partying in the streets. There has to be clear, smart, consistent messaging. I realize this is a somewhat unprecedented situation, but surely someone in charge could've foreseen that shouting ""reopening"" from the rooftops was going to lead to flouting of restrictions and common sense. Instead, just tell the truth: we are not reopened. People in certain industries are allowed to go back to work, but that's it. Everyone else: quarantine."
2020-06-15 13:03:22,Trump sure looks like he is recovering from COVID 19 and the evidence is who would take a malaria Rx when not symptomatic.  He cannot sip water one handed and shuffles along with a slight incline when heading down.  He might be feeble due to age but this seems more circumspect to the virus.
2020-06-15 13:36:56,The lockdowns must be renewed fully and completely until all citizens start following the directions of the government officials and political representatives.  This may need to remain in effect for years or at least until the end of the year.  Government officials know what is best and everyone needs to do as they are told.  Deviation from permitted activities must not be tolerated.
2020-06-15 13:40:55,"Billing this as a binary ""to be locked down"" or ""not to be locked down"" is part of the problem.  As a society we need to reimagine how we are going to conduct business for the next full year.

We need to keep people separated until a safe, reliable, vaccine is produced at scale.  

That means actively making it easier for people to work at home.  Instead of small handouts we need to invest in giving people the tech they need to operate as much as possible from home while only the people that need to manipulate hard materials are permitted to go to work.  And then, those people should be divided into thirds and work on a rotating schedule of A,B, and C shifts.  Whether that is every 8 hours, or every third day.

Forget about the pipe dream of in-person schools, and reduce workloads of working parents to allow them to help in remote learning with their children with the attention that necessitates."

I wear a mask everytime I go indoors.  I do not live in a crowded area so keeping my distance from people isn't hard, so I don't wear on outside unless in a situation where I cannot social distance.

The total number of US military deaths in World War I, from combat and disease (Spanish Flu mostly), was 116, 516.  That means that sometime this week the official death toll from the coronavirus after less than four months will exceed the US death toll in WW I during nineteen months.  A week ago Friday Donald Trump said at a press briefing that the coronavirus epidemic in the US was in the dying embers stage.  ""Only a few flames will shoot up which we know how to take care of.""  Such massive incompetence for the welfare of American citizens in the face of a crisis has not been seen since Herbert Hoover facing the Great Depression. The US could have been New Zealand, or Portugal, or South Korea, or even Greece to name just four countries which survived the pandemic without catastrophic losses.

2020-06-15 13:03:59,"The expectation of a vaccine may not be available as promised. From lab to mass application, time is something people do not want to consider.

That figure of 70% needed to achieve herd immunity was what happened with 1918-20 flu pandemic. But there will be a cost in both lives lost and economic disruption.

Medical treatment is better today than 100 yrs ago. And the number of deaths may not reach the worldwide figure of 100 million dead. [The old figure of 50 million is considered outdated. Researchers have determined that many countries either failed to record or concealed the real count. Laura Spinney‚Äôs Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World provides a telling picture. Ms Spinney explains why the 50 million figure is inaccurate and that the real number approaches twice the old accounting.]

Quarantines, vaccines developed against Pfeiffer‚Äôs bacillus and herd immunity were all employed in 1918. A great deal can be learned from the century old pandemic‚Äîmore than one wave, the human cost and a transformed world.

It was beset with economic collapse and the persistence of the virus. Will people comply with another lockdown, will young people accept the obliteration of their lives and plans? Who can enforce a lockdown without a social contract that is accepted by the majority? How can we have widespread protests and political rallies and pretend we are following guidelines? The questions abound; the answers are missing. It's too complicated for me. Our leaders and potential leaders, all of them, don't supply us with answers. Are there answers?"

Yes, the economy is broken - which is only slightly different than it being corrupt, and swollen from greed.

Yes, our social lives are suffering - the horror!  Inconvenience, and a glimpse of mortality piercing the lie of self sufficiency.

We are tied together by more than Covid-19 - but more than anything else has in a century, it is showing us just how dependent we are on each other, and where the frays in the fabric of our society are.

More of us are going to get sick and die - and even more of us will die if we ignore this virus, and act as though being able to walk into Wal-Mart without a mask is somehow more important than protecting the lives of those you share this life with."

To make courageous decisions on public health facts and data is something that most politicians do not want to do.
So when Oregon delays its opening due to a spike on cases, hospital admissions and deaths, the governor (Brown) is to be applauded.
Those governors and federal officials who say we will not close no matter what, are expecting and accepting of a certain number of deaths (elderly and minorities). They say we are talking about lives and livelihoods....correction: Just livelihoods.
Yes, sure they say they urge the public to practice social distancing and mask wearing but a certain % of the population that does not apply to them so many do not hear it and cannot be bothered. They put not just themselves in danger but others.

Illogic:I will die but my individual rights were not taken away.

The Present: To live and die in America."
2020-06-15 13:58:52,The governors are not listening to CDC warnings and people are not paying any attention to social distancing and wearing masks. We have to pay a vey big price . The coronavirus is dangerous and will stay with us. Now we have to decide whether we want more infected and more death or we want less suffering. The politicians do not care for us . They care for economy. We are behaving like Rambo that the virus can not touch me until get infected. Some of the countries have controlled the virus and we can learn from them. I feel bad for the front line Healthcare Workers who are working so hard and put their lives at stakes. The older people are worst suffering because younger people bring the virus to home where they live.
2020-06-15 13:32:26,"Perhaps if wearing a mask and practicing social distancing (and staying at home if you feel sick) had been framed as doing one's duty to support America and Americans, we might not be where we are today.  For those who want to complain about how wearing a mask, or keeping their distance, infringes on their individual rights, I'd say, even if you are so callous as to say you don't care about getting someone else (or multiple people) sick if you are an asymptomatic, or even a symptomatic carrier, then think about how getting someone else sick might impact their ability to make a living.  If you believe that the economy should take priority, then think about how getting a small business owner sick may lead to them having to shut their business down, for a month and lay off employees--who may have only started back to work.  What if you get someone sick who doesn't have health insurance and they end up in the hospital?  You could be contributing to someone being subject to tens of thousands in medical bills.  If you think for a moment about the potential impact of the virus being spread widely in a short period of time, you will realize that this could render businesses unable to function, if large numbers of their employees are getting sick.  That so many New Yorkers (see the street party on St. Mark's, in Manhattan a few days ago) are apparently willing to abandon the basic steps to avoid a recurrence of the virus is truly befuddling."
2020-06-15 12:34:56,"sadly, we hear very little about the long lasting and devastating after effects of this disease. many people who survive their initial encounter with this virus are left with long lasting crippling side effects, brain damage, lung damage, kidney failure, gastrointestinal problems, all leading to ruinous medical bills and medical bankruptcy. if enough people are left with these conditions, there won't be enough people left to effectively support the economy. this short sighted, selfish and destructive ""life goes on"" attitude is just as damaging as the virus itself."

They are dining close together al fresco, sipping iced coffees and lattes sans masks, sitting four to a bench, and crowding onto narrow sidewalks. Anyone who wants to adhere to Dr. Fauci's and Governor Cuomo's exhortations to social distance would be wise just to stay home. It's one thing donning a mask to ensure your own safety and the safety of others; it's clearly another when most everyone else isn't.

Business owners are forcing workers to make a choice between putting their lives at risk, or losing benefits.  People scoff at a ""Second Wave"", but in reality, we haven't gotten to the top of the first one. If we don't get some real leadership from somewhere, this is going to go on for years, as opposed to months, and a lot of good people are going to die.  I'm 64, and still isolating.  Younger people seem to think that not wearing a mask will only take out folks my age.

The facts are that positive tested cases has held steady at around 6-7% and in the 19 county metro area with a population of 6 million the number of daily corona deaths has held steady at 5, unchanged since March...yes, 5 deaths a day in a population of 6 million.
And, the hospitals are not overwhelmed; in fact, IC unit usage is less today than in April."

And yet the anti-Trumpites are dying the same thing with the coronavirus.  The pandemic ended at the end of April. Any increases in hospitalizations today are not necessarily due to Covid. People are being hospitalized because they didn't get basic medical care for 3 months. Now they are sick. Maybe they also have Covid, found incidentally because all hospital admissions are being tested. There isn't a run on the hospitals, we aren't running out of ventilators, and the dead aren't being stacked like cord wood in the streets. ""Cases"" in a vacuum aren't meaningful. The sick and dying are. The majority of those who were going to get sick or die did so by the end of April. Many will become positive. Few will become sick and/or die. And my proof? 3 weeks since the Memorial Day parties and the protests and the sick and dead numbers are steady or decreasing exponentially. We are being sold a bill of goods. (I know, wait 2 more weeks. it's always 2 more weeks.) In any event, according to their timetable the deaths should be kicking in by the end of June at the absolute latest because of all the flouting of social distancing guidelines since Memorial Day. If they don't, will they concede this is all a lot of nothing? (Of course they won't. ) Like Trump said,  ""who you gonna believe, me or lying eyes""?"
2020-06-15 13:37:57,"In refusing to back an extension of pandemic unemployment benefits, the Trump administration displays its own ignorance once again. You cannot turn down work and continue to be eligible for benefits. If your employer offers you work, you cannot say no, unless you are sick with COVID-19, caring for someone with the disease, or are over 65. It is a myth that people are ""choosing"" not to go back to work. For those of us who are self-employed, many of us have yet to see our clients reopen, and we cannot go back to work, because there is little to none available. Entire industries, from sports to theaters to film and television production to conventions and tourism, are still closed or operating at a bare minimum.

Instead, we have 115,000 Americans dead, cases still accelerating, and Trump planning rallies while refusing to even wear a mask.  We are in for a long, tragic year that didn‚Äôt have to happen."

Consider his appointments.  He picks loyalists and rejects those who know enough to do things their own way (which goes hand in hand with fully knowing how to --that is, being an experienced , well-trained expert.)  And two, he has a bloated notion of his own abilities--Did he not say something to the following effects: ""I know as  much as the generals"" and "" I should have been a scientist; I have a natural inclination"" and did he not label himself a ""genius""--"" a stable genius""? 
Actually he is quite ignorant, unread, bored by complex reading, relying on easy Fox viewing for his ideas.   So combine these two characteristics--distrust of those who know and belief in your own infallibility---and you have the disaster of a country with the most per-capita deaths in the free world.  Mr. N. Kristof had an insightful article this Sunday where he pointed out that all the authoritarian leaders such as Bolsonaro  of Brazil  or Johnson of Britain  or Khameini of Iran ( and of course our own Trump)---all authoritarian personalities had the most Covid-19 casualties  (with women leaders having far, far fewer deaths from the virus.)"

When you open things up even in modified form then say ""Oops! Too soon, you have to go back.""  I believe you are going to run into real resistance.  This happened during the Spanish Flu, There were three rounds and eventually people and business refused to be shutdown.

Perhaps we should have a Plan B."

Reporters for the Myrtle Beach Sun News in a non-scientific survey concluded only about 20 percent of people are wearing masks at the beach while the hotels along the strand are jammed. Many of those visitors are from out of state of course and will likely take the virus back home with them. It would be comforting to say that makes it someone else's problem but its not.

Here in NY, the numbers are headed down to zero, despite flouting of the rules not just in the past weeks, but since the start! I am normally in lock step with most of the left's way of thinking, so this is confusing me. I look at the numbers and I don't see what you are all seeing.  I do see non-stop reports of student depression (Edweek, my inbox), unfathomable unemployment, food insecurity, housing insecurity, people becoming ill from other diseases, and just generally a bleak outlook for all. I no longer see Covid as our biggest threat, far from it..but so many of you do? (Yes, I  wear a mask)."
2020-06-15 13:44:53,"Countless people are doing what they please with encouragement from the self proclaimed stable genius, Trump. Thanks to Trump, these people are putting others at risk in spite of the overwhelming virus warnings and lockdowns, ignoring the experts / social distancing and behaving as if covd-19 does not exists. I understand people will do what they want to do anyway but Trump‚Äôs downplaying of the virus and calling it a hoax without a doubt made matters worse. BTW‚Ä¶.should a vaccine be developed prior to the Presidential election, you can bet he will demand to be the first person in the Nation to get inoculated‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.so much for the hoax."
2020-06-15 12:36:05,"There is too much complaining and hand-wringing. The real issue is that people don't want to face uncomfortable truths. The statistics (let's just assume the reporting is reasonably good) are bearing out that for healthy people under 50, that corona virus is not that big of an issue.  For those older and in good health, there is risk that progresses until it goes sharply upward after age 70.  We cannot afford to shutter the economy, society, and the education system until there is a vaccine.  Playing games with K-12 and college with all sorts of attempts at remote education is just going to result in depriving kids of their futures.  It's going to be two-tier society for awhile until there is a vaccine.  High-risk people need to self-isolate for their own protection.  Unfortunately, this may mean not being in the workforce any longer and not being able to move about freely.  We owe it to these folks, however, to ensure their well-being is assured and they are not in total isolation.  As long as there is enough hospital capacity and protective equipment for healthcare providers, let's get on with life.  And - wear masks.  If you can't manage to put on a mask to run in for pizza, put one on for 30 minutes in Home Depot, or for a short subway ride.  You are simply a jerk."
2020-06-15 14:36:19,"Listen up. Like it or not, this is not going to be over until we have a cure and a vaccination. Period. However long that takes.

Scientists are working around the clock all over the world to come up with solutions. Be patient. 

In the meantime the government should be picking up our living expenses to the extent that we can live our lives as we have become accustomed to. 

The government works for us. We pay them. We've been paying them almost all our lives. They are supposed to provide us with services. What I am talking a out are essential services not luxuries. Time for the government to provide US with something, not the other way around. At this point in time we don't care about $210 million dollar F35 aircraft, destroyers, submarines and the like. Just get US though this crisis."
2020-06-15 14:43:35,"Americans are great at blaming others but terrible at accepting any responsibility for themselves.  While we openly flout safer-at-home directives, we complain that the President failed to show leadership, that our state governors and legislatures failed to show leadership, and besides, we're a free country and it's summer out there.

So when the next round of lockdowns is imposed, there will have to be stiff enforcement, which means the police will have the right to arrest us and take us to jail if we can't prove we went out to shop for groceries, medicine, carryout meals, or to go to the doctor.  And there won't be stimulus checks or unemployment-insurance bonuses while we stay home, if Trump and the Senate majority get their way.

If you thought March and April were bad, all that and more is coming, and not just in New York or Texas."
2020-06-15 14:59:21,"It is not surprising that there are now new outbreaks. The lockdowns were designed to flatten the curve, and they did so. They pretty much protected our health care system from being overwhelmed. As important, they‚Äôve allowed medical science to develop some understanding about how to manage severe cases, and it is likely that the fatality rate of Covid19 will be lower going forward than it was in the past.

But the lockdowns do not allow immunity to develop, so there will likely be new cases going forward, as restrictions are lifted. There will be extraordinarily difficult decisions that need to be made, because while the lockdowns help slow the spread, they also do tremendous harm. There have been many accurate reports of widespread global hunger and starvation, and the lack of vaccination for preventable diseases, a result of the collapse of the global economy, the result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions designed to control the virus. The US has outsourced much essential manufacturing to foreign countries, and we are today dependent on a functioning world economy.

Only a vaccine will allow a return to normal. The availability of more testing will help tremendously, especially rapid testing that gives an immediate result, and that is readily available, especially at home.  Some activities such as mass gatherings should be curtailed. But we are going to have to accept some risk; indefinite draconian restrictions are likely to do much more harm than good."
2020-06-15 14:32:24,"Politicians and public health officials squandered any credibility they may have had in the early stages of the pandemic yet the public went along anyway and has done a reasonable job at mitigation. Future lockdowns seem unlikely as the public continues to adapt and figure things out while politicians and and their experts continue to issue warnings, contradictory advisories, and projections that are typically wildly inaccurate. COVID-19 is now just another cause of death among many that we'll have to contend with and do our best to avoid."
2020-06-15 14:51:03,"The fact that Governor Cuomo rants and raves about the danger of gatherings outside bars and restaurants, when every day he praises and supports the daily cheek to jowl George Floyd protests, is the apex of hypocrisy and selective enforcement of social distancing laws. These demonstrations have been massive‚Äî many numbering in the thousands. It is stunning to see Cuomo hyperventilate and threaten restaurant owners with the loss of their liquor licenses, while at the same time saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too early to tell if the protesters will have any effect on spreading COVID-19.  When this second wave hits, and it most certainly will, Cuomo is trying to set the table to blame those comparatively small gatherings outside restaurants rather than the more than two weeks of day and night, tightly-packed protests. The media might play along with this charade, but nobody else is buying it."
2020-06-15 14:52:25,"The death of George Floyd coincided with many areas easing restrictions. The last 2 weeks were a key period for the news media to reinforce the concept that opening up does not equal back to normal. Unfortunately, there was a virtual Covid media blackout, which suggested to many that the threat was over. 

When national case numbers and hospitalizations spike in the next few weeks it will be blamed directly on the protests, but the majority of the blame should be on the national news media, including the New York Times, that could not take their eye off of the new shiny object.  And the irony is that the virus will continue to claim proportionately more lives among Black Americans."

2020-06-15 12:23:58,"The virus remains an active threat to all.  

Low risk infected individuals, primarily the young, can infect highly  vulnerable individuals even if the low risk individuals don‚Äôt have a fever or other symptoms.

So, everyone should be personally responsible:  Wash your hands frequently, wear masks, social distance, understand the hierarchy of risky behavior and consider quarantining yourself from vulnerable individuals.  If you are in the highly vulnerable category, avoid high risk activities, limit moderate risk activities, and enjoy the outdoors.

And do not look at Trump or Pence as good examples of personal responsibility.  And, when Trump announces the next miracle cure, vaccine, or quack medical theory, run the other way.  He has been spewing misinformation and false hopes since January and now more than 115,000 are dead.

Perhaps the coming weekend's DJT rally, and its demands for liability waivers, treating attendees as virus cannon fodder for stoking DJT's ego will reset the nation's awareness and observance of simple rules of hygiene and social distancing."

This claim is and always has been a Republican ruse to deny benefits to needy Americans, to keep taxes low so the rich can avoid giving up more of their wealth.  It likely arose from, and feeds, the lie that certain races are lazy.  In other words, it‚Äôs part of the systemic racism the world is rejecting with mass demonstrations.

The Safeway store in Lynden WA is an a example of this disregard for the community.  This corporate store does nothing to encourage their customers to wear masks. Spending 10 hours a week in this store doing a part time job, I take note of the failure of the chain store and customers ignoring community health practices.
Obvious incentives could be instituted by the chain (for wearers give out coupon $ vouchers, free food, discount at checkout on purchases........) to instill wearing of masks.

You can‚Äôt be a cyclist, picking and choosing when you are a car or a pedestrian when it‚Äôs most convenient for you. 

The riots and protests shows the general masses showed them it‚Äôs fine to congregate again because rioters and protestors were allowed to do it without social repercussions. 

Also New York City cannot handle everyone on its electric grid at once so if also mass blackouts occur everyone will just be out there again because no electricity and NYC summer is brutal with the humidity."
2020-06-15 15:02:49,"New York State and New York City are allowing restaurants and bars to sell alcohol to people on the street, so you have people congregating on sidewalks and in streets carrying open containers of alcohol and consuming alcoholic beverages. If the State/City wants to stop this, they need to make the selling of alcoholic beverages to people on the street for ‚Äútake out‚Äù illegal. Any restaurant or bar found violating the regulation would immediately lose their liquor license. It needs to be done.

1.  Drop ""total cases"" or deemphasize it and highlight new cases per 100,000.
2.  Show metrics indicating mobility relative to a, say, February 1st baseline.  Changing policy does not mean behavioral changes; you need to show boots on the ground actions by individuals, not policy."

In the aggregate, we are a childishly impatient, impulsive people.

We imagine that we are smarter than everyone else, including bone fide experts in a given field.

We have zero attention span, preferring to make snap judgments based on a photo, headline or snippet of video rather than actually researching and understanding a given subject.

We fancy ourselves impervious to harm (often because we are vending-machine Christians, who, having mumbled a few words about Jesus, believe we have received ""salvation"" from a hidden god and there is no further obligation of decency, compassion or humanity placed upon us).

We are wildly self-centered, thinking only in terms of our own personal well-being, and in some ""generous"" cases, that of our immediate families.

We are individualists to the point of idiocy, failing to recognize that some things require a coordinated community response.

We are wishful thinkers and denialists, believing that clicking our ruby-red heels together and squeezing our eyes shut will make the world as we think it should be.

I could go on. I won't. It's too depressing."
2020-06-15 15:02:50,"""Health officials"" opined that somehow although people going back to work to feed their kids was selfish and verboten the protests/riots were just fine (all to scratch their personal ideological itch).  Now that the protests are subsiding they have decided it is time to scare everyone back into isolation to smother the economy and foil that dastardly Trump.  Anyone with a modicum of intelligence is simply not paying attention to what they perceive as propaganda anymore, even if there is some truth to it.  We can chalk this up to three and one half years of the left  swearing (THIS time it's real) that Trump is going to bring this country to its knees.  The boy cried wolf once again, and nobody listened."
2020-06-15 13:09:14,"it's ridiculous and frankly insulting to pin ""flouting the rules"" on NYC's ""bar patrons"" when there are literally thousands of (unmasked, not socially-distant) people participating in protests 24/7 for the past 3 weeks. manhattan bars that are 'open' are fully restricted to operating as takeout windows only, so the limit of people who can possibly congregate at them caps out at maybe 20. 
delaying reopening of these small businesses would be cruel and ineffective at controlling the spread, which is absolutely being accelerated elsewhere."
2020-06-15 13:54:43,"IF and that is a really, really big IF, IF Trump had actually dealt with the virus as it should have been, with the system that had been set up by Obama and others to deal with pandemics, and used our connections to other nations and global health organizations, but instead Trump spent the last two years wiping out, IF trump had spent less time golfing and rallying,  This pandemic would be well on its way to being eradicated and our economy would be on the up swing.  That isn't conjecture.  You are about to walk across the street.  As a child you had been taught to look both ways before crossing.  You don't walk out from behind cars but instead use the cross walks.  You pay attention to the lights and audio warnings as to when to walk. Even still, before just walking off the curb you still take a last glance at what the erratic traffic might be doing. Then you step off.  It is no longer conjecture that I would most likely not be hit by a car.
In Trump's case, HE THREW us all under the oncoming bus. Even Trump's handling of the polices that direct our police forces which gave them free reign along with combat perspective combined with Trump's racist rhetoric... it created the perfect storm... Pandemic meet race riots and protests."
2020-06-15 13:25:15,"Will we see more lockdowns against the Coronavirus pandemic in American cities in the coming months?  Our president is tempting fate and the virus by holding his first KAGA (formerly MAGA) campaign rally in Tulsa, OK, this week. Donald Trump has taught us in the past 4 years that his ignorance knows no bounds. 

Already, cases are spiking in Florida after Gov. DeSantis's too hasty reopening for business here. The pandemic isn't over, and won't be over for the foreseeable future. Our president, who fancies himself an auto-didact epidemiologist  is bulling ahead to grow our American economy during the worst throes of the existential threat of Covid-19."
2020-06-15 14:42:12,"It is not all surprising that there is a resurgence, in fact this is as expected.  The lockdowns and mandatory social distancing flattened the curve, and, by and large protected our health care system from being overwhelmed. But they don‚Äôt allow immunity to develop, so it is not surprising there are continued outbreaks.

One of the biggest factors is likely the recent large gatherings, including the recent protests over racism and the murder of Mr. Floyd. Though the motivation for the protests is understandable, the biology of the corona virus did not change. The virus is highly contagious, and it seems likely the protests spread the disease. Protests are an especially risky activity and entail close physical proximity, the very opposite of social distancing, along with shouting and loud speech of the sort that facilitates the spread of a respiratory virus like conoranvirus.  Contact tracing after a protest is pretty much impossible.

The Times published a series of editorials with titles like ‚ÄúProtest is Patriotic,‚Äù and multiple columns that encouraged participation in mass protests. In normal times this would be entirely appropriate; protest is very much an important and constitutionally protected right. But there are different rules in the midst of a  pandemic, and there was little attention paid  in many of the columns regarding the risks and requirements, such as the need for masks, imposed by the pandemic.

This was, I believe, irresponsible journalism."

They are all crammed together, screaming their chant without a mask on, spewing spittle on anyone near them. Its as plain as day on every TV news segment. They either dont have a mask at all, or have it pulled down below their mouth, yet these protests dont garner one iota of social distancing outrage from the Governor. The outrage was already there before the Phase 1 opening mind you, as the electorate were forbidden to gather for graduations, weddings, funerals, birthdays, or a lousy get together at home, yet protesting was deemed ok.  Do you folks really think social justice is more of a priority to the masses then a graduation, wedding, or saying a final goodbye to a loved one?
People are ticked off, and its going to show come this November. These protests did indeed start a movement, but not the one you think. Its going to be a chance to lash out the Democrats who forced us into seclusion and economically destroyed lives, while giving left wing activists carte blanche to attack the police, riot, burn, and loot."

That is all part of their grand old plan to extort desperate Americans to go back to work and re-elect Donald Trump, even though doing so will put their own lives and the lives of their loved ones at risk.

The statistics show this will create over 2,500 deaths because the protestors violated this central public health rule.  Shame!

Some will say that the protests were necessary.  Tell that that the families of the 2,500 innocent victims of people who could not wait until the PANDEMIC had subsided or, for some strange reason didn't become so incensed a year or two earlier ... there have been plenty of police videos prior to Mr. Floyd's.

Why is America so angry?? 
The right, left, democrats, supremacists, everyone is angry, an unsettling emotion is everywhere. Its the frustration from people realising their lives are getting worse. America historically has signed up for a flawed approach to life. Success, material success at all costs, rat race, work till you drop, no retirement , commoditised health and education. 'Each one for himself' has destroyed the ethos of community, sharing and compassion. Throw in the narcissism of the age and you have a slippery slope.

The real issue is the lack of professionalism and competence in Washington. A more professional administration would have been studying the problem early in and formulating a risk assessment. A hypothetical administration would have pulled together a public health and robust communication plan to the American people. The communication plan would have clearly articulated the known risk, how the disease spreads and why temporary stay at home orders and transit bans were necessary.  Furthermore, a sober and competent administration would have gathered economists and finance experts and worked with Congress ahead of time to put together some economic packages based on a series of best case / worst case scenarios. A really good administration would then follow that up with data driven daily briefs and a clearly identified metrics and targets. 

We don‚Äôt have that. We wanted a ‚Äúdisruptive personality‚Äù and a hat.

Let's leave aside the moral urgency of the issues the protests address, and compare protests vs. the reopening of businesses.

-Protests are outside, shopping is inside.
-Protestors wear masks, almost to a person, shoppers in red states often do not, even going so far as to intimidate and belittle those who do.
-Protests involve several thousand people, reopened businesses involve MILLIONS of people.
-Protests happen and then they are over. Reopened businesses stay open indefinitely.

All of these factors explain why the protests are not in the same order of magnitude, as possible virus vectors, compared to the threat of millions of people heading back into public life while taking few precautions.

Now with Trump's rush to reopen the economy we're facing Act II of the national tragedy while he pretends the deadly virus no longer exists and is insisting on large indoor crowds at a rally in red state Oklahoma where Covd-19 is still increasing and is considered not OK according to the state director of health as well as in Florida where the virus is still raging for his acceptance speech for the nomination.

Maybe some people would get mad, if forced to wear a mask, but maybe some people will get dead if they don't.

We stop for a red light when driving on an empty road, and fully expect and deserve to get a ticket if we don't, even if there was no other car within miles.  How hard could it be to not wear a mask, even if you feel fine?

Trump could have saved thousands of lives if he had acted better, but governors and law enforcement personnel could have saved lives also, and would certainly save lives in the future if they would just enforce the law.   Until they do, they are as culpable as Trump."
2020-06-15 17:24:15,The withdrawal of the emergency approval is the inevitable conclusion of issuing the emergency approval solely for the satisfaction of President Trump's ego in first place.
2020-06-15 16:50:31,"""The F.D.A. withdrew emergency approval for malaria drugs promoted by Trump. ""

In other news, the White House press secretary announced that all of the ""fake"" scientists and doctors at the F.D. A. have been terminated effective immediately. She declined to answer multiple questions about who ordered the firings or the reasons for them saying that this was an internal matter having ""nothing at all to do with the president"" and had been under consideration for several months."
2020-06-15 16:55:32,"I'm a 65 year old senior in N.GA., I always wear a face mask when I'm in public. People need to realize that using a face mask is NOT going to prevent you from getting Covid 19! A face mask will prevent YOU from spreading the virus!  Every person should get tested for this virus.  They say 40% of people are already infected and are asymptomatic, (having no symptoms) which is what happened with me. 
Out of the blue, I saw opportunity for me to be tested and did it thinking I was fine and the test would come back negative. When it came back positive I was shocked! 
Living here in GA most people skip the mask. When I see someone approaching me without a face mask, I walk the other way. I know my mask is not stopping me from getting the virus again. I wear it to stop ME from spreading if I catch it again.     BE CONSIDERATE !"
2020-06-15 17:09:14,It is a bit late and awfully difficult for governors to warn about delayed re-openings while you have the nation's leader wearing no mask and encouraging attendance in a packed arena.
2020-06-15 17:42:50,"This article makes it sound that the peer review process is tainted to favor Trump. It is the complete opposite. The study that was retracted by the leading medical publications was one that had the malaria drugs doing harm to patients. That article was just made up to discredit Trump. We are told to listen to the scientists. Then we find the scientists are biased to a point where they will make up stuff just to damage Trump. 
WHO says if one is in good health, and don‚Äôt have the virus, don‚Äôt wear a mask. And that wearing a mask when one is healthy could actually cause health problems. Then we have the CDC here in the US says you should wear the mask all the time. Okay which scientists do I believe? Given the scientists here in the US have a bias against Trump I am leaning to believing WHO. I believe that if Trump wore the mask all the time. And says everyone should wear one the CDC will say the opposite."

So, the lockdown did not save them, did it? Think that over..."
2020-06-15 17:33:47,"Aside from laughing so hard about this, once again, it just demonstrates just how dangerously incompetent and misguided our commander-in-chief is at any given time. Now the concern is for all the gullible people who took Trump at his word. Another fiasco by the Fiasco King himself."
2020-06-15 19:04:53,"The next thing Americans have to worry about is Trump approving a COVID vaccine that either doesn't work, or worse yet, is not safe and causes side effects.  Trump doesn't care about science just his re-election.  Let's hope he doesn't force the FDA to approve a bad vaccine."
2020-06-15 16:44:45,"Trump is neither a public health expert nor has a formal training in infectious Disease specializing in Virology and what he does for himself is up to him. If you believe that he did take hyrdoxychlorpqine and survived, then please accept my lack of sympathy that it was not your desired outcome. No one has to follow his example and if one does they are foolish and it is their problem not anyone else's. The word touted is so commonly used because it is a catchy phrase. I never heard Trump tell me or any other US resident that the antimalarials work against COVID-19 at a concentration that does not cause adverse effects. Long ago I stopped paying attention to career politicians or so called experts or governors or mayors or attorneys talking on public health issues. 

People coming out to protest are not scared to get out of their forced confinement because they know a simple truth. The simple truth and scientific fact is that fresh air and measured sunshine is ideal for one's health. George Floyd's immortal words ""I cannot breathe"" should be a war cry for those who are forced to shut down businesses and forced to stay at their home or in nursing homes. ""Let my people go"" said Moses. Well my people are those I share the planet who will be empowered to use their common sense and all available knowledge , follow safety guidelines, avail opportunities to work and maintain a healthy lifestyle. So I conclude by saying ""Let my people breathe and get on with life"". Stop the madness."

2020-06-15 19:20:04,"The other day my husband and I went shopping in our town just outside Paris.  We had to wait a couple of minutes to go in the first store because the maximum number of people in the shop had been reached, and then put on our masks to go in - except that my husband had forgotten his mask. He was politely but firmly turned away, went back to the car to get his mask,  returned, came in, sanitized his hands, we made our purchases and left. There was no drama in the incident, just the acceptance that this small irritation was the price we pay to help keep our fellow human beings safe. 

How the simple action of wearing a mask got turned into a statement of ‚Äúgovernment tyranny‚Äù by Trump and his followers is insane."
2020-06-15 17:18:07,"Perhaps you should at least mention in your article the withdrawal (exceedingly rare) of the article in Lancet‚Äîone of the world‚Äôs most respected medical journals‚Äîthat found hydroxychloriquine increased the risk of death in Covid. This article was pure fraud and junk science and basically said the malaria drug was dangerous. These findings were widely reported by the salivating news media when this ‚Äúscience‚Äù came out. Now no mention of the manipulation and extreme lack of scientific integrity. Several European and Asian studies have found value in hydroxychloriquine when used early in the course of Covid 19. These promising results are, of course, too inconsequential to be significant. But a Lancet study with a non-existent data base? Well, that is something to have faith in! Why not just say that US reporting on hydroxychloriquine can‚Äôt be objective because Trump made positive comments about it early on? Why does everything have to be filtered through the lens of Trump? Of course,the fact that the drug has been out for ages makes it way less of a moneymaker than Remdesivir or a vaccine. Hmm. Maybe the drug is just not expensive and profitable enough to be effective."
2020-06-15 18:33:25,"Trump is, was, and always will be toxic and corrosive. There is no arena in which his presence has been anything but a pox.

When Trump untruthfully stated the availability of ""beautiful COVID-19 tests for all who want it,"" with CDC Director Dr. Redfield lacking the courage to dispute the obvious lie at his side, the people of the United States were condemned to die in greater number than necessary. And they did!

When military and para-military forces violently removed peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square at the behest of political appointees for the President's photo-op/show of strength political benefit they knowingly deprived citizens of their 1st Amendment rights. Did the officers in charge of this debacle not know of their violation of the Constitution... or did they not care.
""Following Orders"" was not seen as an adequate defense at Nuremberg.

While it seems that some have the courage to retrospectively admit their error, what is required of both the military and civilian officials is a prospective ethical determination to resist the corrosion and toxicity of this President and his cohort! Anything less is insufficient and an abrogation of responsibility."
2020-06-15 17:22:09,"The alt-truth folks will actually welcome the experts' stance against the two anti-malarial drugs. In their zealous rejection of official recommendations, they'll conjure up a conspiracy scenario that's suppressing the use of these so-called ""miracle treatments"".
Why are some Americans so contrarian? They have studied at least a bit of science and  they understand evidence-based principles; many of them are members of deeply caring communities and they do charitable deeds. 
Lots of these self-proclaimed ""patriots"" even depend on very generous government aid.
In their echo chambers, though, there's little trust in expert advice. Their cynicism leads to all sorts of dangerous practices. No need to list them.
""Citizenship"" isn't about anthems or liberty or pledges. Definitely not about flags or partisan politics. It depends on understanding and accepting one's responsibilities to the greater good."

2020-06-15 20:27:26,"I wonder about the stockpiles of antimalarial drugs that hospitals have that they will never ever use before the expiration date. These drugs should be put back out on the market if possible, or at the very least donated to warm weather countries where malaria is a concern.  What should NOT happen is to just keep it in storage until it expires before discarding. Get it back into the market to depress prices to help consumers, and to prevent the manufacturer and their investors from profiting twice from a drug not used."
2020-06-15 19:38:58,"Projections are that 200,000 Americans will die from Covid-19 by September.

2020-06-15 20:34:27,"I truly hope that the ravages of COVID-19 are left on Donald Trump and his administration‚Äôs doorsteps. From the start they lied to us. From the very beginning. From removing the pandemic program, as well as where all the money went, I‚Äôd like to see a full investigation of every staff member from 1/2017 to today. The corruption of his adult children and Jared, the disgusting, daily hour of lies from Sarah Sanders for nearly three years, people like Miller and Barr hijacking this presidency behind the scenes...the pieces of why we are here now were put into place by these people. And it should cost them their freedom. This administration used the highest office in the land to commit crime and cause more corruption than all former presidents combined. These are people who need to spend the rest of their lives in federal prison, and seize all their assets so they‚Äôre completely destitute the day these women and men arrive with their shaved heads and orange jumpsuits. 

These people will find out sooner than later that there are no more places for them to run and hide. There will be trials over this. These friends and families of the 117,000 dead are likely to amount to a million. And while they‚Äôre grieving now, soon that will turn into rage and anger, and they‚Äôre going to go straight to Trump and say ‚Äòwhy did you allow this to happen‚Äô. Trump/Pence and this administration will have met their match with the families, who are not going away til Trump‚Äôs entire admin is put away."
2020-06-15 20:22:40,"A lot of folks seem to believe they will not die of the virus. Life is a gamble but, placing yourself in a situation that increases the odds against you is poor thinking and it endangers the rest of society. The medical facilities will continue to be stressed and as more people lose their gamble and stumble off to be helped. To link the pandemic and protesting and economic woes is a sure way to self justify your poor decision making and salve your anger, fears, frustrations, uncertainties and doubts. If you dislike minorities, you're really having a tough day. The virus will spread, people will die. Our society will strive for equality until it is achieved even as you trivialize the plight of other citizens. Trump will go away, or choke on a chicken bone and we will move on for the better. If we are lucky and work hard to soften our hearts, open our minds, see the world as it really is, then we will have what an American nation of our wealth should have; equality for all, healthcare for all, jobs for all, and well, I suspect you know the rest. All Americans need to remind themselves that freedom comes with a huge responsibility; to place the common good above all other considerations; especially ideologies, personalities, self interests, and spiritual beliefs. Do that and you can have a life, with liberty and be allowed to pursue you happiness without the expense of another citizen's suffering."
2020-06-15 19:27:11,"USA lockdown should've been at the beginning when the virus was circulating. Closed borders is the only way to stamp out this virus and going through the four stages of lockdowns that New Zealand went though. No pain no gain. Now we have gained our freedom because we followed our governments orders. Our government scared us into submission and had a free phone dob in phone number, so as to report to police people breaking lockdown rules.
USA needs to use their police effectively for handing out fines to people who break the lockdown rules. You have a large police force so get them to enforce lockdown laws. Fear of the law is the only thing that keeps people obeying government laws. Well, that's in my opinion.
We've got less illnesses and crashes on the road since we closed our borders. Life seems to be less stressful as well."
2020-06-15 19:40:37,"Forget another lock-down or anything even remotely similar. 

Americans who are so politically divided wont stand for it. They'd need to  see thousands dying in the streets from C-19 before anything more will happen. 

Arizona hospitals are now at 88% capacity due to C-19, within two weeks they'll be at 100%. We're seeing dramatic increases in new cases coming from Florida, Texas and SC, all states who thumbed their noses at the lock down. What ALL of the experts said would happen is happening...a rapid resurgence in infections and deaths. When the hospitals start turning away the pregnant mom in labor because there are no beds, perhaps we'll then take this seriously."
2020-06-15 20:03:01,"This whole episode was another win for Trump, for at least two reasons:   (1)  It generated chaos in the news cycle, distracting from his other bad actions and lies.  (2) It is just the reason most of his base of 40% voted for him -- to break things and up-end government.  

I wonder how many have compared Trump and his medical musings to Jim Jones telling his followers to drink poison kool-aid."
2020-06-15 20:10:07,"@jim WHO does NOT say that the healthy should not wear masks and they do NOT say that wearing masks causes other health problem.  You are passing along false information.

Regarding non-surgical cloth masks, they expressly say: ‚ÄúA fabric mask can protect others around you.‚Äù  And, they emphasize that the best ways to protect yourself are to practice social distancing and thorough and frequent hand washing."
2020-06-15 19:33:58,"Some of USA laws where people demand their freedom are actually killing other citizens in USA society. USA needs to overhaul it's laws to do with freedom so as to save USA citizens from themselves, if you want to get rid of this virus.
In NZ, someone returning from USA to NZ refused to get tested for the virus and go into isolation, so the police arrested them, then they were put in their place, and agreed to a test for the virus, and guess what! They tested positive for the virus. Humans can be very selfish creatures and don't care about infecting others if their freedom is taken away. That's why you need the police to enforce the laws otherwise the whole process of lockdown will fall apart."

 b) mutations that make it less likely we will be able to timely develop a vaccine;
 c) mutations that increase rate of transmission or likelihood.of serious injury or death.

Efforts by members of the administration are despicable when they seek to tone down the continuing threat of this virus or the danger of close interactivity.

If the republican controlled government had of helped those that needed money the most, the economy wouldn't be as bad as it is. You can't give 85% of the stimulus to a small group of people and expect a great economy. Leaving a mass amount of people to share 15%. It should've been the other way around.

The downward trend in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths that pre-dated the protests has continued, contrary to what Dr. Birx suggested. We may yet learn that outdoor gatherings are low risk, especially when most participants are masked. 

Also be wary of false equivalences to the protests. Yes, in an ideal world we would not have people gathered in the streets. That said, these protests amount to a few hundred or a few thousand people. It‚Äôs not 17,000 people in an indoor arena and it‚Äôs not 5,000,0000 people across a whole state choosing to ignore virus prevention measures day in and day out. The protestors being out there is not a good excuse for everyone else to throw caution to the wind."
2020-06-16 02:32:51,"After spending time social distancing, wearing a mask, washing hands and otherwise taking precautions, some people just ""get tired.""

That is not a good reason to throw caution to the wind, but some people decide ""I have put up with enough.""

Some people just think the whole coronavirus ""thing"" is some kind of ""plot"" to make Donald Trump look bad, and they are not going to be a party to such a ""plot.""  (NOBODY has to try to make him ""look bad"" when he is so good and so experienced at making himself look bad.)

So maybe some of those people who do not have the discipline to take good care of themselves, or think they are impervious, will learn a harsh and painful lesson before they figure out that the coronavirus does not care who you are or what you believe.

You cannot ""be your brother's keeper"" if your brother tells you to mind your own business and let him do as he sees fit.  But you also do not have to be complicit.

ME? My wife and I, both over 70, are doing everything we can to be careful.  We haven't had a chance to visit in person, to hug, or to share a meal with any of our kids or grandkids since early March.  Zoom and facetime work.  Just waiting for the right opportunity in the future."
2020-06-15 19:37:13,A while back I read about some snake salesman selling millions  or billions of dollars of this malaria drug to the USA government with Trumps approval. That snake salesman must be laughing all the way to the bank!
2020-06-15 21:32:58,"Trump no doubt promoted this and the other drug he supposedly used for the virus because he had money in the drug companies involved. 

Anything and everything Trump does and ever did involves his money. His ego, his money , how much he can steal and swindle, how many people and companies he can cheat - that is what this mentally defective, grossly overweight fat scourge on the USA, is all about."

If we don't test, it means no one has Covid. And if we don't measure the temperature it's not really hot. Think how much energy the country could save!

Maybe I'll disconnect my gas gauge in the car too!"
2020-06-16 02:45:54,I hope the CDC is going to gather data on the Tulsa Cluster.   So happy I don't live there.   But think of all the super spreaders from that single cult rally.
2020-06-16 02:50:43,"Pence tells us the only reason we are seeing an increase in cases is due to an increase in testing.  Dr Brix tells us that hospitalizations are flat.  Yet that past two days all I hear on the news is that Arizona ICU hospital bed  availability is nearing capacity and they are going into emergency mode.  Who to believe?  The boots on the ground or the gaslighting Trump administration?  Trump will continue to spin this but when the bodies start to pile up in fly over country perhaps Americans will finally wake up to reality.  This virus has not gone away.

2020-06-16 03:31:00,Any reasonably well informed person knows that increased testing is a contributor to increased cases as well as additional infections. Increased hospitalizations is a far better marker. Pence's comments are not misleading but an attempt to put this marker in context.
2020-06-16 03:48:25,"The House should exert the power of the purse.  Not a dime more for the executive branch or the military until state and local governments receive the subsidies they need to maintain education, law enforcement, and local infrastructure."
2020-06-16 03:22:45,"Trump said, ‚ÄúI can tell you, ah, on Covid or CoronaVirus or whatever you wanna call it...plenty of names ahh,uh, tremendous progress is being made, a lot of cases that other countries who don‚Äôt even test don‚Äôt have; if you don‚Äôt test you don‚Äôt have any cases.  If we stopped testing right now whatever a few cases, if any..‚Äù

The man has either had multiple strokes, or he has never made any sense and this is what every con man or crooked used car salesman spouts when trying to confuse and distract.  Whatever the reason, we, as a country, need to ask who is in control?  Ivanka?  Barron?  Certainly not this man."
2020-06-16 03:49:34,"Increasing testing shows increase in cases initially, but continuous increase with increase in testing over a longer period is just a result of spread of infection.

States like North Dakota and West Virginia have done more testing than Arizona.  To date, the state has not even tested 500,000 people - our population is 7.2 million.  And to top it off, Mr. Trump and his side show is coming to town on the 23rd.

2020-06-16 03:21:44,"I'm getting to where I can't stand it... just because people were out protesting doesn't mean everyone else gets a pass from following public health guidelines! People are acting like ""Well if Becky got to wear a spaghetti strap top to school, I should be able to violate the dress code too."" 

Except.. we're dealing with a virus that doesn't care about ""rules"" and who did or didn't break them.

Why relinquish caring about public health just because some other people may have? Are you lemmings? Perhaps just spiteful. But even with that, there is still the risk that you're bringing upon yourself - both in terms of any single outing, and in terms of raising the overall level of infected people around you, raising the risk of your subsequent outings.

The federal government will not bail out the cities.

So all of those people who want to defund the police will get what they are asking for--better get ready to defend yourself if you live in a large city.  It comes back to the old adage ""careful what you wish for--you just might get it""."

What about the magnitude of the increase in hospitalizations as new cases (that's human beings) rapidly deteriorate? FL, TX, AZ. Does severe respiratory failure result from an increase in testing?
No wonder Dr. Stable Genius wants to do less testing."

The latest gaslighting regarding testing is the epitome of that danger.  This stuff is straight out of Orwell's 1984 where they actually have so much confidence in their angle on power and their allies in the media and among the super wealthy that they know that collective has their backs. It's just unreal. Even a child in grade school could tell this President and now his Vice President that the infection rate is growing no matter how much testing is done. But no, Pence and Trump will be gently called out in they said/they said fashion in what is left in the decimated 4th Estate, meanwhile Trump's dedicated Gaslighting Media Enterprise will catapult these bald faced assaults on human intelligence as so much ""heroin"" directed at keeping his mesmerized base. The base that he actually has so much disdain for. Such disdain that Trump, Pence, and all of the enablers that make up this Administration find it necessary to literally put their lives in danger as well to leverage base power of ignorance and hate. History will not be kind to those who have microphones with a large audience or pens, who choose to report on the game of politics without calling out the incredible dangers to this nation that are at hand. It is truly surreal."

I'd like to laugh, but the fact is they may retain power and control over our nation for another four years as a minimum, which is more than enough time to fully bankrupt our nation both monetarily and morally.

Dangerous, incompetent and corrupt men are leading our nation on a road to ruin and few in their political party are uttering so much as a whimper in protest.

In my day, wearing a mask would be called ‚Äúcommon courtesy.‚Äù  A small gesture intended to keep those around one a bit healthier. 

Akin to covering one‚Äôs mouth during a cough or sneeze. Or washing one‚Äôs hands after using the bathroom. Or not ‚Äúdouble dipping‚Äù in the bean dip, guacamole, or salsa. Or calling in sick, or at least advising those around one that you‚Äôre sick or not feeling well (‚Äúkeep your distance,‚Äù aka: social distancing). Not sharing toiletry items (combs, toothbrushes, handkerchiefs, etc...). And other small acts. Kind. Thoughtful. Polite. 

These were the things my mother taught me as being considerate of others. They cost nothing other than a moment of time, and are easy to do. Why wouldn‚Äôt one take the little bit of effort to try to help others stay healthy? And vice versa. 

Now, common courtesy is out the window. Everything, even the smallest show of regard for our fellow human beings (like wearing a mask to protect others), is a political statement.

They change their advice and story daily.  People are also upset about the riots, protesters and looting that has been going on because of one police killing of one man. Now we have protesters wanting to take over portions of cities and to defund our police forces because people are branding all cops bad people and racist. Defunding police is a local decision and should be voted upon by each local police district. I like our police department in Chappaqua and would not vote to defund it nor do I think anyone else who lives here would vote to defund it. We would likely vote to increase funding considering what is going on around us. We also now have the Atlanta killing to deal with. That seems like a Black man resisted arrest and attack police then was running away with a taser gun he took from police. He should not have been shot. Now the officer will be charged with murder. Maybe BLM should tell their supporters not to resist arrest.

Another issue is the voluntary part of peer review.  It is a professional obligation, but why not compensate for it as well?

2020-06-15 11:45:36,"Good piece which hints at the real problem. Yes, peer review is important but as correctly reported it is fallible to dishonesty if not outright lies. 
The bigger problem in science as a whole is how many papers contain results which can not be reproduced by other scientists.You might want to take a look at that problem as well. 
As is noted in the piece, trust is a fragile thing. At this time with so many people quoting ""science"" on their side, scientists should be more vigilant than ever."
2020-06-15 11:43:00,"No is the answer to the question of whether it is broken. In the present moment, scientific research is attempting to keep up with a very fast moving pandemic, which is not the speed at which it usually works. There will be mistakes - at all levels. The problem is that the media has been discredited (not without justification, but categorically in a way that is quite dangerous), and the public, because this research is of great interest to it, is applying this skepticism to research. Research is never perfect, will always make mistakes - which doesn't mean that peer review is broken. It means that the public's relationship to information, and its ability to discern fact from speculation from propaganda, is. It's okay to be wrong - this happens in science. It's less okay to be stupid, and this is what the media consuming public largely is."
2020-06-15 12:01:44,"On the contrary, the myriad Covid-19 related publications and the retractions show that the scientific process works well. No publication is consider dogma, regardless of the 'prestige' of the journal in which it appears. Peer review isn't supposed to 'safeguard the quality of scientific research.' Peer review is designed to only allow colleagues within a narrow field of study a tiny window into how the experiment was performed and whether the conclusions drawn were reasonable. The passage of time and parallel studies performed globally give a particular study its merit. 
However, a peer review process that is triply-blind may decrease incidences of unconscious bias during the review of a research finding. In this process, the identity of the authors of a manuscript is also kept secret from both the journal editors and the assigned peer reviewers. Currently, it is only the authors who are denied the identity of the peer reviewers. Such a triply-blind process would limit incidences of bias that can occur during the review process. For instance, 'prestigious' journals are more likely to review a manuscript from a highly distinguished scholar or someone from a celebrated research institution. Likewise, peer reviewers can give such studies less scrutiny (or unfair scrutiny if the person is a competitor.) With a triply-blind process, the peer review is done solely on the merits of the study."
2020-06-15 12:05:51,"So scientific journals cannot afford to improve their process because they don‚Äôt pay authors and they don‚Äôt pay reviewers.

They do, however, charge extortionate fees to universities (and therefore to students by way of tuition costs) and they do accept lucrative advertising from large biotech and pharma companies. 

Why do we need scientific publishing at all? It is free to put research on the internet and most universities have their own entire departments that can help with writing, graphic design and web publishing. 

Researchers don‚Äôt need magazines, they just need to publish their work online for public scrutiny with free access. If someone wants to come along and offer a peer review service, or offer to print a coffee table glossy magazine, they should be free to offer that as an additional service. The Lancet and the NEJM are outdated relics, they have no useful role in modern science."
2020-06-15 12:23:40,"The peer review process has always been imperfect because the peer reviewers, while they are experts in their fields, are still human.  They're under a lot of pressure to expedite reviews because COVID-19 is a crisis.  And, as human, they're subject to cognitive biases.

But peer reviews, however imperfect, are far better than no review.  There are dozens of online publications, referred to as ""predatory journals "", who publish papers with little or no review because they want the fees paid by the authors.  If you read a paper in Nature or The Lancet, it's probable legitimate (but no guarantees, even when there isn't a pandemic).  If the paper is published in a predatory journal, it hasn't been seriously reviewed and reading it is a waste of time."
2020-06-15 12:29:42,"Journal editors and reviewers are not responsible for the problems with the data, the analysis and the related interpretation in the publication. However, the coauthors are, and  they have the responsibility to review data and all steps of the analyses. The real problem we have is not with peer review that is an unpaid, time consuming and unrecognized service but with fake authorship. May be 2/3  of the authors in scientific articles have not made real contributions. At least they could make sure the data are real, and the analyses done properly, because they have access to the data. The reporter should call any single author of the two retracted publication and test how many of them had even read the papers. I would be curious to know!"

2020-06-15 12:11:10,"Carla wrote: ""It's okay to be wrong - this happens in science. It's less okay to be stupid, and this is what the media consuming public largely is.""

The first sentence is OK. But the second is wrongheaded: The first persons being stupid, in this case, were obviously the other authors which did not detect the data fraud by their co-author, which others so easily saw, and did no probing as to its validity (which then appears to have been done in collaboration with the Guardian from the UK).

Then, indeed the peer review showed its cracks under pressure, as another set of people without proper knowledge about such data were assigned as reviewers. But this is nothing new: It is generally true, that reviewers in ""normal"" journals don't scrutinize the underlying data, but just the conclusions drawn from it. This is the biggest crack, and it is persistent.

But on the positive side: What happened next was a lightning-fast reaction of actual experts, which happened fully in the open, and led to retraction within days (as opposed to the ""usual"" process of writing a letter to the editors, which might or might not lead to retraction within months or years). 

Scientific journals in general, but particularly so the ""glamour journals"" like The Lancet, NEJM, Nature and Science are well advised to convert to Open Peer Review, which has been pioneered and proven effective by other publishers. Beyond that, there is an urgent need to recognize that data need review as well, whatever it takes."
2020-06-15 12:12:45,"The corruption of science for political and/or financial gain has become a defining characteristic of our age, it is not a new story.

Dr. Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has from the very outset led the campaign against hydroxychloroquine (largely on behalf of Big Pharma) invoking made-up ‚Äúscientific arguments‚Äù against HCQ, saying categorically there was no cure to COVID-19, and the only solution was the vaccine.

What Fauci failed to mention is that Chloroquine had been studied and tested fifteen years ago by the CDC as a drug to be used against coronavirus infections. Chloroquine was used in 2002 and tested against SARS-1 coronavirus in a study under the auspices of the CDC published in 2005 in the peer reviewed Virology Journal. The main conclusion of the article was that:  

""Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread."" It was used in the SARS-1 outbreak in 2002. It had the endorsement of the CDC.

Furthermore that numerous studies from medical experts all across the globe which question various and numerous aspects of the entire ""Covid narrative"" are censored daily shows that the press is also quite compromised and unable to do fair and balanced reporting on Covid.

So dare I say cheating happens, and cronyism is the order of the day. Some journals will only print research if payed by the author, or the university."
2020-06-15 12:27:29,Peer review has two phases. The first is article review by three experts to determine whether the article should be published. The second phase is article review by the hundreds or thousands of readers. Here the second phase picked up the errors. Science is self-correcting.
2020-06-15 12:46:50,"For those of you who are not aware the pnas journal (from the us national Academy of Sciences) includes the names of the editor and all of the reviewers on each manuscript. The journal of fluid mechanics includes information on when the paper was received, revised and accepted. Both of these might need serious consideration at every other journal moving forward towards improving transparency in the peer review process."
2020-06-15 12:47:35,"The journals spoke loudly about the errors and their retractions.  In doing this, they have maintained their credibility."
2020-06-15 13:31:15,"The so-called prestige journal system exemplified by the medical journal Lancelot may be partially at fault. They hide the results of important papers like the two in this article, until publication date. When this system works this gives high status to the journal and paper authors, allowing both to make more money. But when it fails like in this case both fall flat on their faces.

The alternative system of open access preprint servers has percolating in various corners of the academic world the past two decades. The whole community rather than three rushed and hidden reviewers can examine and comment on flaws in the preprint before it is elevated to the next step of formal publication. The open reviewers of preprint services themselves can be reviewed.

Presentation in oral form at an academic conference before publication serves a similar function of early vetting. But in this fast-paced world of scientific results, especially when they could be life-saving, often cant wait for for a conference."
2020-06-15 13:31:18,"A study from a few years ago claimed that 67% of all studies published in peer review journals could not be reproduced with the same results.

To be fair, this is not so different from what one might expect from the scientific method. No sooner is a new discovery offered, then it's critiqued, altered, advanced or even repudiated.

While the public thinks of science as mathematical certainty, in reality science is a constantly moving target.

This does not mean that there aren't certainties. But too often scientists have failed to translate the many variables that they are comfortable with into language that lay persons can understand.

There have been many products and medical procedures that have been approved by scientists, only to be withdrawn from the market because they cause harm and even death.

And herein is the real problem. Scientists often offer a range of predictability that product manufacturers negligently or willfully ignore. This is especially true where billions might be made before the harm is discovered.

But to avoid this, journals and their editors should follow he advice of Science for the People. This is an organization of social conscious scientists who argue for greater openness and public debate, especially about the ethics of science.  

This is hard to accomplish in this age of patents and secret investors. But we would all be better off by following their advice. And this is critical as we debate the efficacy of the coming corona vaccine."
2020-06-15 13:14:07,"The New England Journal has let its political inclinations seep into its editorial policy as well, and it diminishes the JournalÔøºÔøºÔøº."
2020-06-15 13:02:20,"Over the years, both the Lancet and NEJM have become more political and more ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù in their editorial policies.  What is going unsaid is that this rush to publish, which was indeed out of the norm, was an opportunity for both journals to embarrass Trump, as well as an opportunity to improve their impact scores and hence, their advertising rates.  The Times might have taken a look at these angles, which to many subscribers of both journals, is quite apparent."
2020-06-15 13:02:07,"Why describe everything simply as broken.  The peer review process works well thousands of times a month . Reviewers often suggest improvements for the manuscript. Research from beginning to end assumes honesty. Very, very rarely something goes wrong. If not before this will be picked up along the way as others try to repeat the work. The editors presumably must explain the embarrassing predicament. Doing reviews is considered a professional obligation and is recognized in non monetary ways. I have reviewed 6 papers this year.
The research output on Covid-19 is phenomenally, over 16000 publications. Obviously an acceleration.  On the one hand everyone would applaud the medical, scientific community rapid, energetic response.   But test kits, for example, are coming  to market without the usual review.

2020-06-15 12:39:08,"I am a medical journal editor myself, and would add a few comments. These two papers were massive, massive errors for journals with the reputations and  resources of the Lancet/NEJM. Beyond  just COVID; it reflects the commercialization of even the most respected journals, the ethical failures of medical schools as big businesses, and basic ambition/greed on an individual and institutional level. COVID has caused an enormous strain on ALL journals within relevant subject areas (infectious disease, virology, vaccines, epidemiology, critical care/pulmonary medicine. Emergency medicine) for several reasons. The unprecedented nature, spread, mortality, medical biological ignorance, politics, etc. And quite frankly, many faculty have been locked down at home for months, with plenty fo time to massage data sets and engage in mischievous, however well intentioned, submissions. This ESPECIALLY true with manuscripts with authors who dont hail from N America or the EU. And lets be blunt, academic fraud is widespread in China - the government pay researchers a bonus for publications, esp in western journals. (This is perhaps not politically correct, though its hard to tell at times , but it is, as any medical editor will confirm in private, the blunt truth.) Final point - Harvard Med obviously has more than enough information  to launch an investigation into the first author that is on its faculty, but dont hold your breathe."
2020-06-15 13:38:50,Let‚Äôs not confuse the dancers (NEJM and Lancet) with the dance (the peer review process). There is absolutely nothing wrong with the dance. Two dancers simply blundered.
2020-06-15 13:50:07,"Although no doubt shocking to most people, medical journal retractions of tainted research are neither surprising nor novel.  Factors that are responsible include: public pressure to provide definitive answers and provide them now; researchers' desire, both for noble purposes and self-aggrandizement, to provide those answers; the inherent difficulties of doing good research; honest errors made by researchers; fraud in research; the lack of the appropriate expertise of many reviewers; and the inability of some reviewers, and the the vast majority of physicians who rely on research, to understand complicated statistical analysis.  In 1988, a former editor of the British Medical Journal said, ""only 5% of published papers reached minimum standards of scientific soundness and clinical relevance...""
Do these retractions mean the system is broken or that it is working?  Either way, it is safe to say that it can be hard to know what we really know, study results need to be viewed with caution and not treated as gospel, and recommendations need to be made judiciously.
(Incidentally, I write about this in my book, Eat the Eight, Preventing Food Allergy with Food and the Imperfect Art of Medicine, in the course of exploring the transition from the expert advice that infants should not be fed allergenic foods in 2000, to the retraction of that advice in 2008, and finally, in the last five years, the advice that infants ought to be fed the allergenic foods.)"
2020-06-15 13:52:05,"A tragic and dangerous consequence of the pandemic is the mixing of science and politics. In the UK the government likes to declare it is following the scientific and medical advice, most coming from a secretive but eminent grouping of experts known as SAGE. While at points government needs to make some decisions for political and economic reasons, generally, except in the USA (where Trump knows everything), most countries follow the advice more or less. Problem is Covid 19 is new and there was little known about it at the start and even now there are huge gaps. Different scientist and  their ""models"" sometimes had different conclusions, Even SAGE, while seemingly speaking with one voice and presented as such had its divisions. Science is a learning process, particularly when it comes to Covid19. In short, scientists and politicians have to take a view. Science is at its best when it keeps to the science and politicians should not try to hide behind the science when making tough decisions that could go either way.  Then there is Dr. Richard Horton of the Lancet.  He seems to be more driven by politics than science. In late January early Feb he was on Twitter backing Chinese propaganda that Covid 19 was relatively benign and not to be worried about.  Since then he has in a number of blasts tried to whitewash his earlier stand and make blatantly political statements. That has set the tone for the retractions and loss of credibility for The Lancet as independent journal."
2020-06-15 13:55:29,"I disagree - we are being asked to do critical appraisal on very early data- sharing globally anything is better than nothing -

This is medicine evolving at hyper speed!"
2020-06-15 14:01:35,"The peer-review process, and choices by scientific journal editors, may not work perfectly, but over months, and certainly over decades, the results provide amazingly good quality objective information.

How about peer-review for daily media?"
2020-06-15 14:02:35,"This is an incredible failure on the part of the editors. The only way this would have gotten past reviewers is if they knew absolutely nothing about available clinical databases or what those data collections typically look like. Anyone with any experience would have seen reference to 'Surgisphere' and said 'What's that?!' Especially since the articles were entirely based on this obscure data source. 

Analyzing big clinical data sets is not a niche activity - retrospective studies and meta-analyses are published all the time, and they are often the very kinds of  studies picked up by the popular press. It is simply not conceivable that the editors of major journals - especially in medicine - would not have lists of competent reviewers in this area immediately at hand. 

Seriously - is this just because Trump learned how to pronounce 'hydroxychloroquine', and then wouldn't stop saying it?"
2020-06-15 14:10:03,"The media has always worshiped at the altar of 'peer reviewed', as if it was some sort of guarantee of objectivity and accuracy.  But, ask any academic about how peer review really works.  It is as much a 'political' process, as it is a scientific one.  Who you know, whose side you are on in a particular issue, and what your academic aspirations are, have always been a pervasive part of the process."
2020-06-15 14:13:56,"If distrust of these journals means ALL journals are at risk, consequences would be even more than tragic -- not to mention dangerous to science in general.  
However, it must be mentioned that NEJM, despite its long and august history, does seem to have a not-completely-superior reputation among those actually in medical research.  Many feel there historically has been a sensationalistic tendency to rush ""breaking news"" of especially popular interest into publication. and thereby to become the journal that the general media most often report from (including the NYTimes).  On occasion, even when something problematic appears and is questions, the resulting controversy and even retraction has just made more news.
Covid-19's rapid appearance and spread, along with the huge complexity of both the virus itself and the course of the illness, has meant a lot of not-well-proven or even well understood material gets sent to many medical journals.  The review process has increasingly overwhelmed all journal editors, and those in a hurry to be first and foremost -- esp. in the public eye -- are in danger of jumping the gun and missing important flaws in an article.  
In an era of increasingly limited funding (esp. in the USA) for both pure science and thorough translational or applied science, errors that undermine the credibility of medical reporting are especially dangerous."
2020-06-15 14:19:35,"As can be anticipated in a for-profit health care system, (and is borne out by a number of the responses printed here), profit, politics and science are inevitably in conflict."
2020-06-15 15:21:48,"As a lay I had immediately doubts about The Lancet study. There were two gaping holes:
 - I hadn't heard of even one hospital claiming the kind of damage that the study reported. The Lancet should have insisted on contact with at least one hospital that could confirm the data. Privacy claims were obviously bogus: many hospitals aren't afraid to tell about their experiences in general.
 - hospitals are bound to have different protocols. Some give a higher dosage. Some give it earlier. Etc. The variations discussed - such as HCQ with or without azithromycin - suggested that the distinctions in the study were driven by the discussion about HCQ - not by actual differences in hospitals.

It is a pity that I can't find any indication in the article that The Lancet is aware that the article missed such common sense benchmarks."
2020-06-15 15:22:20,"Glad that the article at least mentioned the possibility that ""politicization"" may have played a role in the rush to publish the flawed papers.  In the past few years, both The Lancet and N.E.J.M. have lurched towards an increasingly political agenda.  It is not surprising that this change in direction eventually caught up with them."
2020-06-15 15:28:45,"The author didn't mention that responsibility lies with larger authorities than these journals. The AMA  and AHA both share the blame for enabling a nation that is more than 50% obese and pre-diabetic, thanks to its support for Big Food and Big Pharma, as prescribed by their 35-year Food Guide fallacies. 

Disease prevention by avoiding dangerous factory fats and highly processed carbohydrates just isn't a medical oversight and direction priority. All the relevant science is now best reviewed on YouTube, as the new LCHF formulation toward healthful eating of real food, and not in journals whose research is too often funded by industry.

Perhaps it is time to defund the journals intellectually. They have patently failed by any standard and it may be wiser to embrace the online review process that anyone with some skin and bone in the game can monitor."
2020-06-15 15:29:35,"I fear that almost all scientific fields have become dominated by a single discipline - Political Science.  It is easy to find empirical evidence for this.  Turn on Fox and you will get one interpretation of the data and turn on CNN you will get the exact opposite, correlated directly with which side of the political spectrum that is impacted.  The R^2 is close to 1 and seems to apply across all media outlets.  It is evident in most if not all scientific disciplines be it epidemiology, climatology, sociology, clearly diet and nutrition, of course, economics, even mathematics (viz. polling).  

Why should the scientific press be immune from the same influences?  Peer review has never had the credibility that it implies. Those who understand the process know that. Reviews focus on methodology, not results, and most reviews are done by the author's buddies.

It is unfortunate that political bias has invaded almost all aspects of our science and society, but that virus has always been around.  We are just going through a particularly bad wave and no one is working on a vaccine."
2020-06-15 15:37:16,"No single study,  no single published article, can tell the whole story.  Each is a slice of a bigger picture, which is why literature reviews, meta-analyses, and replications of studies are so important.  These take time.  The bottom line is that in the rush to understand and publish about the coronavirus, the journals made mistakes and admitted them. Unfortunately, the general public has a poor understanding of the scientific process, and the media that report on these studies need to do a better job of vetting and explaining them."
2020-06-15 15:39:10,"First of all, the Chief-Editors and the Editorial Members of both these prestigious Journals cannot ease their responsibility and the accountability regarding these two fraudulent and fabricated papers published in this unprecedented time. They should have performed better role to safeguard the journal‚Äôs reputation than the Author‚Äôs ambition. 
I am fully agreed with many commentators here and really tired of seeing the retracted papers in so many high profile journals including NEJM, The Lancet, Nature, and Science over the years.

In my opinion, this is because there is no strong measures from journal‚Äôs or publisher‚Äôs side to punish these fraudulent and greedy authors.
I would recommend that these authors should be banned for their lifetime to publish any articles in these Journals in future. At the same time the funding agencies or sponsors should ban these authors and research team for any future research. 
The point I want to make: It is almost impossible for the Journals, Editors and Reviewers to stop these greedy people for their wrong doing until they are stopped at the grassroots level.

These greedy people always ignore the Ethics in Science and try to be smarter. The common sense is if a medical doctor made a mistake in clinical care room, it impacts one patient, if a scientific researcher made a mistake and deliberately falsified research data that impacts millions of innocent people and mislead countless researcher all across the globe."
2020-06-15 15:39:47,"Data is the alphabet of science and without good and reliable data science cannot advance.  But when it comes to COVID, data is quite often unhelpful and sometimes outright contradictory.  A case in point is the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of this disease.  First there was evidence supporting its use, then there was evidence that it didn‚Äôt help much.  Then came two controversial papers that reported worse outcomes in patients who were given this medication.  Published by two of the most prestigious medical journals, they seemed to carry the day.  But then they were both withdrawn because of faulty data.  I am not going to bet what the editors of both of these journals felt when they had to retract these papers, given how finicky they tend to be about accepting anything to publish.  However in the understandable urge to do something, scientists needed the platform and the journals were racing to be at the forefront.  This is all the more surprising given that very short lag time between submissions of the manuscripts and their publication.  It appears that simply having the term COVID in the title of a manuscript guarantees acceptance.  Junk science is junk even if it appears on the pages of the world‚Äôs top journals.  And while the need to proceed at breakneck speed as we race against a timetable set by the virus, rigorous reviews remain the cornerstone of good publications, something that the editors of these journals should never lose sight of."
2020-06-15 15:40:34,Politics and science will remain at odds as long as Trump remains President. Both the left and the right have their faults.
2020-06-15 15:41:46,"I am a psychologist. In psychology journal articles, the subject set of a study must be described. Also almost all studies are experimental, i.e. they involve the controlled manipulation of a treatment compared against those who did not get the treatment. These studies would never have been publishable in my field."
2020-06-15 15:52:03,"It must be recognized that so called ""Evidence Based Medicine"" is nearly meaningless when so much of the ""evidence""  is funded by Big Money with skin in the game, to make more money. It is beyond doubt now that financial interest rule outcomes, and even in less tainted studies, reproducibility is very challenging, often can't be done.  This is a huge challenge for those practicing clinicians who care about doing the best for patients, rather than toeing the party line to boost their own paychecks, which sadly happens also."
2020-06-15 16:15:20,"To answer the question posed by the headline, yes, the peer review process is broken. In fact, not only is the peer review process broken, the project of research and scholarship in the academy itself is broken. ""Publish or perish"" has never been more true. I have seen some insane pre-prints, and indeed published articles around covid-19 and prior to it that are basically works of fiction. For example, the article by researchers at Indian Institutes of Technology 's Kusuma School that claimed HIV had somehow been spliced into Covid-19 was completely wrong, essentially all false. It was withdrawn, but before then it spread like wildfire on Twitter where it was retweeted/liked tens of thousands of times.

This is a huge disgrace to academic medicine/science. Researchers are publishing low-quality, low-power studies based on dubious (or in the case of Surgisphere, basically fabricated) data. The incentive at academic institutions is to publish, publish, publish and bring in the grant money. Most of the research is done by post-docs who are being abused by the system and have poor job prospects.  Very few ""no significance"" studies are published because everyone wants an attractive result and wants to get tenure, so scientists just do the same studies over and over. Statistical and analytical methodology is often hugely suspect. Academic research needs a serious examination and overhaul, or it will continue to lose credibility."
2020-06-15 16:22:11,Is the Process broken ? Like pretty much everything else nowadays it becomes politicized monetized and therefore the credibility is destroyed.
2020-06-15 16:30:44,"Unfortunately,  the medical journals in question appear be believe that  their political opinions are as important as their medical studies, and are letting the two mix.  It seems hard for some to understand that others may not be interested in their politics, no matter how smart they think they are."
2020-06-15 17:33:26,"It is not possible to do peer review in such a short time.  It is almost impossible to do peer review without access to underlying data.  At the same time, developing new knowledge on the fly in the middle of a pandemic calls for a different standard.  Perhaps a new category for reporting of provisional findings would help inform thinking without offering any pretense of conclusiveness."
2020-06-15 17:58:44,"‚ÄúAt the same time, you want quality control.‚Äù

Its been fifty years since I was a college student majoring in Science Curriculums. Vaguely I remember discussions on statistical probabilities as opposed tolerance assessments. Statistics refer to population samples or smaller groups of persons  using questionnaires, polls, observations etc. predictive of a general pop. Tolerance assessments are exact measurements of a physical material‚Äôs properties I.e strength, flexibility etc. (think airplane bolts & fatigue).

The former sample result may be ‚Äògiven‚Äô a confidence level of   70% to 95% as to its validity among the general pop.. Physical material like bolts have a confidence level of 98%. Medicine like an airplane bolt is critical to human safety. That researcher who failed or provided bogus info should be punished!"
2020-06-15 18:16:50,"In medicine, information that stood as truth for years or decades, is suddenly wrong. This stands true even stronger in these times when the whole world wants to find cures and treatments for COVID-19.
My trust stands with perpetual trial and error, until a better truth is found. Authors and journals are sometimes mistaken, but if they make corrections about what they've published, it's the best practice.
We err, we correct, we move on. And keep on."
2020-06-15 18:35:55,How about the study out of Northwell that cited a death rate of 88% for intubated Covid-19 patients? Turned out they didn't count all their applicable patients in the denominator or wait until outcomes were established. I can guarantee that this contributed to people's fears about seeking treatment at a hospital. Still shaking my head...
2020-06-15 19:07:34,"Nothing is perfect, and the peer review system has been stumbling since inception! We can just see its failings in more spectacular fashion. Pay reviewers and make people pay for submission. Don't rush the process."
2020-06-15 19:10:04,"There's always pressure to ""publish or perish"" on scholars.  Here, whoever gets their snake oil to market first gets to be a millionaire and out of the lab. And publishers, over the last 10 years, have gotten poorer and poorer in their requirements. A large percentage of published experimental claims have turned out to be non-reproducible. Imagine not being able to reproduce Galileo's 32 ft/second squared acceleration of gravity at STP and sea level.  like everything else around us, science has deteriorated, concurrently with education."
2020-06-15 19:11:42,"As pointed out, there is a difference from making a mistake in data analysis or reporting, reporting data from a flawed study, and reporting known false data; only the latter is scientific fraud.  There is also a difference between a statistically significant finding and one that is clinically significant. While clinician/scientists understand these differences, there are stresses placed on investigators to be first in reporting new findings, and stresses on journals to be the first to publish these findings.  As the old adage foes: ""Haste makes waste"". As someone who has been active in medical investigation for over 30yrs, and participates in the peer-review process, these differences are well known to me. As in politics, transparency in medical research and publishing serves to protect the public.  The complexity of analysis of large data sets and in newer statistical methods makes it difficult to identify all issues with a report during the typically 2 week deadline given to reviewers, an interval that has become compressed with the need/desire to report Covid-19 related data in a timely fashion. I laud both the NEJM and Lancet in their prompt retractions of the reports once the flaws became apparent as this serves the interests of both the medical and general communities."
2020-06-15 19:28:03,"As an academic, I‚Äôve always felt that biological science papers should be required to be reproduced independently prior to publication. If a result cannot be reproduced, it is not sound science! If everyone in academia was forced to spend part of their time (stipulated by grants) reproducing the work of others, and this were a requirement for publication, science would be much better. In lockstep, there should be a limit to the number of papers one can submit per year. This would make the focus on quality and not quantity."
2020-06-15 19:53:32,"As someone who as written, edited, and reviewed manuscripts on health research, I have to question this statement:

""But editors and reviewers do know who the study authors are, critics note, and that may bias them toward a positive review even when data are suspect.""

In my experience. all Mss. are carefully blinded during peer review -- a reviewer does not know the names or institutions of the authors, for the reason stated above: it might bias the review. (Of course, sometimes it's possible to make an informed guess.)

Another assertion deserves comment: the notion that journals ""generally do not disclose who reviewed a study, what they found, how long it took or even when a manuscript was submitted."" It's true that reviewers' names and reports are confidential, but the dates of submissions, revisions, and acceptance or rejection are all recorded, and at least in some journals are presented along with the published article. This is certainly true in astronomy journals, if not at The Lancet."
2020-06-15 20:42:12,"I attended a lecture circa 2012 by a PhD candidate in medical informatics at Oregon Health Sciences University.  They said they went into the field after seeing the lack of accuracy and incompleteness in medical records that were suitable to be used for research purposes and wanted to try to improve on that.  Their disappointed conclusion after being in the field was that even with the new hope for electronic medical records to be used in research was that only about 1.5% of electronic records had complete enough data to be used for research purposes.  Medical workers in hospitals have too many other things to do than get histories (actually discouraged due to time / money constraints) and accurately record the data (EMR is increasingly considered an actual drag on patient care and physician time).  

The ""completeness"" of the data in the one study from so many different sources should have been the red flag."

When the presidents and sociopaths Donald Trump(United States) and Jair Bolsonaro ( Brazil)  pushed, the fake news that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine were a medicine for coronavirus, tens of thousands of persons died, from the toxic effects of these toxic substances. Even more, tens of thousands of persons died of coronavirus, because they thought that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine would cure them and they didn't need  social distance.
Between IV and XIX centuries, between 20,000 and 40, 000 persons died from the Catholic Inquisition. This is less than the half of the number of persons that died because they took chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, in the first semester of 2020. Without the bad advice of Donal Trump and Jair Bolsonaro this number of persons killed, because they took chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine would be far and very less elevated than this number.

The Lancet probably cost lives in its partisan picking of sides in the hydroxychloroquine debate.

At the Nature site, you can find:  
1) A preprint of their paper,
2) The supplementary information for the paper, and,
3) The reviewers' notes and author's rebuttals.

So please go have a look, and then you might understand more about the peer review process.  There are way too many people commenting here calling down fire and brimstone against the authors, reviewers, and editors of these two journals in righteous indignation without any first hand knowledge about peer-review or journal articles.

So go knock yourself out, read the article as it looked before it was translated into Big Press-ese, and see what kind of dialog goes on between reviewers and authors before something is published.

And then if you want to blame big capitalism, big Pharma, big gummint, big medical, or even the smoke-like demons of the Bardo Thodol, go right ahead.

2020-06-15 19:09:22,"As a physician involved in scientific publication and as a regular reviewer of some medical journals, I feel like I am about to hide my face in the sands!
The retractions of the  published papers is a whole new thing that I am seeing  for the first time in  decades of my professional career. I am shocked that the journals like  the Lancet and NEJM that are like the Bible to many of us have published the retracted manuscripts. The consequence of the retractions have been of biblical proportion in that the WHO also retracted their  previous comments  about the danger of treating COVID-19 illness with this anti malarial agent. It also seems to me pathetic that a dose of anti Trump politics have also influenced the publication of the data!
In the end, I would not lose my faith at all on these 2 high quality medical journals without which I wouldn't be be able to remain true to my profession. However, I would like to request the editors to employ some kind of AI to scrutinize the big data ( as in this case) before even sending to the reviewers. As a voluntary reviewer, I know pretty well that we just do not have  enough time to  scrutinize the data, particularly if that involves big data. Maybe it is time that we reevaluate the whole science and publication cultural that is in praxis today to eliminate fraudulent publications. Another issue is the UN enforced GDPR  that would never allow the raw data to be scrutinized by any third party, unless there is any sub clause in the GDPR"

My takeaway is that given a need for speed, the gatekeepers rely on the ethos of the researchers and owners of ""small companies"" which perform the studies. By ethos I mean the the expertise and the reputation for excellence of the placeholders who vouch for the ""small companies"" that commit the fraud. 

The two journals staked their reputations and the lives of many on the ethos of Dr. Mehra, a high-status placeholder at Harvard and the Brigham Women's Hospital. He took the lead on both fraudulent studies. 

He refuses to acknowledge that his studies are fraudulent. His silence undercuts his ethos as trusted placeholder even further than the fraudulent studies for which he refuses to take responsibility. Nor does it speak well for Harvard or for Brigham, that they keep him on the payroll as a trusted ""face"" or placeholder, part of their boilerplate, a voice of the institution... when it's obvious he isn't worth the paper his resume is printed on. 

Dear reporter, stay on the story; chase the money. What is Mehra's connection to Surgisphere? What is his connection to Dr. Sapan Desai; and who is he, anyway, that Mehra would risk everything for him? What was in it for Mehra? What's in it for Harvard; I suspect their greed has undercut their research mission. If so, this wouldn't be the first time, or the last."

2020-06-15 21:43:00,"This is medicine. Its not physics. But lots of papers in both do have one thing in common: statistics. Physicists tend to be 10,000 times pickier than doctors about the probability of being right.  That's if they are measuring one thing.

There is an article in today's NYT online ([iblished June 10)
about coronavirus and blood type. I actually read it. The researchers looked at 23andme genotype data for a bunch of people and found two ""associations"" that they called statistically meaningful. But that were not the using the physicists criterion. That's bad.

Its worse. 23andme measures 600,000 things and presumably they looked at most, probably in clumps of 100 or so. That's 6000 things (recombination regions). Physicists know that if you do that, you need not 10,000 times better results, but 60 million times better results, probability-wise. That's actually doable, and has often been done for many things (including, for example, proving that DNA (in part) determines height or intelligence). 

This is all well-known. But the medical people have not decided to be picky enough. 

This is far worse than saying that ""its about money""."
2020-06-15 21:54:31,"I've been a peer reviewer for many years and am amazed at just how well the process has stood the test of time. I'm amazed we've not seen more forced retractions. That we've seen such a tsunami in these stressed times is testimony, one has to conclude, both to the general integrity of the authors as well as to that of the reviewers. And the latters' sheer doggedness, as well. In this case, we're looking at two journals but only one dataset, a single point of failure, which slipped through the cracks of the system in a truly anomalous way. True, Surgisphere's collaborators should have seen some red flags go up--but honest, this is not a generalized indictment. I'll conclude by saying I'm humbled and amazed when, after reviewing these articles, I see the quality and attention paid by my fellow reviewers. For the United States in particular, its top journals--I include in this JAMA, the Annals of Internal Medicine and NEJM, and quite a few others--are real treasures of American medicine's academic prowess."
2020-06-15 22:31:46,"As stated in the article, all authors submitting manuscripts to reputable medical journals are required to sign a statement attesting that they have access to all the data.  It seems like the authors of the retracted articles, including the Harvard professor, did not read what they signed too carefully.  A Pubmed search of Dr. Mehra's publications shows that while he is an expert in many areas of cardiovascular medicine, he has limited experience in the utilization and analysis of ""real world data"" from electronic medical records.  His work with large databases are primarily from transplantation registry, which are usually put together painstakingly and not in a rapid manner as with clinical data during a pandemic.  Despite his desire to help, I think his ego got the better of him.  Besides, who wouldn't want another couple of publications in prestigious journals.  Of course, in the chummy world of academic medicine, there will be no investigation or consequences, despite the harm these articles have done to science and medicine, and his mistake will be chalked up to naivete rather than sloppiness or lack of expertise."
2020-06-15 22:41:28,This is a good example of why there should be mandatory double blind peer review.  The reviewers likely looked at the credentials and chose to trust rather than verify.

Two different offices in the same medical practice will ask you different questions and have different recording methods and have different sets of medical history data on you for Pete's sake.

Do I think it's some deep dark conspiracy by drug companies or the government or anyone else?  No, I think the writers were trying to make money and be important and the reviewers were a rubber stamp out of a desire to have something to work with in a hurry.  If you're scrambling you don't stop to think if something is too good to be true.  That is pretty much how fraud of any kind happens."
2020-06-16 01:19:08,"Retractions are integral to self-correcting process of science. The disproportionate criticism and attention received by this particular retraction is merely a result of the time (Pandemic) we live in. These self-correcting moments teach us how we can make the scientific process better, just like they have in the past. The fact that scientists themselves - not the public, journalists, or politicians - have flagged the study down (similar to any previous instance) speaks to the longer-term integrity of the scientific process. That very nature of self-correction is all the more reason why science is a trustworthy process fundamental to long-term human existence. Science is open to correction."
2020-06-16 01:31:57,"Peer review is not and never has been assurance of the accuracy of a scientific  publication.  It can often screen out false conclusions but not false data.  The literature includes a small fraction of fake papers which, when discovered, create a fuss with scientists and can damage reputations.  But in normal times the public is blissfully unaware, and significant errors, intentional or not, are eventually weeded out.   Editors are faced with the task of sorting out the bad science without also rejecting  critical papers that  may overturn prior beliefs; and even highly respected scientists are sometimes fooled by their coworkers or collaborators.  The current problem is not a breakdown of a system which was designed to prioritize rigor over time.  To cast blame on the editors, reviewers, or a professor who was fooled is wrong.  The fault, which in my mind is criminal, lies squarely with the company that sponsored the  research."
2020-06-16 05:12:43,"The medical peer review system IS broken. When I review a paper, I get to see what the other reviewers submit, and I'm all-too-often appalled at the superficial, incomplete nature of the reviews - even for top-line medical journals. And it is no surprise: it takes time and work to properly critique a paper. Furthermore, there are 10's of thousands of medical 
journals publishing over a million papers a year: its just not possible to assure the quality of this torrent of papers, even there were enough peer reviewers available for the task. Finally, even if this medical torrent of papers WAS mostly of good quality, there is no way for any human (or, currently, any AI system) to assimilate all the information in these millions of papers, regardless of the medical discipline. A large portion of the work ends up overwhelmed and ignored in that torrent, with the end users oblivious to the work, like an art exhibit that nobody sees. Medical papers certainly often generate important findings, but with all the resources funneled into the enterprise, that's a pretty low bar for assessment: in general, the process is inefficient, wasteful, and, all-to-often, misleading or wrong, even in the absence of blatant fraud."

My co-author suggested that I notify the person responsible for the media at the UNC-Charlotte who then contacted the above and within 48 hours all three now ran the story.  It soon became clear that with a well connected agent, PR department, that some  prestigious journals will give more attention to these media specialists than  to academics who take the time and effort to do the research."

Private Schools, especially those here in Cleveland (I‚Äôm looking at you Hawken and University School) get enormous local and state support, charge up to $35k per year tuition, pay teachers far below average salary (not to mention these teachers often have less than the required state certification necessary), no access to unions w/o fear of termination, and no state-test requirements.

In California, schools whether they are charter or public receive a fixed amount of money per pupil from the state.  While this amount is usually tied to attendance, no cuts were made in the distribution after the forced closures due to the Covid-19 virus.  So charter schools received every penny they were entitled to from the state.  To claim that they cannot meet their on-going expenses would have to mean that they mismanaged their budgets since they now claim to have a deficit.  As all schools will face substantial budget cuts during the coming year, any funds that these schools received from a program designed to assist private businesses, should be subtracted from the amount of state aid they receive during the coming year."

The end result is weakened education all around.

Does anyone wonder why wealthy GOPers want charter schools? What do they have to gain by throwing a business model on a school? They gain a poorly educated populace and a race to the bottom.

2020-06-15 18:50:27,"I think there's a lot of nuance missing from this analysis. While the big charter CMOs are the most visible (KIPP, Uncommon, Success, etc.) the majority of charter schools are small and independently run. The political climate around charter schools in NYC is unique; in most American cities charter schools are responsible for paying rent, an expense that often runs hundreds of thousands of dollars each year, among other additional costs. I think there's a huge difference between a $50M CMO taking a PPP loan and a small community-based school doing so. 

As a final note in regard to outside funding; public schools can take outside funds too, and they often do. I would hope those who condemn charter schools for taking outside money because it's ""not fair"" object as vociferously to the money raised by PTOs in wealthy neighborhoods and suburbs."

The juxtaposition of these phrases makes it seem like the charter is breaking the law. In reality, they simply decided to pay back the loan. Nothing unseemly.

In general, I would have thought more money for education was something most NYT readers could get behind. Apparently if your school (public charter or otherwise) has ever received a gift from Bill Gates then they‚Äôre somehow not entitled to public funds anymore?

Children are the toughest incubators of infectious agents. Because they recover quickly from most infections but they transmit spread infections to their siblings, parents and grand parents. Around children everyone should wear gloves and proper masks properly and wash hands or sanitize them every time a child is touched.

I challenge this author....write an article about what you think is a good thing today.  

For example:  
1). you can safely drink your tap water in your home or place of work.  I couldn‚Äôt do that in rural India.  I had to boil the tap water.  I couldn‚Äôt do that if I lived in Flint, Michigan 5 years ago.  Celebrate safe drinking water.

2). I can walk outside my home and be in the sunshine.  And the air is not filled with car exhaust or polluted by factory smoke stacks.  Celebrate clean air and your front door being in an area which allows the sunshine to get to the sidewalk.  If you lived in a barrio in Mexico City, the sun might not shine on your face right outside your front door.  The air would not be clean.

When they were created in the early 1990s, it was predicted that they were the death knell for public schools; since then they have contributed to the suspension of growth in public school funding and development and the general decline in student performance overall in both systems.

Charter schools should be abolished. Period.

Along with the employment of Betsy DeVos by the federal government.

And the United States and each state should re-commit to the 21st century development, with full and increased funding, of the greatest public school system in the world.

So what is this hatchet article written to appease the third triad of the school to prison pipeline doing in the NY Times?  

Public Charter School do exist in this middle world where they receive (in most states) no facility funding (in NYC and DC they receive over $3K per student and in CA they receive $1.1K per student in low income communities) but else where nothing.  Also, they receive $4K less per student nationwide.  

But the real story is during the great recession, charter schools could not access the TRANS or TANS systems that every district in the country relied upon for 1% loans.  Districts could access them, charters could not.  There is your answer.   

Randi Weingarten, Carol Burris, Diane Ravtich, & Elizabeth Warren (the 4 Karens of the Apocalpyse) are once again spinning to deflect the story away from the narrative now forming that Black Lives Do Not Matter to the Police Union, the Teacher's Union, and the Prison Guard Union.

The theories are 'unproven' because they would implicate a NATO ally, but otherwise they have strong DNA evidence supporting them.

2020-06-15 15:30:05,"A capitalist economy, to be healthy, depends on strong demand for goods and services. A capitalist economy without demand is moribund. Therefore, the best way to ensure that demand increases is to ensure that the people have enough money in their pockets and purses to be able to pay for the goods and services they want and need. To this end, it makes far greater sense to abandon ‚Äòtrickle-down‚Äô economics and think instead of ‚Äòtrickle-up‚Äô economics. Mass market demand rests with the people, not with the √©lite. The √©lite, for the most part, have few needs and unfulfilled desires. They‚Äôve got it all. Not so, the people.

It has been stated that the real income of Americans hasn‚Äôt increased since the Seventies. Ergo, there must be a great deal of pent up demand in the US economy. This needs to be released with cash injections to the people, not the superrich.

I would therefore suggest a change in economic focus. Put money into the pockets of the many. That way, the people at the top will benefit in a sustainable way. It isn‚Äôt a falsely inflated stock market that is the hallmark of a sound economy; rather, it is ever growing demand for goods and services in a strong economy.

I thought a frequent flyer program was a liability, not an asset, in accounting terms, because it requires the airline to provide something tangible, in this case a seat on a plane, for which no revenue would be received.

The Grand Old Party has become the party of ignorance, intolerance and corruption.  The real question is what has the Democratic Party become as the answer to that question will determine the future of the Republic and the national interest during a period of crippling structural deficits and demographic time bombs for social welfare programs. 

The danger ahead for America is that our one remaining ""political party"" is that an ill-conceived grass roots revolution (like the The Tea Party) captures the moment and seizes control of the Democratic Party and then goes off the rails and results in an analog to the past 4 years of  ""La Terreur de Trump"".

2020-06-15 20:36:40,"here os what we must do:

Make sure the private sector has enough useful money to conduct commerce. When the federal government spends or the FED buys bonds, that sends money to the private sector. When the government taxes or the bonds get paid back, that takes money out. Hence the federal deficit measures the net flow of money from the public sector (which has an infinite supply thru the FED) to the private sector. 

We must ensure that it is enough larger than the trade deficit which measures the flow of money out of the country. Also spend the federal money so that it gets to the people who need it and will spend it in domestic commerce, not to the people who do not need it and will speculate with it.

All fixed term government debt comes due eventually, and if there is no intention to pay it off, it must he replaced with new debt. Obviously, if interest rates were to rise appreciably then the interest on new debt would rise beyond the government‚Äôs ability to pay, except by a rise in taxes, which is a political anathema these days, or by issuing more debt, or by printing more money. 

Consequently, the more the government increases the national debt relative to GDP, the lower it must keep interest rates. This has the effect of increasing the size and frequency of credit and speculative bubbles, followed by financial crises, followed by deficit finance remedies (read more more of the same).

In Hungary we estimated they had over twenty per shift running it, supported by a team of ten maintenance technicians. It never ran 24/7.
It was then shipped to China and installed in a stonking new factory. Installing it was a book in the waiting. The factory was built upside down as no one had specified which floor did what. It was painted dark green in the production area (reason ditto). It was supposed to be a clean A/C area -- no A/C so they opened the windows. Then it snowed heavily so they drilled holes in the clean area roof to stop it collapsing. Meanwhile, the production team, headed up by a young post grad (actually the son of the local 'Mayor') comprised of over 50 people. Despite all the training in Europe, in the end a team of us had to stay over to make it work.

It is exactly this line of thinking which has proven to be problematic for the world at large.

Just look around and see how China has behaved with all other countries against the backdrop of this pandemic. Is it a wise choice to be dependent on this country for trade at all?

- In February and March, China conducted con large-scale military exercises in the Taiwan Strait. It did this even at the peak of its pandemic situation.

- In April, Chinese coast guard vessels sank a Vietnamese fishing vessel after ramming into it. 

- In April as well, a Chinese ""survey"" ship escorted by vessels of the coast guard and maritime militia tailed a Malaysian ship involved in oil exploration in the South China Sea. This incident happened within Malaysia's exclusive economic zone.

- In May, Chinese troops confronted Indian troops in a border clash in Sikkim, pelting rocks. Officially, China recognises Sikkim as part of India. But there are still clashes along the border.

- Later in May, Chinese troops crossed a mutually accepted control line and detained about five Indian soldiers in the Ladakh region. Both sides reinforced troops with armour, infantry and artillery. The standoff is still ongoing.

Yes, the Soviets collapsed, when they finally got a leader (Gorbachev) who was not willing to kill people to keep power.  However, the People's Republic of China won by growing its economy to become the richest country on earth.  Yes, more than the U.S., by the PPP weighting used by economists.  

Then the U.S. elected a totally incompetent President who has a reverse Midas touch--everything he touches turns to the opposite of gold.  While he has yet to put his opposition in concentration camps like Xi, he might well do so if he is in power for four more years."

2020-06-15 12:12:29,"My worry is based on lessons from the second world war. Our country mobilized its manufacturing capabilities to produce war material at a rate that allowed us to defeat the Axis powers. Would we be able to do that today if, God forbid, we go to war with China? Or, like the US did in WW2, would they be able to outproduce us leading to an American loss? I am not suggesting we start building war material but instead, bring manufacturing capability back to our shores regardless of how much we want cheap consumer goods."
2020-06-15 12:12:44,"What this demonstrates is that it is much harder for a seller to find a new buyer than it is for a buyer to find a new seller. 

In America‚Äôs relationship with China, we are the buyer (see: trade deficit). We must seize the opportunity to stop buying from China. Can we stop buying 100% of what we currently buy? No, but we can try to get close. 

My only concern is that we might be too late. China has done a pretty good job developing developing its own self-contained market of sellers and buyers. 

We have listened to our so-called leaders for too long who say trade and cooperation with China is good. We should have seen that China became a fascist country, quite a long time ago."

Many companies, mainly impelled by rising labor costs in China as well as the lack of reliable commercial law and persistent problems with quality have moved manufacturing to other countries, most notably Vietnam.  I heard one expert in international trade argue that Vietnam would be the ""winner"" when the effects of the pandemic were calculated.  China has implicitly acknowledged this trend by placing greater emphasis on domestic consumption."

This is simply untrue. The ""mishandling"" in question was really the failure to start their draconian lockdown a few weeks earlier, at the first hint of a new virus. It has been months, and the world still has much to understand about COVID, yet we expect China to act immediately with virtually no information. Of course, the US would have called for sanctions over what would've seemed like a terrible and unjustified violation of human rights. The devastating  impact such apparently capricious action would have had on business/manufacturing would surely be used to justify decoupling .Further we don't know that silencing whistleblowers had any impact on COVID because the CCP was, in retrospect, clearly gathering information and planning even while they squelched the public dissemination of incomplete, albeit alarming, information. We had tons of information available in the US, and what did the public, or for that matter, government, do? Information still needs a plan.  If nothing else,  COVID has actually shown the strengths of an authoritarian system that makes decisions based on science.

This is not to say that I support arresting doctors or want to live in an authoritarian system. But, one of the obligations of free speech, is critical thinking. Freedom without reason is dangerous."
2020-06-15 12:23:48,"""The risks of relying economically on the Asian superpower have never seemed clearer.""

What completely incompetent analysis. What is clear is the fact that the US, under Trump, deliberately provoked antagonism with China for 4 years.

I am so tired of the endless China bashing that our government and media has engaged in. It is counterproductive at best and dangerous at worse. By focusing on scapegoating China, we have on both conscious and unconscious levels reinforced the perception of China as ""other"". I believe that this has been part of the reason that our response has been so delayed and inadequate. Remember the ""relief"" when this hit Italy because then we would get some ""real"" information and see how a modern Western nation could successfully deal with Covid without resorting to the ""draconian"", ""totalitarian"" and ""Maoist"" strategies employed by China. Then to our astonishment and horror, we saw this thing literally steamroll Italy. Oops. It really doesn't matter what China publicly said, they gave us a step by step playbook of how to handle this. What they did to contain and mitigate was literally visible by satellite and based on sound reasoning and science. If we did not see them as ""other"" we would have appreciated the severity of the threat sooner and would have followed their, now proven, strategies. We are blaming them for our own failures and continuing to do so will jeopardize the global cooperation that is required to deal with this and future pandemics."

What do we have instead? A chaotic, stupid, poinless trade war we were losing even before the pandemic, lack of organization of common interests on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, and virtual delivery of the economic future of the remainder of the century to China.

Among all the damage the Biden administration will have to try to undo after the present fool leaves office, the Pacific trade agreement is but one piece of restoring an orderly world because a disordered, disorderly world suits China just fine."

We have fewer and fewer factories in the USA  where employees work with their hands.  These jobs have gone to other countries and to advanced automation worldwide.

We need to accept that we pay a premium for this.  We used to be able to balance this against a full economy and sensible trade practices with our business friends and allies around the world.

Now we are isolating ourselves with ill-considered tweets, poor communication, inconsistent tariff policies, and little in the way of imagination or leadership about restructuring our own factories and infrastructure.

When American auto companies faced stiff competition from Japan, they outsourced parts to Mexico. There are obvious reasons why baseballs are made in Haiti, chocolate is controlled by an exchange in Switzerland, Nikes are made in Vietnam.

Under US law the responsibility of a corporation is to maximize profit for its shareholders. In America that means serving the 10% that owns 85% of all stock shares.

Communist China, with its terrible human rights record and lax environmental laws offered cheap exploitable labor for US multinational corporations.

Today half the 250 billion dollars trade deficit with China is actually American owned goods made in China being exported back to the US. Those same companies shelter their profits in foreign counties to avoid taxes.

This endless exploitation for profit is the inescapable logic of capitalism. It has no morality, not sense of social consequences and no conscious.

We can blame China, but the truth is that if it wasn't China it woulds some other developing country with cheap labor and exploitable natural resources.

Supposedly, China would be the potentially huge market for American businesses to sell its products, services and crops.

All of the time, except for the agriculture aspect, American companies simply wanted China to be the place to have products manufactured to their specifications at bargain-basement prices.

If the US and other countries could not have China as a political punching bag and that totalitarian (by political party) state set aside the politics and recognize that a good economy means good politics, we might get somewhere.  This would be true in Hong Kong, where the party rule seems more important than the economic power of that island's contribution to China and to partners elsewhere.

We cannot even say that our economic policy is one driven by democratic principles.   At the same time we should not abandon principles which used to be seen as values of America to be emulated.  We can advocate without imposing; encourage as role model without force of threat.  

The story features Australian lobstermen, but it could have also been said of New England lobster business, where the boom of selling to Hong Kong and Shanghai has fallen dramatically.  We do not need to punish our people as a result of dopey economic and environmental policies.  The rising tide lifting all boats has been discarded in favor of beaching our boats.

A lot goes in.  But very little comes out.  Especially to those who are not high ranking members of the Chinese Politburo. 

China has never been an open society.  We in the West are basically trying to read Chinese tea leaves.  Shooting in the dark. Without any real knowledge of what is actually going on. On the inside.

For all we know China is a mess.  SARS-CoV-2 is out of control. Their shadow banking system is on life support. And their only hope is to save face and pretend otherwise.  

Hoping that they will be the first one to cross the finish line in developing an Artificial General Intelligence System. Capable of outsmarting.  Out maneuvering.  And out playing their competition. In a contest for control of the planet's dwindling supply of natural resources. 

Which is what this new Cold War is all about in the first place. Why more of us don't see that is beyond me. Perhaps we just have not been paying attention. Or we don't care.  Or it's too obvious.  Or worrisome to acknowledge.

Further, the loss of manufacturing jobs has perhaps fueled the malaise in the lower income class blue collar workers (perhaps contributing to the drug problem). Although the US is the leader in technology (and silicon valley cannot be copied just yet), not everyone can retool themselves to work in those jobs. People need jobs, not just for income, but also provide some sense of worth. While we sell insurance and credit cards to each other, we have lost a big part of american ingenuity that was the cornerstone of the growth of this country.

The implication that ordinary Americans WANT their goods to be produced in China is wrong and offensive. The stock market and corporate c-suites wanted to produce in China without the pesky complications of democracy, rule of law, health and safety regulations, and employment protections, and free association and speech for workers.

With every breath we take, we must commit to being that change, and to creating a better, more just world for everyone.""

The problem is that China had its own ideas of what to do with all the money that came pouring in and it was not to the West's benefit.  The other issue is that while parts of China are modern, other parts are incredibly primitive.  In the past that could be ignored and left for ""China to deal with their own mess.""  We no longer have that luxury.  

For thousands of years China was THE power in all of Asia and parts of the Middle East.  For the last 200 years or so they have been eclipsed by the West, but they have never forgotten their past glory and want to restore their proper place in the world.  The world's trade with China has now given them the resources to do so.  China's vision will come at our expense, they will be subtle with the process, but the long term goal is Chinese preeminence.

China's primitive systems in sanitation, quality control, medicine and government were written off as an internal Chinese problem that could be ignored.  As COVID has shown, those ideas are no longer true.

My point here is that we can no longer allow tactical advantages to blind us to the fact that China is a danger to the world.  We should not be enriching our adversary.  We must move our trade away from China."

2020-06-15 15:55:28,"If not now, never. 
The hope held by western democracies  years ago was that once China was admitted into the WTO, economic growth would induce change in the country to share common values held by western democracies; rule of law, freedom of speech and freedom of association, etc.  As China grew wealthier and wealthier to become the world‚Äôs second biggest economy, it has tightened its despotic ruling domestically and started to bully small countries that have become too reliant on exports to China.  It has jailed hundreds of human-rights lawyers and over a million Uyghurs, retaliated against Norway for awarding a Nobel peace prize to a political dissident and imposed heavy tariffs on Australian goods for proposing an investigation into the source of Covid-19.
The average US family is estimated to save $800 a year from cheaper imports from China.  That amounts to $16,000 in two decades or total savings of roughly 1.5 to 2 trillion for the country.  Compare that with the amounts the US govt. injected into the economy to save it from collapse. Upfront and honest admission of the virus by China would have saved the world from disasters.  If western democracies do not act as a united front and decouple from China, their reliance on China will only continue to increase to the point, say in 20 years, when most countries are under China‚Äôs big thumb.  By then, America will at best be its equal, powerless in forcing any change and lonely with no meaningful allies.  If not now, never."

C-suite decision makers were excited by the promise of cheap labor to the point of overlooking factors such as the exhaustingly long journeys which company representatives must make to observe the operations, and the invasiveness of the communist government in many aspects including plant ownership.  It's heartening to see some actual thought now going into sourcing from China, and some jobs returning to the US and other nations.  If we had a government which put more thought into manufacturing jobs, we would invest as a nation in skills training so our workforce would be more useful to manufacturers."
2020-06-15 16:08:40,"This is an interesting article, but it fails to focus on the major issue: our dependence on Chinese manufacturing.

The article mostly discusses China as a market at which to sell Western products. This is an important issue, but it not the major concern. The issue crucial to our national security, and the security of the world, is that we are dependent on China to build countless essential products. Most medicines come from China. As we just learned the hard way, so does most PPE. Innumerable products essential to a functioning infrastructure, such as large transformers for our power grid, are only made in China.

As we've closed down our own factories, our national security is now dependent on China. They know it and we know it.

This must change, but it will not be easy. Too many America politicians, business leaders, members of the media and importantly economists displayed catastrophic tunnel vision as we marched towards globalization.

By and large, globalization is a good thing, and has dramatically lowered the cost of goods and raised the standard of living worldwide. But it must be subject to constraints, so that essential products are available from multiple countries, including our own. This will require some degree of centralized planning, and may require tariffs to implement. These are anathema to many with a capitalist mindset, but represent the only real alternative to a growing dependence on countries, such as China, that are not always our friend."

You Americans can even manage to invest in your basic infrastructure, which would support a new wave of manufacturing. Also, you would have to spend money on training which you haven't been doing. Factories with 21st century 4.0 machines would need to be purchased. Private corporations won't produce anything unless there's a (big) return to the shareholders which means manufactured products would have to be competitive to drive demand. 

Sure, some manufacturing ""might"" come back to your shores, but corporations act in their own best interests, not in the interests of Americans or the U.S.A."

2-After all is said and done if China still dominants, congratulate them and as the old saying goes if you can't beat em join em.

No business that expects to compete globally can ignore it & none can attempt to dictate its own terms for dealing with Chinese businesses and the Chinese government. This is no different from countries other than the US dealing with the US, long the most important market in the world. America, since the 1930s, has demanded price concessions, imposed various trade barriers, insisted on knowledge transfers and appropriation of intellectual property, punished firms and countries that annoy or threaten domestic firms, created bogus safety and other regulations to keep out superior foreign products, and violated its own trade agreements and international law whenever it suits US interests. China has actually been remarkably well-behaved in comparison. Of course, Washington and US economic interests don't like at all the tables being turned. Subservience such as imposed on Canada, the UK and EU is much preferred to having to make accommodations to another big player. The EU starting to bristle at US ill treatment is a further complication, especially now that the faithful US ally, the UK, is gone. How the EU will position itself vis a vis China in the covid-19 recessionary era will be very interesting to watch.

The reality is that as a country with a quarter of humanity of this planet, China has strong impact on our world whether it has a Communist Party or not. In fact, many of economic impact, good or bad, of China's development in the last 40 years are the results of 1.4 billion hard working, hungry Chinese people. If anything, their resourcefulness and ingenuity are hampered by an authoritarian and corrupt regime. By attributing all economic effects of a changing China on the world to the policies of the Chinese Communist Party we unintentionally push a large portion of Chinese people to the side of CCP which has long claimed to be the protector of Chinese national economic and security interests. We must faced the fact that China and, in the near future, India are going to has a huge impact to the old world economic order with their large population. Attempts to ""contain"" aspiration of world's half population is unwise and unjust. Indeed, we must work toward a new economic order in which we could eliminate poverty from all corners of the world including Africa, South America, all Asia and the middle east.

The move from being a country with many higher paying manufacturing and research jobs, to one where service sector jobs prevail has been painful for the US.  Particularly so since the GOP refuses to raise the minimum wage, which many service sector jobs pay.  The GOP often explains its reluctance to raise the minimum wage by indicating that service jobs are for teenagers, without any suggestion as to where these teenagers go for higher paying jobs when they reach adulthood."

But the timing was right to buy a used RV I'd come upon in Florida. How to get it back home? I did all -- ALL -- the research, and had it laid out perfectly, step by step, from getting a ride to SFO in a van (socially distanced, wearing masks), through the airport, on a flight (on Delta, who take the best precautions) with the fewest possible co-passengers (through Seattle and Atlanta to Sarasota), then by rental car (no-contact pick-up) to the dealer, where my contact was to get a COVID test and take two days off (at my expense) before touring me through my vehicle (shut down for 72 hours before my arrival). I was DYING to do a photo-essay (like this) of the experience getting there and driving back home. Why such planning? To protect not only myself BUT everyone else as well. I refused to get someone else to drive it: if anyone had to take a risk, it would be me. Then a great friend made a point: there was a third group to consider, my friends who'd be worried sick of my doing this, as a 63-year-old with multiple risk factors.

That accepting a rise in infections is even considered, indicates that elite thinking regarding COVID is quite disturbing. 

A fundamental question is NOT being asked: clearly, corporate America is behind the push to reopen prematurely, and given their outsized control of politicians relative to the needs of working Americans, are we willing to allow the politicians to prioritize commerce over our health and well-being?

That the same politicians pushing for a premature reopening are not simultaneously advocating for a government funded health program to help those who have contracted COVID, gives a clear indication of the integrity level of these people who claim to represent us. And before you view this through a partisan lens, recall that Gavin Newsom has ceded reopening decisions to county-level officials - many California counties are currently NOT mandating masks. 

Unfortunately, due to long-standing elite resistance to reform of police behavior, most of us are focused on the issue of police executions instead of public health.

So long as we continue to elect politicians who are essentially employees of corporate America, things will only get worse on civil rights and health care."

""The 64 counties that moved into the second phase of reopening on June 5 saw a near 42 percent increase in new cases the week before that could not be explained by increased testing alone, according to a Miami Herald analysis of the Florida health department‚Äôs case data. Testing had increased by only 8 percent over the same period.""

Florida's surging numbers have little to do with increased testing."

2020-06-14 14:53:26,"With the severity of the infections in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, the people in those states had to learn the hard lesson of social distancing including wearing masks. Sounds like people in some of the other states are going to have to learn those same lessons."
2020-06-14 15:06:03,"The partial reopening was a good plan, but it ran into two unexpected problems. First, if California is any indication, many people aren't following the guidelines. About 1 in 3 people aren't wearing masks. Many people are gathering in groups and they going on road trips like there is no virus. 

Then there's the protests. If this virus is anything as contagious as they say, those are candidates for super spreader events.

We almost fought the virus to a draw, then we let down our guard, and our progress is evaporating."
2020-06-14 15:09:58,"There is nothing shocking contained in this article.

The virus is spread by human behavior.

Behavior change that mitigates the spread -- staying home, staying away from people and wearing masks if you must go out -- keeps the case numbers down.

Reopening and not practicing behaviors that decrease transmission will increase case numbers.

We're fighting against several things -- 1) needing to get out of the house after being stuck inside for months, 2) needing to get the economy running again, 3) people who just don't care / think it's a hoax / it won't happen to me / if it does it'll just be a cold for me.

Unfortunately we could deal with 1 and 2 well if 3 didn't exist, but humans being humans 3 will always exist."
2020-06-14 15:27:37,"If something will be remembered of this pandemic, that will be the ability of self-deception of both the American citizenry and of our political leaders, mostly conservative. 

That lockdowns were wasted as a short interlude to prepare tracing and testing is one thing. To have the public assume that new infections will not reoccur when all factors are conducive to an outbreak is astounding and makes us wonder about the education and rationality of Americans. 

We are courting the tragedies of New York and Boston but across hundreds of cities and tens of states at once."

We have met the enemy and its our administrative state which can't get anything done."

I have a close family member, my cousin Giorgio, who died within 6 days of exposure  just by being at a restaurant in February with people who had the virus. He was in good health and a mountain climber. 
Americans for the most part, don't have family members or friends who died from the virus so they have a false bias of safety. 
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but the virus will return. The probability of developing a vaccine is low for this type of virus. There will be monoclonal antibody therapy  but that takes  an inordinate amount of resources to produce. 

In short my friends, we have to take care of each other. Wear masks, stay away from crowds, keep the recommended distances and trace infections and enforce lock downs for infected people."
2020-06-14 15:28:33,"What did you expect? It seems more people and especially politicians are wanting to ignore science. The CDC and doctors  have told us what needs to be done to control and reduce Covid19 spread and infection.  Instead it seems too many of us want to take a short cut and pretend we can power through this pandemic.  Trump has managed to politicize this virus to the point that if you wear a mask you're somehow a left wing Democrat. He's made not wearing a mask a sign of being for patriotic, freedom loving and a real  American.  Sadly all that not wearing a mask in public reveals about you is that you're willfully ignorant, selfish and inconsiderate of my health. The virus doesn't care about our politics. It's just looking for a host where it can land and propagate."

However, what is worse is the fact that every nation has to deal with this problem with the only proper fix being lockdowns where the virus spread is limited, and this costs every nation a lot. Even worse is the fact that these same nations which are struggling with the costs of this virus still maintain the misunderstood human animal survival instinct and continue to spend more on their killing machines.

They will then leave these events, spreading the disease within and outside their geographic areas like plague rats.

I am now seeing it in action. Driving from Iowa to New York, I‚Äôve seen hardly any masks, forget about social distancing, hotel lobby‚Äôs full of people partying, hotel staff not wearing masks. 
I don‚Äôt know that all the wiping down, changing sheets, trash bags on surfaces etc is going to protect us in the long run if people can‚Äôt take basic steps to protect themselves and others. 
The virus is going to run through the world population. America is in free fall, in more ways than one. It may just reach herd immunity with a devastating death toll before other countries if it keeps going on like this. 
The ones who refuse to apply common sense complaining about shutdowns etc, well, they are the ones responsible for the next shutdown which is looming on the horizon. Stop complaining about the damage to the economy, unemployment etc since you are complicit by your refusal to do basic things like wear a mask and stay 6 feet apart.

No wonder states that didn't see cases early (or which stopped them early, like CA) are now getting hammered--it was just a matter of time until the virus reached them, and now that it has, it will blow through the weakest like wildfire.

What remains to be seen is whether it then acts like a typical coronavirus and disappears (like SARS and MERS)  or for some reason acts more like the flu (a totally different genus)."
2020-06-14 15:40:07,"Before re-opening Texas, Governor Abbott indicated the number of coronavirus cases would be monitored carefully and decisions to further expand re-opening would be driven by that data. Now roughly six weeks later, the state continues to open up more and more types of businesses and increase their capacity limits despite an alarming rise in infections. They say everything is big in Texas. Looks like the lies are too."
2020-06-14 15:47:55,"If there aren‚Äôt surges in cases in the next weeks after the protests, people may get complacent...and that‚Äôs alarming to me. I do think the risk is much lower outside compared to inside spaces ((homes, office spaces, restaurants, hair salons, etc) I also do think death rates may slow this summer. 

But the virus hasn‚Äôt disappeared.  

Many wise business owners are leaving  their doors and windows open in warm weather  , allowing  the virus to disperse and, hopefully, remain at low enough levels that it  isn‚Äôt as easily transmitted, even  when inside those businesses. Kids play outside, go swimming, etc. They‚Äôre not stuck inside as much. 

So what  if we don‚Äôt have a major surge, both in cases  and deaths, till colder  weather returns? Contrast a  flu  To summer:  kids in school, far less time  outside , employees back in offices...and, where there are frigid winters, doors and windows shut tight against the cold. 

If we‚Äôve had a relatively ‚Äú safe‚Äù summer, with hospitals ICUs nowhere near capacity people may feel complacent, may have  let down their guard. Thats when things could get very bad again.

As for us, being high risk, we‚Äôre not changing a thing : groceries delivered, socially distanced walks around the neighborhood, not going to restaurants, hair salons, etc. At worst, we‚Äôll be proven wrong. And we‚Äôd be delighted."
2020-06-14 16:27:29,"As a Florida resident, I have noticed that since the lifting of restrictions, probably around 60-70% of the people I see going to Walmart, Home Depot, Lowes, Publix, and other major stores are NOT wearing masks. Even some of the stores like Petsmart don't even have their employees wearing masks any longer. 

With the need to balance the economic recovery with public health, it seems like wearing masks is the minimum that we should be doing -- and it should be mandated.  

Unfortunately Trump is sending a message through his words and actions that wearing masks are not needed and his apostles are following his lead. Scary to think of what the potential spread of the coronavirus might be from his rally in Tulsa next week and then the RNC in August."
2020-06-14 15:52:41,"Yes, wearing a mask is uncomfortable.  Social distancing is awkward.  However, as a society, we used to sacrifice individual comfort (not rights) for the greater good.  Rationing, blackouts, etc. in WWII, for example.  When we refuse to wear a mask to protect others, including the most vulnerable among us, what does that say about our society? Our humanity?  Research demonstrates that masks and social distancing prevent transmission.  I fail to see what Constitutional rights are infringed upon when you wear a mask.  There are no Constitutional rights to comfort, selfishness and willful ignorance."

I left Texas in 1995. I have now lived more years outside of Texas than within it. 

When I read the news regarding Texas' reopening I was not really surprised. Decades have passed since I was there but Texas still has a lot of ignorant, impatient citizens who don't comprehend the consequences of their actions. So naturally they would push for a quick reopening. An aunt who lives in the Dallas area reports to me that few people are wearing masks now.

The tragedy in this situation is not just the people of Texas suffering due to their own ignorance. They put the rest of us Americans at risk as well.

I never thought I would say this but the last few years under the Trump ""administration"" (I have to put the word in quotes because since when does staggering hubris, ignorance, laziness, cruelty and nepotism count as an administration?) have led me to support the South again seceding from the USA. Allow these Americans who wish to live a backwards reality reminiscent of the 19th century to go their merry way to their own oblivion. Allow them to quarantine themselves with their own ignorance. Allow the rest of us who wish to live in the 21st century to do so.

Governor Ducey also took away the power of local Mayors *anywhere* in our state to establish laws more strict than his.

The rules here are so confusing that I, who care very much, have little idea what they even are.  Does my landlord have to wear a mask to enter my apartment?    Is there any penalty if he doesn't?   What about my employer, a warehouse in an old garage where 50 people pay NO attention to social distance, and a third of the people wear masks, decreasing over time?

The government of our large, liberal city, TELLS people to observe social distances and wear masks, and limits the size of groups, but, the Governor of Texas ruled that it can't be enforced, and I think the courts might have upheld that.   And the Governor issued different rules than the city and the county did.  The rules that do exist are typical Texas fake law; more of policy request than a law, it depends on people being ""nice"" enough to observe the rule.   Like with smoking in public, hardly anyone pays any attention, but, the city passed a rule and they take the matter very seriously.  NOT. 

Austin cancelled its public hospital.  And we aren't even told which hospitals to go to if we have respiratory distress, nor how to get there.   

Testing for covid follows the same pattern.   In Austin, they want everyone to test - but noone who lacks a car and access to a private clinic doing tests can be tested.   It's been true for months and the leaders don't care."

And this article appears to use the words ""death"" and ""die"" just once each. No mention of ""dying"" or ""mortality"" or ""per capita"" for that matter. But ""cases"" is used around 20 times.

If people, as they pass from their private spaces to public spaces such as air transportation, school, work, etc were to be tested on a regular basis, and if found positive, traced and isolated, this would filter out much of the virus.  The degree of testing would be reflected in the filtering out of the virus.  This has been the procedure in the countries that per capita have the lowest damage done by the virus.  The US counts for a quarter of the deaths from the virus.  The reason for this is negligence and abysmal social discipline.  In an more intelligent and socially responsible nation, the people would demand the government take the initiative and do what is possible.  We have deplorable leadership, perhaps because we are, as a people, negligent, obtuse, and disaffected."

But what is NOT mentioned at all is the possibility that the virus is evolving into a less deadly strain. Why isn't this being discussed? It happened in some past respiratory pandemics; and it makes sense in terms of the coronavirus' ability to spread its genes faster (asymptomatic or low-symptomatic active people spread it much faster than isolated sick and dead victims).

San Diego is experiencing a wave of coronavirus cases from Baja California.  The border patrol reports that people cross the border from Mexicali to Calexico and call 911, or have an ambulance waiting for them.  El Centro Regional Medical Center has so many coronavirus patients from Mexicali that it has transferred coronavirus patients to hospitals all over California.  Imperial County, adjacent to Mexico, has the highest infection rate in California. Yuma County Arizona has higher infections rates that Phoenix and Tucson.

Last time unknowingly the virus entered from the Chinese soil. This time the second wave in China has been well reported in the media.

As temperatures roar in the Sunbelt, folks tend to stay indoors, which assists person to person viral transmission. This is not unlike flu season trends. As winter approaches, folks stay indoors more often, and flu transmission spikes, particularly during the big holiday season from Thanksgiving to New Year‚Äôs Day. 

However, in non-Sunbelt states with late spring weather bringing mild temperatures with cool evenings, folks tend to stay outdoors as much as possible. As long as mass gatherings are avoided, adequate social distancing is easier to sustain.

The early reopening of Sunbelt states started around the time that temperatures moved towards triple digits, in places like SoCal, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, TX and FL. With the benefit of hindsight, once these these states decided to reopen, they should have limited access to beaches, malls and parks. Or, they should have strictly enforced distancing and face mask requirements in places that attract large crowds."

2020-06-14 17:50:59,"It is no surprise that the coronavirus is still with us, and that there are increases in cases as states reopen. The draconian lockdowns performed as intended and flattened the curve, but they did not allow immunity to develop. Only a vaccine can end the scourge.

There is good news: the pandemic was slowed, and our healthcare system was, for the most part, not overwhelmed. Further, medicine has learned to better manage severe cases, and the fatality rate has been lowered.

As we decide how to move forward awaiting a vaccine, we know that lockdowns and social distancing can slow, but not eliminate the virus. Further, lockdowns as imposed  in the past have collapsed the global economy, producing wide spread hunger on an unimaginable scale. The US, having outsourced most of our manufacturing, is more dependent of global trade than many recognize.

Thus, as we manage or slow the reopening of our economy, we must balance the downsides of lockdowns with their benefits. This is not easy, but is absolutely essential.

Let‚Äôs not forget common sense. We should all wear masks in public; they are an effective tool. Seniors, particularly those with chronic diseases, are at greater risk than younger people. Some activities, such as mass protests, are especially dangerous, and impossible to contact trace. The coronavirus will spread even if the protests are well motivated.

This also severed relationships with employer-related health plans.  All of this occurs while billions go unaccounted for and plenty of companies that did not need assistance got it.  Compound this with a complete abdication of responsibility by Republican leaders and a psychological weakness among many in the population who cannot delay gratification if their lives depended on it, and you have people at risk; many of whom will become sick.

I have adjusted my grocery shopping habits to only go to those stores that strictly enforce mask wearing, have sanitizer and gloves at the door and sanitizer at check out stands. The check outs have plexi screens and all employees wear masks and gloves. Trader Joes has been excellent in following these procedures and they sanitize the handles on their carts and baskets.They require people to spread out 6 feet apart in the check out lines and have one way directional traffic in the store aisle.

For the opposite side of what I just listed - it can kill them.  It seems that a big chunk of society is basically deciding that COVID isn't a big problem for them and that those at risk ""should be protected."".  That is code-speak for ""keep them from being a hassle for me"".  Without a vaccine, we are about to learn an unfortunate lesson there are many more people that are at-risk than they thought.

Use of ICU beds, the principal data used in making re-opening decisions, has trended up slightly, but, according to the state dashboard, that is overwhelmingly due to non-covid cases, while covid cases are somewhat lower than they were. I cannot explain these results, except that they may be due to state and local officials working together and speaking with one voice, and continuing to admonish us to practice social distancing, mask wearing, and hand washing. Also, testing is widely available now, and there has been particular focus on hot spots."
2020-06-14 18:45:49,"The seeds for disaster is being planted as people go about like this pandemic was just a bad dream.  Well, considering what I've seen (and still seeing), were about to learn a harsh lesson in being impatient.  Already I saw restaurants filled with groups clustered together, without any masks on, laughing and having a good time.  Although it was outdoor, the sight of them so close together gave me pause.  Clearly, we failed the marshmallow test."
2020-06-14 18:09:49,"The rise in cases is not surprising.  What can you do with a portion of the public that takes the attitude of ""if there are no cases in my town/county, then the Coronavirus is a hoax, and proof we do not need social distancing""?  These people should realize that social distancing is what has kept their communities virus-free.  But when right-wing politicians and their propaganda wing (Fox News) are either ignorant or deliberately obtuse, this framing of the responses to the pandemic is lost.  Imagine how many lives would have been saved had the Right jumped on board with the need for an effective public health response?  
Instead,the public gets is an inconsistent, almost incoherent recommendations.  In my state, the governor was politically attacked, and faced court challenges to her ability to impose public health rules.   And the CDC has had to temper it's recommendations.
The virus is here to stay, and a portion of our country believes it is acceptable to let people die."
2020-06-14 18:11:31,"Lockdown was a horrid thing, social distancing is difficult sometimes, but definitely do-able. Mask wearing is now mandatory on public transport and some shops are enforcing it too. I dont use public transport, I would rather walk 10 miles than get on a bus or train at the moment, the only essential purchase I need to make is food, which I do online. Im unable to get a haircut for another couple of weeks or so, annoying, but not life changing. I dont need new clothes or homewares right now. I am at last able to see my only child (40, but still my only child) again, more important than being able to go to the pub or not!! The upshot of my considered actions for the last three months are as follows......my child and I are both safe and well, there have been no new infections in the county where I live for 7 days, population nearly 290,000. The nationwide covid related fatality number for today is 36, population 66.5 million, so the misery mongers are starved of headlines today. Boza Johnson can be a drip at the best of times, but careful, considered easing of lockdown has been his mantra and on the whole, we listened. Stay safe and well America, its not rocket science, just science  :)

You know what's not pleasant, terrible disease of the lungs.

The mask-less woman in the grocery store this week who wore a flag on her shirt, front and back is just one of the unpatriotic people sabotaging  the re-opening.

2020-06-14 18:13:36,"Common sense and economic survival would dictate that our opening be mainly about businesses re-opening. It should not be about individuals not having to wear masks, not having to wash or sanitize hands, and being able to crowd up in bars or beaches, or getting to see more than a few personal friends.

This is not about individual privilege. This is about economic survival. By being lazy and loose with the rules, thinking that you yourself are the exception, you risk killing the businesses in your community, because when the virus surges back, and when those businesses have to shut again, they are far more likely to be shut forever.  Use some common sense."

We choose to repeat the 20th century but particularly the mistake part: the Vietnam War era repeated in the Iraq war era. 

We wasted immense resources but also time for nothing, simply nothing. We created an immense number of  PTSD veterans and PTSD society as we are harvesting today what we saw yesterday.

Today we are still living in the same mindset,  US colossal failing in Coronavirus response, entangled with its racial discrimination cancer.

2020-06-14 19:52:59,"The narrative here doesn‚Äôt quite capture the true situation. Arizona has had onerous restrictions for three months, during which infections were very low.  So we have never dealt with the sort of crisis that existed back East.  And when restrictions were eased, our fear level was low. 

Fear is the big motivator here and we had little. And only now is that beginning to change, at least for those most vulnerable. As for young people, they‚Äôre the ones out there mixing. 

The trajectory of the pandemic is different here than it has been back East. We beat it back, we dropped our guard and now the elderly and those with dangerous conditions are going back inside. So the new regimen is concentrating caution among the most vulnerable. Many scientists view that as the best way to return to normal. Hopefully, that is true. The East called for uniform precautions for all. That didn‚Äôt work so well."

Her annoyance over that paled in comparison to what she saw out her window: a few dozen people periodically hugging, not social distancing, almost no masks.  I told her that likely, COVID hopped a ride on the droplets that came from the constant shouting and laughing.

Even worse, she estimated that in total, about a third of the crowd were elderly.  Toddlers were there, too.

She said it was surreal; she absolutely could not believe her eyes, since the state of Florida, and South Florida particularly, have seen cases skyrocket quite literally overnight.  She said it would have taken the landlord maybe an hour to go door-to-door and call off the party.

She also said there was a prayer at the end, and that down the block is a church led by a nice but fairly aggressive pastor who gave the prayer.  Just weird, considering.

My relative is right: It is absolutely surreal to consider that some people simply don't care if they cause the death of someone else.   After all, there are burgers and potato salad and hula hoop contests to be had - and maybe some new church members to $ign up, too.

Meanwhile, we have 21000 cases a day and consider it business as usual.  That is why we are the world's pariah.  We are doing about as well as the developing countries. The only difference is our hosptials and wealth.  But that too has limits.  AZ, FL, and TX will soon have to shut down no matter what their governors may say."

The Republican strategy (since Reagan) to erode confidence in the federal government has finally come home to roost for Americans. Russia has been actively trolling American's electoral vulnerabilities, to great success. China is beginning to overtake the US in global influence. The quality of American public schools has declined so precipitously that many adults cannot distinguish fact from opinion. Americans are so skeptical of ""government"" that many believe COVID is a Democratic ""hoax"".

They tend to claim that the concept of OUR life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness is some sort of socialist conspiracy.

New York was a big influence on the total numbers due to the very high number of cases in a densely populated area.  The rest of the country by ""opening up"" and disregarding mitigation efforts such as social distancing, masking, etc are now picking up the slack.

If you are vulnerable, and you are able to use all possible means to protect yourself, do so.  The situation may be better in the early hot spots but things are not better in the broad swath of the country, they are now worse."

While the virus had its origin in China, it spread rapidly in the US due to Donald Trump and his Republican peers. You only need to compare the actions of New Zealand s prime minister Jacinda Ardern and Donald Trump.

At the very onset Ms. Ardern delivered a strong message: This is extremely serious. We are all part of one team, team New Zealand. If we stick together and hunker down hard, it will be difficult but we will get through. We will come out better in the end. Ardern believes in science and the greater good.

Compare that to Mr. Trump and his minions: This is a hoax intended to make me look bad. This is an assault on your personal freedoms. You don‚Äôt need to wear a mask because the virus is relatively benign and will only affect very few people. Go out and congregate in numbers. Trump disdains science and is only looking out for himself.

Idiots in the US are still delivering this message, meaning the second wave will be even more devastating, we will be in lock down for much longer, more people will unnecessarily die, and our economy will be in tank for years to come. Arden unified people. Trump divided us all.

Ergo if our President would wear a mask many of his followers would and the science indicates this would reduce the amount of transmission, death and non fatal complications from the coronavirus.

While you're at it check the same curves for Oregon, California, Arizona, Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, North and South Carolina , Georgia and Florida. This proves that if hot weather slows down this virus, it is not apparent. It looks like the mother of all spikes.

BTW, we can expect the openings to have similar impacts here in the tri-state area. A close  examination of these curves reveal that COVID is just below the surface, lurking.

This is the reason why COVID 19 is Fauci's nightmare. I predict in a week or so, Sun Belt states with any sense will be closing down again."

In one respect it might have been lucky for us here in MA to be the state in the #3 position for overall cases.  As an excellent article in the Globe pointed out, it was a series of initial errors that helped, as well as more severe outbreaks in highly dense boroughs of Boston like Chelsea.

Our reopening has been glacial compared to other states, and every step has been preceded by looking at the data.  I have no doubt that should the numbers start climbing, Governor Baker would give us a jolt of reality by reinstating strictures.

Given how much the administration (and its supporters) have been wrong wrong wrong, I have no confidence in their prediction about the fatality rate either.  So far, the US average has been about 5% and about 2% worldwide.  Remember, these same people are the ones pushing for 'herd immunity' but never discuss what that means.  For the US (with 330 million people) that means 65% of the population needs to be exposed.  Of the 220 million exposed, if we even follow the worldwide fatality average, that's 4.4 million dead.  If we follow the average we've thus far had, that's 11 million dead.  I want the administration (and those who ape its idiotic dogma) to explain who they expect to die for the greater glory of rich people (who BTW are the only ones who really benefit from a premature reopening)."

In this country we don't want to see death, dying, suffering and pain, up close and in real time. If every night on the local and cable news, we saw people dying from the virus it would solve the problem in days. People would be following all the precautions and then some. 
We see doctors, nurses, and other health care workers sobbing over what they have seen and continue to see in conjunction with this plague. If the people trained to deal with death and dying are that broken up over what they have dealt with, I can't imagine how the general public would respond having witnessed the same things."
2020-06-14 21:09:17,"Here in San Francisco, a densely populated city of close to a million people, we have less than 3000 positive cases and less than 50 deaths since March. 

Most people here wear masks everywhere and do social distancing everywhere, even on public transportation and in parks. We have started to open up and no spikes so far. 

I feel fortunate to live in a place where people respect science and are willing to comply with the restrictions despite impatience and frustration."

2020-06-14 21:18:54,"Why am I not surprised? Flattening the curve was a joke. Many of US, as many as 40% of adults over 45 need to flatten our waist line and behinds and 20% of those below 40 needed to do the same. Social distancing was another joke we did need to stay as far away as possible when indoors in closed spaces and 6 feet outdoors. Improper masks commonly worn under the nostrils improperly was another big joke. Many who wore it improperly would tell me "" I can't breathe"" with the mask. Hello friend, a proper mask works like a filter with air passing freely through a surgical mask or a piece of cotton cloth.  

Soaps and sanitizers are readily available now get some and use them every time you touch something or someone. It has been over 4 months since that menacing rascal COVID-19 made a landfall in mainland USA. I was curious to find out whether I had acquired herd immunity and so I got myself tested. The test was negative, an indication of no past infection until the recent past. I knew I was not in a bubblette like the bubble boy but I was not going to get any immunity unless I encounter the virus in a closer proximity or get the vaccine in whichever year of the lord. 

I tell everyone who has survived this pandemic just keep doing whatever you did. Don't do anything I would not do but feel free to do what I do to survive. My herd is doing fine, some following my suggestion to ensure daily consumption of a balanced diet along with optimal protein intake and a glass of virus killer."
2020-06-14 21:45:09,"I think that the authors of this article are misrepresenting the reopening in Pennsylvania.  The Philadelphia area counties, as well as several others with high case numbers, did not begin any type of reopening until Friday June 5.  Pennsylvania is a huge state with a lot of sparsely populated areas with small numbers of cases--those are counties that began reopening in May.  The most likely reason for the continuing decrease in cases in PA is that the counties with the highest caseloads stayed completely closed until 10 days ago and that even in the stage of reopening we are in now, there are rather severe restrictions.  Among the many restrictions still in place: everyone must wear masks when entering a business; all personal care and wellness facilities (gyms, salons, etc.) are still closed; gatherings of over 25 people are prohibited; entertainment venues like casinos and theaters are still closed.  Reopening looks different in different states."

Especially in border communities in Texas and Arizona --
-- along with the border counties of Imperial and San Diego counties in California, which, along with Los Angeles county,
are the darkest spots on the corona virus map of California
(which, in other counties, is doing relatively well compared to the rest of the USA, thanks mostly to the lockdown and careful observance of lockdown rules by the denizens of those other counties).

We'll never know,
because there is no serious ID requirement for health care treatment -- whether corona virus or otherwise --
except for medical facilities which have a serious interest in getting paid from private sources.

The NYT and the press trumpet that border-related spikes
are American citizens living in Mexico --
supposedly ageing mostly white sunbird retirees,
living out retirement in inexpensive Mexico,
but returning to the USA for decent medical care.
Maybe.

But no serious analysis in the NYT about the number of citizens born to ""undocumented"" Mexican parents and returning with their ""undocumented"" parents to Mexico to grow up there --
and many have indeed grown up there --
but are -- as citizens -- entitled to medical care here.

The media tells us that there simply can't be any spikes in corona virus cases related to border crossings by ""undocumented"" persons because Trump has ""closed"" the border -- as if there are no gaps there."

If we listened to CNN, etc we would not have opened anything until July 4 early, and the fall semester k-12 and college would have been on line.  We would be in the second Great Depression had been in 5 figures in deaths of despair.  Dumb people, wear a mask, keep your distance and wash you hands!.  Remdesiver is ready now for emergencies, and AstraZeneca is in phase 3 of vaccine tests with hundreds of million of doses by year end.  Business and institutions like colleges have spend millions reconfiguring for safety.  This will work out if we get through the next 3 or 4 months with some inconvenience.  I don't love Trump, but so much of this ""vaccine will take 18 mo minimum"" and ""schools won't open"" and ""Lake of Ozarks party video"" is put out by Trump hating cable news especially and most commentators are only political and really don't understand the world wide scientific effort going into the remedy.

Just because there aren't many people around you who got infected with COVID-19, doesn't mean that you and your family might not infect you. I ask all the people to wear masks outside. Wearing a mask is uncomfortable, but it can save many lives of our community. To prevent the second wave of COVID-19, please listen to what your governors and mayors say about social distancing and wearing masks."
2020-06-14 21:38:51,"It is my belief that it Trump and the Republicans had invested $100 trillion in support of the working class who lost their jobs due to Coronavirus instead of giving that money to Big Businesses who used it not to help their out of work employees, but to buy back stock to make themselves wealthier, the high death toll and the forcing workers to go back into a deadly work environment would not have happened.   But then that is the typically way Republicans operate."

2020-06-14 21:59:12,"It's stupefying and frankly scary that our officials express the false choice fallacy of lockdown versus business-as-usual as the only response to this pandemic.  

The real way to keep your economy open during a SARS outbreak, while not killing your citizens, is to institute contact tracing programs and mandate wearing masks in public.

You are willing to allow your citizens to die because wearing a mask is uncomfortable?  Callous doesn't even begin to describe that.  We need a new word that mashes together callous and stupid at the same time.  Because, ostensibly you are opening your economy to avoid the economic damage, but killing a lot of people will also destroy your economy too.

When the epidemiology books will record this, these deaths will be considered preventable deaths because the mechanism of prevention is known.  Contact tracing programs, mass masking.

Lastly, it is nice to see in the NYTimes what I see on a daily basis here in Arizona.  No one is wearing masks and socially distancing.  That's not an exaggeration.  Everyone is going about their business like there is no highly infectious BSL-3 virus on the loose.  God help us all."

Good for Douglas County, and good for us, but we all suffer from a significant reactionary element in these non-urban counties, with too many people who howl about ""uncomfortable"" masks and think that fatalism is a viable approach to a pandemic.

If you are afraid of getting the virus, stay home.""

They thought this would protect PPE supplies needed by health workers, and maybe it did. But at what cost? 

Now we know what cost. No one believes what they say. Government and public health officials have, as a group, totally bungled this, and the public is understandably just winging it.

Unfortunately, since we are not, as a whole, very well educated in this country, many have not grasped the situation well. Being an uneducated country is proving very expensive."

I guess she has never studied the epidemiology (the science of the transmission of pathogens) of infectious diseases, nor their consequences. As far as asserting that ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt stop living‚Äù; it‚Äôs very easy to stop living if you‚Äôre dead.

This is the 21st Century, but you wouldn‚Äôt know it with the POLITICAL response to this pandemic, instead of the public health response required. Even during the Plague of London in 1665-66, when more than a quarter of the population of London perished (100,000 deaths), and they didn‚Äôt even know what caused disease or how it was transmitted, city officials instituted measures to stop its spread, such as quarantining plague houses and posting guards outside, while delivering food to the poor, dying people inside.

When leadership fails, people do not do what is smart; they do not sense the urgency or need to ""do what I say, not what I do"". 

I live in AZ. Many people display their support for Trump by being as foolish and careless about Covid-19 as he is, thereby endangering every person in the state with whom they make contact. It's an outrage to people trying to stay safe and healthy, and they get off on that outrage. One only hopes the person who doesn't get the ventilator is the person who refused to be safe."

But, once Big Daddy said ""no mas masks"" every one in AZ except some older women and some ""yuppie"" couples, took them off.

However, I will say that last Monday when I went to the supermarket I did notice more people wearing masks as the news of AZ becoming a hot spot was becoming more widely reported.

Contrary to East-of-the-Hudson newspapers, AZ in NOT moderating or modernizing.  It tries to represent itself for business and tourism purposes as a ""Republican state,""  but not a ""Trump state.""

We filled up at home on food and fuel and thought we could go up and back without coming within a dozen feet of anyone, but it was packed like Disneyland. Huge groups of people stopped to talk to other groups, everyone just as desperate to be out as I had been. We walked a short distance, turned around, and drove home. I‚Äôll deserve it if I get Covid, and with my childhood-onset autoimmune disease, I can‚Äôt anticipate a great outcome.

Prevention is generally accomplished by people not doing something they want to, or doing something they don't want to. After the physician gives the advice it is up to the patient.

Covid-19 can only be prevented by avoiding exposure. That can only be accomplished by the  patient. what is often forgotten in this is that people who are careless (or reckless) about their own exposure are exposing others, especially their immediate circle, to exposure as well.

2020-06-15 03:48:06,"'New cases' is a very poor measure and tells us almost nothing. Most cases are mild, and the number of cases is vastly undercounted.

A much better measure is 'new deaths', which is rapidly dropping around the world. Only 30 countries out of 213 reported a rise in new deaths today, and most of the increases were very small, from 1-5. the biggest rise was 28, from Columbia.

Globally new deaths were down 901 today, which is 23%. All this talk in the NYT about the virus 'raging' around the world is nonsense. It is fading almost everywhere.

In the States, Arizona reported 3 new deaths, down from 39 the day before. Arizona's 'Deaths/1M population' is 160.7.

Texas reported 7 new deaths, down from 23. D/1M is 67.7.

Florida reported 6 new deaths, down from 47. D/1M is 133.4

By comparison, New York reported 37 new deaths, down from 50. D/1M is 1,590.

Sweden reported no new deaths today, with a D/1M of 483. 

The data does not seem to support the hypothesis that strict lockdowns result in lower deaths/1M. Other factors are responsible for the wide disparities we see in D/1M between countries globally,  and between states in the US."

2020-06-15 10:53:38,"In some ways this is a useful article, but the lack by either author of any background in science or medical reporting shows badly.  This lack of understanding of the science behind epidemics causes these well-meaning reporters to buy the entire Republican Party line without real scrutiny.

First, the outlook for the US is not at all stable.  It is becoming increasingly bimodal, with some states doing quite well and others shambling quickly into exponentially-increasing disaster. The improvements in about half the states happen right now to just about cancel the worsening situation in the other half.  Over the long run, the improvements in the healthier states will slow and the worsening situation in the other states will speed up exponentially.
You see a similar situation in building fires. They can seem to smoulder and remain contained for a long time and then suddenly ""explode"" into a major fire.
As so often happens, the article completely ignores the considerable body of new knowledge from outside the US. This article makes the assumption that it is restarting the economy that causes infections to rise.  Most foreign experience shows that certain procedures are vital to success. In particular, you have to test, test, test. However, you need to choose carefully whom to test and you need to follow up with contact tracing and local lockdowns."

Some days are better than others. I zoom with friends and talk on the phone. Some days, like Mothers Day, are really, really hard. I have put off 3 trips in the past 6 months.

When people and their governments continue to ignore the science and place themselves and others at risk what obligation do health care workers have to continue to stand in front of the machine gun?

Small potatoes to Trump, who as one of his ambassador‚Äôs testified, only pays attention to the ‚Äúimportant stuff.‚Äù With the coronavirus disproportionately ravaging black communities, Trump may be calculating that spreading infection is the ultimate solution for suppressing the vote in communities of color this November.

2020-06-12 14:20:57,"At a time when millions of American citizens and fresh college grads are unemployed, it only makes sense to review and limit legal immigration, and to set up further physical and other barriers to illegal immigration.

All nations have requirements for, and limitations on, who may become citizens and how.

Most Americans welcome LEGAL immigrants, but do not want ILLEGAL immigrants. They recognize that the US cannot afford (or choose not) to support our own citizens: the poor, the ill, elderly, disabled, veterans, et al., and that they and other US taxpayers cannot possibly support the 20 million illegal immigrants already in the US, much less the hundreds of millions of foreigners who would like to come here. 

US laws allow foreigners to seek entry and citizenship. Those who do not follow these laws are in this country illegally and should be detained and deported; this is policy in other countries, too. 

The cruelty lies not in limiting legal immigration, or detaining and deporting illegal immigrants, or forcing those who wish to enter the US to undergo processing and review. 

What is cruel, unethical and probably illegal is encouraging parents to bring their children on the dangerous trek to US borders and teaching the parents how to game the system to enter the US by falsely claiming asylum, persecution, etc. Indeed, many believe bringing children on such perilous journeys constitutes child abuse.

No other nation has open borders, nor should the US."
2020-06-12 11:24:38,"Requirements not to sue if attending a Trump rally.....Isn't that just like Trump....and so very Republican.

TX, NC, SC, Arkansas, MS, UT and AZ.... Why is it not a surprise that 7 of the 9 states reported this week with an increasing number of COVID-19 hospitalizations since Memorial Day are Republican?

Over the past five months, the U.S. conducted a bit over 20 million COVID-19 tests. A couple of months ago, a group of experts convened by Harvard called for five million tests a day by now, ramping up to 20 million per day by July. 

The U.S. has no plan, manufacturing activity or capability that will get us anywhere near the ability to administer this amount of daily tests. Businesses, schools, and group living facilities that bring folks together in close living and working conditions bear the most risk from Trump's and Republican State plans to open it all up without having sufficient test kits and other necessary supplies such as masks, shields, and wipes to protect from this deadly virus.

The actions of Trump and Republicans to open all up, business as usual, without working tirelessly to gear up and supply our nation with all that we need to safely do so, is a death wish to thousands upon thousands of Americans.

These irresponsible actions will overwhelm our hospitals and immediate care facilities, and force doctors, nurses and medical staff to collapse from overwork.

Thanks for nothing, Republicans and Trump. Your inaction will be remembered November 3, 2020."

The part of me who is an American worries for the inevitable increase in Corona virus cases and deaths will cause more burden on hospitals and front line health care workers. 

The numbers are already spiking in most states after they reopened their states. 

Trump is to blame for all the unnecessary and avoidable deaths in this country.

So, I‚Äôm not surprised he‚Äôs holding a super spreader event requiring people to sign their health and his responsibility away.

2020-06-12 11:29:44,"I wonder whether the waiver will be enforceable. 

On the side of the waiver:  if you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt attend the rally. Attending the rally is optional (perhaps even stupid). If you don‚Äôt want to get COVID there, don‚Äôt go.  Attendance will be negligent in itself. 

Against the validity of the waiver:  you can only waive risks that you know about. Trump says COVID has been conquered. If you believe him, you will not know that you are taking a risk by attending the rally.  Informed consent law is on your side.  Moreover, you are being fraudulently induced to attend if lies are being told about the extent of the risk. 

Either Trump is lying when he says that he has conquered COVID-19, in which case there is a real risk, or he is not, in which case there is no risk to waive. The fact that the campaign is demanding
a waiver to attend the rally clearly indicates that the campaign thinks that there is a risk. It follows that COVID has not been conquered and that the campaign knows it. 

QED."

But they didn't have much to say about social distancing over the past few weeks, other than ""stay safe"" with tens of thousands of citizens getting together, day after day, night after night to excercize their right to protest.

And please, don't tell us that the people ignoring the social distancing guidelines which have been hammered into our heads by state and local governments for months and months, were perfectly fine because people were excercizing their right to protest, because attending a political rally is also excercizing a citizens right to support the candidate of their choice and a political movement.

If his fans didn‚Äôt realize it before, they should now finally see that he doesn‚Äôt care at all about them. They are mere fodder for his vanity and political aspirations.

That's the lie he has been trying to foist on us.  'It's over' but 'don't hold me responsible if you die'.

Nothing.

Perhaps Trump is so ignorant he does not know that sun will not shine permanently.

Maybe Trump has never visited our national parks and seen how mountains wear down.  

Trump is truly naive if he imagines he can make any law permanent.  Our Constitution has been changed.  It may need some changes now - once Trump is gone.  To make sure people in high office must have prior experience, an understanding of history, geography, science etc.  And have good character, ethics morality.

2020-06-12 15:20:25,"This article links to another one which is titled ""Why a Top Trump Aide Said ‚ÄòWe Are Desperate‚Äô for More Immigrants‚Äù.  It said, ""Proponents of restraining immigration, particularly among low-skill workers, often argue that  newcomers can supplant American workers or depress their wages, even if they help the economy as a whole. Companies have to compete less to hire when there are more workers around. But the evidence supporting that argument is limited.‚Äù

The evidence is limited because researchers know it would be political suicide to conduct research which might suggest that undereducated, low skilled immigrants supplant or depress the wages of many of our own citizens.  To get research funding and to get job tenure, professors cannot risk questioning the immigration status quo.

The status quo encompasses both illegal and legal immigration.  The vast majority of illegal immigrants have little education or  skills.  

When it comes to legal immigration, not only are immigrants permitted to bring in their spouses, minor children, and adult unmarried children, our country reserves 2/3‚Äôs of its green cards for members of their extended families.  The only criteria is kinship.  Education and skill are not considered.  Not surprisingly, we end up with a great many undereducated, poorly skilled immigrants who compete with our own citizens.

Alas, professors are afraid to conduct research on this matter."

2020-06-12 16:15:18,"More restrictive immigration policies are a step in the right direction.

The US has suffered from too much population growth during the last several decades.

That has flooded the US with low-skilled workers.  That means that we have ore unskilled workers than we need.  That will drive up unemployment in the aftermath of COVID-19.

Population growth is an even more serious problem in the third world.  But that problem should be addressed by helping third world countries cut birth rates to sustainable levels.  For example, the population of Guatemala has quadrupled since 1960.

Additional immigration to the US will make it difficult for us to afford universal health care and provide resources for America's own poor.

We should cut illegal immigration to zero and limit legal immigration.  That should be coupled with direct aid to Latin American countries that can address their problems with poverty."
2020-06-12 16:55:59,"The resurgence of contagion with the reopening process is occurring. It is time for Governors and Mayors to reconsider the speed of reopening in their communities. Actually it is overtime. If they reverse course and slow down or even shutdown, they need to understand that it will take weeks for contagion rates to plateau and further weeks for it to return to pre-reopening levels.
The most at risk areas states appear to be California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, North and South Carolina, and several others. Only a few states have followed the CDC guidelines for reopening probably because the President has gone silent on the issue.
Governor DeSantis of Florida is in denial. Even though new cases in Florida have set records in the last few days and ICU's are rapidly filling up, he says that there is no widespread problem. He maintains it is confined to LTC facilities and agriculture,(a code word no doubt for immigrant workers).

Also, a pledge to participate fully in NATO, the WHO, the UN, the Paris Climate Convention, the Iran peace accord, etc.  A plan to immediately coordinate scientific research and response regarding the coronavirus with other nations.  A reinstatement of Justice Department civil rights investigations and consent decrees with problem police departments.

The country cannot employ or adequately care for its own citizens, the last thing it should do is permit more immigration.  It is past time to deport those who are already illegally present; the taxpayers effectively subsidize the individuals and businesses who employ illegal immigrants without paying necessary taxes.  The taxpayers are further burdened with the cost of providing education, medical care, food and other services to them and their children.  Visit an emergency room, a school, or a social services center to get a sense of the enormous expense and inefficiency of our vast shadow economy.  The harmful effects of illegal immigration on lower skilled workers, in general, and the black community, in particular, have been largely overlooked in the current and long overdue protests.  Those who self-righteously promote the rights of illegal immigrants perversely disregard the needs of struggling Americans, for whom government and society, must be the first priority."

As usual, he seeks to sacrifice others for his own warped sense of glory. It will be interesting to see if he allows mask wearing during the rally, particularly for the vetted cheerleaders standing behind him on camera.

Only a complete embrace of the powers of national government would succeed in eradicating this threat nationally so that we actually can return to a real normal.

2020-06-12 18:53:40,"I think that you are using the wrong metric here. What we really care about is the number of serious cases - specifically hospitalizations and not the number of positive tests. That's because of several factors. First, the more tests the greater the number of positives. Second, with such a small (5 percent) of positive results, false positives at (say) 2 percent mean that the number of actual positives is 40 percent lower than reported. Finally, it doesn't matter if 1 million people test positive if they do not have symptoms and are not spreading it to the vulnerable populations. We now know that older people and particularly older people with underlying serious health problems are the ones getting really sick, not the general population. So, please focus on hospitalizations and the PERCENT of positive tests rather than taking the easy way out by reporting the bogus ""Daily Cases"" numbers.  Please show me where I'm wrong here as it really bothers me to see these reports over and over again."

Because we will have to live with this disease; I have my doubts that a vaccine, should one arrive, will do a whole lot of good.  Kids need to go to school.  Young adults need to go to college.  We can ban large events but the rest must go on.  The government response is beyond disappointing; it is an utter failure that has simultaneously cost lives and wrecked the economy."
2020-06-12 18:59:51,"In those few states that have been successful in muting the COVID contagion rate by social distancing and shutdown, the curves after the peak all approach zero new cases and deaths in an asymptotic manner.
Usually, though not always this can be attributed to a small driving force, in this case reduced contagion. That driving force is measured by the Ro (R-naught) which has recently become part of common parlance. It is the number of people infected by each infected person. A number greater than 1.0 indicates increased spreading and less than 1.0 indicates decreased.
At the end of the day, social distancing etc. depends on human behavior and compliance. We are apparently not too good at this and hopefully will improve with time. All indications, given the shape of the descending curves in places like NY and NJ suggest that Ro's for these states are very close to 1.0. Governors Murphy and Cuomo are correct in saying we need to be vigilant, watch the early indicators and slow down or reverse opening if need be.

And, yet, conservative interests in Texas sued the state to stop people from voting by mail due to the pandemic. The case went to the Texas Supreme Court, and no surprise, the decision to allow mail-in voting was overturned because of some well-crafted language stating that ""fear or lack of immunity to the virus"" is not significant reason to vote by mail. 

Republicans would rather see people die than lose their stranglehold in government. I guess their voting base is mostly older people over the age of 65 who qualify to vote by mail. Plus, as we've seen, wealthy white polling places are numerous and easy to access versus polling sites in poor and non-white areas, which have been closed and/or moved to remote locations."

Just as mask wearing has become politicized, so have our decisions about what we choose to risk our lives for.
For me, almost total isolation is in order and voting by mail is a hoped for option.  But I respect the global outcry to the killing of George Floyd and see it as a sign of hope for a world that sure needs one."
2020-06-12 19:05:17,"The Republican governors who assert the increase in cases is due to an increase in testing -- as though that means no problem -- are making a specious argument. Based on their own premise, they are claiming that they have had more cases than reported all along. How is that a good thing? They also govern in states where compliance with distancing and mask wearing is lower, so the widespread numbers of cases (detected or not) means the virus will spread to more and more residents. How is that a good thing?

It would be valuable to see more reporting on hospitalizations and the age demographics of those hospitalized. Most journalists report deaths and note that most are elderly. There is a hidden effect of the virus, which is hospitalizations, of which 20% are age 20-44 and 18% are age 45-54 according to Johns Hopkins. Being ill enough to be hospitalized with an infectious disease is not a good thing. The NY Times yesterday reported on the double lung transplant for a previously healthy woman in her 20s.  Awareness of the risk of hospitalization might motivate some of the self-centered magical thinkers rethink behaviors."

Those workers are wearing masks to protect THEMSELVES.  So if you want to protect yourself, follow the example of Ebola workers (surely trustworthy models) and wear a mask.  

Don't expect me to go along with your irrational nonsense.  If you can't think for yourself, you're beyond help.

What's more, illegal immigrants lack basic rights and protections. It is quite simply the wrong way to handle immigration.

As to those seeking asylum, if they were merely fleeing persecution they would stop in Mexico. Their real goal is to come to the United States for economic opportunity, and the vast majority of asylum cases are rejected by the courts.

OK, let me understand this correctly. Had we had State lockdowns for another month or so, the virus would be practically nonexistent because transmissions would be practically nonexistent.

But no. Conservatives wailed loud and long about their freedoms being curtailed, so here in a couple of weeks or a month, we get to reset the clock back to the beginning.

Meanwhile state public health experts and the leading hospital group, Banner Health. continue to warn him that's not true, they're running out of emergency space and ventilators.

Ducey's response?  Schedule a full-on Trump campaign rally with no social spacing.  Attendees will be asked to sign a waiver of liability.  Open schools state-wide on time and assure parents their children will be fine, not to worry.

This is the leadership we're getting in Arizona during the most serious public health crisis in 100 years.  Mirrored in every single red state.  They're willing to let thousands die, including children, in their criminally negligent efforts to get the worst president in history re-elected."

That's a lie. I live in Texas and the reason the cases are going up is we reopened too soon. People aren't getting tested. They have to work anyway, so they don't care about testing. The only people taking tests are people who are very sick and suspected of carrying the virus already.

A few weeks later however the 2nd wave hit with a vengeance killing tens of millions."

It's extremely clear that misguidance and gray-area political language (at the risk of liability) is leading most people here to believe we don't have all that much to be worried about. In my conversations with co-workers, there seems to be a lack of belief about the virus because they have not been impacted by it directly. 

That said, I find myself teetering between rage, grief, and apathy at the lack of compassion for fellow neighbors. The veil of blissful ignorance will be lifted and it will be too late for some."
2020-06-12 19:28:15,"I very much appreciate the NYT comprehensive converage

It would be good to get some views/information on-how to interpret an increase in the number of cases, including a discussion of the effect of an increase on the R-naught contagion factor that public health experts talk about

Many state officials (e.g., Gov Abbott of Texas)  say increased cases it is just because of increased testing and as long as the positive rate stays below x (10?) percent and the hospital system is not stressed, the increase in cases is not a concern.  

However, Governor Cuomo says that the results of the 50,000 tests NYS performs daily are key to understanding whether the virus remains under control.  He also points to number of hospitalizations s a key indicator.  

Could use your help in evaluating these statements."
2020-06-12 19:29:53,"I buy the argument that more testing undoubtedly   leads to more detection and known cases.  If there had been a greater focus on testing earlier (took this virus seriously), we wouldn't be having this discussion.  This Administration has clearly failed the American people."

This is more a reflection of people getting cabin fever rather than any scientific evidence that it's safe to go out.  

To fully control virus from spreading we need a top-to-down plan and countrywide three week lockdown -- like New Zealand or Iceland. Unfortunately, we have not shown the ability to do that and will continue to suffer and wait until there is a vaccine."

More cases, you say. OK, does that mean more people are getting sick? And if so, are they getting seriously sick? Are they dying?

This life and my money are staying home for now. 

My heart goes out to those who feel that they must go out to work and have no choice. Call or email your Congressional representatives to tell them to subsidize your income the way they augment corporate needs. Politically you have some leverage right now because they don't want to look bad.

The total lack of leadership in this country has only resulted in the continued spread of Covid-19 and the case numbers increase.

 I'm just as tired, fidgety, somewhat down and restless to resume normal life once again as the next person. 

But, I know that the only way we can have a semblance of living normally again is if we wait out our fears and desires. WE MUST STAY AWAY FROM OTHERS RIGHT NOW so that the safety we will create turns into control of and final abatement of this pandemic.

The virus is still here and will continue to be here for some time; this is the new normal everyone is talking about.

The hospitalization rates are up some but remain within capacity. If you keep looking at the 2,000,000 cases number your not seeing whats going on. The vast majority of those cases have resolved, a significantly higher number of people probly had the virus already without a test. We arenmoving from crisis to management. Good news."
2020-06-12 19:59:58,"Reporting on high case numbers is misleading, if not willfully dishonest. The dearth of testing during the initial outbreak and peak means that we have no good record of where the high point was, and we are *still* incredibly limited by testing resources. The story here is just as likely to be Florida and Texas administering more tests than they have before, but the headline is inflammatorily written to suggest a spike in true infections. The virus is something for many to be afraid of, but this framing is pure unwarranted fear mongering. 

The only two indicators that really matter are hospital admissions and deaths (per capita). They lag real infections by 1-2 weeks, but they're the only metrics that are not confounded by testing accuracy or infrastructure, and ultimately are the outcomes that we really care about. How are those numbers doing? Why aren't they the headline metrics?"
2020-06-12 20:14:18,"One lesson regarding our precautions, repeatedly heard, is that countless lives could have been saved if we had taken action sooner.  But that lesson is called into question based on what is now happening in Texas and Florida.  Both states got an early jump on precautions which were enacted largely because of early peaking in the northeast.  And for months, it seemed to work.  But after months of precautions and low virus totals, the willingness to sacrifice has waned and now the problem is peaking.  

Many say you must show maximum vigilance from onset until we have a vaccine.  But we are dealing with real people who do not live textbook lives.  And so the gold standard isn't social distancing for a year or two.  It is to take precautions when they are most necessary and to ease up, though as little as possible, when the will power of the public wanes.  

If your plan is to start early and continue indefinitely, your plan will fail.  Precautions don't work if the people are not willing to comply with them.  Florida and Texas are hoping that infections soon peak.  That's what New York and New Jersey did earlier.   Hoping is a part of any successful strategy."

We need to see total number of tests, tests per capita, positive test rate, hospital bed utilization rate, ICU availability.

Multiple studies have shown that if we all wear face masks and social distance, we can reduce the spread by 85%.  I see mostly very good practices from restaurants, grocery stores and professional offices.  The problem is with the customers who don't care.  Nearly all of them are Trumpers."

There are a lot of neonazis here, as well as other violent groups.  The board is made up mostly of very hard right Republicans.  I have been shouted at for being a librarian, someone who ""takes advantage of others.""  School campuses are closing when we need more space for children to distance safely.  I am fortunate to be able to stay home, others can't and I am a concerned mask wearer.  It's too bad we can't put politics and hate aside to save lives.

Anyone who thinks that this virus is a hoax or is done is buying into a fairytale, it has been here, it has destroyed lives, it has destroyed economies, and until a more educated, health-conscious mind tells us otherwise it is here to stay, it wants to be our friend and silent enemy. Is the world economy better now that states, provinces are reopening, not really, you can never regain your losses no matter how much governments try to help, however, if you are wealthy you can certainly wait out Wall Street, the Dow, The TSX.

An infection is included in these reported numbers only when a test confirms the infection.  Therefore, if you substantially increase the amount of testing (as has occurred), you would get substantially more detection of infections even if there was no increase in the number of infections.

The Times would be providing less deceptively if it would focus on the number of hospitalizations from the virus.  Hospitalizations is the best indicator, even better than the number of deaths since the number of deaths could fall without infection rate falling if the medical people could actually find treatments that were effective."

If anything should demonstrate to Trumps base that everyone is  dispensable to Trump, even his supporters, surely this should.

Deliberately organising these rallies is highly irresponsible as it will spread COVID-19, to other people in the community. It shows disrespect to  the vast number of US citizens who have died from the virus and are likely to die because of Trumps rallies which are designed to massage the ego of a failing President."
2020-06-12 20:46:23,"Reporting case numbers is what newspapers do. 
Establishing smart testing protocols in communities is what public health departments should do. (Don't bother me with briefings if you have not done anything worth reporting.)

What's a smart testing plan? How about sampling communities to estimate how much virus is out there. For all those tested, collect basic data as age, gender, ethnicity, symptoms if any. Maintain contact with all  those testing positive to help with their 14 day quarantine, contact trace for each positive case. If we have these protocols in place (as have all other countries that are controlling this virus) then the pandemic ends, without benefit of effect medications or vaccines. Because we don't have a systematic way to identify those who really need to quarantine for those 14 days, all of us need to socially distance until further notice. How stupid is that? 

How bad is it? Bad enough you have to sign a pledge not to sue Trump if you get sick at his rallies; he will not be responsible for your illness or death. But we knew that already, didn't we.

Has anybody asked DeSantis or Abbot or Trump or Hannity how many dead people would be too many to justify a person‚Äôs right to get a tattoo and go to a bar? Are they too cowardly to directly answer such a direct question?

I know that people who are unemployed are hurting, not because they have no job, but because they have no income. In a country that just gave $2 trillion in tax cuts to rich people, why can‚Äôt we simply pay the salaries of people unemployed because it is not safe to go to work? At twenty million unemployed, $2 trillion would work out to $100K per person. Easily enough to pay most bills for most folks for a year or two. And there are YouTube videos on how to do a self tattoo."

He wasn't talking that way when he was insisting New Yorkers coming to Florida HAD TO quarantine themselves (in March). Now the shoe is on the other foot and he thinks the coronavirus is nothing much to worry about.

Maybe that's what Trump is telling him to think."

Well that‚Äôs where we are. Our CDC, trembling in fear of Trump, offers mealy mouthed suggestions while the epidemic gets its second wind. States in our northeast were nearly devastated but have mostly regained the upper hand. Their falling numbers continue to overshadow the gradual expansion of the epidemic in other regions. 

Trump and fellow travelers in statehouses have minimized the epidemic, mocked public health measures, and proceeded to reopen as though the disease has been vanquished.

Florida is likely the same way, same kind of attitude.  I think it is all part of the denial that covid is dangerous, and one thing tells me it isn't just testing, it is hospital admissions.

NYT has a cumulative case count for my county but no way to see the trend with time. How is one to make an informed judgement to guide ones own choices?

Generally, a waiver must be intelligent and knowing, and courts will examine the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the ostensible waiver.  See, e.g., Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938).  Moreover, if someone waives his or her rights to bring a civil action, that will not waive the rights of that person's spouse, children, relatives or friends who are later infected by the sucker who attended the MAGA rally.

The next steps I could see are communities taking action to isolate the elderly and those with compromised immune systems since by and large they are the ones dying from Covid. For the rest of us we aren't going to be isolating any longer, humans need other humans. That's why in prison one of the worst punishments that can be doled out is solitary confinement.

2020-06-12 20:51:40,"(This is with regards to the article about Texas reporting record daily highs in new virus infections.)

The reason for the lockdowns, and the real concern about the coronavirus is exponential growth of new cases that would overwhelm the healthcare system.  While it‚Äôs true that Texas has had some recent highs in new daily cases, the article failed to mention some additional information that would put things into a more balanced perspective. 

Texas has about 30 million people. Is a small incremental, not exponential, increase from about 1,500 to 2,000 new cases per day over the last two week period anything to worry about? Two thousand new cases per day means the chances of an individual in Texas becoming infected is about one in fifteen thousand each day.  Does that warrant an alarmist headline? The article also failed to mention that  the number of statewide deaths has been steadily decreasing over the last month and is currently down to around twenty five deaths per day. 

The real risk is that the coronavirus will return in the fall with a vengeance. But the press has cried WOLF! so many times that when the wolf really comes, no-one is going to listen.  That‚Äôs also, by the way, probably why very few people seem to be wearing masks. They don‚Äôt trust the alarmist press anymore and have taken matters into their own hands."
2020-06-12 21:08:07,"It's interesting how the real facts show that US COVID cases and deaths peaked Apr 10-May 10, and have been marching downward (including this week).  Yet, the media is desperately trying to falsely claim that COVID dangers are increasing.  Since I work with data constantly, I recognize that this is exactly how I would go about trying to sell a product using false or irrelevant statistics.  For example, say Detroit's crime rate is rising more slowly than Beverly Hills CA.  Does this mean Beverly Hills has a higher crime rate than Detroit?  Most people would be confused by such tricks and believe so."

Please also report on a) the number of tests administered in these states, and how the number of tests relates to the number of newly found positive cases, and b) the percentage of all people tested in a state that test positive, and how that percentage has developed over the past few weeks.

Unfortunately, it appears the folks in Texas, California, and Florida + the next generation's culture didn't learn much from observing NY state, New Jersey, Washington state, Massachusetts and several other early infection locations and observed their management towards the COVID virus distribution.
Wear masks, wash one's hands often, and self-isolate oneself from others, so the rate of infection drops dramatically. Increase the likelihood one will live and not die!

Conversely, ignore  CDC's advice, behave ""normally"" = irresponsible pandemic behavior patterns,  and imitate POTUS Trumpster's behavior = disaster = infection rate and casualty rate records record growth.

2020-06-12 22:35:02,"As COVID-19 infections spike and officials in Florida and here in Texas forge ahead, expanded testing is the explanation being pointed to as a cause not to be concerned about. 

The lack of early and available testing is creating a blurry picture that renders the indexing of positive tests to fatalities  be a less relevant risk factor.

Expanded testing is now picking up people who otherwise may have contracted COVID-19 and then lived with and through it.  By expanding the denominator, testing may not have the same implications as seen in the NY Tri-State and other large metropolitan areas.

While any large increase in infection raises risk of death, increasing the test population as the denominator without having an alternative and more reliable index to fatalities will obscure the need to react.

The information on the Texas Department of Health Services is varied and doesn't pull all of this together with a mix of county information and Trauma Service Areas (TSA)  for reporting from hospitals

This lack of consistent reliable data continues to hamper the ability for us to separate public health from the politics.

I'd like the Times or other news outlets to offer help here given those representing us in the state houses may be more concerned about partisan politics than the health of their citizens.

We crushed it by everyone getting it. Somehow I don't think that was the plan. To the extent you think NY had a much higher mortality rate than CDC guidance indicates we were incompetent somewhere along the way in treatment. I prefer the profound incompetence in the area of governmental policy. Then 48% got covid, which isn't too far off 20-25% NYC had antibodies based upon inaccurate tests in late April/early May.

As you see, even Trump has not use this as an argument against media and democrats, so he  really supports exactly the same, to open totally the country and go ahead into labour whatever are the motivations behind and the consequences. Now, lots of people seem almost ridiculous talking about safety, health, social distancing, tests, and all the epidemiological stuff when a few days ago they were in complete silence, with the mind divided between the bad thing and the worst. They have not understood yet than a coherent action is always needed in order to do the right action. You cannot go against violence with violence, nor you can go against brutality with any respect for human life, as protersters went amid a pandemia. It's difficult to admit but it is so.

Florida, as well as my state, AZ, opened by using the positivity rate, and as metrics go. this would not be a bad one except that they had recently gone from testing only a few who were very ill and seeking medical care to suddenly testing a lot of people who were not seeking care

In this circumstance, one would automatically expect a drop in the politivity rate since those seeking care would have a higher rate of positive tests

Thus, this was a phony metric to use under these circumstances and did not reflect that the states were actually meeting any of the recommended guidleines for reopening.

There is no real evidence we were seeing any decline in AZ.

So, if you add in the no mask requirement, it was a disaster waiting to happen

A huge spike in the number hospitalized for covid-19 began right after Memorial Day, in my state of Arizona

I'm sure the protests contributed some, but here in AZ where daily temps often spiked over 110 degrees, the protests were not as large in size compared to other places

In contrast, as soon as restrictions eased, the local news was filled with images of people partying at restaurant bars and rivers and lakes, and not engaging in social distancing or wearing masks. Most people are not even wearing masks to do daily shopping

There have been thousands on a daily basis playing roulette with covid-19 compared to the number of people who were protesting"
2020-06-12 23:34:20,"As a photographer, I've been documenting the ongoing effects of pandemic and now protest in the life of my city. 
In Seattle, we've gone from bleak, deserted streets, following Gov. Insley's March 23 order restricting all but essential business, to streets filled with throngs of protesters over the past two weeks. 
I have clear photographic evidence that the vast majority of protesters are wearing masks. Yesterday, taking photos of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), I lowered my own mask to identify myself to an acquaintance I hadn't seen for several months. Almost instantly, I was admonished by protesters for doing so. 
For those who offer jaded criticism of protesters taking risks, understand this: they are not doing so lightly. They are certainly not taunting and flaunting - rather, this is a deeply heartfelt attempt to make fundamental changes to a society founded on the structures of slavery and inequality.
Interestingly, in none of my photos - not one out of hundreds - are the police or the national guard wearing masks."

Our nation does not need another shut down.  As a matter of fact, NOW would be a good time to start.

From environmental issues, health, bad urban planning, congestion, economic inequality, personal finance, social isolation; you name it; biking can help it!

The flip side of biking being relatively inexpensive (the cost of a decent bike is less than the advertising budget of a new car) is that no big corporation can extract a huge profit from it. Therefore there is no serious money to lobby or advertise for biking.  Unfortunately, in societies where making money is the highest priority, that relegates biking to a marginal mean of transportation."
2020-06-12 19:50:05,"Reporting from San Francisco. Despite SF being one of the nicest climates for cycling, never freezing, rarely hot, usually 50-60 degrees F, the preoccupation of the motor mad lazy people has prevented cycling from truly blossoming here. With the advent of  Uber/Lyft illegal taxis, cycling growth leveled out. Now, during Covid, cycling is again more popular, with bike shops recording record sales and service work. Nonetheless, the city politicians and departments have struggled to allow more roadway to be allocated to human powered movement like walking, skating, kick scooters, cycling etc. Golden Gate Park, one of the largest parks in the city has a small section of one street, JFK, closed to auto traffic. It took months for the city to allow it, in face of resistance from the head of Public Health! The rest of the park has unrestricted auto access. The same is true for the other major park, McClaren Park, where one street was belatedly closed to auto traffic. A number of streets have auto traffic discouraging barriers, but the roll out has been dismally slow. This only happened weeks after Oakland declared that it would restrict traffic on 74 miles of it's streets! Despite the need for people to have a  healthy alternative to public transit, city leadership has had difficulty reducing the primacy of the car in city street priorities. This difficulty is, in my opinion, based on  laziness, both physical, cultural, and intellectual."

To think that many cities, worldwide, might start to reimagine their public transportation in a way that tilts more heavily towards bicycles is exciting.  More healthy, happy people.

Both are terrifying, and I use an electric bike to give myself a fighting chance against the cars. There are signs on both instructing cars to ""share the road"" with bicyclists, but we all know who really has preference. 

Even a few reflective bollards between me and the cars would go a long way toward making the journey feel safer, and would encourage other less daring bicyclists to join in someday."

Yes, and if the priority is ""the protest"" then police officers would do well to understand that ""the protesters"" are upset about the ""above the law"" attitude so many police officers exude.

Wearing the mask isn't just a fashion statement, it sends the message to protesters that they care about them, that they (the police) are there to protect them and keep the peace, and the police should understand that peace is most likely to happen when police and government and the courts act like they are in service to the public...and not the other way round."

Collateral damage from this will be all the macho police officers who followed his example, became infected with SARS-CoV-2, and will die from COVID-19 as a result.  Although I don't agree with them politically, they are clearly not the sharpest knives in the drawer and need to be educated about the virus.

If Haru Sushi restaurants can obtain customized masks, the NYPD certainly can.  It is understandable that in a pursuit it may be difficult to wear a mask as there is no question it does make it harder to breath.  
There is no doubt that that there needs to be police reform but defunding the police department will only result in more problems.  The criminal justice system also needs reform.  The reforms that recently went into effect need to revisited because they were not the answer.  Now repeat offenders are back on the street immediately after committing a crime.  Do we want the Wild Wild West?"
2020-06-11 15:02:54,"This shouldn't be so hard to fix.
A police uniform already consists of several mandatory components -- cap, badge, shoes, etc. Just decree that during the pandemic, a mask is a required part of the uniform."
2020-06-11 15:03:10,"Here in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, officers from the local precinct have NEVER worn masks. Even during the worst period of the pandemic. This is not just specific to the protests."
2020-06-11 15:03:37,"I live overlooking the police assembly point near the Brooklyn Bridge and pass them several times a day. At first, a few officers wore masks- mostly women, but even this has stopped. Now none of them wear masks except occasionally when walking through Cadman Plaza Park where there are often families with young kids. I have seen them trade phones, water bottles and even some eating off the same plastic plate while leaning on a vehicle. Yesterday, they were loading up vans, with 8 sweaty people all crammed in together- no masks visible. It was terrible that so many PD personnel got the virus early on, but now it‚Äôs difficult to respect the lack of consideration that cops have for their own families, neighbors and fellow citizens. It‚Äôs middle school level peer group pressure, that demonstrates a lack of discipline and needs to be dealt with on a  city, state and department level basis. Like with the treatment of demonstrators and people of color, is it bad apples or a rotten barrel?"
2020-06-11 15:07:29,"We can ask this same question of a very large number of our fellow citizens, who either don't understand, don't care, or think it's more important to make some kind of statement by not wearing a mask.

2020-06-11 15:10:08,"Unless one is using an N95 mask meant to filter out viruses, the masks are to protect other people, not the wearer.

It's no surprise that the police wouldn't care about whether they infect the citizenry but it also says something that they don't care about their fellow officers either."
2020-06-11 15:13:15,"My impression is that a lot of public sector and union employees are politically conservative/Republican, despite Republican attempts to eviscerate public sectors and unions. Certainly I've seen this in my own family. Additionally, these officers receive an incredible amount of tax-payer funded sick leave, so their concern about getting sick is significantly less than someone working at Walmart."
2020-06-11 15:17:39,"The city and the state need to finally crush the PBA and other police unions.  50-A is a start, but if all other unions can be forced to accommodate and change, the police need to realize they are next.

Make police jobs be fire/hire at-will positions, and the employees (I say ""employees of the state"" not ""members of the union"" as they see themselves) will start to behave better.

Remember, the police work FOR US, not for their unions as they would have us believe."
2020-06-11 15:18:46,"Leadership starts at the top of ANY organization and should be a reflection of the character of our leaders. Accountability, as a price for freedom, should be an expectation of ANY of our  institutions and citizenry. Respect for the whole should at least be as important - I might argue more important - than the focus on self. Take a look around folks - ALL 3 of these tenets are MIA in today's America. With many (and I might say most) of our ""leaders"". Now, is it any wonder why the police - as well as other ""tribe members"" - aren't wearing masks and view the coronavirus more so as a ""political"" issue (infringement on freedoms) as opposed to a ""medical"" (science) issue? America is a living paradox - balancing personal freedom with collective responsibility . . . . and not always doing it well."
2020-06-11 15:23:10,Wearing of a mask has become a political statement.  If you don‚Äôt wear a mask you support trump and the status quo.  If you do wear a mask you support political change and the removal of trump.
2020-06-11 15:23:24,"""The official New York Police Department policy is that officers should wear masks when interacting with the public.""

And airlines recently mandated the requirement that everyone onboard a plane wear a mask and yet flight attendants said they have been told not to confront passengers who opt to not follow them.

So why such outrage against the police for not wearing a face mask but not the airlines?  Or the president or his staff or others in his administration?

This picking and choosing of who to blame for the wearing  or not wearing of face masks is getting exhausting.  

Very, very few people I encountered on a couple recent trips to Wisconsin wore face masks but boy did my husband and I get the dirty looks like we were botched senior citizen bank robbers.

Frankly, I would think the entire clear plastic face shield many police officers wear is an excellent protective option.

Honestly, the wearing of face masks/protective shields has been proven to slow down the spread of this virus.  Why ANYONE would choose to not wear face protection is a mystery to me.  We face a plethora of hazards every day.  Why add one more if it can be prevented or reduced?"
2020-06-11 15:23:50,"As a registered nurse who works in a major hospital in Manhattan I might be able to offer some insight.  I've  see police officers speaking in huddles outside of Grand Central Terminal and outside my building at the deli in close proximity of each other.  They are not wearing masks and it is quite troubling.  I've seen patients horrifyingly ill and an entire hospital turned into an infectious disease ward.  Medical professionals are still working through the trauma of what we've seen.  I've survived contracting the illness and caring for the most impacted victims.  Even though its possible that I am now immune, I still wear a mask all day at work and when I'm outside my home.  We don't know anything for sure and I wouldn't want to put others at risk.  There's plenty of data to suggest that wearing masks helps protect other people.  Medical professionals who find masks to be uncomfortable have found all sorts of ways to make it work for them.  I've seen all sorts of head coverings equipped with buttons to place the mask straps to avoid pressure on ears.   I take breaks from wearing my mask when I start to overheat, but I make sure I'm 6 ft away from people.   If health professionals can find creative solutions, why can't the police?  Should nurses be hired to educate them?"
2020-06-11 15:24:28,"Face masks are uncomfortable. I have four different styles, ranging from homemade to one I bought online from a high-end suit tailor that cost over $20.  I hate wearing any of them, so given the choice, I'll stay home rather than venture out wearing an uncomfortable mask -- though when I do go out I wear one because it's the right thing to do.

Harry Truman said, ""A pessimist is someone who makes difficulties of his opportunities, and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties.""

Let's see some old fashioned American ingenuity -- someone, please invent a mask we will WANT to wear, and this won't be an issue."

The so called law and order President has made not wearing a mask a symbol of what he stands for, namely clear the streets and support of the police.  Since demonstrators wear masks the police are far more to avoid wearing a mask, because of the identity issue.  Of course it makes no sense.  But neither does so much in politics."
2020-06-11 15:27:50,The punishment for not wearing masks has to be a law that is enforced.  But WHO is going to enforce it upon the police?  Policemen stick together and this comes from the very TOP.  Any one who tries to change this is ostracized from the group.  Any changes have to come from the TOP.  (I worked for a police department and saw this firsthand).  Police departments love to hire recruits who have former military backgrounds.

Although they allow for air to pass under the shield, they protect the eyes, unlike masks. Of course best would be mask plus face shield, but we shouldn't be as alarmed as the mask messaging would suggest. And BTW, wearing a mask or face shield DOES offer some protection to the wearer, in addition to others, by impeding some respiratory droplets."

2020-06-11 14:55:08,I am across the street from the Brooklyn bridge every day. What I read is inaccurate. Not a single officer is wearing a mask up and down Tillary street. There are usually between 30 and 40 all together. The few who have masks are just letting them hang.
2020-06-11 14:59:36,"If they defy orders, they should be reprimanded.  

Just a wild guess here: many of the same cops who are opposed to masks are more likely to be the same cops who rough up protesters?  Take them off the streets for a week or two and let them cool off and think things through more clearly."
2020-06-11 15:34:16,"I think it is misguided to single out cops as a group for not wearing masks.  In the interest of harm reduction, we need to examine why segments of the population, regardless of occupation, do not wear masks.  I'd estimate that 20% of the people I see in Brooklyn and Manhattan are not wearing masks (or are not wearing them properly).  I would speculate a few reasons:
--a misunderstanding of the rationale for mask-wearing, ie protecting oneself as well as others
--a feeling of invulnerability (I'm young, I'm in good shape, I have no coexisting medical problems, therefore, I'm at low risk)
--a political statement (further explanation not needed)
--machismo
In addition, I see people without masks smoking, drinking coffee, eating or talking on their cellphones as they move through the streets.  These activities are not justification for removing or not wearing masks.

Public health officials have to examine the reasons why people don't mask and tailor messages to those reasons, not to specific occupations.  As we return to some semblance of normalcy, all it takes is a single super spreader to bring about a spike in cases."
2020-06-11 14:32:57,The Mayor is not in control of his Police force.  They are endangering the public by not wearing masks and giving the impression they are following the example of Trump which is totally ignorant.

a) the time to wear a mask is always.  hasn't the good doctor heard about asymptomatic transmission?  

b) it does NOT give the wearer a false sense of security that they do not have to wash their hands or cover their mouths when the cough or sneeze.  If a person does think that then they are baseline stupid which makes a mask even more important.


Dr. Oxiris Barbot, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, addressed the issue.

from the article:

‚ÄúThe time to use a mask is when someone is symptomatic, when they‚Äôre coughing, when they‚Äôre sneezing, and it‚Äôs to ensure that that individual doesn‚Äôt contaminate other folks,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt gives people who are asymptomatic a false sense of security that if they wear this mask, they don‚Äôt have to wash their hands, they don‚Äôt have to cover their mouths and their noses when they cough or their sneeze.‚Äù"

2020-06-11 15:36:28,"I wonder how many news people remember the extreme reluctance of (Male),cops to wear longer hair or mustaches in the early 1970's?
 The NYC police department has always been reluctant to allow change  in the 60's, which  seemed to be both an attack on
their manhood and an attack on the entire set of standards for behavior of some men then  believed  ""normal"".
  A few cops working undercover  grew their hair and left it long,  until the style became something of a point of disagreement. This  also a occurred between sports figures and their employers, and many other men  in public life, until time and change , the preferences of many wives and girl friends, made  the entire set of dress codes and ""grooming standards"" for men, seem absurd. 
 But the refusal to wear masks in public, when on duty, however, seems a way to spit in the eye of  politicians and protesters who  demand police check their politics when they put on the uniform. 
One might  wonder how long police will expose themselves and families  to medical risk, merely to make a political statement and maintain solidarity with other police."
2020-06-11 15:37:08,"The CDC has told us now for months that the most powerful weapon we have to combat Covid 19 is social distancing not masks.  So, my question is:

WHY HAS THE MEDIA GIVEN A PASS TO ALL THE PROTESTERS WHO DID NOT SOCIAL DISTANCE?

The federal epidemiologist now predict that somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 new cases of Covid 19 will be generated solely due to the protestors.  This translates into between 2,000 and 3,000 needless deaths."

At one facility, workers refused to wear protective masks. I discussed this situation with an OSHA enforcement  official.  He said that wearing masks should be a condition of employment, if engineering controls weren‚Äôt feasible. 

That was to protect worker health. With the coronavirus, it‚Äôs two ways. Protecting the public is the other. 

Given the seriousness of the pandemic, police officers need to wear masks as a condition of employment when isolation distances cannot be maintained."
2020-06-11 15:38:17,Some epidemiologists have asserted that there is little data proving that non-respirator (N95) masks provide meaningful protection against transmission. Perhaps the police have read those articles (or not).  The shields do create a Darth Vader look...not very friendly to say the least.
2020-06-11 15:38:24,"The twisted truth of cops, firemen, and correctional officers at public prisons is that they are largely conservative and vote for republicans who are anti-union.   Yet they receive  generous pension plans at 80-90 percent of their income, while making middle class to upper middle class incomes while employed-- all with public money.  My brother in law is a CO at a prison and we be able to retire at 50 with 90 percent of his income including benefits-- public money. He makes six figures.  Law enforcement is probably the most stable and well paying job in America-- cops don't get fired and they know this.   

They know that police and firemen in our country are untouchable in terms of public perception-- they are ""our heroes"" so neither party dare cuts their budgets or retirement, so their politics don't match their economic interests.  

In France, when Macron implemented the pension cuts across the board, with the exception of police, you actually saw firemen in the street protesting and clashing with the police since their pensions were going to be slashed.

Put some pressure on these cop's income and we'll see change.  At the same time, repubs are surely going to make this a political issue.  If this blows over by November, expect zero change."
2020-06-11 15:43:00,"Refusal by the NYPD officers to wear masks is an act of aggression.

As Governor Cuomo personally, and the State's PSA campaign continues to emphasis -- one wears a mask to protect others -- not to protect oneself!

I wear a mask to protect you.  You wear a mask to protect me.

By refusing to wear masks these cops are essentially saying that they will gladly infect a protestor should they themselves be ""positive"" for Covid.

If the NYPD ""brass"" had any decency it would make mask wearing part of the uniform such that any on-duty police officer would be citable for being ""out of uniform"" if he/she is not wearing a mask."

For those who actually would do so, they don't want to come up against this peer pressure. The way to counteract this is to overcome group mentality: model mask wearing behavior from the top, and significant penalties for any officer not wearing a mask.

It is so disrespectful to the neighborhood they are completely disrupting. The language is just god awful, when I walk by with my kids I just hope they don't say anything too awful. At all hours of the day and night, officers are too lazy to get out of their squad car and go talk to someone, instead they use the car loudspeaker to ask Jimmy to grab them a bag of chips from the bodega while the neighborhood is sleeping. In a perfect society these officers should be the paragon of civic virtue. People who I can point out to my children as role models of what a good citizen is... not have to explain why the police officers run the red light all the time in front of our building but I can't.

They don't wear mask to demonstrate that they enforce the rules but don't have live by them.Why did a cop murder a man while he knew he was being recorded? Mr Floyd was murdered because the cop knew he could do it and there was no power to stop him. Reforming a culture that has been above the law for so long will not be an easy task.

And about the ""15-hour tours,"" they are grueling, no doubt, but the overtime checks will be fat indeed."
2020-06-11 14:50:23,"Bulletproof vest? Are they planning to open fire on the protesters? Lord knows the NYPD can't hit anything they shoot at.

And Dr. Oxiris Barbot should resign immediately.  Asymptomatic people can spread the virus too.  It would help to get a real doctor in that position.

Respect is earned.  So is contempt, I suppose."
2020-06-11 14:14:45,wearing a mask shows that you care about NOT infecting those around you.....not wearing a mask? you know the answer to that.
2020-06-11 16:09:14,"What does it say about policing in this country when officers sworn to serve the public...refuse to wear face masks?

Refuse to wear masks if only out of respect for others...or out of respect for the some 100,000+ citizens who died - alone and without family or friends - here in this country in the past 3 months? 

What does it say about the state of policing in this country when nationwide - worldwide - protests...do not even give the law enforcement community pause? 

When leaders of law enforcement do not even feign to take a step back to consider what the public - taxpayers who pay  their salaries, benefits, and pensions - are saying to them loud and clear? 

It says to me not only are the protests and outrage justified...but long, long overdue. 

It says to me a culture of militarism and weaponization has poisoned those sworn to serve the public; sworn to be guardians and protectors of the public...

...and that their belief in their absolute power is corrupting them absolutely.

There is nothing happening in our society right now that has not been borne out - clearly and repeatedly - throughout history.

Time to put down the smart phones, separate from the social  media, texting, and tweeting...and get back to that which is of real value."
2020-06-11 15:25:04,"A German acquaintance of mine has coined a new term for the COVID era: nasenidioten. That directly translates to 'nose idiots'. 

The term describes those who wear a mask below rather than over their nose, thereby rendering the mask a useless decoration on their face."
2020-06-11 14:56:23,Going maskless: the answer to rubber bullets and tear gas?
2020-06-11 15:53:04,"Why are they wearing all that gear to begin with? The protestors aren't armed with rubber bullets, tear gas, pepper balls, pepper spray, clubs, or immunity from the law."
2020-06-11 16:18:20,"The reason is obvious: the cops consider themselves to be above the law.

Isn't that what BLM is all about? A police culture that is contemptuous of those they are supposed to serve and protect, most especially if they are black or brown? A culture where it is perfectly ok to use excessive force and then to lie about it, if it comes down to that? Where the pain of ostracization looms for any cop who might try to rebel and do the right thing? 

The blue wall and all that. Us against them. Even some cops who are themselves members of minorities are drawn in to this toxic culture, as we have seen in many videos where they are the perpetrators of the violence.

Sure there are exceptions. But they exactly that: exceptions. Arrogance and bullying are the rule.

Now, for some reason, the police seem to have decided that wearing masks would mark them as some kind of weaklings. So the poisonous police culture -- that no cop dares disobey -- dictates that they not wear them. Even though they are supposed to. Even though they are putting themselves and others at risk by not doing so. Even though many of them probably would wear masks were they not intimidated into conforming by their peers.

Even though they were arresting people for not wearing them just a short time ago.

Black and brown people, mostly."
2020-06-11 16:22:07,"Assume that about 1 in 5 of those officers in the picture become infected with the Covid-19 virus, and 1 in 5 of those will become seriously ill, and some number of them will either die or suffer debilitating conditions that will last for months or a lifetime.  Their rejection of masks given those odds is impossible to understand, and even harder not to condemn.  What level of infection, illness and death will penetrate the minds of those officers and move them to wear masks?  Even in the face of high rates of infections and deaths among fellow officers, they don't  take seriously the risk to themselves or this risk they pose to protesters or other civilians in the area.  Are they so unconcerned with the safety of the communities they serve that they are willing to infect them?  Do they want to infect them, as some form of punishment for protesting? Do they shun masks as an act of defiance toward 'experts'?  Do they fear being shunned by fellow officers if they do wear a mask?  If they risk infection, do they ignore the risks to their family members at the end of their shift?  Why doesn't the NYPD hierarchy insist that officers wear masks, for their own safety and the safety of others?  Their tolerance of risk is a worry for their thinking when they encounter civilians, make arrests, use force, or testify in court."
2020-06-11 16:23:17,"I'm sure the protesters saw many in their groups not wearing masks, and they surely weren't social distancing. I'm afraid hypocrisy reigns everywhere. They had a right to protest and the police were commissioned to be present, so the decisions any of them made may or may not have dire health consequences. At least, let's hope not."
2020-06-11 16:24:03,No mask? Then maybe their health plan needs to increase the cost to the department in anticipation of more cases of the virus. Hit ‚Äòem where it hurts.
2020-06-11 16:24:22,"I assume they want to get sick so they can have paid leave. They have been without masks from the get go, so the 15  hour ""tours"" and bullet proof vests and helmets have nothing to do with it. The entire time of the pandemic if I saw a group of 4-6 people huddled together without masks, it was 98% of the time the police."
2020-06-11 16:30:33,"From what I observed only half to 1/3 of cops were wearing masks for many before the warm weather and the protests. It's macho posturing, just like the President."
2020-06-11 16:33:40,"This is just a further example of how some police see themselves as apart from the general populace. Their reference to the public they are supposed to serve as ‚Äúcivilians‚Äù has been a characteristic of police departments nationwide. These intractable attitudes have set them apart from others in a way that has allowed some officers to seriously lose touch with the people they are sworn to protect. The results of this have always been on display, but especially recently in response to protests in multiple cities. Police officers should never forget they were ‚Äúcivilians‚Äù once also."
2020-06-11 16:35:16,"Cuomo should make a joint statement with the Chief of Police for the NYPD and state it's required that all police wear a mask/shield when at a protest or on the street, at a minimum. 

Stop behaving like children. Show children that adults are responsible about their health and safety."
2020-06-11 16:35:24,"For all the fuss they have made about the several instances of officers being injured by protesters around the country, they fail to address the real threat of COVID-19 that has killed 40 officers in New york. NYPD, (and SPD in my city), really needs to have someone take an objective look at their practices and adjust accordingly. Are the bulletproof vests, that apparently make it too hot to wear a cotton mask (though I would not buy that excuse in Seattle given the weather), actually needed to protect cops? Is there some way we can keep officers cooler so they can wear protective gear that is proven to save lives?

Too often police policy seems to lack an evidence based approach, instead relying on hunches, gut feelings and tradition. Refusal to wear masks is just another example of this kind of thinking."
2020-06-11 16:36:25,"I can't think of another organization in which employees could defiantly disregard a superior's orders to use safety equipment without being fired. 

And they'd usually be fired immediately."
2020-06-11 16:41:23,"How about because the majority of NYPD are Republicans? Even back in March, they continued to shake hands and mock the concept of social distancing, just like Trump."
2020-06-11 16:41:48,"I am glad to see this issue getting more and more coverage. i have been seeing so many police not wearing masks... just saw 50+ of them not a single one wearing a mask while they were waiting in the wings for a park protest to start a few days ago. police have been the ones handing out masks at these same parks during these months of pandemic and the ones to call for covid safety ( not that they helped much), and the ones in hordes monitoring for covid safety (again, not that they helped much). its all just gross and upsetting and adds to the entire disconnect of what and who are the police anymore."
2020-06-11 16:43:06,"Why aren‚Äôt they wearing masks?  If they get sick and survive, they can easily retire with their pensions, which can under certain circumstances pay them more than their normal salary, and with full health benefits (until Medicare kicks in at 65).   For a ‚Äúdisability‚Äù caused at work they can retire at any age.  So, after bashing people‚Äôs heads in, those same people (bashees) can then pay for their oppressors to enjoy the rest or their lives not being productive.  I am very pro union, but it‚Äôs stuff like this that is partially responsible for the destruction of the US labor movement."
2020-06-11 16:45:16,"At the medical institution where I work, all doctors, staff, patients, and other visitors wear masks all the time. This is good medical practice: it substantially reduces the risk that we will pass the virus on to others if we are infected, and also that we can get it from an infected person. Sure, being outdoors is protective, and people who aren't showing symptoms right now are unlikely to transmit virus as efficiently as someone who is severely ill, but being maskless is like saying it's OK to drive because I'm not particularly drunk and anyway there isn't very much traffic.

Every incremental bit of good behavior helps break virus transmission. And law officers, of all people, should be showing good behavior -= just what part of ""community professionalism respect"" is it that they don't get?"
2020-06-11 16:47:29,No masks? How about the cops that cover their shield numbers? They should immediately be fired.
2020-06-11 15:56:05,"If I don‚Äôt get an influenza vaccine I will be terminated. My job is more highly trained and important than a uneducated cop. Fire them, and fire their chief. Come on NY, you are better than this."
2020-06-11 16:53:06,The major point of the demonstrations are that US police are much more like an occupying army (how well did that work out in Afganistan) than a force for community aid. Trump has made mask wearing a symbol of left wing sensibilities and police in any city are not going to do that. Frequency of mask wearing does seem an OK  marker of community concern. Why NYC police are so eager to show their politics is only puzzling to those who do not track their other activities. Good luck reforming police departments.
2020-06-11 15:46:58,"Police has generous sick leaves, if they did get sick."
2020-06-11 16:57:43,"‚ÄúAsked about the masks, officers mostly declined to comment or ignored the question. One officer who was confronted about the matter by a young man in Williamsburg on Saturday responded, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve got more important things to deal with.‚Äô‚Äù

Yeah, we‚Äôre all busy trying to cover our badge numbers."
2020-06-11 15:54:29,"I don‚Äôt think it is possible that virtually none of the officers would rather not wear a mask.  What is likely is that a core of influencers and senior managers within the ranks have decided for whatever reason that cops don‚Äôt wear masks and any cop that try‚Äôs to buck the trend risks brutal retribution.

This is the same phenomenon that allows racism to permeate many or most PDs.  A core minority in the force are racist.  Sadly, this core includes senior managers and other influencers who have decided that the standard of behavior toward citizens is not universal.  A few racist cops (aka bad apples) are allowed bad behavior toward citizens of color.  Any cop that try‚Äôs to out these ‚Äúbad apples‚Äùwill face the wrath of racist managers/union officials/other racist cops.  Take your pick.



The result of all this.  Police departments look, smell, and taste like racist organizations."
2020-06-11 16:11:09,"You would certainly think that fostering contempt for the law would be the last thing the NYPD wanted, especially when anyone can go to Youtube and watch five of them brutalize a woman accompanied by a small child in a confrontation that began because she had her mask dangling around her neck. ""The official New York Police Department policy is that officers should wear masks when interacting with the public."" ""Should for them"" but a knee in the back for you if you don't."
2020-06-11 15:55:54,It might be helpful to just ask each one of the police officers in the photo why they weren‚Äôt wearing a mask.
2020-06-11 16:16:05,"Some cities are too big to govern effectively, period.   
And as every medical professional knows, the NYPD have a natural immunity to the Corona virus thingy, so they don't need masks."
2020-06-11 16:11:38,"OK, Officer, let‚Äôs make a deal: you wear all your protective gear, or none. 
If real men don‚Äôt wear masks, they don‚Äôt need bulletproof vests, shields or helmets either. 
Take that stuff off! You‚Äôll be so much more comfortable."
2020-06-11 17:00:33,"Not wearing a mask says ""I don't respect you or your health."" It's the least of the warm gear the police have to endure, and would be a nice symbol of showing regard for the communities around them. My young son is already asking why the police don't have to follow the rules. It's just a bad example all around."
2020-06-11 15:43:58,Just doc $100 in pay for every time an officer is seen in public without a mask.  They are disease vectors killing the people who pay their salary.  Don't pay them if they don't do their job.
2020-06-11 17:01:14,Mr. Wilson examines the issue without really examining the issue. NY cops who don't wear masks are following the example of their hero Donald Trump. The wearing or not wearing of masks has become a political choice.
2020-06-11 15:53:26,"As the governor said, wearing masks shows respect. The NYPD is sending us a message."
2020-06-11 16:15:12,"If there is a rule they will break it, if there is concern for others they will ignore it.  They should be rested weekly and fired if found to have not been wearing a mask."
2020-06-11 16:07:33,"Masks  (fabric) don't protect you as much as they protect the people around you. That says it all about the police.
 The machismo of the right will be the death (sometimes literally) of all of us if we don't change this country.

As an aside, I was in the WTO protest, peacefully assembled, almost all white. They came in a line, with their shields, for us as well."
2020-06-11 17:05:58,"Sworn to protect, not infect.

There is no reason why taxpayer dollars should go to spreading the coronavirus.  And there is no way that police aren't infecting the public because of their behavior."
2020-06-11 16:02:50,"It's certainly not going to help them achieve their goal to be ""respected"" and not be ""treated like animals and thugs.""  Continuing to ignore the order to wear masks -- on video -- shows exactly who they are.  We see you.  Respect has to be earned.  And real New Yorkers wear masks.

2020-06-11 16:11:48,"They are selfish, don't care about the public and not spreading the virus, don't even care about infecting their own families after interacting with thousands of people.  They should be fired for not wearing masks and all of them should be tested once per week at a minimum."
2020-06-11 17:07:03,"Police Officers are refusing to wear masks because Trump doesn't wear one and they support him, it's that simple."
2020-06-11 17:11:15,Why is it even an option?  Where is the leadership on this issue?
2020-06-11 17:12:26,The issue has been noted elsewhere as well. I don't know the why of it but if some aspect of the refusal was a silent gesture of flipping off the politicians who have so nobly rushed to their support as they have been vilified it wouldn't shock me.
2020-06-11 17:22:58,"Wearing a mask is a low cost precaution, an inconvenience that may save lives and enable us some manner of return from lockdown.  Who cares if there is a debate? If it helps, great. Lives saved. If it doesn't help much, there is no real loss. Let's just do it until there is no need."
2020-06-11 17:23:05,"This is not just at the protests. I see them everyday in groups with NO masks. The other day there were 5 police officers in one car and only one was wearing a mask. This proves once again, that many do not care about other people's safety."

2020-06-11 17:30:00,"Our entire construction site wears masks in the 90+ degree summer heat of California. They wear them working on the roof, working in the non air-conditioned building, and while stocking materials. They wear them with their hard hats, long pants and shirts, and protective glasses that the masks fog up.

So sorry for not accepting the Sgt's response of ""Perhaps it was the heat,... perhaps it was the helmets..."". These officers are supposed to be examples of the what to do. They are the most visible faces of the government and they should be following government policy. The workers on our site follow that policy; we aren't above the law, so why are the police?"
2020-06-11 17:31:11,"We saw that same behavior at Ground Zero. The City tried to get police officers and fire fighters to wear respirators when they were on the pile but most refused.

Now we see many of these brave yet stubborn men with lung cancer or other health issues from that exposure."
2020-06-11 17:38:00,"I retired as a cop, and I know the reason.  Cops are a hyper-macho subculture, and for many wearing a mask seems weak.  There is constant peer pressure to appear tough, and covid-19 is just not enough of a tangible threat to too many of them."
2020-06-11 17:39:49,"In New York City it is the law that one must wear a mask in public when one cannot social distance.  

Why are the police not obeying the law?"
2020-06-11 17:40:58,"Kudos to the cops who do the job well and risk their lives doing so.  However, looking at this photo, seems there is a macho, belligerent aspect to the culture. If our police will not adhere to basic public safety, I have little hope they can tackle meaningful reform across the board."
2020-06-11 17:45:15,"Some of our leaders including my governor, whose COVID-19 directives I have supported right along, refused to enforce their own orders the minute they realized that applying them evenhandedly would require police to break up protests that gathered more people than were allowed for other purposes.    

By deciding that the need for protesters to march in the streets outweighed what they had previously presented as life-or-death concerns that justified the imposition of drastic and unprecedented measures on society as a whole,  Murphy and other governors have effectively destroyed their moral authority to enforce their orders.     

Cops not wearing masks is one of the early returns.  I don't expect New Jersey's prevention efforts to survive the July 4 weekend."
2020-06-11 17:45:51,"Sgt McRorie spoke of the heat, the gear, the long shifts.  Why is it that nurses and healthcare professionals can leave their 12-14 hour shifts with abrasians and grooves in their faces from N95s every day? Ask nurses how many have lost weight because there's no time to remove PPE, disinfect and actually have a meal break.  Maybe the nurses are tougher, or just smarter?"
2020-06-11 17:46:14,"My guess is the reasons are the same as for all the people who refuse to wear masks.  They may think all the virus deaths are just part of a hoax, and that Trump is ""the second coming"".  They may think masks don't look macho, or cool.
But, on the other hand, part of it could also be just to make it easier to breathe on a hot day."
2020-06-11 17:47:43,"The members of NYPD who don't wear face masks in public just aren't very intelligent, are they? And not wearing a mask advertises that fact.

Keep in mind:  the media message that wearing a mask is to protect others is a turn-off, because it makes people feel like sycophants when that's not why they choose to wear a mask.  We need to hear more that wearing a mask offers some protection (not 100%) to the wearer.  That's why healthcare workers wear ""Personal PROTECTIVE Equipment."""
2020-06-11 17:48:17,"Why won't their captains fire them if they don't wear masks? 

I don't understand the lack of discipline. It's the law to wear a mask in public.

Doesn't the Mayor of NY have some control over the NY Police?  Why can't DeBlasio order the police to wear masks?

This article pointed out the problem - which is obvious every place there are police. Yet the article does not explain why the open disregard for law has been allowed to continue.

New York has 38,000 police.  Maybe it's time to wittle them down to those who will obey the law."
2020-06-11 17:51:28,"Considering the fusillade of gun fire that has met the police during the last couple of weeks. Considering the number of police that have been killed by gunfire, the combat wear and bullet resistant vests have certainly been useful."
2020-06-11 17:51:56,Well this is ironic. Showing weakness and insecurity in submitting to the peer pressure to appear strong and macho by not wearing masks.
2020-06-11 17:53:07,That's because they're not really interested in public safety as much as collecting a huge pension for life after retirement.
2020-06-11 18:01:31,"It fits the narrative that police officers see themselves as being above the law and given how difficult it is to prosecute for wrongdoing, who can blame them. This really gets to the heart of the problem and any reforms that do not seek to change this attitude will not be effective. It also explains their love of Trump who sees himself as being above the law also. The NYPD reputation is in tatters. The Governor must take charge of this reform as the Mayor is too vulnerable to reprisals from the cops."
2020-06-11 18:05:44,"Perhaps police need to wear season appropriate clothing. They might shed a lot of strange militaristic attitude by getting rid of all that bulk. Then masks maybe a reasonable protection that they would wear. I sympathize with anyone wearing masks for a length of time. I wear them when in public places and in grocery shops. Boy, do I feel light headed and awful after a time. These are by no means N95 masks. Also the skin on my face reacts to all the horrible materials, cottons, plastics. I can see a lot isolation  from crowds in my near future."
2020-06-11 18:05:57,"I have seen loads of employees, at stores like CVS or restaurants like Sweetgreen, not wearing masks ‚Äî indoors.  I feel that this warrants an article as much as police officers outdoors not wearing masks."

2020-06-11 18:14:27,"I see these images every day now in city, police officers without masks, almost relaxed, hands off mentality, standing on the sidelines. Today, the police in New York look more like loiterers than officers. I always felt there were too many cops in New York to begin with, often wondering what they are actually doing for us at any given moment? The police force needs to be evaluated, probably reduced, and for sure better trained. Nonviolent deescalation tactics instead of targeting citizens."
2020-06-11 18:15:34,"It's pure unadulterated arrogance that is indicative of a more general arrogance that manifests, in various ways, in how they treat all of the various groups they interact with, ranging from those convicted, through those arrested but not yet convicted, those being investigated for good cause, all the way through to those being surveilled and/or stopped without probable cause, those engaging in peaceful protest, and finally just members of the general public demanding accountability.

Arrogance, at whatever level of the police hierarchy, needs to end, it's incompatible with a democratic republic."
2020-06-11 18:16:40,"Their failure to wear masks is a failure to serve the people of New York City. In effect, they're not protecting the people they're sworn to protect from their own selfish actions. The city should dock each officer's day's pay if photographic or video evidence shows they've failed to wear masks while out and about and on official duty and in close proximity to others."
2020-06-11 18:16:42,"They're not wearing masks because cops believe they're above the law. Period. 
Cops don't give other cops parking tickets. Or speeding tickets. That's just for the little people, like you and me. 
The culture of police putting themselves above the law starts with masks and parking tickets and ends with George Floyd. 
In our police culture, the good cops are intimidated into silence by the bad cops and their union protectors. It has to end."
2020-06-11 16:34:27,"The blue wall of silence condemns all cops as complicit in aiding and abetting the myriad crimes of brutality committed against innumerable victims. To those crimes against others is now added that of stupidity in not wearing masks. Theirs is a culture of violence, brutality, corruption, cynical daily mendacity, hatred of working people, racism and misogyny. In that context it's natural that most of the public hopes they continue to not wear masks and bear the consequences that the justice system refuses to met out."

2020-06-11 16:33:21,"Like all other police departments, the NYC police department allows officers to be members of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA).

CSPOA, on their YouTubes, claims the constitution gives the authority to determine which; laws are constitution and therefore which laws are to be enforced to the police.

The connection between refusing to wear a mask and CSPOA is clearly one of street police demonstrate disregard for regulations and simultaneously disregard for the health of those they have sworn oath to protect.    

Such police should be fired and stripped of all pension benefits accumulated."

2020-06-11 17:40:36,"As an RN, I have zero tolerance and patience with those who use the excuse of ""it's too hot"" ""it makes it hard to breathe"" ""it's uncomfortable"" or any of the other excuses I've heard for refusal to wear a mask.

 The front line medical workers that are giving their all to save your life, should you get sick, are not complaining about 12 hours- or more- spent with N95's wearing bloody grooves into their faces. I would expect the same from the police, but I guess the average cop is not nearly as tough as the average Registered Nurse. (And spare me any comments about working conditions; nursing is hard, physically demanding, emotionally taxing, exhausting work).

It seems to me that too many Americans have become an extremely whiny bunch of spoiled, self absorbed brats, unwilling to carry out even the slightest act for the good of us all. And sadly, the whiniest, most self absorbed brat of us all is in the White House."
2020-06-11 16:45:38,It is time to disband all police forces and start over.  No cop should ever hire or promote another cop.   All prosecutors and judges should be hired and promoted from within the general community and those community members should be picked at random.  Any vote to hire or promote should require 100 percent approval.
2020-06-11 16:57:58,"Wearing that mask all through an 8 hour work shift?  Nah... Impractical, and maybe impossible.  Especially if you are chasing down a criminal and are running out of breath."
2020-06-11 16:34:32,They are the ones our mayor tasked with enforcing social distancing and public mask use. A good way to show up the mayor. NYPD is just being NYPD. Another awesome reason to keep clear of them.
2020-06-11 16:38:01,It's not just the protests. On Sunday I visited Randall's Island and there were hundreds of NYPD assembled but there not a mask in sight. Isn't the Police Commissioner touting the number of COVID19 cases among the NYPD as evidence of their sacrifice? Did these officers not get the memo? Was there a memo? This flagrant ignorance combined with an irrational sense of immunity will only make more people -- police and the people the interact with -- sick.
2020-06-11 17:00:44,"Defang the police! Since 9/11, the police have become a militarized organization. They act as they had seen US troops act in war zones. They treat American citizens, exercising their First Amendment rights, as enemy combatants. The police unions refuse to admit that any ""brothers"" are use their badges and guns to dominate and abuse the public. The police disrespect anyone and everyone not in uniform. Even the ""elected representatives of the people"" are afraid of them. The police have become a law unto themselves. 

BTW, misbehavior of the police is nothing new. Remember the ""police riot"" in Chicago in 1968? Any reform since? Do cops in the North act, or have acted, any differently from their counterparts in the South? Or. more frightening, do they really represent majority American social and cultural attitudes? On November 3rd, we will get a better idea of what constitutes ""America""."

2020-06-11 17:14:25,"‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got more important things to deal with.‚Äù  If NYPD are genuinely unable to perform sequential tasks - i.e., put a mask on their face and then perform their basic job duties - they should immediately resign (or be forced to resign) because they are incompetent.  Every precinct leader should be called to account for the failure of the officers under their command to wear basic protection."
2020-06-11 17:14:22,"Seems to be an amazing logical disconnect to believe a cloth mask or an N95 mask can filter out a virus that is exponentially smaller than the dust particles that they are designed for.It is also absurd from a scientific standpoint to think someone wearing or not wearing a mask will have a meaningful effect on the microbiological content of the sea of tiny life that envelops us as beings on this planet.
The public wearing of masks demonstrates how people driven by fear will pretentiously engage in futile and empty gestures instead of acceptance of the reality of nature.Well at least their not burning ‚Äúwitches ‚Äú,yet."
2020-06-11 16:35:44,"Reminds of a guy I saw in the supermarket a month or so ago.  I live in an open carry state.  He was open carrying a pistol but not wearing a mask.  I thought of asking if he planned to shoot the virus if he came into contact with it, but thought better of it."

2020-06-11 16:58:32,"Investigate.  If it turns out this is a political statement, then fire them.  Lord knows, you can afford to do so, New York City half as many police officers as the whole state of California, and that's not counting another 14K ""law enforcement personnel"" beyond them."
2020-06-11 17:19:07,"""Perhaps it was the heat""? Do police in other major cities that have beat the virus - Singapore, Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei, etc. - complain and shun masks?"
2020-06-11 16:33:04,"You know, I get it. It's hot to wear one all day, they're annoying, blah blah. I don't wear one while biking most of the time because I'm so far away from anyone else that it doesn't make sense, but people still glare at me like I just insulted their child. When talking about cops who deal with the public or move around the city though, it's a matter of respect and courtesy. If you're close to someone else or indoors, put it on. Always.

I live in Manhattan and almost never see cops wearing masks. There will be a group of 5-20 standing around chatting on a busy intersection with no masks. The problem is compounded by the protests and all the homeless people around. They're not only not wearing masks, but not doing anything to help either. It sets the tone they they truly do not care at all."
2020-06-11 18:28:14,"This story is very sad.  Trump has politicized wearing masks, and many police officers are apparently following his lead.  The ""peer pressure"" comes from those officers.  It's frightening to think there could be so many Trump followers within the ranks of NYPD."
2020-06-11 18:28:46,"Another example of the military style police deciding that the instructions of elected officials don't matter. We are expected to obey our bosses, yet the police ignore their boss, DiBlasio, with impunity. Actually, they seem gleeful about it. Does anyone really still wonder, after seeing the police response to peaceful demonstrators, why so many are calling for a re-thinking of how best to achieve our public safety goals and the role of a police force."
2020-06-11 18:30:06,"The authentic power of the police in the community rests upon their moral authority: citizens believing that the police can be counted on to lead by example. 

I don‚Äôt understand why the police would cede this authority so easily. Once it‚Äôs gone from the community, it‚Äôs gone for good."
2020-06-11 15:45:56,"Masks have become politicized, just like climate change, private vs public schools, health care and every other essential practice or service for Americans. The history of the politicalization of everything in America goes back to the Civil War but has intensified through America's refusal to introduce more than just 2 parties in their electoral system. Think for yourself police officers. Wear a mask. Be smart."

And people are confused about mask wearing.  Just today.. I entered a store wearing a mask, I was chastised by another customer, also wearing a mask, because I did not heed the one way rule. Later, I stood in my proper six foot (and more) distancing behind this customer as she checked out.  Just as she got to the cashier, this customer pulled her mask down off her face and proceeded to lean in to have a conversation with the cashier. Done speaking, and she left, she pulled her mask back on! 

Just make the wearing of masks legally enforceable at all times, and let‚Äôs be done with it."
2020-06-11 17:55:09,"And yet, no one seems to care that thousands of protesters, rioters, and looters also refuse to wear masks."
2020-06-11 16:27:38,"I marched in Brooklyn Saturday and saw hundreds of police, mostly along Flatbush Ave.  Almost none wore a mask.  Five at the most.  Saw another protestor yell at them about it.  It is so incredibly arrogant and disrespectful. Not exactly the image you‚Äôd expect them to want to project at this time. Completely confounding."
2020-06-11 16:42:09,"Protect and serve indeed!
Pat Lynch, the bilious police union head, held a rally and presser on Randalls Island during which neither he nor the dozens of cops masses behind him wore masks while complaining they weren‚Äôt being treated with the respect they so richly deserve. The arrogance and disrespect starts at the top of this toxic cop culture. And that willingness to endanger the public in every possible way is why the NYPD needs to be disbanded and remade in a better way."

If, instead, it puts the lives of our fellow citizens at risk and commits crime and does not even maintain the standard of integrity generally expected of others and devalues human life and disrespects the dignity of each individual, perhaps they should be removed from the job and, if they die from COVID-19, forfeit death benefits to their survivors.

2020-06-11 17:50:50,"It is like with traffic rules. Most NYPD cops put on their sirens briefly to go through red. I practically do not expect them to wait for green, If they do it is a surprise. It is as if rules that apply to us do not apply to them."
2020-06-11 18:08:24,"This article could be two sentences long. The evidence is in, masks work by containing the spread of coronavirus.  The NYPD officers not wearing masks are either not informed or do not care about themselves or anyone else."

2020-06-11 18:04:19,"Bowing to peer pressure and taking the mask off is what weak people with no moral compass do. 

This is an added burden on taxpayers. We don‚Äôt need cops out sick (leading to more OT bills when others have to pick up the slack), cops running up health care costs, or cops spreading Covid to others. If they don‚Äôt wear their masks when they are indoors or when they are unable to socially distance (and there‚Äôs not a good excuse), they should not be paid.

There are a lot of great cops out there putting their lives on the line to protect our communities. Right now we need them to show some leadership by putting on a mask and doing the right thing.

2020-06-11 18:13:17,Look at the WKBW picture of the Buffalo NY Frank Sedita Court house during the court hearing on Jue 6th for the two police officers charged with assaulting the 75 year-old.  There's a crowd of several hundred police and fire department members with almost none of them wearing a mask.  Glad that others have noticed this.  What's going on?  Are masks a sign of weakness?  Are they emulating our President?  Really strange.
2020-06-11 17:46:26,"Because the masks they wear protect the people they deal with, not themselves."
2020-06-11 18:21:35,"At Governor Cuomo's press briefing today, some reporter actually asked if police officers should be ""disciplined"" for not wearing masks. At prior briefings, reporters have asked if New Yorkers should be fined for not wearing masks, and if businesses should be charged with crimes for not enforcing policy. What is wrong with these reporters? It's no wonder no one trusts the press anymore."
2020-06-11 18:49:44,"The members of the police force, much like physicians, are infected with an unreasonable sense of personal invincibility, which leads them to feel they are 'too tough' to need a mask. Behavioral studies have shown that this effect can be attenuated by shifting the nature of the order. Just as changing posted signs reading ""wash your hands for your safety"" to ""wash your hands for your patients' safety"" leads to improvements in hospital hygiene, changing the order from ""wear your mask for your safety"" to ""wear a mask for your neighbors' safety"" gets the policy across without sacrificing whatever machismo aura is being protected."

2020-06-11 18:58:00,"This has nothing to do with the protests or heat.  I have taken a walk everyday throughout the pandemic and most police that I have encountered have not been wearing masks since this started in March.  Nor do they social distance.  They stand in close-knit groups talking without masks.

It's no wonder so many are out sick and have gotten the virus.  I guess they will achieve herd immunity before the rest of us, at least those that survive the virus."
2020-06-11 19:01:53,"The face covering law in NYC needs refinement. It should be clarified that face coverings are NOT necessary when taking solitary walks or doing solitary exercise outside, and that face coverings are only for when you will be gathering with others outside or when going into any indoor public space, traveling on mass transportation or when in a vehicle with anyone who is not a member of your household. With the hottest weather of the year ahead, it is NOT safe for people to walk and exercise outside with their faces covered. It will lead to overheating and heat stroke for many."
2020-06-11 19:05:56,I CAN'T BREATHE. That's why they don't wear masks. It's slightly harder to breathe. The irony is devastating.
2020-06-11 19:09:46,"If a policeman/woman is passively standing guard in a grocery store, or stopping a motorist for speeding, then a mask is only reasonable; but it he/she is actively engaged in addressing a violent protest, then that is another matter entirely."
2020-06-11 19:11:50,"I'd be willing to bet that a lot of police officers have already had Covid-19 and presume themselves to be immune. Random testing showed at least 20% of New Yorkers have already developed antibodies, and front-line workers like police and transit workers have been more exposed than the general population. That may be the reason some don't wear masks -- they know they are unlikely to infect anyone or catch the virus again, and masks are uncomfortable."
2020-06-11 19:14:06,"Maybe it's time to start taking a hard look at the personality and mindset of the people who want to become cops to begin with. It seems to me that protecting and serving is just lip service for cops that really just want the power and control that being in law enforcement provides. 

It's true that my experiences with the police can be counted on two hands and limited to the road over a lifetime, but I've always felt that most of them are rude and in it for the power; from the cop that had to make a snide comment about how steaks must be on sale at the corner market when I was pulled over for speeding to the one who was completely put out by having to deal with me being stranded on the side of the road with car trouble while eight months pregnant. I can't begin to imagine what POC have to go through."
2020-06-11 19:15:42,"The police are our biggest and most powerful set of gangs.  They have convinced us that they offer an indispensable service, and their reward or price for that service is that they pretty much set their own rules.   Attempts to make them adhere to external rules, even if these rules come from their chiefs, are met with partial withdrawal of the indispensable service they provide.  

The gangs keep their positions and powers by arousing and scaring their admirers and supporters whenever their autonomy is threatened.  This strengthens our divisions and makes them worse, and those who profit from the divisions or see their values supported by the division have no objection to this gang tactic."
2020-06-11 19:22:43,"You ever wonder why people genuinely like firefighters and yet they generally fear cops? Firefighters have one mission in mind, helping out the helpless. They do it without guns, tazers, clubs or wearing bullet proof vests. They work for us. The people. And we love them for it! Cops seem to be working for someone else, somewhere else. We  need to inform them of their misperception of reality. Tear it down and start over. Build the police force you, the people, want. This isn't magic. Build a force you love and wouldn't hesitate to call if you were in trouble. Build a force that causes you to breathe a sigh of relief when they show up at your door, not one that simply won't let you breathe."
2020-06-11 19:25:54,"I've been jogging around Washington Square Park and the couple of times I've gone out in the last week, each time there are around 50 cops spread among various locations around the park, some in groups of five or more, many in pairs and a couple solo.  Only one or two of these cops wear face masks. I circle around in disbelief, as if they don't understand the reasons people are required to wear masks.  It is dangerous not only for themselves, but for us."
2020-06-11 19:33:12,"There are British reality tv shows that depict paramedics, law enforcement and traffic safety officers. They behave like civil, respectful professionals. Watch a single episode of any of these shows and you'll see it's like night and day. The Brits in uniform behave as though they want to help the people they encounter, and seem to recognize they are neighbors and the people for whom they are working! The Americans want to be as aggressive and fearsome as they can be, and to dominate everyone. A lot of people think this is all about our national gun sickness. Why haven't the police worked harder to disarm everyone, across the board?"
2020-06-11 19:36:03,"Recent studies indicate that the single most important thing any community can do to mitigate the virus is to wear masks. Universal use of masks cuts the R rate to below 1, which means that the number of infections goes down every day. Countries like South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and China where mask-wearing was common even before the pandemic have suffered far less from COVID-19 than Western countries.

There should be no stigma and no politics around this easy, common-sense practice. If we're serious about reopening the economy, than everyone should be onboard with masks."
2020-06-11 19:36:42,"If the police refuses to pay attention to the pandemic, then I INSIST  that doctors STOP treating the police. 
My taxes pay for the salaries of these police. My taxes do NOT pay for the salaries of protesters.
If I get sick, if one of my friends gets sick, it will be in part because our ""finest"" are spreading the disease. I will NOT wait in line, in a hospital, waiting for the docs to treat these cops, any cops. 
If a cop comes into the hospital and tells me that he/she did wear a mask, then I will demand that he ensure that *every one* of his comrades wear masks too. One cop doesn't wear a mask, none of the cops get admitted into the hospital."

2020-06-11 19:52:18,"Not wearing a mask underscores the current perception that the police don‚Äôt care about the well-being of those they vowed to protect and serve.  Wearing a mask protects those around you, not the wearer, and is a sign of caring and concern for others.  Perhaps that‚Äôs too much to ask of law enforcement?"
2020-06-11 19:54:24,"Why are so many people refusing to reply to us police? You want reform? You want the chokehold outlawed? Give us guidance; give us answers:

As a police officer, being attacked by the person I‚Äôm trying to arrest, can I defend myself using a chokehold? Will I be fired and jailed; in my own jail, if I‚Äôm successful in saving my life by using the chokehold? Would a woman police officer saving her own life get a lighter sentence? Or should we police simply let a person go if they threaten to resist arrest; thereby not having to worry about being killed by the suspect, or fired and jailed by our Mayor?"
2020-06-11 19:58:06,"I think it's to show that they are not scared of being identified for their actions. 
If they were wearing the masks and in riot gear there is limited ways of people identifying them. Masks would allow the protestor to make complaints without having to identify the officer so more complaints (true and untrue) would be launched. 
They are standing up for themselves. However they should while in close contact wear masks. 
Also if 20% were already infected then 1 in 5 might not be required to wear the mask, although they could be carriers. 

Until it is required by OSHA, DOH, etc it cannot be enforced."
2020-06-11 20:03:26,"Will those mask-less officers be willing to forgo a hospital ventilator should they need one, or reimburse the city for their medical insurance coverage should they get sick?  Come on, officers: Those masks are designed to protect us AND you. The stock market just melted down today because of renewed Covid fears. You might need to hold off on buying that post-police force vacation house at this rate."
2020-06-11 20:06:46,"It is the police department's motto to ""protect and serve"" so it truly ironic that they are not wearing masks to prevent the deaths of New Yorkers. It is also infuriating to state that the police are unable to wear them given their working conditions when we have all seen photos of front-line medical workers with cuts on their faces from wearing them for so long."
2020-06-11 20:32:19,"Refusing to wear masks, substantiates the general feeling about the police.  They aren't protecting and serving, are they."
2020-06-11 20:34:08,Should we be paying for the benefits of public employees who willingly place themselves in jeopardy?
2020-06-11 20:34:31,"Downtown last weekend eight police officers without masks were lounging on either side of a sidewalk and I had to pass through them. Seconds later, one of them sneezed, so I decided to turn and say, nicely, ""You all should be wearing masks!"" ""Have a nice day"" said one of them, rather cynically, I thought.  

On Sunday, when some so-called social distancing ambassadors gave me a mask -- they don't seem to do anything else-- I handed mine to a policeman in a car, an African American, who seemed happy enough to get it. Some officers wear it, but it is true that most don't.

This is a sign of arrogance, which is part of the culture of inpunity and defensiveness which has characterized  the NYPD for too long and which is manifested in its poor relations with minority communities. The story is not always racism, but it's very often about arrogance. The essence of police discipline is following rules and the fact that so many officers refuse to do so is a clear sign that there is another set of rules being articulated at union or precinct level, undermining authority. So this story is not only about masks.

This must change."
2020-06-11 20:41:01,"The solution is clear - a public debate about what New Yorkers want from their police, and a public decision on new performance criteria.  Then fire every last officer and make them apply for their jobs again.  And not only the officers on the street, but all of them, including the chief.  Some may be rehired, some may not.  Their new contracts must also neuter their union.  It's drastic, but it must be done."
2020-06-11 20:43:06,"a) They weren't wearing masks prior to the protests either.
b) Why are so many officers covering their badge numbers?"
2020-06-11 18:47:54,"That the police force, supposedly the defendant of 'law and order', chose to bypass basic prevention in spreading the coronavirus, ought not surprise us, given the awful example of a lawless president, too arrogant (with no humility whatsoever) to follow reason and common sense, and decency, to set the norms expected in any civilized society, especially while ignoring the thousands of deaths already under his belt. What a disgrace is Trump for this suffering democracy, in the midst of several crisis, i.e. police brutality, an abuse of their 'privileged power'."
2020-06-11 20:02:18,Tough guys these cops. But also not the brightest. You don‚Äôt even need a college degree to become one. If one of them wants to wear a mask he/she is probably ridiculed by their peers. Let‚Äôs see how many will fall ill.
2020-06-11 20:18:53,"The press officer's belligerent tone says a lot.  She's being petty in her flippant attitude toward a very reasonable measure that protects the public and officers alike.

It really is a sick bystander culture and not just a few bad apples."
2020-06-11 18:52:47,Are officers wearing no masks showing they are Trump supporters?
2020-06-11 18:56:25,The answer is simple. The white supremacist authoritarian President has decreed that masks are not to be worn. The police not wearing masks are his followers. It‚Äôs just another piece of evidence establishing that police departments are in need of reform . The maskless face is the new MAGA hat.
2020-06-11 20:48:49,"Obviously we need to raise the standards for candidates for positions in police departments nationwide. Too many of these cops have no business  wearing a badge, much less a gun. Higher pay for fewer but better  cops would be a start."

2020-06-11 20:03:44,"The Commander in Chief does not wear a mask.  He claims to be the ""law and order"" president: The supporter of the police and the military.  Are the police taking their cue from the  President of the United States?  Not wearing a mask is saying you do not care about the health and welfare of those around you.  It is a selfish, mean-spirited decision to not wear a mask."

2020-06-11 20:43:31,"Why? IF Alex Bell's FOIL-based numbers from 2016 are relevant today, less than 50% of the NYPD resides in Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan. Have you been on Long Island in the last few weeks? Mask wearing is the INVERSE of what you see in the Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, where most residents wear masks. I personally have noticed less interest in mask wearing in Staten Island, I don't know about the Bronx. Obviously the subtext of Wilson's question (the headline) is a correspondence between culture and masks; given that mask wearing breaks per region, I'll mention the rumor that notable numbers of NYPD manipulate if not use false addresses per residency requirements. Please NYTimes, this article is arguably provocation/entertainment if you fail to FULLY INVESTIGATE THE NYPD IN A MEANINGFUL WAY rather than simply ask questions."
2020-06-11 18:51:50,"My guess is that police reticence to wear facial coverings is political, cultural and leadership-related. Political: police lean conservative and conservatives are more likely to believe the seriousness of the pandemic is ‚Äúoverblown‚Äù and that public health measures are an infringement of their civil liberties. Cultural: too many police think rules are for others, not themselves. Leadship: there is a deficiency within the ranks. The ignorance and arrogance on display in relation to coronavirus play into racist misdeeds as well."
2020-06-11 17:06:47,"Watching these videos for the last week of police behavior, the off-handed/lame-brain comments of various police officials, and pictures in the press, what are the entrance requirements for becoming a police officer??? Not that they should require a perfect SAT score, but come on---I would expect that when you give a man or women a gun and power to arrest/dedain/question citizens, the entrance exam and psychological interview would be stringent enough to weed out the kinds of officer conduct we are witnessing each day. These are good jobs, with good pay, good health care, and good pensions---why aren't we getting good people to match these good benefits."
2020-06-11 19:02:28,"Your Photo shows many officers wearing helmets with face shields and many wearing masks. I also have seen hundreds of demonstrators without masks or having them pulled down.

Looking back almost 3 months we see so much confusion and outright lack of knowledge, led to terrible outcomes . . . but always the ""authorities"" made ""statements."" 

The police are led astray by their own leaders and peers. If they thought things through, perhaps they would protect themselves and their families. Not thinking is also part of the problem."

It took a long time coming, but once they find out that their posturing will hit their paychecks, you'll see thing change fast.
They will try to stage slow downs, allow crimes to be committed, and all the usual tricks to show their unhappiness, but I suspect that now people can record videos of their actions, it will end up with them shooting themselves in the foot."
2020-06-11 18:27:13,"Fueled by the right wing in their quest for 'liberty', narcissism, sociopathy, and a general lack of empathy are other pandemics that are ravaging our society. The notion that an individual is part of a larger community and/or should act in the interest of the common good is viewed as weakness or an infringement on 'personal freedom'. America is diseased and there doesn't appear to be a bottom for how far we will fall."
2020-06-11 20:28:21,"Clearly police officers do not believe that their job is to serve and PROTECT!
Hence the protests.  Not wearing masks is simply an affirmation that there is something wrong with the police force mentality"

2020-06-11 19:29:04,"WOW!

Less than two months ago when NYC was grappling with its worst crisis since 9/11, NYC coppers, among other first responders, were being hailed as heroes on a nightly basis, with the sounds of pots being banged with spoons and offers of free coffee and food.

Now, because of the murderous actions of four police officers in a different city and different state, ALL COPS, EVERYWHERE are being vilified for everything across the board.

How quickly the tone, temperature and temperament changes almost over night.

Not every cop is bad and not every cop is perfect.  They are human beings.  Just like the rest of us.  To be perfectly honest, I see a ton of ordinary people riding our commuter trains, walking on sidewalks and meeting in crowded bars with no face masks.

This notion of kicking all NYC cops for something like not wearing protective facial gear while how many other civilians do the same thing?  Where's the outrage in that?

I swear I don't know how these men and women in blue can be practically revered two months ago and suddenly they are viewed as public enemy number one because SOME cops are not wearing a face mask.  So, were the claims of these folks in blue as being heroes just a lark or a joke or insincere babble?

And yet, where is the indignation over the president NOT ever wearing a face mask?

Sincere apologies for the rant."
2020-06-11 20:36:18,Not wearing masks is just a small part of police lawlessness.They do not care about other human beings.They are also part of the extreme right wing which rejects pandemic control measures by government.

Covid does not care for machismo.  Having seen so many patients I can tell you that Covid is a punishing disease. Ignoring policy is one thing but abandoning common sense could be lethal."
2020-06-11 18:42:59,"So, the official excuse is they have no excuse. Very good."
2020-06-11 18:55:15,"Because they are politicized; and just as it‚Äôs wrong to politicize the military it‚Äôs wrong to have a police force that cares not for the people they are sworn to protect, but rather they obviously only care about Trump."
2020-06-11 19:47:21,"It is definitely a mark of someone who is unfit to wear the uniform. 
Reasons do not matter here, the fact of the necessity being literally life and death is ignored by people meant to be examples of good behavior. That alone is enough of an indicator of bad character to remove them all."
2020-06-11 20:02:02,"Cops fear being clobbered or shot every shift, whether working a sometimes angry demonstration or walking down a dark street. Cops are frightened every shift they may not get to go home or collect their pension. Many are not worried about catching a cold."
2020-06-11 18:26:37,"was just at 79th and 5th and saw many not masked.  that said, i also saw a few protesters (whose cause i support 100%) openly taunting police."

All the excuses in the world can't hide the power cops have over us.
2020-06-11 16:40:49,"Masks are a misery. But worth it to protect self and others, in a time of crisis.

The maskless officers are themselves protesting . Not unlike the maskless firefighters clearing the toxic pile at ground zero. They felt the situation, the heat, the grief, was just too damn much to comply with this one thing.  And at one level, we can all empathize to some degree - this has been an incredible long haul of too damn much.

And is it dangerous? It was horribly, life threateningly dangerous for the guys at ground zero. Some of them suffer still; others have died. We are still paying medical bills. Not that we can have the heart to be picky about whether they used ventilators - and we shouldn‚Äôt. 

Is it dangerous for  Covid? God willing maybe not so much. Outside, in the sun and wind, maybe ok....but the closeness, the yelling, all not good. Thank goodness the infection  rate citywide has come down so low. (A hard won statistic.) We can only pray that data won‚Äôt show that police have been spread it amongst themselves the last two weeks. We‚Äôll see.

Let‚Äôs not chide them over masks. If there is a toll, document it, but this is small potatoes. Let‚Äôs urge them (by every means possible ) to de-escalate, and keep calling out the bullying, arrogance, jerk culture, lack of community safety behavior that runs so deep and has hurt and killed so many. 

We could all use safer, healthier stronger communities. In every group, and in law enforcement."
2020-06-11 18:21:34,"As I understand it, our knowledge has evolved and wearing masks is much more about efforts to keep others safe than evidence of our own protection. The NYPD is just showing us in yet another of many ways that they don‚Äôt give a damn about protecting anyone except themselves."
2020-06-11 17:23:57,"Why the hell do the police expect us to respect and support them when they can't follow a simple common sense directive that is meant to protect themselves and the public. Why do we trust their judgement and give them any leeway when it comes to serving and protecting the public when they can't be bothered to do what is expected of every other person in our society. The arrogant, uncaring attitude that this behavior represents has gone on far too long. Start over. Gut the police department and hire people that can respect and actually want to serve the public."

2020-06-11 15:22:28,"PPE may be close to being in hell for some folks. I don't know how the medical workers do it. If a policeperson has to work a 15 hour shift something is wrong, because I don't think humans were made to sustain such stress for so long and still function at peak performance, at least not without rotation and R&R. Might so much stress for so long even lead some decent folks to irrational behavior? We are in a siege war against the covid virus. If it was all hands on deck, the stock market winners would be doing a lot to help the rest of us, including policepersons, win. Even if it cannot be an equal opportunity infector, the virus may get even some of them too."
2020-06-11 21:10:36,"We can't get cops to wear masks and yet we think they're going to abide by new regulations regarding their use of deadly force? Legislation is not going to be enough to change the law enforcement system, it needs a major rebuild from the ground up."

How stupid can you get?"
2020-06-11 21:21:41,"What this is really telling us is that the police don't think the rules apply to them, that they are above the rules, above the law.

Police officers who do not wear masks need to be fined and or suspended to send the message that - yes the rules do apply them."

And why are they allowing these ""protestors"" to loot and burn private businesses and public buildings and kill and injure innocent people?  In Seattle, the anarchists have taken over a police precinct and declared the surrounding area a ""police free"" zone.  Why are the Democratic leaders in Washington State and Seattle not putting a stop to that?  Is anarchy, larceny and arson suddenly okay with Democrats?  Why aren't the Democratic leaders in Congress demanding a stop to these actions?  If Democrats think allowing or supporting these people will help with the problem of racism in America they are sadly mistaken.  The majority of Americans do not support these actions."
2020-06-11 14:09:10,Why doesn‚Äôt the NYT ask some police officers? My guess is they may fear people can‚Äôt hear them. It‚Äôd be a lot more interesting to actually get some facts instead of an article that just speculated.
2020-06-11 14:13:25,Good for the police officers! Anyone wearing a mask is a victim of the corrupt contagion narrative. Anyone following either of the media-led stories of plague or  street action is being leveraged by those who intend to get the power back that they foolishly let slip in   2016. Conspiracy theory is now conspiracy practice.
2020-06-11 14:46:31,"I understand people's concerns. But there are some arguments that can be made against masks beyond peer-pressure. The officers are mostly working outside, which is the safest place to be, with or without a mask. Also, there is a raging debate about how common or how rare asymptomatic / presymptomatic spread of the virus actually is. Note this week how the WHO has stated such spread was very rare, then walked back the statement a day or two later. And given all the other uncomfortable gear officers are required to wear, it is understandable that they might balk at masks. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, when interacting with the public as a police officer at a time of national consternation over police conduct, it is important that officers appear to be human. The Robo-cop look is not the look you want when facing down protesters who may be holding bricks and bats."
2020-06-11 14:51:53,"wait wait 

so if the police arrest or stop or enforce wearing of the masks they are being too aggressive - because you shouldnt be forced to wear your mask - 

after all its better the police dont engage in enforcing ticketing or arresting for non distancing or mask wearing ...

2020-06-11 15:59:27,"Perhaps the masks interfere with people hearing their directions clearly?  The CNN reporters wear masks, which is assinine since they are at least 6' away from the cameraman.  I stopped watching their coverage because their voices were muffled by the masks.  The NYPD puts safety first, and maybe the masks that do muffle speech, causes safety problems."
2020-06-11 16:03:35,"It is not necessary to wear a mask outside - duh.  There is no literature or evidence that supports doing that.  Anecdotally, few to no transmissions of COVID-19 have been attributable to outdoor transmission.  Instead, wearing a mask outside is about political affiliation.  It is virtue signaling.  At worst, this conversation is about intimidation (for both sides).  It is deeply pathetic."
2020-06-11 16:07:11,"At least one reason is the same reason why more people in general are not using it.

They are hard to breathe in, stifling in the heat to wear for 7hrs. and the pandemic is at its nadir.
     
I took random samples where I live and people in general are down from 80%+ to less than 50%+.

I will say though that most of the cops don't even have it at the ready, ie hanging down if they get close to a sick or disturbed person and also they are standing too close together."

This reminds me of how badly behaving cops often don't have their cameras on when video would be key, when a detainee is injured or abused. 

If DeBlasio would make it CLEAR to the police chief that cops are going to be seriously docked, fined, sanctioned re their careers, etc. for blatantly not wearing masks, re policy -- at least he'd get credit for trying, and idiot cops would get punished. 

But no, it's all grandstanding.  

If this were a red city and a red mayor, somehow I strongly suspect the NYT would be far more critical and active, as would left leaning commenters, re this issue.

The police in America need a reset.   Police unions wield too much power and public opinion is propagandized by the constant stream of ""cop shows"" and police movies depicting police as sensible, intelligent and hard working.

Schools overcrowded and teachers forced to buy supplies with their own money and yet we have no problem giving NYPD six billion a year? Cops who refuse to wear mask and get sick we pay. Cops who beat up civilians and get sued we pay. No wonder cops think we work for them. The crocodile tears they shed for working 12 hours days helps them cry all the way to the bank to cash gargantuan overtime checks. Just wait until the pay of the top earners are published then we will really realize who works for who. In reality they are defunding us. The Governor can shut down the state and city but can't make cops wear a mask? Taking a knees is only cosmetic to take our eyes off the real problem.

I'm glad I'm don't have to deal with this"" ( gesturing at the passers by) ""any more, if I was still on on the force I'd quit.""  Masks were obviously way down the lists of things he thought important.  My take on it is that it's way to show they can still get with something, like the cop who always double parked in front of my Dad's shop deliberately blocking him in back in the 1980's because he explicitly didn't like having our Puerto Rican employees in the neighborhood.

2020-06-11 18:50:51,"China is not a rich or a poor country. It more complicated than that. China is best thought of as a population of close to 1.4 billion living across about 4 different developmental levels. First, the so-called 1st tier cities gleaming Jetson like metropolises - Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin and Shenzhen. The cities many US papers avoid printing photos of - no need to spook the horses. (Next time someone waxes lyrical about what Finland has achieved with its population of 7 million remember China has achieved this trick for about 300 million of its citizens.) Then there's the highly developed and often quite beautiful 2nd tier cities: Hangzhou, Dalian, Xiamen, Chengdu, Suzhou and Dongguan all larger than most US cities - bursting with China's new middle class defined as those with net assets between US$50,000 and US$500,000. An embarrassing little reported Credit Suisse study from 2015 found China at that point had about 93 million of this type of middle class compared to lower US total of 82 million. If anything in 2020 the Chinese lead is greater. After the 2nd tier cities you have hundreds of million plus cities all forging ahead in development and quality of life striving to match the 1st and 2nd tiers. Finally, there are the poorer emptying rural areas a rural to urban migration seen more than 80 years ago in the US. It's as if Washington had to run a country containing the US, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean. Yet all boats have been rising for 40 years. Not bad."

2020-06-11 19:32:21,"After reading the article, I have to say that many of the problems highlighted are not just applicable to China  but also to Western countries.

1) Unemployment

""While the government says unemployment is at 6 percent, other estimates put it at 20 percent""

It is inevitable that reductions in output induced by the restrictions to business activity will increase unemployment. Th is is hardly unique to China. More than 40 million have already claimed unemployment benefits in the US since quarantine began in March. In fact, increasing unemployment is the trend in most countries.

Going further, particular Western countries had significant unemployment even prior to the current  economic slowdown. For example, the youth unemployment rate in Spain exceeded 50% between 2012 and 2015. And it has never returned anywhere near pre-2008 recession levels. It was still a staggering 30.8% in January this year (before any of the lockdown restrictions in that country).

2) Informal Sector

High unemployment in southern Europe (e.g. Spain, Portugal, Greece) implies significant participation in the informal sectors in these countries as well, likely tolerated by the authorities. How else do citizens make ends meet? The deterioration of purchasing power (and the broader disenfranchisement of workers) has thus been the norm in some Western countries for some years now.

Furthermore, 40% of US workers have not seen an increase in real wages since the 1970s. This slowdown will hurt them too."
2020-06-11 19:34:59,"One other thing. ""No. 2 economy"" If we are going to engage in these endless nervous geopolitically driven economic comparisons with the Chinese when can we look forward to the admission that according to the World Bank using GDP measured by PPP (Purchase Power Parity) the Chinese economy overtook the US economy in size in 2013?
Before China came close to accomplishing this feat PPP was lauded by most serious economists as a truer measure of an economy's size than clunky dated standard GDP measures that avoided differences in purchasing power between countries. But as China surged GDP measured in nominal terms that clunky dated measure apparently was discovered to hold the virtue (at least for the next decade) of providing the right answer to whose economy is bigger. (I look forward to more dark rumblings about the veracity of China's economic data when it overtakes the US using the nominal GDP methodology.)
But long before that happens the focus will switch to the very flawed per capita measure comparisons of which again really only make sense if assessing quality of life when relative purchasing power is compared - things are much cheaper in China and very very cheap in the poorer parts!
Also how many Americans know auto workers in Shanghai make more than autoworkers in America's NAFTA partner Mexico?"
2020-06-11 19:39:26,"This is a very unfortunate attitude the Chinese Government has. Like Mao didn't do enough to leave his country devoid of a real culture the current one is closing down the things that create one, emulating the west and stealing intellectual property is hardly something to be proud of, street food and people in stalls making a unique products is [let's not forget Apple started in Job's parents garage]. But to the point all culture starts with food, it is the culture a people have when they have little else and when we have much we still want that slice from the corner shop."
2020-06-11 20:11:49,"""The government set a goal of creating nine million new jobs this year, down from 11 million last year. That will not be enough for this year‚Äôs 8.7 million college graduates plus the many workers and professionals who lost jobs in the sharp economic downturn.""

The number of new jobs is slightly more than college graduates.  What about the majority of people who did not go to college or maybe even high school? 

The West has this notion that China is everyone is prospering while ignoring the low income factory workers because the CCP wants us to believe it.   Anyone who's traveled to mid size factories know that skyscrapers and high speed trains are just smoke and mirrors only accessible by the upper middle class and foreigners."

No, actually, people all over the world usually do just fine when they are free to make their own choices, speak their minds, and live their own lives.

2020-06-11 21:53:42,"The Western media tend to portray China as a monolith and many people do not realize that it's a huge continent-sized country of extreme complexity and diversity. The eastern coastal region is highly developed while the inland rural provinces are quite poor. Just imagine a union of South Korea and North Korea, times ten."
2020-06-11 23:38:39,"China is changing. It will, sooner than later, become far more open than it is today while the Western world will become far more closed. Even the Chinese do not believe everything the government tells them... The crazy days of double digit growth is over within the Chinese economy as Western world embraces automation and 3D printing. The largest problem facing China today is that it may grow old before it grows rich."
2020-06-11 23:39:21,My friend suggested when universities open up again and I return I should open one... we live in a tier three city so it might just work. Letting people make their own income is not a bad thing... better than people waiting for a government cheque and avoiding work as is most definitely happening in Canada. It is so bad that the government is suggesting jail time for fraud... better to sell handicrafts and tea if the option is there for everyone involved.

Interesting question that is hard to answer objectively. When can a country be called very rich? It's like what Potter Stewart said about pornography: I know it when I see it.  

This brings to my mind a couple of thoughts. I'd have to find the data, but some years ago mainland Chinese were asked in a survey the following question: If you or your spouse gave birth to a baby on the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islets, a disputed territory located in the East China Sea that is controlled by Japan but claimed by both China and Taiwan, would you want that baby to be eligible for citizenship in Japan, China, or Taiwan?

Apparently a plurality of respondents asked this question in mainland China answered with ""Japan."" But this was some years ago. I don't know what the breakdown would be in 2020.

Another observation: When the United States liberalized its immigration laws in 1965 and once and for all abolished racially discriminatory barriers to migrating to the U.S., pretty much every adult in India who was a university graduate and fluent in English immediately made plans to get out of Dodge and leave Delhi or Calcutta for Buffalo or Chicago pronto. A massive brain drain ensued. But virtually nobody in Japan with similar skills and credentials was clamoring to move to America after 1965. 

I know it when I see it. Japan is very rich, India is still very poor, and the jury is out on China. How many Chinese keep a 2nd passport?"
