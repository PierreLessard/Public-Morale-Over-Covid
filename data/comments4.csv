Retreating into a faith based politics - which puts untested assertions of belief over reasoned analysis of empirical evidence - is in this crisis forcing scientists to work double time. They must mitigate the dangers of a novel virus and of a blinkered and hide bound administration. 

Our bad political choices, are forcing scientists to waste time and effort preventing an all powerful executive, unmoored from reality and effectively unaccountable, from creating deadly new facts on the ground.

I hope we can have an open and honest discussion about this process of understanding, and mapping the genome of this corona virus.

Here is a link that suggests this corona virus is pretty unique due to the presence of 4 DNA strands previously only found in the HIV virus.

But as scientists race to invent a vaccine, there are a host of challenges that may take well over a year to solve.

Meanwhile, our country struggles to provide a concerted national testing program that includes wide-spread testing for antibodies as well as an immediate test to see if one is exposed and currently infected. Without testing, we are flying blind; and without knowing the genetic details, a race for a vaccine will be a pipe dream."

interest that naturally transcend human borders and material gains (most of the time), we all build upon the work of other and previous scientists, so that it is extremely rare for an idea, a discovery to occur purely on its own.

Unfortunately the real world often imposes its own reality by attempting to limit collaboration in the name of national
security or intellectual property, sometimes for valid reasons because some researchers or nations seek their own glory or advantage.

In a last ditch effort, the ""enemy"" releases a plague ""The Wandering Sickness"", which runs rampant, and kills a third of the planet's population. Civilization is almost lost except for the efforts of the world's remaining scientists and engineers, who from their headquarters in Basra, reconquer the Earth and rebuild civilization along scientific principles, with erasing national boundaries as a prerequisite.

According to the Times reporting, on December 30, a Chinese doctor alerted his colleagues of a possible reoccurrence of SARS and was told to not spread rumors. By January 23rd, the city of Wuhan was in lockdown. That is a little over 3 weeks. Obviously, the Chinese government was not ignoring the disease but investigating. What they have learned in these three weeks? (1) It is a new disease with a new virus. Chinese scientists sequenced its DNA and shared with the rest of world in early January. (2) The infection can spread from people to people which lead to the decision to lock-down Wuhan. After that, they also learned and told the rest of the world that (3) asymptomatic transmission is possible. With all these knowledge, what the governments in the west did? US president thinks the whole thing is exaggerated until a week ago. Three months after the Chines told the world of the new disease. If the Times thinks the Chinese government restored to its old habit of keeping secrets, maybe one can suggest Times also has old habit of bias toward a developing country, like China with an authoritarian system? One lesson the Times can learn from the Chinese government is once credibility is lost, it is difficult to earn it back.

Donations of protective equipment (masks, gloves, etc.) to the hospitals have been set up. I see also how useful equipments for covid testing are being requested and, in response, how many inactive labs and scientists are willing to donate tubes or molecular kits, loan equipments or help with grant writing for covid public health labs. I encourage you to setup the same in your university/organization/company."
2020-04-01 14:27:53,"This public sharing of vital information hopefully will become the new normal.  We have wasted years, money and many lives in military endeavors internationally that have brought nothing but destruction.

2020-04-02 09:44:34,"This is marvelous news, though not totally surprising in some ways. What scientists love most is science and doing research, which means that they are drawn to each other. This is apparently one time when we have the best minds in the world pulling together for the good of all humankind. 

While we certainly cannot expect this collaboration to last to this extent once this crisis has passed (careers must be forwarded, promotions had, etc.), let's hope that it does indeed create some new openness which lasts. 

The world has been barreling in the opposite direction for a while now closing borders (even before the pandemic), building walls, going it alone. It's time to remember that we all share one globe and to some extent others' fate will always influence our own."
2020-04-02 11:23:44,"Outstanding article. Various leaders around the world could use it as a model for (gasp) climate change initiatives and other global threats. Being in a medical field myself, research is oftentimes seen as plodding along in secret until someone can make the ""big reveal,"" as suggested in this story. It is refreshing to see scientists working unselfishly toward a singular goal for once. Too bad our political leaders can't bring themselves to operate the same way."

If you question them, you are attacked by them. And the whole world is suffering by their scientific lies."

2020-03-28 19:43:04,"I am 67 years old, came down with gastrointestinal illness and a flu like feeling all over my bod and a temp, my doctor said I qualified for a test, and I will find out the results in eight days. I felt I’ll for one and a half days then suddenly recovered. What shocks me is the nonchalant attitude of Trump and his henchmen while people die. The insidious ness of this journey of a deadly pathogen creeping through our cities while adults in government suppressed testing and argued like middle school children is the most horrific thing I have seen I. This Trump administration. While his henchmen and women are loyal to him, people die and get sick? Who can be criminally prosecuted in the government high ups for negligence?"
2020-03-28 19:46:53,"Thank you for this article. This is what I've been saying. Once I saw those dead bodies on the street in Wuhan, I knew it was only a matter of time before this started showing up in major US cities. However, I thought we had tests, PPD for medical personnel, and ventilators. How wrong I was. 

A few countries, like Singapore and Vietnam, did contact tracing and enforced two-week quarantines WITH doctor visits and food delivery for those exposed. That was far more efficient and less expensive than collapsing the economy.

This pandemic has exposed that the US is not really a first-world country. We were not prepared to protect the most vulnerable among us. More damningly, those in charge don't seem to care at all."
2020-03-28 19:45:00,"One of the strategy to be successful in many Asian countries could be wearing masks. Indeed it is true that wearing masks is not the most efficient to way to protect a healthy people from infection, but it is the most effective way to stop the spread from the infected person to the healthy one. In the current circumstance when we don't know who are infected or who are not, wearing masks could be a very effective way. However still there is a culture in America and Europe that wearing masks is considered as a sign of sick people and some Asians wearing masks are attacked or become the target of discrimination. The experts still tell to the general public not to wear masks. One reason could be because of the shortage of the face masks for the medical staffs, but this is not the right way to protect the general public from infection. The administrartions should work hard 1)to speed up the production of the face masks 2) to encourage  people to wear the face masks whenever and wherever."
2020-03-28 19:45:01,"“Only the best people” trying to work with Federal agencies whose leadership has been decimated with unfilled positions, and acting heads whose prime qualification is loyalty to Trump. Long term professionals are considered the Deep State, trying to undermine Trump, and every warning and piece of bad news is seen as part of the plot.

And above it all, the number one priority is to keep Trump happy, praise him at all times, and make him look good. The biggest threat for the administration is that he won’t get re-elected; everything else is secondary. 

Expect more chaos as long as Trump remains in office and the GOP controls the Senate, giving him cover. At this point, it’s either 25th amendment time or a real impeachment trial. We may not make it to November under Trump. If he can cancel or rig the election, he will.

Meanwhile, a closer look at death rates in Italy suggests the toll from the virus is being under-reported. There’s neither time nor resources to investigate every death to confirm if it was virus related, but the numbers are much higher above normal than the official virus death toll can explain.

This is going to get much worse before it gets better."
2020-03-28 19:45:53,"This account suggests it was ineptitude, turf battles, poorly qualified appointees, deep cuts in agencies that protect our health, and a failure to appreciate the emergency that led to the lack of testing.  I hope this is true.  A darker possibility is that political appointees dragged their feet to preserve a rosy picture of the virus in hopes of pleasing the president, who at the time was busy denying the seriousness of the threat, and overtly admitting he wanted to keep the numbers low."
2020-03-28 19:48:50,"Ever more precise tests for more and more Germans enable the early detection of clusters and areas of infection. That explains the high number of infected people in Germany. On the other hand, it enables the infected ""only"" with mild symptoms (the majority) to be recognized in good time and sent home for isolation early enough so that no risk groups are infected. The high test rate and the many infections that were discovered early enough were therefore eliminated as a risk factor for all old people or people with medical risks. This means that there are fewer deaths in precisely these risk groups. Thanks to the measures taken by the government to lockdown, social distances and a health system that has so far worked exemplary, Germany has managed to mourn only 400 dead despite 50,000 infections. I very much hope that other countries will soon work in a similar way. Because an even larger number of victims and a longer waiting time until this crisis is overcome would be unbearable.
And other god News from Europe:
The other aid programs of the EU countries are starting to run slowly. Next week we will take over 5 Italian corona cases that need ventilation on our corona intensive care unit in Bad Hersfeld Hesse. And we are not the only ones in Germany or Hesse. With a lot of work and even more luck, we can hopefully lower the mortality rate together. Solidarity with each other is now all that matters.
We will defeat this pandemic together not ""someone First"""
2020-03-28 19:52:47,"And, the trail of accountability begins. Nicely done except after the failure of a greater percentage of the public to grasp the Mueller report, the complexities of what will become the corona virus report  may end up in the same heap pile, too. A mad king,  his corrosive impact on our most important institutions, and a political system that allowed it gave us chaos. A supposed legacy of American exceptionalism is that we come together in a crisis and get it done. I’m a child of the 50s and if I had any doubts after Katrina that this had become more myth than reality, now I know with certainty. Myth. In a banana republic, there is only one well coordinated institution and that is the military. What would save me from the depths of this cynicism would be for the many involved with the current administration to publicly reflect and show inner wisdom and the courage to reveal the truth."
2020-03-28 19:54:57,"When the complete history of this catastrophe is written there will be a chapter on the dismantling of government and it's consequences. The Trump administration, to the extent he ever staffed it, will be known as the test case for the proposition that we don't need a federal government at all, that the country would be  better off  just letting the corporate elite do as they please and the free market have its way.

By disbanding the pandemic unit on the national security council the president set in motion a series of actions that led us here. That he stated that he did not know anything about it, and or accepts no responsibility for that or anything else, is  indicative of the problem. Of course the end of that thinking and his conduct is this catastrophe.

By refusing to use equipment from the WHO at the outset of the pandemic, and a host of other massive blunders the spread of this disease was assured. By downplaying, making lite of, by flatly misrepresenting the facts of the matter, a test for everyone !  he has made a bad situation into a complete fiasco.

His theory of government has not only been found wanting but to be an utter failure and betrayal of the country. He very much bears responsibility, he was elected to be president after all ?

As to motives there will be time enough time to dissect that. Right now the question is can the federal government act in a manner consistent with  one of it's  fundamental  reasons for being, TO PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE."
2020-03-28 19:55:38,"After 9/11, we were told that the main function of the newly-created Department of Homeland Security would be to ""connect the dots"" related to threats against the U.S.   Well, there  were a lot of dots in the weeks and months preceding the COVID-19 pandemic and while many blame Trump for a lack of leadership, where was DHS as this crisis loomed on the horizon? Could it be that DHS was silenced or diminished by Trump or were the ""best people"" put in charge clueless?"
2020-03-28 19:58:28,"Sad, but not totally unexpected considering that we have novices running the show. ""Draining the swamp"" means that no one in the administration is an expert in their field.

It's a little bit like the difference between a medical intern and a seasoned master clinician. The former is learning the ropes, and only reacting to the clinical situation. 
The master clinician, through clinical wisdom, knows what's about to happen before it actually does. As a result, the master clinician can quickly get ahead of the situation and save the patient.

It's just criminal that ego got the best of them and allowed the situation to get out of hand. 

This critical error was indeed an error of commission rather than omission because of misinformation and misdirection.

Trump:  ""Anybody that needs a test gets a test; they're there, they have the tests, and the tests are beautiful"" - Trump

Azar nodded at one point as the president noted that ""they're making millions more [tests] as we speak.""

These words were spoken on March 6th 2020 (3 weeks prior to this story's publication date)."
2020-03-28 20:06:56,"Thanks for the great reporting. We need to continue to hold those in power accountable, People say, ""don't look back"" and just focus on the virus moving forward. But it's precisely by looking back now and seeing where the administration went wrong that the public can put pressure on Trump and those that surround him to make the right decisions moving ahead."
2020-03-28 20:08:29,"Actually the federal response was even worse than described here, when you consider that a functioning Covid19 test in Seattle (by the Seattle flu study) was not allowed, by the CDC and FDA, etc, to test for at least 3 weeks (early Feb to Mar 1), despite being ready to go (3-4 weeks before the CDC test worked). Three weeks probably represented six or so doublings of the infections at the time, after which any hope of actually containing the virus was gone, and the only hope for avoiding catastrophe was social distancing for weeks, at huge cost to the economy."
2020-03-28 20:26:40,"This is a good article, but it is so long it is hard to see the key issues.  I have a research lab where we do PCR (polymerase chain reaction, the core technique in the test), and have been watching the problems with the coronavirus test.  I think there are three main problems:

1.  The CDC was slow in developing its test.
2.  The CDC required testing labs to have a particular combination of very specific equipment and reagents, which few labs did.  Even minor substitutions were initially not allowed.
3.  The equipment and reagents needed in the CDC test, and also in recently-approved variants of the test, are specialized, and only available in limited quantities.

Although the number of tests is increasing, it is still being held back by these problems.  A willingness to use more commonly-available reagents would allow many more tests to be done.  However, work validating the use of these more common reagents would be required.  Also, tests of different kinds that do not use PCR are being developed."
2020-03-28 20:26:56,"CDC's delay in the deployment of testing is unacceptable. It is more important to have a test running than to ""re-invent the wheel"" in times of emergency. The accuracy of a test is important, however, when compares to the urgency of a test when the virus is spreading fast, the choice is obvious. Let's hope that there will be a congressional inquiry when we are through this COVID-19 pandemic."
2020-03-28 20:28:13,"Not testing ""those with milder symptoms""  was just a euphemism for not not having tests available.  On March 18 I was an 82 year old who had coughed for 10 days with flu like symptoms and had a 100degree temperature.  A large emergency ward at a major Miami refused to test me until an X-ray showed pneumonia. Lucky I tested negative but was sent home to a family of 8 children and grandchildren after the test and was not notified of the results for 6 days after release.  When I hear of the administrations criminal euphemistic coverup of the shortage I cry for the families of this who have died and/or have had to wait in the rain for 6 hours at NYC hospitals to be told they are not candidates for the test.  No functioning health care system would behave this way."
2020-03-28 20:48:10,"It is important not only to test for those who have Covid-19, but also to be able to test widely for those who have had the virus infection and recovered. These people are critical, especially in the healthcare profession, as they cut neither catch the virus or transmit it."
2020-03-28 20:52:45,It's great to have more test kits but you also need laboratories that won't get bogged down when the avalanche of test swabs arrive. Right now my hospital is experiencing 5-7 day turnaround for tests. That means we are using up valuable PPE - gowns gloves masks - on potentially COVID negative patients because we're waiting on test results. We need an immediate point of care test that can quickly rule out non-COVID patients.
2020-03-28 21:01:13,"Some other thoughts about the failure to test rapidly:

1) Agency leaders set the priorities, and could have prioritized test development instead of other Trump administration priorities.
2) A good leader would have supported parallel evaluation of the WHO test and home grown tests. The Trump administration has promoted a culture of leadership opposed to cooperation with international bodies.
3) Federal agencies are criticized and scrutinized by Congress, GAO, consumer groups, the media. If they do not follow strict laboratory standards and SOPs, they will be punished and attacked, leading to a culture of cautiousness. A lot of time and energy is spent dealing with responses to inquiries, and that shapes what agencies work on."
2020-03-28 21:01:51,"Death by bureaucracy.  
The most important people to test are the mild or presymptomatic.  The very ill patients can be presumed to have CoVID19 or another infectious virus, and all precautions can be taken.  It is the mild and presymptomatic who are out grocery shopping, serving food for take away,  working at checkout counters, hopping on planes and spreading the virus. If these mild and presymptomatic cases are identified they can be quarantined and their contacts can be identified and quarantined. In Asia there are apps that people can volunteer to have their cell phone GPS data uploaded so anyone in contact with a diagnosed case within two weeks prior to onset can be informed and quarantined. Any software developers out there? We cannot do anything about the monumental failures to test and to supply our medical teams and hospitals in the past. We can start now to do everything humanly possible to support our healthcare professionals and scientists and to contain this virus going forward. Starting now."
2020-03-28 20:15:41,"This pandemic may just be the Perfect Storm.  Disasters typically require multiple things to go wrong in order to be really bad.  The Titanic sinking is a great example: Construction problems, a captain racing the clock, calm waters, and a sense of invulnerability all come together to create a disaster beyond what would be imagined.

Same thing here maybe.  A virus that is highly contagious, has a high mortality rate and is very stealthy.  A president who downplays the virus for 6 weeks, losing precious time, and then continues to bumble and make mistakes and not take it seriously all in the name of reelection.  A percentage of the populace that isn’t taking it as seriously as it should.  A weakened federal pandemic response machinery.  And initial mistakes in testing by the CDC.  

The Perfect Storm that just may show that, yes, it can happen here and it can happen to us and our generation."
2020-03-28 19:59:20,"All of this is lapses in leadership. 

Good tests were there to be had.  Not getting them is a leadership failure.  A career ending one in a well run world. 

Regulatory hurdles have exceptions.  Good leadership would have made those exceptions. Not making those exceptions should be a career ending failure. 

And nuts who sneer at science are a leading part of this administrations leadership failure.  Should be a career ending failure.  But the people who brought us the war on false pretenses in Iraq only to make Iran stronger and us weaker and the Great Recession and now the worst outcomes on the pandemic despite the most lead time and chance to get ready are and will do fine. 

But the Times will do its bit to soften the blow of the Trump administration incompetence from top to bottom and eagerly publish the excuses from unnamed white noise sources who continue to muck it up as gospel truth. 

Principles of free market my foot. 

This is the easy pandemic. Easily killed.  Easily avoided. Not as deadly as the bad ones. Not bad on the young.  Medical knowledge so advanced and widespread the solution time is faster than in the history of mankind. We are mucking up the easy one because of those who have been elected leaders.  And Biden hiding and trembling for fear he will say the wrong thing."
2020-03-28 20:08:53,"“Dr. Stephen Hahn, 60, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, enforced regulations that paradoxically made it tougher for hospitals, private clinics and companies to deploy diagnostic tests in an emergency.”

‘Paradoxically’?  It’s more like ‘criminally’ and ‘tragically,’ seems to me."
2020-03-28 20:27:25,"And who was pushing the impeachment at that time? Of course Trump was preoccupied with it, as well as the Democrats."
2020-03-28 20:10:39,"When the president is a low information paranoid conspiracy theorist consumed with how any public issue affects his reelection this should come as no surprise.  It was only after the severity of the pandemic became clear that he put someone in charge because that is when he knew it would affect his reelection. Even then he didn't choose someone based on expertise or effectiveness. He chose the most loyal sycophant at hand. Had he left him in charge and exited the stage we would undoubtedly be in a better place now but that is not in his nature. He continued to downplay the threat while stepping on the effective messaging of the expert doctors and scientists.
He is incurious to anything not related to his personal political aspirations until they are and then he can't get out of his own way or in this deadly occasion ours."
2020-03-28 20:31:01,"It was all about getting re-elected.  He and his Administration ignored the warning signs coming out of China.  With South Korea on the ball, that country did its duty in protecting its citizens.  Europe is being decimated by this virus and here in our country with the epicenters being in New York, Washington, California and now Louisiana and will be seeing more epicenters other parts of the country.  And he wants to reopen for business by Easter.    The polls show of an approval rating of Trump handling this health and economic crises is incredible.  Who knew you get better approval ratings for failing to do your job."
2020-03-28 20:32:19,The irony is that if trump handled this well from the get-go he could have contained it and then claimed it a hoax. But he didn’t. And far right people are not immune to the virus. How many of them will die before they take it seriously?
2020-03-28 20:40:32,"It's not a failure to test - it's a failure of leadership.  When members of the Senate knows enough in January and February to sell stocks (and buy biotech stocks), then those members have the duty to ramp up production of supplies and ventilators while pursuing detailed screenings at airports.  They could have also built up staffing to do contact-tracing.  The fact that Trump had no idea continues the theme of his Presidency: a dereliction of duty so he can devote his time and energy enrich himself through the office of the Presidency.  Violation of the emoluments clause is enough for impeachment!  I'm not going to slowly ""adjust"" my standards downward like I'm in an abusive relationship (Republicans should not be graded on a curve, when Democrats like Bill was impeached for a personal affair!)

Now my attention turns to Republican voters:  You don't need a super high IQ, or even a college degree to know that the man in the White House only cares about himself.  Why still support him?  I suspect it is because they see a lot of themselves in him, only they don't have the power or position to thieve like him or Richard Burr.  ""Greed is good"", so their prosperity gospels say...  Imagine that...the moneychangers and Jesus as buddy-buddies.  Now in the fog of corona-war, the GOP and their true (elite) base are creating slush funds to enrich themselves!  *livid!*  We live in a ""plutocratic socialist"" state.  Heads or tails, they always win."
2020-03-28 20:52:22,"As noted below “not testing milder symptoms” was basically a direction from government to pressure health professionals to ration testing due to limited capability. It is being repeated around the world, in the UK, Spain, the Australian government active discouragement of testing is playing with fire, this along with misguided and untruthful information that face masks do not help are two of the catastrophic lies that have contributed disaster now unfolding in the west. At least NYT has exposed that face masks are even more effective policy than social distancing, a mild self help policy !"
2020-03-28 21:00:07,"What can anyone expect of people who have no governmental experience and in many cases do not believe in the mission of government to act for the greater good? Too many only know profit motive and in the end, may have killed the goose that laid the golden egg."

2020-03-28 20:44:17,"It was Trump's failure. While the warnings were coming in, he was laughing, calling it a ""Hoax"" and media/Democratic conspiracy.  He also said there were only five cases which would soon be down to one. We need a chronology of Trump's statements."
2020-03-28 20:51:55,"The predictions by many observers over the three years of Trump's presidency that we've been lucky he's not had to deal with a crisis because if he has to he'd be clueless and the mistakes could hurt everybody and everything.

Well it's here now isn't it and it's on display in every single response of the Trump administration. 
The death tolls overnight in Spain and the climbing toll in France with 2000 deaths so far and the UK over a 1000 deaths. 
Their government responses  haven't been perfect but compared to the US they look a lot better every day as Trump bickers with State governors and goes about the place boasting and preening and lying.

Trump does indeed own this growing disaster in the (un) United States of America."
2020-03-28 20:02:14,The third world like tragedy of our testing failure is that the decision to seek and only dole out infection information came from and continues to come from on high from the medical community.

2020-03-28 20:11:14,"Failure of leadership like the NYC mayor refusing to shut down NYC earlier, even when Cuomo was pushing for that?

Or the NYC health commissioner who, on Jan. 26, said: “We are encouraging New Yorkers to go about their everyday lives and suggest practicing everyday precautions that we do through the flu season.” She added that those “who had recently traveled from Wuhan were not being urged to self-quarantine or avoid large public gatherings.”

I read that various NYC officials continued saying that for weeks.'

I don't fault these people, but let's be honest and admit that lots of people/officials were underestimating things early on."
2020-03-28 20:29:48,"It is becoming more and more obvious with each passing day how Trump bankrupted six businesses.

The only question left is:  With his recent tsunami of catastrophic (and deadly) blunders, how could it have been only six?"
2020-03-28 20:42:24,"Look, this one is on Trump.  He hired the heads of these departments and he fired the heads of these departments.  The work or non-work of each agency that worked well or failed abominably is on Trump’s watch.  The buck does stop at Trump. He has caused the deaths of hundreds of us so far, and he will cause the deaths of thousands more of us before a vaccine is developed and deployed to put an end to this virus.  We all know that Trump will absolve himself of any blame because he is incapable of leadership, but we all know the truth — that he above all others is to blame."

In the coming weeks, need to be aware the political shell game that Trump and the GOP are trying to play with the ""we will reopen in two weeks"" mantra. This is clearly something they know people will not follow but that they can later say would have ""saved the economy if we only listened to Trump."" Its a cheap attempt to pull yet another con. 

Trump's legacy is death to the masses so he can claim some fantasy about his role with the economy. Anyone who follows this madness is a threat to humanity."

That would have eliminated the inter-agency squabbles and cut through time wasting protocols as described at the FDA.
This will come out in full eventually and land squarely in the lap of the president. Remember, nobody was more prolific on Twitter in criticizing every buck that should have stopped at Obama's oval office door than Trump."
2020-03-28 20:06:11,"One issue insufficiently discussed is the manner in which this administration has confiscated the TV networks. Around noon and 6 o'clock, prime news time on most days of the week, they clogged the passage of information by blocking the free press, what President Trump labels ""fake news"". They then transmitted incoherent and scattered bits of information. True, false, or misleading? Let let the viewer decide. Based on what? If a viewer chooses to switch from NBC to CNN? Same press conference. No alternative.

One network for such announcements would be sufficient. Let the news channels select one outlet each day for transmission of any press conference, place that network selection on a chyron, and allow the viewers choose which news source they wish to view."

By the end of the month, Mr. Trump claimed the virus was about to dissipate in the United States, saying: “It’s going to disappear. ""

I was overseas in early January, when the reports started coming in from Wuhan.  I immediately changed my travel plans, gauging the amount of time to get home.  My home is both New York and Canada, I chose to go to Canada, because I know that there is a sound, connected, health care system that could deal with an epidemic.  The first person who was identified with the virus, was identified through a flu study in Seattle in early February. That study was shut down, a cruise ship was denied entry, because Trump like his numbers.  Dr. Faucia, called for more testing, but was apparently brought before the principal and got more in line with his praise and the president's actions of shutting borders...totally irrelevant, since China has already quarantined and restricted travel on many of its residents.  Then there was this curious Dr. Birx, saying that the US demanded more rigorous testing and regulations, to assure there were fewer false positives and negatives.  Really?  There are global health regulations, the EU and Canada's are stricter.  We turned down tests, and the result is we have the most cases.  Trump is responsible for this debacle."

And for two years, he worked as Ken Starr’s deputy on the Clinton Whitewater investigation.""
Mr. Azar should have never been given the leadership of two major, health related, federal agencies with these credentials. But I am not surprised, given the number of Scaramuccis that Mr. Trump has hired!"

I remember it so well because I was concerned about family members in California. And here we are, just one month later, in a totally changed world. I know Trump apologists who keep saying we have to look forward, not back (that must be something from Fox News, because I saw someone mention it here in the comments). Of course, we have to move forward as quickly as possible, but even now mixed messages coming from Trump continue to cause harm. I’m no expert, but from the very start I’ve been saying, they need to test more people. If we had acted early with stricter social distancing guidelines and more testing, and if we had a mask culture and masks available, we would have been able to take Sweden’s and South Korea’s strategy of keeping the economy open. (I remember the Surgeon General’s press conference on masks where he was close to ridiculing people for trying to get masks. If we have a shortage of masks, whose fault is that?) We had more warning than any other country. Okay, so maybe now isn’t the time for blame, but when this is all over, there will be a detailed post mortem that will show what a total failure Trump was. Elect a narcissistic con man, and this is what you get."

Under NO circumstances will our country be accepting of Trump taking over oversight of the funds to be issued to any entity.
We all need to voice this to our representatives and senator, say absolutely NOT. NO more power grabbing, and it smacks as bad faith in the middle of a pandemic."
2020-03-28 20:11:17,"Testing, testing, testing. It's always been about testing. Until anyone can get a test, for any reason, at any time, we aren't testing enough. All the data from all the tests needs to be consolidated, and then ""the numbers"" crunched, until we know what we are facing, and what resources are needed where, when. Until then we are always catching up, always reacting to events rather than being proactive.

Trump slow-walked testing because he didn't want ""the numbers"" to make him look bad. Of course Trump uses ""hunches"" and ""my gut"" to make decisions. No thanks, I think I want my health and safety to be subject to more data-driven decision making.

Ignorance is no way to fight a pandemic. And as we are discovering again, ignorance is no way to lead a country. Remember in November - show up and vote."

     I'm a physics professor who consults with NASA on ""advanced concepts"".  One of the most frustrating problems I have encountered in this work is the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome, the tendency for the NASA Centers (Johnson, Huntsville, JPL, ...) to ignore any ideas and inventions that were not developed in-house.
     It's clear that the NIH and the CDC suffer from exactly the same Syndrome.  The imperative to force the use of a locally-developed test for COVID-19, even after an initial failure, took precedence over speed in getting the testing done to head off the spread of the Corona virus.  Probably the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome by our leading scientists will lead to thousands, perhaps millions, of extra deaths from COVID-19."
2020-03-28 20:28:19,"There was no urgency applied to the problem when it first appeared on the radar. Instead, the situation bears the whiff of decision making by ""hunch"".

2020-03-28 21:00:15,"The French have a saying : ""With enough ""if onlys"" you could put Paris in bottle"".

My problem with all these ""if onlys""stories the press keep publishing .. is the pretence that any of the things everyone ""would have liked"" were then or even possible yet today. 

How does harping on what wasn't going to help going forward and facing the actual situation today: how to mitigate or slow the spread until better solutions are available? 

There were not millions of tests available to the US, nor the spare medical personnel or administration employees to track people the way they were in South Korea, not to mention privacy laws and culture. 

By the time this hit the US, most other countries were battling for the same finite numbers of tests, equipment, ventilators. Nor did we have the numbers of trained personnel needed... 

Can we focus on what we all need to do today to support all those fighting for us ... and slow the spread? Those are the things our press need to be communicating non stop to the nation about...."

But no, he kept it under wraps over the coming election & possibly hurting his chances for a 2nd term. 

His contentious relationship with nearly everyone is coming out in very ugly & unhelpful forms.

His single biggest problem is his own credibility now. Having been caught in so many lies and misstatements, the majority no longer have any faith or trust in his actions. THIS is why he won't be re-elected."

Up until now, this made-for-television administration has been able to coast on its belief in the hubris of its ill-informed base. FOX News has led the disinformation illusion that Donald Trump is a great president, when in fact, he has absolutely no idea what he's doing. He's a third rate actor miscast in reality, and his time has come and gone. Like all shooting stars, real or metaphoric, he's burned out long before he's ever touched the ground. The Trump administration is now an administration in name only. The governors of the states have taken the lead in this battle, and Trump just stands on the stage at those briefings, looking like a middle-school-student-principal-for-a-day. Unfortunately, this day that should have been so much fun for him is filled with a genuine crisis, and he spends his time pouting and whining, since he has no real leadership skills. He needs to resign today."

2020-03-28 20:48:00,"So once again the ""experts"" failed ordinary Americans.

All of these people are M.D.s or former biotech people.

Why has no one at senior staff levels at CDC and FDA been fired?

Why are the GS-15's and up being left off the hook?

The blind desire to blame Trump, and Trump alone, will come back to haunt America.

The instinct of the ""meritocratic"" class to circle the wagons and protect itself once again is outrageous.  (After the derivatives meltdown in 2008, the Iraq War, the decision to admit China to the WTO and ship 5 million American jobs to China, the decision to join NAFTA and ship millions of American jobs to Mexico, the decision to ignore the opioid crisis until millions of working class Americans were dead, virtually all of the ""experts"" have proven themselves unworthy of trust.)"
2020-03-28 20:53:17,"Trump was focused on ""keeping the numbers low"" and did so by making sure that testing was virtually impossible to get (unless you are/were rich).

Trump routinely denied any problems, and even the virus until the economy was impacted, and suddenly the virus stopped being a Democrat created hoax and he switched to calling the virus a real danger to the country.

There are millions of Americans that are 10,000% sure that this whole thing is a hoax, and are not taking any steps to prevent the spread, and in some cases, are intentionally taking part in gatherings where the virus can spread.

We had a month, a whole glorious month, to prepare.  We didn't.  Well, some did.  However, the average citizens greatest resource - the US Federal Government, did as little as possible.  This is due to the complete disregard for the American public held by Trump.

Trump refused to prepare the government, and he is utterly incapable of handling a real emergency.  He is the ultimate armchair/hindsight quarterback, however when the chips are down and the 3rd most populous nation in the world needs a bold, strong leader...he has utterly failed to perform.  Trump is wholly impotent when we need competence."

Virus testing is like pregnancy testing. It will only tell you if you are positive. It does not prevent one.

Everyone knew about the epidemic when Trump ordered the travel ban from China. 
If the governors and mayors had taken more personal responsibility instead of spending time ridiculing Trump and turning a blind eye to spring breaks, the U.S would not have been blind sided."

Trump and Congress when Trump had a Republican majority cut CDC and NIH funding in 2018. 

Specifically the defunded a CDC global pandemic response network in 49 countries, used by President Obama to successfully contain and treat Ebola at the source.

Trump and Congressional Republicans disbanded a Bush era program, continued by President Obama, called “Predict,” which had identified over 1000 viruses, including a strain of Ebola.

Trump-Pence and Republicans in Congress focused instead on rushing through a corporate tax cut that increased the structural annual deficits in excess of a trillion dollars to gin up the stock market. 

Didn’t last long, did it.

Trump browbeat the Fed to increase monetary stimulus a year before the Trump Virus Crisis.

As recently as two months ago, Trump wanted to cut the budgets of the CDC and NiH further.

Now the country doesn’t have enough face masks or ventilators, and trump is paralyzed to act. He only acts quickly when money is involved."

But we must learn from this and develop protocols which will proactively address future pandemics. We have the public health and medical expertise to identify and target problems but, as is blatantly obvious, our health care professionals lack essential supplies and resources. According to our president we have the greatest military in the world, the largest cache of arms, planes, etc., etc. but we have a broken and woefully underfunded health care system - CDC, HEW. NIH, all have had their budgets ravaged and cut by the Trump administration and now we see the fruits of their labor. Tragic, unavoidable  and derelict.

The sequence of the virus was published in January.  All hands should have been on deck immediately rather than telling the American people that everything was under control and it would go away, despite the alarm bells going off among the medical community.  Meanwhile Senator Burr and others (including Trump??) were dumping stock and investing in health care suppliers, saying one thing to the public and another thing privately.  This is a nightmare beyond what anyone could have imagined, notwithstanding the novels that were written describing a pandemic originating in Asia.  We have lost precious time during which we could have immediately ramped up testing, traced contacts, and implemented public health strategies to contain it.  Now we are trying desperately to catch up while our health care workers struggle without adequate equipment and are becoming ill themselves.  There will be many more deaths and suffering.   This is all due to Trump and those who have aided and abetted him.  What has happened to our country???  Despite all of our problems and ills, we always aspired to something better, always found a way to survive the worst.  We will somehow survive this, but only because of all the heroes whose stories will be written, but we will have paid such an unbelievably high price, some of which was preventable."

2020-03-28 21:05:05,"Although the incompetence and inflexibility of the government bureaucracy with regards to test was a substantial problem, a current more significant issue leading to viral amplification is the awful behavior of large portions of the United States population:   Many are not obeying the shelter in place orders or practicing distancing, and are still maintaining social activities.  They make excuses for theirselfs why they should be exempt.  Not wearing masks further contributes to infection amplification.   Local governments should impose stiff penalties to those that are not conforming similar to those in the Asian countries and Germany."

Your president has minimized the danger, wanted to not let passengers disembark from a cruise ship because it would increase 'his' numbers, dawdled while infections went undiscovered, disagreed with expert scientists and physicians, boasted that he ""gets this stuff"" and at the same time claiming that ""I'm Not Sure Anybody Even Knows What It Is"" (we know EXACTLY what it is, the genome was sequenced within weeks of discovery of the virus), lied repeatedly about numbers of infected in your country, claims it's Obama's fault, incites racism by calling it the 'China Virus' and then announces that he knew it was a pandemic before the experts did. This is nowhere near a complete list of the lies, obfuscation and efforts to rewrite history. Yet, his approval numbers have never been higher?

Trump is mentally unwell and this is the kind of leadership you get with someone who is more concerned about their ""legacy"", than the health and well being of the people they are  supposed to serve.

But they are not as drenched in the Trump meme because they are not in America having the falsehoods so ambient. Right away any Trumpists reading this far, is turned off by the word ambient. That is enough for them to completely dismiss what I am saying... sigh.
Anyway I was talking to a very conservative last friend by phone night and was amazed to hear him criticise Trump at last. What was the tipping point for him? The Down to Zero comment by Trump set against the100,000 COVID19US figure which is the number equal to the capacity of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He can immediately visualise how many people that is and he saw Trump saying zero and his other ridiculous comments denying the reality.
Now even more powerful than that is that his conservative wife is a nurse on an Indigenous community and has already carried out swabs on white people visiting the Aboriginal town she works in.
He is a smart guy and has suddenly started ridiculing Trump. His life is at risk through his wife. True story."

There's another important intervention - strongly urged by the public health officials and scientists in the Asian countries that have controlled their epidemics - that we in the West continue to ignore and scoff at: wearing masks. Yes, there aren't enough surgical-style masks to go around. But other countries swear by them, and Taiwan's government is pumping out 10M masks/ day for the general public. Masks clearly work. We should make it a priority to produce them, teach effective wearing to the public, and make it a cultural norm. It will be an essential part of how we manage this virus in the years to come. Our reticence now is foolish, and will be viewed as such very soon.

I have been trying to reach my doctors who belong to an IvyLeague university practice. After 3 calls and several emails I talked to a nurse practitioner who advised me to stay at home. She mentioned a test would take a week / 10 days to get back with results. No one has recommended me to get tested even after calling the practice a few times. I am unable to reach any of the doctors in the practice. 

Me and my family are anxious and wish I could get tested. We think a test would be crucial for us to implement even more stringent isolation at home than we are doing now. 

CDC guidelines on health care workers using appropriate PPE during surgery are full of holes given the lack of symptoms during 2 - 14 days after infection. Anesthesiologists and other operating room staff lack proper PPE. Some apparently elective surgeries continue to be performed occupying all important ICU beds and ventilators."

2020-03-28 21:39:08,"As a laboratory scientist, I feel that it's important to acknowledge the years that go into developing and validating laboratory tests. There's no point in rushing a test to the market only to find that it yields too many 'false positives' (a positive result when the person doesn't have the disease) or 'false negatives' (a negative result in a person who doesn't have the disease). Both can be devastating to a patient and misleading for public health investigations. 
This coronavirus is called 'novel' for a reason: we've never encountered it before (though we've seen organisms like it). While there are protocols in place to ramp up test development, these processes don't turn on a dime. They need time to be validated and implemented responsibly. I salute my colleagues as they work behind the scenes to put accurate and valid testing procedures in place."

I think this is misleading.  There was high-level interest--in not doing adequate testing to identify infections.  Trump repeatedly discounted the number of infections publicly, or even the need for concern, all through the period this article covers.  If anyone doubts that the message from the very top was ""if there are infected people I don't want to hear about it,"" just look at his public admission of precisely that point, when he objected to allowing the cruise ship passengers disembark because it would ""make our numbers go up.""

I asked them to provide me with information on any studies which evaluated the use of facemasks, as a google search finds almost no studies in Western literature on the efficacy of facemasks (I think you can search Asian literature with the help of google translate, I havent done this but apparently there is research in Asian journals to show they are effective).

But the fact is our lack of vital supplies at this critical time comes from a fatal error in our strategic planning.  It is the ultimate failure of globalization and everything it stands for.

Critical medical supplies including surgical-grade masks, N95 respirators, gowns, protective eyeware, most pharmaceutical drugs, all PPE in every industry, ventilators, sterile swabs, and a whole bunch more have not been manufactured on American soil for at least two decades now.  Even the basic components needed for the COVID diagnostic assay, the reagents and such, are made abroad, all mostly in China.  When the Chinese cut off supply lines to us to keep these things for themselves in their own crisis, and when we embargoed them as well, we lost our only supply because we somehow had suddenly lost the ability to make these things overnight.  Only it was 20+ years in the making, and we let major multinational corporations talk us all into oh so easily.

""Pray to God and row to shore,"" as my sainted mother used to say.  ""International Trade"" is a fine thing for those who have nothing to keep or protect.

Our mutual assistance and the central coordination of efforts to overcome all adversaries is the strongest part of our ability to self-govern. 

That the current occupant of the office of President can not grasp this simple concept is the main reason he must be removed from office as soon as is possible by the people. 

We are well past the concept of political parties or partisan interests, our ability to self-govern and survive is now threatened by a clear and present danger in the form of blind partisan ignorance exhibited by a man of willful ignorance who would easily fail a basic US history test and has no knowledge of our mutual civic duty."

There were delays, tests that did not prove to be accurate and bureaucratic rules that contributed to the inability to start testing early when the virus was first found in Washington state.

However, I believe that further investigative reporting will reveal that Donald J. Trump gave a “stand down” order loud and clear to the agency heads that as little testing as possible should be done. He made it perfectly clear in the very beginning when he resisted the passengers from cruise ship disembarking because he didn’t want the numbers to go up.

In fact, given the evidence, one wonders why most of these people are in charge of anything at this point. The insistence of the US in developing its own screening test and not relying on the WHO test is reminiscent of what happened in France in the 1980s: A test for screening blood for HIV had been developed in the US, but the French refused it, waiting for its own test. As a result, blood transfusions were not screened for HIV for a time and people got infected and died."

Dr. Aylward is correct. We need to know if the ones around us  have the virus, or not. Especially in the hospital––we need to know. There is no tele-med for us. The frontline worker is at the bedside. We are in close proximity to our patients. Some of us interact with the most vulnerable, and at risk populations. We want to protect everyone, including ourselves. Currently we check only the temperature of the health care worker prior to their shift. Is this enough? 
How long did Italy and China wait before they tested the staff? Did they not warn us? Am I mistaken? 
I ask these questions not for myself, but for my patients.
The R-naught on this is anywhere between 2.6-4.4. We just don't know the exact rate of transmission yet, but we do know it is high. We also know some of us could be asymptomatic, or have few symptoms. Would it not be prudent to test us? If we did this, we could quarantine the ones that test positive. 
It's hard for me to believe that all of us in the field have negative Covid tests, but that data we cannot study. We aren't testing unless there are symptoms, and even then it is  difficult to get tested. Italy has encouraged us to test our hospital staff.

2020-03-28 22:29:43,"This excellent article reveals one glaring conclusion:  the responsibility of this national fiasco lies squarely at the feet of Donald Trump.  

The “Deep State” within the federal government is, or was, a corps of highly competent, dedicated public servants well versed in marshaling the resources of the government in fulfillment of public service, and these people were ESSENTIAL to effective government in both its daily activities and in times of crisis like we now face.

Political ideology and loyalty, regardless of whether or not one has  an M.D. after their name or clerked for Anthony Scalia, is no substitute for highly competent administrators who value public service.  I feel for all the Trump appointees mentioned in this piece, but respectfully, they should not have taken those jobs, as much as I know many of them are trying as best they can.  Being an oncologist does not qualify one to run a huge government agency.

If we are going to point fingers when this is all over, my finger will be pointing to the millions of Trump supporters who cannot make the distinction between loyalty and competence.  If the “Deep State” had been running the show, we would be in a far better place as a nation right now."

Certainly that would be easier than making thousands of ventilators. And would maybe buy us some more time to play catch up."
2020-03-28 22:27:40,"It was painfully obvious that the Trump administration did not want testing. If they did not actually block it, as I believe they did, they did fail to enable streamlined implementation. The word was that Mr Trump did not want to use ""foreign"" designed test kits.

2020-03-28 22:12:58,"Thank you.  This is the detailed report that I have been awaiting.   It looks like the primary failure was in the career employees of the agencies.   The leadership failure by the political appointees was a failure to recognize the obstruction and address it with the force and flexibility that the circumstance called for.  That is what political appointees are for.   

“Dr. Hahn maintained that his agency had moved as quickly as it safely could to ensure that tests would be accurate.”   The problem with that statement is the word “ensure.”     In health care regulation I have have worked with people who love that word and use it a lot.  They are incorrigible obstructionists who refuse to recognize the lethal costs of their perfection.   The perfect is the enemy of the good.   Dr. Hahn’s job was to recognize and defeat that bureaucratic pathology, not echo it.     

In a just nation with accountability, the next question would be where he shall live in exile when expelled from the nation that he did so much to destroy by inaction.  Of course it doesn’t work that way.   He is one of the lumps floating at the top of the tank and they do well no matter what harm they do."

Instead of testing as many people as possible and isolating those specific people (like Iceland), the president, with the body politic's blessing, has assembled an ad hoc response. 

Now that the ""cat is out of the bag"", deaths, due to COVID-19, the Trump administration is confused as to what to do. 

If they test more Americans Trump's team will discover more people who have contracted the virus, if they wait till summer and don't test aggressively, maybe it will ""go away"". However, if they do the latter, it may also get worse. 

Trump's team should be testing more so as to isolate and quarantine, but it's a thing of national pride and saving face now. This will not end well. Especially for those in my beautiful state, Georgia."
2020-03-28 22:23:56,"Great reporting. The failure started as sson as Trump was elected and they pursued their extreme "" deep- state"" anti-science agenda. 

The failure to fund the restocking of critical PPE (which pre-dates, but was nonetheless exacerbated by Trump's policies),  the failure to appoint experts in key positions, the failure to take the warnings of numerous experts seriously and the tendency to look at individuals through a highly political rather than a competency lens,  the dismantling of the NSC office dedicated to pandemic response , the firing of its competant director, and the rescission of   its funding, are just some of the devastating decisions that have contributed to the U.S. leading the world in having the worst response to date of any country.

At the head of this is a leader that is wholly incompetant, and looks at the crisis soley through the lens of his own personal political interests, a party that refuses to remove him to save the country and, a public that is so misinformed that a majority believe he is doing a good job. 

We already have the most cases ( and the numbers are of course much larger), in a matter of weeks we will have, by a wide-margin, the highest death toll. And our econmy will be in shambles.

As an expert in disaster response, it is unimaginable that we have put ourselves in this position given the resources, the expertise, and the planning that has gone into preparing for such an event. It is wrenching to watch and it did not have to happen."

2020-03-28 23:06:12,"The key lesson from these - unfortunately still early - dropped balls must be to be open to breaking with established healthcare paradigms in the US. While most of the attention is on diagnostics tests today, there are other paradigms we may have to break with that can be equally or even more significant to get the pandemic under control. Most notably, the concept of asymptomatic cases not being infectious - or, nota bene, cases  undetectable by tests  don't infect others. Inexplicably, our medical professionals still don't think that the general population should wear surgical masks, while Eastern Asian countries where the use of masks is widespread year round, experience no or much less uncontrolled outbreaks (for instance Japan with one of the highest population density in the world, exposed to the virus early on). What this suggests is an efficient transfection by asymptomatic cases that could be well mitigated by the general use of surgical masks."
2020-03-28 23:00:58,"How blind could we be, to the urgency of recognizing a developing epidemia, and doing something about it? Official rigidity, and the fear of crossing a vulgar bully's ego, unable to hear, and listen, bad news, nor be contradicted, let alone criticized, made for a comedy (tragedy, actually) of errors...that the U.S. population is paying dearly. What is galling is Trump's ongoing braggadoccio about his 'perfect response' to this crisis, against all evidence. Similar to his arrogant demand of being exonerated from a legitimate impeachment for trying to sell the nation's security...with foreign help, to make it easier to re-assault the presidency again. All this with the complicit approval of the sold-out G.O.P.  So, how to explain that something as 'simple' as the idea of early and frequent 'testing', so to know the spread of the coronavirus and it's contagion for lack of social distancing, in such an advanced country, before it was too late...but for the crying?"
2020-03-28 21:52:44,"This only confirms that career officials in government agencies were largely to blame, and not the Trump appointees.  While Trump should be held accountable, as well as the people he picked to head the agencies, top scientists and administrators failed when the consequences of not doing their jobs well counted most.
Further proof that Trump's incompetence is not the primary cause can be seen by looking at Europe. Not just one country, but nearly every major power has failed spectacularly in a similar manner, with even greater consequences (Italy, Spain, France).
In New York, it was obvious that the governor and mayor, especially in the absence of adequate testing, should have acted sooner, closing the bars and restaurants, schools, enforcing social distancing, and most of all getting the media and public to understand what no testing meant. They didn't, because evidently their top advisers didn't explain the likely consequences, even with Italy already crashing.
Where was the media? Why is the New York Times doing a story on testing now, instead of two months ago, or one month ago, if this was obvious to experts?
Either no one could know, or the New York Times at least should have known it's importance. This paper, with all it's resources, and access to top scientists, did not.

2020-03-28 23:12:38,"Now that the United States is importing and manufacturing tests, the important question is how we will use them. 

Will we use them to identify infections in individuals at their earliest stages and isolate them before they infect anyone else? This will require aggressive testing through contact tracing and rigorously quarantining those who test positive in an effort to contain the virus. 

Or will we use them only after people show symptoms so we can use the results to plan their treatment? Combined with social distancing, this can flatten the curve. But if we don't aggressively test people and identify those who are positive and asymptomatic, we are going to eventually infect 20 to 40 percent of the population until we presumably acquire herd immunity.

The first strategy will require a massive mobilization of public health workers and volunteers. The second strategy will result in a huge number of deaths (at least 1 percent of 20 percent of the population, or 600,000 people).

The most important task for our national leaders is to pick a strategy, mobilize the nation, and execute it."

Recently I watched “Contagion”, which is quite disturbing since the virus in that movie is much deadlier than coronavirus. Afterwards, I had to calm down by reminding myself that the movie was not real, just fiction. Another evidence that “Contagion“ was fiction: in the movie, the CDC actually did their job."

The cat was out of the bag in the United States by January 20th. What might have helped was China shutting its own borders to air/sea/land traffic in early January, but it was not willing to take that hit alone. Instead, the world got hit.

We are a country that thrives on the ability to make profits and is powerfully militarily  but. we don't know how to turn that power into a positive and truly make the world a better place which, we are now finding that we can't even do it for ourselves."
2020-03-28 19:36:45,"How many tests could $2 trillion have purchased 6 weeks ago?

The magnitude of the failure is hard to really get your head around.  

There is a kid who should be in pre-K right now who won’t go to college because of this mistake.   There are untold thousands that will never retire.  There are thousands of families who will lose loved ones. 

We’ll be paying for this mistake for generations."
2020-03-28 20:01:23,"From here in Canada, the US response has seemed to be (predictably for this administration) incoherent.  There does seem to be one advanced western country, Sweden, taking the tack of targeting and protecting known vulnerable individuals rather than locking down the population.  Sweden appears to have and at least to think it has a healthy socialist health services infrastructure.  The UK seemed to going the same way a few weeks ago, but is collapsing into behind the curve lockdown Italian-style after a decade of underfunding the NHS makes it untenable.  Canada built up socialized national and provincial pandemic responses following SARS and H1N1, and its boring but preternaturally compliant population is taking to the lockdown fairly well so far.  The virus may have Darwinian consequences for some responsible political authorities, if not populations, over the longer term - possibly a silver lining to the dark cloud."
2020-03-28 21:33:31,Too late.  It is everywhere now. We need to focus the the most of the energy in getting reliable antibody tests.
2020-03-28 20:43:48,We read about lack of testing and lack of tests. Certainly they are connected. Who is responsible for the lack of tests? What agencies? What individuals? We need to know so mistakes can be corrected.
2020-03-28 21:55:13,"The one thing I'm having trouble understanding-- and I fully believe community spread has been here in big international cities/metro areas since late January-- is if it's been spreading for this long, why did we not see a big rush on ICUs, ventilators before now? Is it simply that numbers had not yet reached a large enough sum? Were these things in fact happening but explained by other purposes? I would love to hear an answer on this."
2020-03-28 23:05:30,"Despite the concept of testing early, many other factors also were in play. Flights from overseas were incoming from all over Europe as well. No one was screened or quarantined as well. China was not the sole source of infection. We never took charge immediately to stop this early. Testing alone was not going to prevent this outbreak."
2020-03-28 23:05:39,"There are still other things that can be done to unravel this mess. There was a sharp rise in ""flu-like"" illness in New York City the second week of January. There were anecdotal reports of ""abnormal"" chest radiographs and other unusual ""pneumonias"". It is entirely possible that COVID has been here since the first or second week of January. We need to know, because this will change disease prediction models. It is possible to look back at patient records, to review chest x-rays for classic signs. It is imperative to begin testing of New Yorkers using serology. This will help us plan for the future. These measures must be done on a state wide level. We should not expect any action from Washington, because they are to blame for the spread of this pathogen and will now seek to hide their tracks. For those in Washington, blame will come soon enough."
2020-03-28 23:10:26,excellent reporting. This article names specific persons responsible for the situation we are in. They must be held accountable.
2020-03-28 23:20:02,"So we knew about it as early as Jan 1st and didn’t start testing meaningfully until the second week of March.

And yet we’re told it was a Chinese cover-up which prevented us from taking action.

So which is it? It seems like a failure of our federal government because we sat on our hands for at least eight weeks."
2020-03-28 23:24:01,"My mom probably got the virus. She showed all the symptoms. She called her doctor countless times, asking for a test. They told her that since her symptoms aren't severe enough and she isn't a part of an at-risk group, she just needs to tough it out. My dad and I live with her, so of course, we're exposed to it (currently don't have symptoms, but who knows). The overall number of 100,000 is probably so far off, it's mind-blowing. 

Trump did this to us. It is on his shoulders, on his hands."
2020-03-28 23:08:50,"If, I understand what I have read and heard on legitimate news sources, we are still not testing enough to know where we are in this pandemic.  The President spews inane, nonsensical number at each briefing.  He boasts that we tested more in 8 days than South Korea did in 8 weeks, but when one grasps reality,  it's clear that South Korea has tested far more of its citizens than we have ours.  South Korea, China and Taiwan used social distancing far earlier than we have to a distinct advantage.  

It's clear that President Trump's and his administration's incompetence have resulted in a life threatening delay to all Americans.  The President can lie, blame and demean anyone he cares to, but it will not alter the facts, that he is responsible for our present, deadly circumstances.  Like it or not Mr. Trump, you are accountable for your administration."
2020-03-28 23:12:58,"When people pull on this thread many many unsettling realities may come to the fore. This pandemic, this world wide financial collapse, this terrible event for so many individuals, families, very likely is something certain well placed persons have been and will continue to seek to profit from.

To the extent that is true, this is not just a natural disaster but a criminal conspiracy of world historical proportions.

For instance:
The democrats insisted that there be oversight over the dismemberment of the $ 500 billion in the 3rd bailout bill. At the time trump said he would be the oversight, no oversight  needed, with a straight face!

Now just after the signing of the bill the president has stated via signing statement, he has no intention of being held to the oversight established in the bill. 

Can there be any clearer evidence of who stands for what?

Now all the public has to do is connect the dots. It is true that some horrors are so unbelievable that most will simply not believe their own eyes. Other dictators have made good use of this psychological condition.

Other related observations: some  $750 billions for the so called defense dept. and yet no provisions for the basic needs of a nation facing this sort of pandemic?  Not to mention basic health care for each and every one us. How about we divert half of the defense budget to that end?

Follow the money. Also someone please pull the curtain away from the man DJT back there-he has no clothes among other things."
2020-03-28 23:00:21,"The president didn't want testing because he wanted to keep the numbers low...and in his alternate reality, not testing was the solution."
2020-03-28 22:26:05,"Some are arguing that the incompetent response from the federal government shows that the federal government should be given no further resources.

Others argue that it was the governments regs that have prevented tests being stood up on the spot.

1.It is the intent of the trump administration to do a incompetent job, thereby undermining the public's confidence in the governments role. This hold true for not only his conduct relative to the CDC and or pandemic committee on the NSC, but also for any other agency that might provide oversight of his administration, in all it's illegality.

2. The time to stand up the testing kits was not after the fact, it was prior to the fact. The administration had prior warning, not only from the events in China, but also from the intelligence warning of a coming tsunami, months before the virus reached the U.S.

What is stunning about persons attempting to defend the president, or shift blame to the federal government regulations, is that they refuse to acknowledge any of the malfeasance of the president, though it is happening every day.

He runs the federal gov. He and his crony in the justice dept. B.Barr, have argued that he has almost unlimited power. Yet when the situation demands it, he is front and center misleading, deceiving, and generally thinking about his poll numbers. At the same unable to act in a coherent manner.

It would have been better in fact if he were completely AWOL, leaving it to the experts to call the shots."
2020-03-28 23:12:29,"The 'German/WHO test' methodology is published online. All 297 known Covid-19 samples tested +ve. The test discriminated completely against related animal Coronavirus (including bat variant). NO significant false +ve reactions were obtained with control samples containing other common human respiratory viral pathogens. Weak/equivocal false +ve reactions were obtained in 4/297 (1.35%).

Check for yourself. The German paper (Berlin Institute of Virology with British, French, Dutch and Swiss co-authorship) is easily accessible.

Firstly we heard that the WHO test was unacceptably inaccurate. Now the excuse is that the CDC test was 'potentially more accurate'. A smokescreen for inactivity and complacency, I reckon."
2020-03-28 23:23:09,"The article states that, after Pence was anointed to be the guy in charge, the “testing has ramped up quickly, with nearly 100 labs at hospitals and elsewhere performing it.” What? Right after that sentence, the article continues to explain that not everyone can get a test, at least if one’s symptoms are milder.  i think the authors overstate whether testing has truly “ramped up.” A simple google search would produce many articles that explain that testing still lags behind in certain areas (e.g., Texas). The authors’ own statement that tests aren’t always available undermines the premise that testing has ramped up. With so many authors for this article, one would think that someone would have caught this unsupported characterization of the status of testing."
2020-03-28 23:26:43,"Spent more than three decades developing  medical tests. I just looked at the CDC's latest protocol for testing COVID-19. IT IS NOT A COMPLICATED TEST and except that the samples are quite hazardous the actual testing could be done by any competent undergraduate student. What I see is that rather than trying to solve a problem, they chose to try to prove that the CDC is the only standard and the public health labs must be incompetent for being unable to get that kit to work. And the FDA left it to the CDC to just go on believing that. Any testing lab given an option would have switched to a method that gave better results. There was a option, the WHO method. Except in the USA. Such arrogance in the CDC and FDA is criminal."
2020-03-28 23:32:42,"Experience matters, from the top on down. Trump has been scraping the bottom of the barrel for political appointees with little to no agency management experience, while the Republican Party has been chipping away at funding for federal research for decades because ""the private sector is better"". Look where all this great leadership has gotten us. Trump and the Republicans own the death and the economic crash. Here's hoping folks remember in November."
2020-03-28 23:38:18,"It's a laudatory goal to say that ""mistakes were made"" and instead of trying to assign blame we should all work together to find solutions.  It would be a lot easier to do that if the individual leading this country were able to say ""I'm sorry I didn't take this as seriously as I should have, but for the rest of my time as President I'm going to do everything I can for the American people.""  That would get a lot more people on his side than ""I don't take responsibility for anything."""
2020-03-28 23:40:57,"I have yet to hear a convincing explanation for the delay in implementing a test in the US. I only see  finger pointing. Once the sequence of virus was  publicly available, it was a simple matter of applying well-established quantitative PCR technology.  A first year grad student could have designed the test in a day.  The FDA regulatory issues for laboratory developed tests are a red herring.  Enforcement of the regulations could have been quickly suspended .  All signs point to incompetent management.  Will anyone be held accountable for all this needless death and suffering?  Without accountability the US is well on its  way to becoming a failed state."
2020-03-28 23:48:04,I've been coughing for two weeks but couldn't get tested even I live in California and within one hour drive from a few billion dollar biotech companies that manufacture such equipments. I'm thinking about flying to Taiwan and cough a few times on arrival because Taiwan authority will test me immediately and give me results in 24 hours.
2020-03-28 23:48:18,"There are already so many cases of coronavirus disease in New York that the greater availability of molecular testing (that identifies recent active infection) is too little too late. 

The focus should now shift to antibody testing to identify immune people, who can then go back to work and slowly reactivate the economy."
2020-03-29 00:02:50,"I recently saw a map of infections in my metropolitan area It seems the wealthiest suburbs have the most cases. 
I wonder if this is because the wealthiest residents are more likely to have traveled to places where the pandemic has been raging or if the wealthier areas are being given more testing kits."
2020-03-29 00:18:34,"Thanks for insightful reporting.  It feels to me that the failure may be that we focused on fixing our problem, rather than figuring out what we can do within the limitation. If testing was not happening for technical or political reasons, there could be still other ways to delay or address the spread (e.g. early introduction of social distancing, public education, procurement of PPE).  Maybe our obsession with pursuing large-scale tests took some precious resources and time away from what we could have been doing instead."
2020-03-29 00:30:58,"What is America missing that we have in British Columbia? Both jurisdictions had the same information and the same time to prepare, but we are testing at a high rate, implementing increasingly restrictive measures in a timely manner, conveying clear and honest information, and containing this epidemic, whereas you are not."
2020-03-29 00:42:48,"I worked a shift in the ER today - still unable to test with the exception of patients admitted to the hospital, with priority for those being admitted to intensive care. 

This seems to me to be a backward approach. Those admitted to the hospital ought to be treated presumptively as though they're COVID-19 positive. It's the mildly ill patients who are being discharged back into the community who are the highest risk to the population at large. They are the ones who ought to be tested.

Hospitals arrive at these policies to protect hospital staff. We need to advocate for population-level protection.

We really need to be thinking about case detection, case isolation, and population-level screening and tracking."
2020-03-29 00:52:50,I'm glad to finally see an article like this but also think that many need to be held responsible. More need to stand up to Trump that are in office. They're playing with all of our lives and those of our loved ones.
2020-03-29 01:01:03,"During the first weeks  the Chinese government got the high risk people to ""volunteer"" for at least quarantine and then progressive levels of isolation as symptoms or exposure was confirmed.

This was not really because Chinese testing was particularly accurate in the early days. But because the Chinese government could ignore the results of tests and just strictly quarantine for two weeks regardless of test results. 

The Chinese just started returning health people who were originally quarantined about 2 weeks ago. That is right - if people passed quarantine time without symptoms China still kept them separate in semi-quarantine...because they were then known either NOT to be exposed (or naturally immune)."
2020-03-29 01:15:49,"The U.S. under Trump in just three years have become a third-rate power. The future doesn't bode well for us. Our ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" moment is upon us."
2020-03-29 01:29:50,"As with everything in this administration, the few people who try to do their job are quickly sidelined when it interferes with the main job of the current administration: to please and coddle the president. Everything else is of no consequence to these people.

It was surreal to watch the president and his minions go on about testing being easily available to all the same day we finally managed to get tested, after 3 doctors and an ER visit. It then took 12 days to get the test results back. And that was only after multiple phone calls asking about it. 

The level of disconnect is surreal."
2020-03-29 01:59:05,"We still can’t get a test if we need a test.  Many who are tested never get their results.
How is that possible?"
2020-03-29 00:46:21,"And let us not forget how the super-triggered right in our hyper-politically polarized country continues to spread misinformation, distrust, confusion, and ultimately more death as they ignore or belittle medical experts, science, and basic critical thinking skills.

If a lot of people are sick come November, and turnout is quite low, which party will that disproportionately aid? Is there a political and religious group who don't believe they will get sick, or don't believe the pandemic is as bad as it is? What are their chances of passionately showing up at the polls? Who will that benefit.

And people think 45 doesn't have a plan. Seems to me like the gears to re-election are working very well. All the States the won't vote for him are seeing outbreaks rising and lock-downs looming. All the States that will vote for him see outbreaks rising...and don't much believe the news."
2020-03-29 00:53:26,"Although the The Teflon Don, AKA the Great Leader, has put up his tiny hands up and refused to accept responsibility, for the delays with testing. it goes with the job. The buck stops with the Teflon Don, who will need to be held to account for the dangerous lies he has told throughout the pandemic, which he knew to be false and extremely dangerous. This could not be more serious, as people are dying because of the lack of early testing. The White House knew that the virus was coming months before it arrived. Trump's lies were to keep the stock market up to protect his rich friends from financial loss. Trump's response such as it is has been, has been a debacle. He needs to be impeached again as this time he has blood on his hands with the death toll rising, unfortunately exponentially."
2020-03-29 01:54:07,"Do you think that with this hindsight the Trump administration would do things differently?

Do you think that if the republicans would have known that Donald Trump would have been such a disaster in this emergency, would they have nominated him for president?

If we had prior knowledge of a stock market crash, would we have let the economy crash in 2008?

What if we knew that there weren't any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, would we have invaded?

All of these things were known or strongly suggested by evidence ahead of time, but we as a country ignored all of it.
We are suspicious of science and evidence and therefore our hubris causes us to walk right into these disasters of our own making."
2020-03-28 23:59:48,"The United States did not have a failure to test. It had a refusal to test, a refusal to consider testing, a refusal to believe, on the part of elected leaders, that this country was as vulnerable to this deadly virus as any other. 

As for blindness, what we are suffering from is willful and deliberate blindness by the people we entrusted with keeping our country safe, and all for their own short-term political advantage."
2020-03-29 00:15:09,"When the United States decided to go to war with Iraq in 2003, those at the White House did not take advantage of an immense planning document—produced by the various bureaus of the Department of State—for what to do if we were faced with “regime change” in Iraq. This story reminds me of that, because had Trump not disbanded the Global Health Security office at the National Security Council, I am certain a plan would have been on the shelf for this pandemic. (I am a retired Foreign Service Officer.) Somehow we have to get administrations to accept that what previous administrations produce is valuable and should not be tossed out simply because of some partisan viewpoint. That’s the real long-term answer to solving these mistakes, and sadly, this one is costing many Americans their lives."
2020-03-29 00:32:50,"There are so many failures here, but the one that is most unforgiveable to me is the lack of PPE for our medical personnel. Really, in the richest nation on earth, we don't have enough masks, gowns, etc.? Why aren't they stockpiled? Why isn't there a coherent plan for supplying them in a crisis? It is unbelievable that the President of the United States encouraged states to bid against each other to procure all of the various supplies needed to fight this epidemic, without any apparent thought that he might have a role in the process."
2020-03-29 00:36:04,"This brings back so many features of the intelligence services before 9-11: ignoring the warning signals from the field, bureaucratic infighting, inability to prioritize information and action, lack of shared integration, lack of leadership. Only this time, not 3000 people dying, but maybe 100 to 1000 times that number. What does it take in this country to do things right?"
2020-03-29 01:08:39,"This outcome really shouldn't be too surprising to anyone. Our healthcare system is completely dysfunctional.  The executive branch views science as a tool of the deep state. And our crisis response is hamstrung by a wall of bureaucrats more concerned with smoothing the waters than strategy and results. I work for the government. My advice, be afraid, be very afraid."
2020-03-29 01:08:44,"""After law school, Mr. Azar was a clerk for some of the nation’s most conservative judges, including Justice Antonin Scalia... And for two years, he worked as Ken Starr’s deputy on the Clinton Whitewater investigation.""

It's odd to read this about Azar. Scalia built a career turning his back on vulnerable people in service to his idosyncratic textual interpretations. Starr likewise pursued his own agenda like a hermit monk in an abbey fortress, tuning out the rest of the world. What a strange resume for the person entrusted with the health of the country. It boggles the mind."
2020-03-29 01:06:43,"I have always believed that being the President of the United States requires outstanding intellect and leadership skills. I also believed, and still do, that Donald Trump is totally unfit for the job, and have been angry about his election since November 2016.
However, in the past few weeks my anger has been leavened with pity, as I see a man totally unable to rise to the occasion flail about, trying to deal with a situation that is totally beyond his capabilities.  Meanwhile, the country that we all love is on the brink.
Although his childlike ego may not let him realize it, he should be as relieved as the rest of the country when this nightmare administration is voted out in November."
2020-03-29 00:33:09,"The fundamental dilemma is a lack of expertise, wisdom and accountability in all Cabinet level positions. No amount of meeting time would resolve that. Compounded with laziness, entitlement, a distrust of science and a need to placate an unstable President, you have our current situation. It was inevitable that some mismanaged disaster would occur under President Trump's ""watch""."
2020-03-29 00:38:42,"[The C.D.C.] “provided a workaround, telling state and local health department labs that they could finally begin testing. Rather than awaiting replacements, they should use their C.D.C. test kits and leave out the problematic third probe.”

In other words, the CDC test is STILL not working properly. 

So, the CDC wouldn’t use the WHO test because it only used 2 probes while the CDC test had THREE. In the end, the CDC ended up using only 2 probes anyway because the third one never really worked. 

A month delay during an pandemic for nothing."
2020-03-28 23:43:50,"I would like to know - in gory detail - why the US opted NOT to use the WHO screening test and decided to go it alone. Was this a ""typical"" case of the ""not invented here"" syndrome, i.e. we nly use what we ourselves invent. Or were there ideological objections over the WHO diagnostic, unrelated to its efficacy as a diagnostic tool? I am concerned that it is the latter, and that there are too points of view in this country over what is a scientific phenomenon is what's truly scary."
2020-03-29 00:04:42,"It is ironic that the CDC found the WHO test so lacking that they decided that third genomic ""probe""  was necessary, presumably to ensure that the test would be accurate, (i.e. to eliminate the possibility of false positives), in other words, that a positive test would not be inaccurate. In scientific terms we describe this as specificity. However what was needed was not so much specificity but rather, sensitivity, (i.e. the ability to pick up truly positive specimens even if some might not be truly positive) thereby reducing the possibility that positive specimens would be missed. The irony is that the third genomic probe developed by the CDC was determined to be ""inconclusive"" thereby fomenting confusion over the entire test and causing delay in testing at a time when expediency was paramount."
2020-03-29 01:27:51,"It is such an unfortunate situation. There must be something wrong in the system that needs to be investigated and corrected  . We need  a more robust disease control system which works independent of who are in charge, when such pandemic or epidemic occurs. An emergency plan should be kicked with or without the few top people's permission, like relaxation of regulations testing, voice/power of CDC takes over the role. How come we don't hear any voice/warning publicly from any epidemiologists about the pandemic? We almost thought we were fine. People were not alerted at all, traveling around under risk. The spreading would be a lot less severe if we could be alerted and travel less even with no sufficient tests available. 

Something needs to be changed from now on, before the next epidemic or pandemic comes."
2020-03-29 01:37:44,"As a physician on the front line trying to get patients tested, I can assure you the that the availability of testing has been critically limited for the past 6 weeks by something as mundane as a lack of  Dacron swabs and viral transport media. In order to collect a specimen to send to a reference lab (Labcorp, Quest, et al) a sterile plastic (not wood or paper) shaft stick with a synthetic ( Dacron or Nylon) tuft has to be fully inserted into the patient's nostril. The swab is then placed in a solution (viral transport media) in a plastic test tube which is capped and chilled and sent to the reference lab. One month ago, I could find no viral collection swabs or viral transport media to purchase anywhere, all supplies were back ordered at least 2 weeks from all suppliers - this is not ""toilet paper,"" folks. This is how we track this disease. What use is having labs with capacity to test ""X"" number of specimens per day when there is no way to get a specimen to the lab. We are still restricted by these supply deficiencies. We don't have enough testing supplies at this time to re-test someone who tested positive in the oupatient setting to ensure that they no longer test positive. Instead the public health department has had to offer a second alternative - assume they are no longer contagious once they are symptom free for 72 hours, and are at least 7 days past their onset of symptoms. Evidence from China suggests that those with COVID-19 may shed virus for 14 to 37 days...."
2020-03-29 00:07:31,"The decision to not adopt the WHO test and bet everything on developing their own test, or at very least both take the WHO and in parallel with developing their own in case their did not work was a crippling case of ""Not Invented Here"".

The decision making behind this should be investigated. Trump has been gutting Obama era pandemic preparation dreadfully, but even with that decisoin making was bad and unnecessarily risky.

The log jam has only finally been cleared by adopting (as Cuomo encouraged) commercials sector tests, and in particular the Roche testing volume is immense.

This is a national scandal, when for a long period Scotland with 5.5M people had run more tests than the entire US."
2020-03-29 00:51:03,Trump has been working overtime trying to keep our national government out of solving the Covid-19 debacle relative to supplies and equipment while waiting for the private sector to step up and do his job for him. The problem not handled by cutting the government out of the equation is orderly dispersement of supplies and ventilators to avoid bidding wars and uneven availability of necessities to fight the pandemic including tests.
2020-03-29 00:02:52,"Summary: The administration and CDC did not take the pandemic  threat seriously, and proceeded in ""normal channels"" to produce testing capabilities, and was not forced out of this path.  The seriousness of the problem was finally recognized, and  the CDC, as currently organized and managed, could not respond effectively, and the US finished months behind countries such as Vietnam. Because of this, we are suffering a terrible epidemic, and there will be many tens of thousands of deaths and great economic losses.  It need not have been with competent management.  Does that capture the essence?"
2020-03-28 23:46:30,"How about people stay inside -- 

Stay inside ... 

I'm tied of the testing comments  -- stay inside and away from others.

I restricted my movements back in mid February -- I don't need a test !"
2020-03-28 23:53:14,"It's more than just Trump.  It's the conservative movement.  This catastrophically bad federal response is the result of their politicians, their president, their priorities, their media and their political dogma.

They ALL need to be held accountable."
2020-03-29 01:43:19,"One very large problem with the idea that we should just go forward and stop with the finger pointing is this: the completely incompetent response and multitudes of errors are not a thing of the past but continue today.

Today our great leader is suggesting that by his authority, though no such legal authority exists, the states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut  may be quarantined. This from the mouth  of a man who just a day ago stated that the problems of New York were being overstated by the Governor of New York.

Could it be he is trying to punish, intimidate, and or coerce officials who might criticize his actions as the man in charge but who has not the slightest clue what he is doing? Very likely the case. A pattern of conduct with hundreds of examples.

Another very large problem with bringing up the history and the facts is that his blind followers will become all the more defensive and enraged to the extent he is held responsible for anything.

A kind of mania to be sure. Certainly working against their best interests as has been noted in many places.

A kind of catch 22 x 2 or 3 or 4.

We have to survive the pandemic, the financial meltdown, and last but not least him and his party.

 I have always felt that if America were to survive this dark age there would need to be some kind of deep transformation of the countries psyche. 

I feel now we have entered into it. Believe in something far better, hold onto that vision, and perhaps we awake better for it."
2020-03-29 02:00:45,"First step in a planning process: Define the problem. No or limited tests of Coronavirus distribution, no definition of the problem."
2020-03-29 01:52:36,"The ability to detect who is infected is key to the entire effort to control a disease like this. Initially, hubris upon the failure of the U.S. test prevented adaptation of globally available tests. Once the Trump administration became engaged, it was intentional disinformation, obstruction, and incompetence that thwarted effective action. There are errors here that I believe rise to the level of criminal behavior, and I hope that after we suffer the tens to hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths that there is an investigation into those responsible for these unnecessary deaths, Trump foremost."
2020-03-29 00:22:43,"many places STILL don't have test kits.  And PPE shortfalls where doctors are begging the sewers to start making face masks
all shocking negligence by those in power."
2020-03-29 01:31:35,"Many people are commenting about how the Trump Administration  has shown no leadership, did not have a strategy, and that Trump’s first response was to deny that there was any danger because a crisis would make him look bad.  He’s correct.  It has.

Trump has gone beyond being inept.  He is a clear and present danger.  He is not a cheap imitation of Putin, he has become much more like Jim Jones or David Koresh. 

Many of Trump’s followers are as dedicated to him as were the followers of those cult leaders.  They will willingly drink the Kool-Aide.  That was often used metaphorically, now it has become a direct threat.  Trump would rather lead them to their death than admit that he is mistaken. 
Trump will continue to blame others, deny responsibility, and issues irrational, often fatal solutions unless someone shuts him down.

That is why I am urging the NYT, the Governors of US states, other politician, judges, the press, anyone and everyone with power to stand-up directly and stop Trump.  The Republicans thus far seem incapable of raising a question or criticism.  They see that he craves “appreciation.”  

But this is no longer political.  Trump has become the biggest threat to the health can safety of this country since Pearl Harbor. Sadly,  I am not being hyperbolic."

2020-03-29 01:46:16,"In October a group of health professionals and epidemiologists ran a pandemic test scenario at Johns Hopkins. They change the variables to try to figure out and document the best way to respond so as to minimize death rates - and perhaps economic consequences as well.

When interviewed, one of the participants revealed that a breakdown in testing and quality of tests was never even considered as a possible important variable or scenario. This is the Titanic pandemic....

I got this from an excellent article in the Atlantic.  Which also offers some optimism and excellent suggestions along with the dire concise reporting.

2020-03-29 00:15:05,"Time bought by China and South Korea was squandered casually by Europe and the United States. Some countries were better the other countries but mostly all have failed catastrophically to contain the spread of the virus. Unfortunately the sad truth is that US and the few large European countries already have more or will have more cases and death counts compared to China. Compared to China, the outbreaks in Europe and US were months later, the populations are smaller, the per capita GDPs of these counters are much higher, the political systems are democratic. So, why did all of them fail so miserably?

For US, big business and special interest groups have just as much to be blamed as Trump and this administration.
 
1. Overwhelming conservative views early on not taking the matter seriously while blatantly denying scientific projections. 
2. Oh yeah, it is an election year. Stock market matters.
3. Delay in testing, as mentioned in this article. Please go check how many test kits were being prepared per day in South Korea when they only had 1 case, 10 cases, and 100 cases. 
4. Prejudice against Asian countries due to their political systems and being dismissive of the drastic actions they had taken. How can NYC not have already been under martial law style hard shutdown like Wuhan? 
5. Why there are so many businesses going through loopholes and force their employees to work even though they are not critical or essential but got green lights from the government?"
2020-03-28 23:46:30,"Every American deserves to know that Trump NEVER activated the decades long epidemic protocol. Even now it is not being used.
We are living a nightmare due to his complete negligence. We all paid for experts to create protocols and yet this administration has decided that our lives are to be sacrificed for made up news and straight out lies.
That alone causes my head and heart to sink low."

The administration was naive in listening to people with little experience in real world.

2020-03-29 01:48:08,"Trump personifies the death of meaning. He can't make a single, coherent, specific statement that isn't so badly worded that it requires a chorus decipher what they believe he intended to say. Because he never intended to say anything coherent. 

So, Judd Deere says, “any suggestion that President Trump did not take the threat of Covid-19 seriously or that the United States was not prepared is false.”

Well, we have his public statements and his failure to  marshal the resources at his command as pretty irrefutable evidence. Where's the evidence that he was acting quickly and decisively. (Don't mention the restrictions on Chinese nationals entering the country. That was two weeks after the first diagnosed US case -- an American citizen who returned home with a planeload of others, coming from or going who knows where. They weren't tested and weren't quarantined. Because Trump evidently thought only Chinese people could get or spread COVID-19. Where did he get that idea?)"

Until the USA returns to a culture of accountability and equal law for everyone our society will continue to lose its civilization - this epidemic is a great example.  

Corrupt bankers need to go to jail like they did in the 80's.  Police who commit crimes need to be prosecuted.   Elite members of the political class must be held accountable to their duties to serve the public, not told ""Great Job Brownie""."
2020-03-28 23:43:17,"The article lacks focus on two major issues; lack of leadership and abundance of lies which erodes trust.  

Article should have elaborated more on leadership by using prior administrations as benchmark and highlighting how leaders can set the stage up for success or failure.  On that benchmark, Trump has miserably failed.

Trump has continued to downplay the threat and lie about critical supplies.  Here is a lightening rod of example:  Trump promised 5 million tests kits in March 9 press conference.  Still, as of Saturday, March 28, barely 600,000 tests have been performed.  Where are other 4.4 million test kits? 
 Supply of ventilators and masks are also subject to same level of falsehoods by Trump.   

Other than that the article addresses in-depth look into multitude of failures within CDC, FDA and Dept of HHS which will do nothing else buy allow Trump to throw others under the bus."
2020-03-29 01:13:19,"Yes we sure failed the test on testing. But that really bad patch will look like Nirvana compared to what will happen if America does not stop the runaway growth of the virus. We have 20% more infections today than yesterday, roughly 20,000 more. Yet, Trump is not telling Americans the ideal target of new daily cases to flatten the curve, and sacrifices needed to hit the goal. As a result, the nation is not building consensus on our central existential threat and is not being prepared on how we must change to address it. This is beyond irresponsible and inept. It is starting to look like a crime scene."
2020-03-29 00:31:58,"Call it like it was from the outset - in late January when Democrats were raising concerns Trump called it a ""Democratic hoax"".  And his tweets were even worse denials of the potential threat.  Then he from his podium told, ""everything is under control"".  Don't give him a pass!  ANY other president, democrat or republican would have led with science by his side and martialed forces to have us much better prepared. Failure to call him out or make him accountable for his untruths and false statements only emboldens him to create more of a problem for the nation."

Has no more to do with politics than it does with ethnic heritage, but it does strongly relate to organizational ineffectiveness, for which governments are infamous, with their very rare positive outcomes due to chance, are rare, hence so newsworthy.

2020-03-29 01:14:44,"Donald J. Trump's words of wisdom on testing: “Interestingly, if you go back—please—if you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. They didn’t do testing like this. And actually, they lost approximately 14,000 people. And they didn’t do the testing. They started thinking about testing when it was far too late,” --(Press briefing on March 13.) Based on this article, failure to test was the original sin in the federal government's response. Looks like many thousands of Americans will die as a result, and the economic loss is not even possible to estimate at this point."
2020-03-28 23:36:07,It took about 10 days for competent hospitals to set up the PCR test.  This should have been initiated in January when China quarantined. There is simply no excuse for the CDC's failure and the WH failure to recognize this.
2020-03-29 01:47:09,"When you combine the problem in developing a working test and the refusal to recognize that the virus was already here in February with no testing being done to discover this fact, it almost feels that there was a deliberate desire to validate Trump’s false claims at the time.  Now we read that the CDC released sick cruise ship passengers into the Atlanta airport, because the virus was already out in the community and these people needed to get home.  This is why we are now the country with the most cases of Covid-19."
2020-03-29 02:34:30,We would be in very different place if CDC scientists hadn't messed up and delivered the number of tests they said could be delivered in time.

2020-03-29 02:30:35,"This whole article reads like an series of excuses to let President Trump off the hook. 18 months ago Trump and Bolton fired the Epidemic Response Team the previous administration had established to deal with these exact circumstances. Trump refused the WHO test kits, and held  up testing hoping to be able to make a test his son-in-law could patent and profit from, all the while telling the country he thought the virus was a hoax, or a plot by the Democrats to disrupt the election. Anyone who has paid any attention to public health in the 21st century would have told the President the key to controlling this thing is early widespread testing, but Trump hires people on the basis of personal attraction, rather than expertise, and apparently no one left in the administration who could see the writing on the wall had the gumption to speak the truth. Nancy Pelosi forced his hand and out maneuvered Mitch McConnell to get some financial assistance for the out of work people and suffering small businesses, but only at the price of another big pot of money for corporate handouts. As far as I am aware, he still has not triggered that disaster funding, he is refusing to pay for ventilators, and he tried to make himself feel better by calling Governor Whitmer of Michigan ‘that woman’  and telling VP pence not to return her calls, while the hospitals in Detroit are filled beyond their capacity with untested COViD 19 patients. Trump’s failures are killing people."

-Third for suggesting that by mid-April we can get back to somewhat normal.
-Can't get much worse than that in sixty days time .

2020-03-29 02:41:16,A strong early response was not part of Trump’s agenda. That’s why it didn’t happen.
2020-03-29 02:42:18,"The virus is the invisible enemy. This is a repeated refrain from our President. Listen to him over and over soliciting our understanding of the monumental task of confronting an invisible enemy (true). But the virus was and is not invisible in Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and other countries that effectively tested and illuminated the enemy. When the President says our enemy is invisible (true) you must know that he was the one who turned off the lights and destroyed our lives."
2020-03-29 02:47:14,"A test that only answers one question -- ""is this person presently infected? -- isn't very useful when we have little idea of how long a victim has actually been contagious, and whether pneumonia will ensue. In addition, what's the value of testing only those with obvious symptoms, and refusing everyone else? Useless data.
Acquired immunity is another big question mark.
And there are many helpful research findings coming out of China, but no, the Washington take is ""why trust anything they tell us; they're always lying"".
The time for international co-operation has come.
Excuse the boasting, but here in Canada the political parties are in agreement on what to do."
2020-03-29 02:51:09,"In Germany, the fatality rate from corona is less than 1%. In the US, the average is 4%. In Germany, as soon as they detected the first case in Bavaria, they identified the source and took immediate action. In the US, we were aware of corona in December but 4 months later, there is still no comprehensive plan of attack. Our response is chaotic.

So what’s the difference? Germany has a functional government whereas the US suffers a circus clown who lives in his own little world, aided and abetted by criminals who would see us die as long as they can hang onto power and ransack the nation’s wealth.

New Orleans is in utter chaos and that chaos is rapidly spreading across America. The only question left is how many people will die before we correct the obvious problem?"
2020-03-29 02:23:04,"Ineffectual initial government responses  at CDC, FDA and the Trump administration have placed the US population at huge risk from the coronavirus. Lack of a pandemic response team at Homeland security,axed by this administration, contributed as well. The first rule of public health is - prevention, prevention, prevention, and lacking adequate testing, this became impossible in the US. Historians will have their hands full detailing the multiple breakdowns in our agencies that caused this nightmare scenario to progress the way it has. Recent works on the Chernobyl disaster come to mind."
2020-03-29 02:55:04,"The battle cry of this administration is to tear it all down and have limited government with strong industry ties. It's not just the names in this article, it's the other high ranking federal employees from HHS that left when the administration changed. It was years of sequestration under Obama, and no budget increase with HHS being asked to do more.  Industry is important in the response, but once again if the heads of the agencies are not familiar with policy and the process of enacting a response, then it is too little too late.

 Although the response could have been stronger, this virus would still be spreading, albeit a lower rate. Only countries that had the specter of SARS in their memories and went through this drill with H5N1 and H7N9 were prepared enough."
2020-03-29 00:53:21,"Is there any surprise as to how this Administration had dealt with this pandemic? I, for one, knew something is going to happen...of course, not this virus but I was expecting a disaster in the making since the day this guy got into office."

The executive at the top -- where the buck stops -- was Donald Trump.  Trump dictated the approach that would suit his reelection requirements and none of his minions had the courage to openly criticize.

How any realistic scientist, after watching what was going on in China with the superhuman measures to stop the growth of the virus, could possibly not be terrified at the lack of data as an indicator of what is going on is absolutely stunningly awful.

No terror.  No urgency. Those are the telltale signs of inexperienced executives who have either never been in laboratories or have forgotten what they are.  The hunger for data is the mark of a scientist.  Shunning data as our Administration has done and continues to do is the mark of politicians, who ALL need to be removed from their jobs ASAP."
2020-03-29 01:55:49,"After reading this article - a very thorough one at that - I am infuriated.  The incompetence and ignorance of this complete administration borders on criminal.  

I just read that the first infant has died and now our dead are doubling every two days with no end in sight.  The US could have 6 million dead in one month if everything keeps on going as it is now.   I do not believe we are being told the truth about how  perilous our situation is which is even more infuriating.

By early January it was clear that COVID-19 was destian to become pandemic and will cause major stresses on health care system every and economic disaster. Foe weeks there was no clear leadership in the White House. CDC should have looked to South Korea and Germany for a reliable test rather trying to have an American test.

And we really need to insist that Trump be tested “again” for the coronavirus, this time having the test—including the obtaining of the specimen—documented by a third party. [Why? There is truly no trust in this man Trump and his protecting sycophants.]

Anthony Fauci would be a good choice as the documenting third-party. He personally oversees the swabbing of Trump and the continuous verifying that the specimen is tested and reported accurately.

Two heads voters will hopefully take care off in Nov.  But we need more competence at CDC as well.  It is shocking to see our so called experts make these costly mistakes."
2020-03-29 00:26:08,"Trump's blind arrogance permeates this story from his appointments to key positions to his obsession with beating rivals that lead him not to take care of the country.  He has proudly pointed to his ability to cut through red tape, but when the chips were down he failed miserably and the whole country is suffering.

China gave us the tools to create an accurate test by giving us the virus's DNA in January and hospitals quickly created tests, but the arrogant power dynamics at the top made implementing them impossible as personal egos took charge.  But Trump was too busy trumpeting his victory over impeachment and Congress to notice that the country was going down the drain.

There are many figures in this piece, but it is the President  who is ultimately responsible for the key stone cops handling of this crisis."
2020-03-29 03:15:28,"Excellent article, thank you for your efforts.  My takeaway is that the pandemic was basically due to two factors.  One, a president who didn't want any bad news that might lose him the election, never mind the human costs.  Two, appointees who had neither the political skills not the medical background to handle the problem quickly and efficiently.  Appointees put in their positions by the aforementioned president.  So I guess there is really just one factor.  The same factor that has been trying to destroy this country since January 2017."
2020-03-29 03:07:50,"The story is very old and simple:  The sentinels hired to keep watch for the pandemic were relived of their duty or demoted.  

When the invader came, there was no one to cry the alarm.  When others cried in alarm who were not sentinels, they were not listened to because they were not sentinels.

Thus, the invader entered freely, and before the population knew it, they were at the invader's mercy."
2020-03-29 03:33:56,"If you don't test you'll never know the exact numbers and it's easier to deny. There was enough warning this thing was coming, I think it was all over the place starting at the first of the year, and a lot of what we thought were flu deaths were from covid. We should have had mass test kits ordered and being used with the first warnings."
2020-03-29 05:23:00,"Excellent work.  Thanks for the authentic American journalism.  I was puzzled on understanding what the CDC wanted to achieve using the extra third ""probe"" sequence for increased specificity.  With the third ""probe"", the result was not conclusive then why the WHO method with only first two probes worked fine and eventually adopted by the CDC for testing Americans.  What correlation was missing with the results of the extra probe?  Also, why the initial tests were so narrowly restricted to people who had recently traveled to China or had been in contact with someone who had the virus?  It seems that there are more work ahead."
2020-03-29 06:27:58,"One day after all this is over someone might finally explain to me what happened with testing. I'm a doctor in Oakland, California. My whole community health center still has only 170 tests. We are still only testing those at high risk. Your article makes it sound like the problem has been solved, but there are still no tests. I'm watching New York really ramp up testing, but no one even talks about it anymore because we know it is not coming. When we do test the results take over a week to come back. Without a result it is very hard to convince people to quarantine away from their families and very quickly families get infected too. Thanks for this article. It is so sad so many people will die because people couldn't get their act together."
2020-03-29 06:42:49,"Good article. It is the basis for taking corrective action to be prepared for the next one.  After reading this piece, it seems to be the early denial of how virulent and deadly this virus is was a serious mistake.

Now, we have to ride this out and invest in preparedness and researching a vaccine.   I am still thinking this horror story through but I think we should also invest in more research into how the immune system operates and determine if there are therapies or additives to our diet that can strengthen the human immune system.  I hope the N.I.H. is sponsoring research grants to explore why the immune system weakens with age.  Also, I think one Nobel Laureate has explored this issue, sort of making old cells younger."
2020-03-29 06:49:27,"On March 19 I have read on the NYTimes an article written by Richard Perez Pena:
""Virus Hits Europe Harder Than China. Is That the Price of an Open Society?"". I quote a section of the article that made me think back then, and gives me a bittersweet smile now: ""To some extent, experts say, Europeans are paying a price for living in open, affluent democracies, where people are used to free movement, easy travel and independent decision-making, and where governments worry about public opinion. Governments aren’t used to giving harsh orders, and citizens aren’t used to following them.""
The entire western world ;Europe in the first place, followed by The U.K and The USA, later on, should have realized that is not a matter of how open or how locked a society should be: a raging pandemic doesn't care about boarders, or political compass. The real problem is how a government acts or reacts under an emergency circumstance. 
Both Europe and the USA are dealing with the same issues: lack of tampons and ventilators. It's time to stop the pandemic rather than fight over it."
2020-03-29 06:54:57,"Because this pandemic involved illness with delayed onset, a large portion of asymptomatic or presymptomatic but contagious victims, and difficult to perform testing with limited specificity, the public health approach required a deep grasp of scientific principles, scrupulous analysis, and sound planning with only regard for the safety and health of the general public.

We do not have such leadership in our government today."
2020-03-29 08:36:10,"In Germany we are used to criticize our bureaucracy as typical German. Having lived in the US for 17 years I always was surprised  finding bureaucracies everywhere. This analysis about testing is shocking. While in the US 100 people were tested, here already over 10 000 were tested daily. Now it’s 500000 weekly. Why is that possible? Any lab that was technically able to perform tests did so using the WHO test kit. This number will increase further because they work 24/7 and  now also veterinary labs will be involved. 

Though we have a very high number of intensive care beds and even take patients from Italy, Spain, Swiss and France, our  biggest problems now are protective gear and people. China is the Monopolist who decides who gets what and how much. My biggest wish for the future is, when this nightmare is over, that we take  production and jobs back into our countries."
2020-03-29 09:47:38,"Because of the lack of testing real cases might be twice as much as official figures suggest. Here in Spain we are going through the same situation. Authorities were always a few steps behind and the first measures came tepid and late. The only good news is that, as many cases are not reported, the percentage of deaths is much lower than what official figures show. Oh! And that air pollution sank to the minimum."

And number two, has absolutely no experience holding public office, or trusting anyone other than himself to make all decisions. Mix in extreme narsicism and insecurity assuaged only by the incessant bestowing of bogus praise on him by everyone around him, and we have a formula for disaster. The only thing worse would be if the virus victims became zombies when stricken."
2020-03-29 06:30:24,"Yes, discouraging words all around about testing that was not done in time to contain those infected, especially not yet showing significant symptoms. People in charge were afraid to understand and believe in the science, instead kowtowing to their superiors out of fear for their jobs.

This is the bizarre twinning of the worst and the supposedly best. DJT is the worst president in the history of this country and now a contender in world history. But the more inexplicable failures have been by the so-called experts. 

We're supposed to fawn on Fauci and Birx, and yes, they're appreciably better than DJT, but they aren't on top of this. They've been in place since Jan. 29th and have yet to turn to him and tell him he's categorically wrong. Time, energy, resources and expertise have been squandered on tepid suggestions and ameliorating the president's fatally wrong ""information."" That doesn't even address the flawed and missing tests. 

I've wondered for some time if one of our mistakes is in over-complicating and being too reliant on specialized knowledge. To prepare for this pandemic, all one had to do was read about the 1918 one. I have and called  on these pages for lock down in early Jan. You can't quarantine after the fact, a we are learning in the bitterest way imaginable. Once an pandemic takes hold, it's self-evidently much too late. 

Some governors, again not the medical experts, seemed to grasp this much sooner than Fauci and Birx did. Ohio shut down fast and hard and our numbers are 1/10 of neighboring states.

Coupled with this has been an illogical belief that America is impervious to any threats by way of some divine intercession.  There are far too many people who cannot understand that simply denying uncomfortable truths will not make them go away.

Hubris also plays a major role in the failure to grasp the magnitude of the crisis facing us, as professionals insisted that institutions could not fail in dealing with the situation.  No one wants to admit that the roof leaks, especially when the sun is shining.  This article takes a hard look at the response to a well-defined threat, and some of the ways that response fell short.

Pointing fingers may make us feel better, but it does nothing to remedy the problem.  What is needed more is some self-examination.  Who let things get this bad?"

2020-03-29 03:39:42,"At the handover of the presidency, Trump was told that pandemic preparedness was a national priority and given non pharmaceutical response plans developed by the Bush and Obama administrations.

Scientists have long been studying the microbial threats of zoonotic spillover. The NIH and other civilian and military agencies, as well as private entities, have been developing biodefense strategies to prevent emergence and mitigate impact. Dr. Fauci is the public face science in the service of healthcare. He is the tip of the spear. The Trump administration had a full quiver. Which in its animus towards  science and government, and its arrogant incompetence, it disdained, derided, and dismissed.

It is too easy to say, here was a failure of testing. Here is an unmitigated failure of leadership, in which the entire apparatus of the Republican party is complicit. The frivolous chaos of the Trump White House, the unconscionable inaction it promoted, and the predictable panic it inspired, caused the disastrous humanitarian and economic crises that have overtaken our nation.

It was inevitable that America would be Trump's 7th bankruptcy. Who knew how prescient Trump's boast was, that he could get away with killing people on 5th Ave. It's happening right now.

Science can explain and protect us from pandemics. Who can explain and protect us from the devolution of the Republican party and the cult of personality that has developed around Trump? Seriously."

2020-03-29 05:03:01,"MASKS, people, masks! 

Of course they provide protection.  The CDC and this administration saying masks aren't needed unless a person is ill is absurd beyond belief. 

And it's caused confusion as well as yet another deep divide in our country.  This time between those who wear masks and those who think only health care workers should wear them.

If everyone wore masks (and gloves) - especially grocery workers and and customers - we would all be so much safer."
2020-03-29 05:16:09,"When some blame the Chinese for the virus spread I am reminded of the story I learnt in school which goes like this:

Four partners of cotton warehouse shared a cat with each taking care of one leg of the cat and related areas. Once the cat got hurt in a leg and the partner, say P1, put a cloth band aid. Unfortunately the cat got that bandaid in fire and while trying to escape it spread the fire to the whole warehouse and burnt it down. 

Partners 2-4 sued partner P1 for causing the damage because of the leg he took care of. However, the judge asked for reconciliation because the three good legs of those partners were the reason cat could run around and cause the burning down of the warehouse!

Cv-19 may have started in China but it is spread around the world mostly by non Chinese and the mis management of  non Chinese governments!

The end!"

The story that matters most. The story that US history books will tell in a hundred years, if humanity survives that long.

What's left mostly between the lines is that all this happened because of something even worse than a vacuum at the top. It was an active hostility at the top toward testing, because the president, in a childish, irrational and criminally negligent attempt to stave off the inevitable, liked the numbers low."
2020-03-29 09:06:37,"I’m surprised you guys are going so easy on Trump in this article. Whether we like it or not, the relevant people in this crisis were taking their lead from a man who dismissed the virus and only wanted the numbers to ‘look good’, and who has behaved so erratically that it’s impossible to determine any coherent position or strategy. Other errors were made, yes (including the appointments made), but the buck stops with Trump. And he has failed."

The Trump Administration's response to this Crisis has been weak, flip-flopping, and more than empty, to say the least.

So ... now, even though we cannot ""turn back the Clock""  (to pre-Virus days that used-to-be!), can America's EPA at LEAST protect our Nation's clean water quality, so we don't get increasing Virus Diseases like the ""One"" from Wuhan ? That Virus was created from beyond filthy water conditions, coupled with beyond filthy livestock habitat. Does America want to relax EPA standards, and copy that Danger ?

I am NOT anti-Chinese, and it hurts me to hear of Chinese/Americans being treated poorly in their local neighborhoods.  I AM anti- ""the Chinese Government"";  AKA; the Chinese Communist Party.  From what I have read , the Doctor who warned the World of this enormous Crisis was ""detained"" on December 2nd of last Year by the CCP, and results or ""News"" of his findings were delayed, as Xi Jinping wanted to ""save face"" for the CCP., before acting.  And now, he's trying to act like the ""leader & savior"" of the whole thing.   Hogwash .  Heaven help the Ethnic Minorities locked in Prison in Xi's ""Transformation Camps"" in Eastern Tibet.

As a World of Nations, and as We, as People, have to do our best to work together and find a cure for this Virus ~ let us all be strong.   If there is any ""silver lining"" in that, it is that we must all work together in THIS Endeavor."

Obama team handling of Ebola could have had completely different results had they dithered and reacted slowly but since they contained it, even though right wing media including trump himself, second guessed and criticized him constantly, no one noticed because the results were positive. Likewise, the financial crash and recession could easily turned into a worldwide depression but with minimal cooperation from republicans, the problem was contained and the economy back on track. Again, Obama got no credit for the success that trump called a mess until he came into office and all of a sudden the “mess” immediately turned into the greatest economy in history.

2020-03-29 03:19:44,"You mean this isn't, as DJT characterized it, ""a hoax""? Just like global warming. The buck stops at the president's desk, and the damage wrought by this epidemic results directly from his and his administration's contempt for science and for global cooperation. China, South Korea, Singapore had the tests. They would have shared their knowledge. But instead of making American great, Trump's made America suffer. If he doesn't exactly hold direct responsibility for each and every death, he would certainly, in a court of law, be charged with criminal negligence. 

Even now, if we had already developed and distributed a test for antibodies (revealing how many have had subclinical infections), we could say who was immune, therefore who could take care of patients with confidence, who could go back to work. Trump has laid waste our economy as well as our health and welfare."

The worst thing that could happen is for a 'return to normal' without a deeply focused reassessment of what our priorities really are as a global civilisation ... and the alteration of our course and direction accordingly.  

But before that, what do we think is going to happen in Africa - indeed in any of the countries we like to label as under-developed.

2020-03-29 06:04:19,"It is hard to believe that initial reports of the rapid spread of the virus in Wuhan didn't set off alarms among White House officials.  It makes them look obtuse or clueless.  When we needed proactive movers and shakers, the equivocators prevailed, including a leaderless president.  This is what happens when the chief executive is more concerned about optics than hunkering down and solving problems.  Even today, Trump arranged for a photo-op in front of a hospital ship bound for New York and exaggerated its significance.
He is more interested in promoting the image of a leader than actually leading in a positive way."
2020-03-29 11:07:10,"Ultimately the responsibility rests on the shoulders of the Republican Party and the American electorate in putting a President in the White House who is incapable of providing the leadership required.   There were clear indications of his inadequacies throughout his campaign in  2015 and 2016, yet they did not take heed.  Unfortunately, he is unable to grow and develop as a leader.  As this article highlights, his appointments to posts are not always guided by sagacious decision-making.  I do not know what was on the curriculum in the late 1960s when President Trump was a student at the Wharton School of Business; however a 2019 online article entitled 'Which Leadership Style Is Best for Your Team?' gives  wise advice, including this warning:  'Narcissistic Leadership: The Style to Avoid.'"
2020-03-29 11:10:42,"The Trump administration negligent response to this crisis brings to full view their deeply rooted incompetence. Their decision making based on hunches rather than facts forged a chain of poor judgements, and reinforced a chaotic and destructive outcome. As a result, not only will ordinary citizens like myself suffer, but some of our country's best people, scientists, doctors, nurses and essential citizens will be harmed the most."
2020-03-29 11:24:19,"Look no further than your mailbox to see the cravenness of government agencies toward the president. Of course, the CDC published and mailed in big bold letters:  “President Trump's Coronavirus Guidelines for America"", which in reality, was a free campaign mailing for Trump.

If the CDC is willing to stoop to the level of distributing propaganda for the president, it is no surprise that they were not clearly enough sounding the warning bells and forcing Trump into early action- or, simply taking action on their own. Now, they are misleadingly crediting Trump for actions he failed (and is still failing) to put in place. 

As this article makes clear, inexperienced appointees, many with political rather than public health motives, combined with Trump's top-down-fear-based leadership, is now costing lives and livelihoods."

 He diminished it's scale from the outset.  He said COVID-19 was like ""the flu"". 

He trivialized it, calling it ""the China Virus"", in his xenophobic manner. 

He deflected & diverted, talking about ""the economy"" and how it’s ""…over by Easter"".

He delayed, by (1) not renewing the Pandemic preparedness program (sent to him  on June 05, 2019), (2) by not testing  and (3) by his failure to invoke the Defense Production Act, in a timely fashion, to make masks, gloves and ventilators. 

He is even now in complete denial.  He has told Americans ""I am not responsible.""

Now, because he has no leadership skills, all Americans are in reactive mode.   We are simply following in Trump's chaotic footsteps."

I don't know why the USA refused to just import the German test. Must be about politics or money.

2020-03-29 08:33:34,"This article fails to mention one of the key reasons for this failure of leadership at the top.  Under normal  circumstances in a normal administration, CDC leaders  would have a relationship with pandemic response veterans at the WH and at the NSC (including unofficial back channels), and within the office of Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Emergency Response (ASPER).  The Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH) would then bring all of these groups together with the CDC Director to develop a strategy across all of HHS (including the FDA) and the WH.  

Some of these positions, and even entire offices, were eliminated by Trump.  Most of these positions that remained were filled with people without relevant experience, selected  because they were Trump supporters..  Dr. Redfield, for example, is an HIV researcher but has no real experience as a field epidemiologist and unlike most previous CDC directors was not trained in the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS)."

We threw away the battle-tested playbook developed by the last administration against Ebola. History will look back at these mistakes that have compromised our National security, and lives and livelihoods hundreds of millions of Americans. 

This virus is here to stay until it is mitigated by an effective vaccine. We must look to the future: testing a large segment of our population not only for viral RNA but for humoral and cellular immunity in individuals with good or untoward outcomes. Thus we will take a step forward in this war."

On the knowledge front, we must safely include incompetence. On the power front, we see the wrong persons were in charge.  The key part of this article is how President Trump, who constantly reminds us how great the USA is (and better than other nations), had to plead with South Korea for tests.  Why doesn't the USA learn from that country about how to organize itself better?  Figure out what they do there and copy it.  If key things they do there are hard to do there because of culture or whatever, change the culture or whatever--but at the very least don't call the culture or whatever ""the greatest."""

This has been a colossal failure of leadership and a public health disaster.

2020-03-29 05:34:02,"At the very same time that the novel virus was ravaging China in December 2019 and January 2020, the Democrats were totally focused on the impeachment of Trump and the clearly futile attempt to get the Senate to remove the president. This enormous distraction had tragic consequences in that it distract the nation's attention to the very real threat of a new viral plague which had no cure or vaccine defense. The narrative now is that during the intense heat of the impeachment and removal trial in the Senate,
Trump coulda shoulda been focused on the viral threat, while the Democrats were playing the impeachment drama. At no time during time did Pelosi or Schumer try to refocus the nation's attention to the real threat of the viral plague to America. The impeachment drama has had enormously tragic consequences."
2020-03-29 09:37:48,"First of all, thank you so much for the well organized picture that would help us prepare next waves of unknown yet impending pandemics. When each of my friends told me they had just arrived from South Korea or China while those countries were desperately battling with coronavirus, I asked each of them, ""what kind of screening you had to get through?"" Their responses shocked me. They were so worried about painstaking protocols to detect the virus since the United States has CDC, FDA, and NIH but were so shocked that with just a couple of simple questions, they easily passed through the customs. Even though they were allowed to get on the airplanes after the screenings in the Korean or Chinese airport, they secluded themselves for two weeks, saying ""see you after at least 15 days."" They said ""self quarantine"" had become a social and moral norm for themselves and communities. Without any doubt, I had believed we had more testing kits and masks because we have CDC, FDA, and NIH even though we don't have a president who carries out very basic duty to execute constitutional responsibilities. This dire situation critically challenges how federalism efficiently functions when the country needs urgent actions to save its citizens and land."

What is the plan moving forward. I hear contradictory statements daily. We Americans deserve to be told of a coherent strategy moving forward. The first tragedy was the pandemic itself which was can not be blamed on anyone. The greater tragedy is the sheer incompetents of our leaders in developing a battle plan. We in America are good at castling blame for the past. The question I have is what are we going to do tomorrow."
2020-03-29 05:30:36,"I am a doctor. We have still not gotten to robust universal testing. Most people even those with symptoms who present at a hospital cannot be tested. Either because of restrictions around who can be tested (severe enough symptoms) or because they have to ration tests. 

It’s psychotic. The person who is not severely I’ll goes home, infects 3 others, who infect 9 others, who infect 27, 81, 243. 

So because we cannot afford or prioritize testing every potential case (people WITH SYMPTOMS), we risk 200  cases.

Psychotic."

Mr. Deere is truly a White House spokesman, because his regard for the truth matches that of the current occupant."

To have permitted the CDC and FDA to not function in a unified manner is additional proof. The CDC and FDA are here to protect the people and under the trump administration this did not happen. As an RN of 35 years it is unthinkable that these 2 departments would not have the leadership to function in the protection of the American people. It is also a tragedy of major proportion that many people will die due to inability of this administration to enact the corporations to mass produce personal protective equipment and ventilators again slow walking the PANDEMIC response. I have lost my faith and trust in the CDC and FDA but more than that l have no faith in the trump administration to act in a way to protect the citizens of America. This is a tragedy that will be remembered for many years to come and the review will not be positive.

They wouldn't say who told them not to supply Michigan.

Governor Whitmer called the White House but Trump was busy appearing on Fox and belittling her at the same time she was attempting to call. She didn't blame the White House, but indications point to Trump as the one who doesn't want to help Michigan."

No litmus test is necessary to lay the ultimate responsibility the magnitude of this pandemic belongs to in this country. The answer is simple. It starts at the very top. Initial official statements to inform the public with fact based information about the severity of the virus was never done by Trump. These lapses and missteps in leadership inevitably caused the chain reaction of events further down the ladder, eventually leading us to the dire situation everyone is experiencing. Settled.

The United States of America has some of the most talented doctors, researchers, and scientists in deadly pathogens and infectious diseases at the CDC, several Federal Agencies, public and private Health Care Systems, and private companies in the world. Their experience and knowledge should not be challenged when a serious outbreak occurs, nor have official vital positions throughout the world eliminated or left vacant. Yet this occurred, and official vital positions in several countries were vacant well before the outbreak. The massive hurdles this dedicated and talented group of individuals must overcome depend upon everyone's cooperation and support. Including the many individuals that appear to not take the pandemic seriously.

This pandemic is unlike the others. The distancing guidelines put in place by the CDC and WHO are a doctor's note that everyone should use. Please be safe, and take care!"

Is it really feasible that all the test kits could have been manufactured and distributed in that time when all the world were clamouring for the same kits? OK possibly, but unlikely but testing could have been improved of course. But, one major restriction that has been bought in in many countries is quarantining states and stopping overseas visitors (regrettably our country didn't do that early enough in relation to visitors from the US and now 2 out of 3 cases in Australia result from infected people returning from overseas). But as soon as Cuomo throws a tantrum, all ideas of quarantining NY are thrown out of the window - you will pay heavily for that, unfortunately."

How many tax dollars have been spent devoted to meetings, planning, creating emergency flowcharts and protocols in the event of such an emergency?  And for how many generations?

Meanwhile the University of Washington in Seattle has a turnaround of only a few hours for test results. My 76-year-old husband with underlying health issues -- former smoker, cancer survivor, A-fib -- has some of the same symptoms but still has not been tested, though he was told if I have the virus he probably has it too. Neither of us knows how long it takes to incubate, how long, mild of severe it will afflict us and when, or if, we may be considered cured or immune we will be if we don't die.

1.  Soak the masks for about 20 mins in 99% ethyl alcohol, (which can be bought by the gallon by any lab, if they do not have it already).   Alcohol at this concentration should quickly destroy the virus.
2. Remove the masks and the alcohol will evaporate quickly (has to be done in a well ventilated environment, no flames or sparks).
3.  The now-dry masks (with ventilation they should dry in under 30 mins) should be clean and ready for reuse.  

As good as a new N-90 mask?  Maybe not, but it is better than none."
2020-03-29 04:33:21,"What is terribly sad is that Germany has had an affordable test it is willing to sell for weeks. I just read that it finally started selling some to the US. But, the newfound willingness to seek outside help is little too late and there was absolutely no need to try and develop a ""better test"" at home. The current administration is an epitome of the problem the US has had for decades though: the idea that the US is somehow unique and somehow more ingenious than the rest of the world. Under past administrations too folks and commentators on both ends of the political spectrum have turned their noses to what other countries have been doing better, from gun control to universal health coverage to retraining workers in lost blue collar jobs. There is always this notion that the US has to reinvent the wheel somehow and it veers on arrogance to the point that it is costing Americans lives everyday. In our now global world there has to be greater realization that we can learn from others the same way they can learn from us. But, I worry that Americans, no matter whether they are on the right or left, don't fully understand what this means."
2020-03-29 04:49:25,"The best thing we can do is test everyone in the US,  and as soon as possible. The numbers will be through the roof but I contend that will actually calm people when they see the percentage of those who have it versus those who die from it.  It will give us faith that we can beat this, focus on hot spots and make sure those areas get the required equipment to fight it and save lives,  and also allow those who overcame the illness to return to normal lives.  Trump is currently engaged in willful indifference and acting out of political paralysis. If he activated immediate and frequent testing we can move on much quicker."
2020-03-29 06:26:39,"To an outsider, it would be amazing that the name Pelosi does not appear.   From November on she made the  media and  Administration concentrate solely on impeachment.

Then Trump in the State of the Union called for cooperation  against the virus.  Nancy tore up the speech and sent the House home for two weeks.  That should be the central ad:  his appeal or for coperation, her tearing up of the speech, her recess. and the reminder by the Kentucky representative that constitutionally this kind of bill originates in the House."

It beggars belief , what have we become?"
2020-03-29 10:20:47,"I do not understand how the US decided to not use a German-designed test, even though it was distributed by the WHO. You could have tested months earlier on a massivly larger scale. The F.D.A. decided not to approve the test, but rather let the American people go untested for weeks? Is that national pride or hubris?"
2020-03-29 08:27:29,"Having read this article several times, it's clear that mismanagement and mistakes were made at mutiple levels repeatedly. A knowledgeable take-chsrge person never appaeared and road blocks developed that further slowed the process of getting a good test out radidly and in volume

Leadership was lacking from the top down. As a result, we have a much worse pandemic than we should have  had costing  lives and hardship. I'm sure many books will be written after this is all over documenting the mess and who was responsible. We obviously did not have a first-rate health care  system in place to handle a crisis.There is no excuse.There was time to do something and the time was frittered away. It's all unbelievable. I'm at a loss to say more."
2020-03-29 08:48:54,"On the topic of the CDC’s overtures being rebuffed, I have heard that the Chinese perspective was that the US did not offer any practical proposal as to how the CDC would help. When you add to that the very combative attitude coming out of the US at every level towards China, it is no wonder that they did not want to take resources away from the crisis to accommodate the CDC. Other countries responded rapidly with assistance, whereas the US was signally unhelpful.

The fact that the Germans were able to get a test working (as were many other countries and even US bodies other than the CDC), shows that the Chinese should not take any blame for the US’ failure to get tests out.

Now in Hong Kong the virus is taking off. This is due to infection coming in from the US and Europe and is much worse than what we received from the mainland which is next door to us. Again this makes it clear that the rest of the world is responsible for the pandemic. China was only responsible for their epidemic and they handled it well after a (probably understandable) rocky start."

In South Korea, for example, regulators in early February summoned executives from 20 medical manufacturers, easing rules as they demanded tests.”

2020-03-28 23:24:57,"I'd like to blame this all on Trump.  Lord knows he's made his own gigantic foolish imprint on it.  But this has been on the radar for decades.  A lock tight safety plan is exactly the kind of thing our government should provide its citizens, but regime after regime politics take precedent over sanity and we all allow it.  We aren't prepared for disasters:  Extreme weather, Flood, Fire, Guns, Terrorism, Infrastructure failures and most of all, Health.  Supporting the public need is routinely trounced in Congress as Socialism, and again, we allow it.  All of the movements were correct:  Capitalism rules, Corporations control and money matters.  But as little miracles happen as a result of this disaster, we as a people need to take control of our government, both State and Federal, and make it work for us.  Now is the time to shed our dependence on shoddy healthcare, on fossil fuels, on antiquated technology.  Now is the time, in the wake of the worst natural disaster in 100 years, to finally throw the baby out with the bathwater."

Perhaps get the mathematician featured recently in the NYT to give us estimates based on the # of positive tests and have him run those “community transmission” algorithms, factor in city density etc. so that more realistic numbers can be arrived at. 

The numbers we read on maps everyday are but a fraction of the real US number. There’re mostly numbers tallied from hospitals and the abysmal testing outposts we have. Why continue to confuse Americans and the world with misleading facts ? Haven’t we had enough already ? 

Germany is doing 500,000 tests a day or a week? I can’t recall but they contain the outbreaks quickly by tracking down all contacts and isolating them, consequently their numbers are more accurate. 

I am constantly sending these maps and updates to twenty-somethings who think things are not that bad yet where they live - and then I have to hammer home why the numbers in their community are likely significantly higher and thus they need to take greater precautions. **I’m tired of telling people what I want the news to report.** I fully expect thousands upon thousands of spring break returnees will not entertain the possibility of significantly higher numbers unless NYT you report projections. Each and every time."

Their incompetence is costing our country untold lives, hardship, and treasure. Our reputation and image in the world have plummeted, with serious consequences that will manifest themselves for many years from now.

Whatever trust Americans had left in their government will be shattered by the outrageous mishandling of the coronavirus response. And who can blame them, when the government bureaucrats at all levels left their fellow Americans fend for themselves?"

Because back in January they learnt of a worker dying from the virus and immediately researched and tested everyone he had been in contact,  and quarantined everyone who tested positive.

This goes beyond all that. 

I have never been more saddened and ashamed of my country. Is this who we are? I find it so hard to believe that no one from one of these agencies took the reigns and rose above this disaster. 

I loathe Trump, but this goes way beyond him. This particular testing issue, is a failure of our institutions.

Over the last several years the “deep state” has come through to save us time and time again. I’m sure it allows some of us sleep well at night, knowing that even though our beloved institutions are being weakened by this current administration, we have good people in place that are actually doing a lot of the dirty work necessary to run this country. 

Well this disaster was exasperated by good people. Several good people made horrible decisions that led us to where we are. 

When Covid-19 is all said and done, I believe we will be seen as one of the countries that handled it the worst. (Lack of PPE is our other great failing currently).

I have never been more saddened for my country. The trust I’ve lost in my institutions due to this current situation will be a wound that will not heal easily.

Trumps pervasive demand for fealty, his poor choice of Commissioners, other leaders, tamps down the needed ""speaking truth to power"".   It smothers and compromises those who have knowledge and wisdom.    Trump himself is unable to recognize wisdom.

This is having the effect of killing many, many thousands of Americans and secondarily disrupting our economy.  Making this growing disaster worse.

Scientists have rung the alarm about pandemics and climate for years; this administration made one of its first order of business to sideline science on every issue, to deny and deny on both until it had no real options to act wisely.

But, more than that, we are living with the consequences here of an administration that, from the top, refused to engage in the normal transition  process after Mr. Trump's election, thereby preventing his assumption of office from being as seamless as possible.

Since President Trump declared himself as a wartime President then he should have imposed greater tracing program, testing, and other programs. His hubris is his greatest weakness. If he didn’t think of it, then he’s reluctant to adopt the idea.

3. In 2018 Trump fired the NSC pandemic preparedness team and the global health security team even after being briefed about a possible pandemic. 

4. Jan. 2019, Dan Coates, head of DNI released the “worldwide threat assessment of the intelligence community report” which outlined a pandemic threat for Human Security and Global Health in which the US was to take a worldwide lead. Trump was briefed on that.

6. Trump Is stalling the release of the 2020 Intel report which he knows warns that the U.S. isn’t ready for a global pandemic.

7. In Dec 2019/Jan 2020 Trump received intelligence reports about the seriousness of the coronavirus threat, and he continued to downplay its severity in public. 

8. For weeks in March 2020, State officials and hospitals have begged for more supplies using the Defense Production Act. Trump waited weeks, before issuing and appears to be politicizing help based on party affiliations and ties to donors.

It is the direct product of the denigration of professionalism which did not start with, but has found its most virulent expression in, this president* and his acolytes.

According to this article, which explains the needs of testing, there must be not only the first test, but also 2 follow up tests, not more than 2 weeks apart, and that is in the case of the person who tests positive for the virus. For the person who test negative, the test would have to be repeated - within days, at the very least - unless they are completely isolated. Because surviving the illness does not make you immune (so far as I can tell, that is not a given.) So we are talking about each and every American who is not locked away from society and its contagion. In other words, most people. 
That is a lot of tests, people. And you don't just roll them out, in stages, to segments of the population. They have to be there, free to anyone who can't pay, and the results tracked. Records kept, and people identified, probably to local police and certainly hospitals and on databases. We do not even have a national database for patient health information (as, I believe, at least one Scandinavian country has). 
So: how simple is this, exactly? How can or could this have been accomplished? I imagine a test that is as simple as testing your urine for glucose - a strip that turns color (wiith the potential for false negatives and positives, of course). Easily stored, free for everyone, results verified, tracked, etc. And, as explained above, requiring a LOT of strips."
2020-03-29 12:13:54,"I live in Bogota, Colombia where the whole country is in ”self isolation ” for 2 more weeks (one week already gone).

The government machinery is created to keep out fraud in some of these medical testing procedures.

In Colombia, it was reported today that the government has seized kits for home use - attractively priced - for purchase - but totally useless.

There is no telling how many folks have been duped.

Let's not forget that young attractive looking Stanford graduate who fooled the best including ex Secretary Schultz that she had a blood test - that would be one of the cheapest ever.

So, these issues with CDC - and the bureaucratic infighting - not surprised at all.

I spent over 4 decades in the oil patch - and volunteered for clean up efforts post Macondo.

Folks may recall that even Macondo effort - driven by BP - was taken over by the Feds, Cost Guard among many others - largely because Obama wanted ”to put his boots on BP's neck.”

And yet, it was BP that capped the well - after 80 plus days- if I remember right.

Hopefully, Wuhan will teach our scientists some new methods on how to quickly develop tests for the next invasive virus.

The NYT is reporting a story on ventilators where the government's best efforts failed because - well, similar issues as here.

And let's not forget that deaths attributed to H1N1 are an order of magnitude greater than Wuhan fatalities to date - despite widespread testing."
2020-03-29 12:16:13,"While you would of course try to lay blame at Trumps door,the lack of testing kits and the fact they didn’t work
was in fact the cause of the delay,if we had millions of testing kits ready to go I am sure we would have used
them,the fact we did not is the cause of the delayed testing and the huge increase in cases by day. Asymptomatic patients
wandered freely among us all spreading the virus I guess especially in NYC.The solution is for either the Feds
or State departments of health to stock huge quantities of testing supplies easily manipulated for the current Corona virus,
or persuade China where many of these virus’s start to do a better job of reporting them and not get excused by the WHO."
2020-03-29 12:44:04,"This virus would have spread throughout our country no matter how much testing was done! If you look back two to three months at the mindset of our citizens, we would not have stayed at home and shut down the economy - it just wouldn't have happened, no matter how many tests were done. 

In fact, despite the hysteria and terrible economic plunge, it is questionable whether the US will have as  half as many deaths from coronavirus as from influenza."
2020-03-29 12:34:55,"The scientific and medical community did not rise to the occasion.  But let's not lose sight of the fact that from the start, with the exception of the travel ban on flights from China, which was at least in part a racist gesture, Trump downplayed this threat in order to preserve the stock market, the economy, and his chances for re-election. 

Now his economy is in the toilet, and hopefully he will soon join it."

Now we can just wait for the virus to takes its toll until a vaccine is developed."
2020-03-29 12:33:16,"I remember well the upbeat claims that Trump was making when the government, under his leadership, well, such as it is, should have been preparing and testing.
We saw this crisis unfolding and the move to ban people from China was ineffective.  
Had this been any other administration the Republicans in Congress would be calling for resignations.

As I watched the signing ceremony starring Donald Trump and his sidekick McConnell I became more angry when I saw that ear to ear grin of McConnell’s knowing he and the rest of his cabal could have attempted to cajole Trump into action.

Now that we are entering a stage in which the virus crisis is full blown, we have Trump threatening governors, blaming Obama, and the Trump supporters irritated by Dr. Fauci as they see him as part of the “deep state” that Trump bleats and brays about.

We will get through this.  And it will take governors such as Cuomo to help us get through the crisis.  
And Trump will continue his comedy show from the press briefing room.  And his supporters will believe every word he utters that is false."

2020-03-29 12:57:37,"The biggest factor in our coronavirus crisis was the failure of Donald Trump to appreciate the potential danger to America of what was happening in Wuhan, his earlier dismantling of medical intelligence offices, and his insistence upon presenting a false, rosy picture of the virus to the American public.

Just as damaging was Donald Trump's appointing people to be his advisers on the virus based on their politics, instead of their experience. Notably, Alex Azar is a good public speaker best suited to defend an organization for questionable decisions of the past.

Of those persons already in place, Dr. Robert Redfield of C.D.C. had no experience running an entire agency in an emergency mode, and he was too fussy in insisting that a C.D.C. testing method be used instead of another country's, although the Redfield approach probably appealed to the nationalistic Trump. Dr. Redfield let perfect get in the way good, when time was of the essence. Similarly, Dr. Stephen Hahn, the new appointee at the F.D.A., dragged his feet instead of taking bold action.

Donald Trump has been the worst possible leader to deal with this pandemic."
2020-03-29 12:38:11,"""Failure to test"" has become the mantra to protect state and city democrats who acted irresponsibly.  Look at a time-line of NYC's response and you understand why ""failure to test"" has to be the catchall because no one in their right mind can explain away the actions and in-actions of the mayor and governor.  Likewise in Louisiana, the governor and the mayor of New Orleans went forward with Mardi-Gras, ignoring the obvious consequences.

Earlier testing would have helped - I think that is obvious.  But none of that would have mattered in hotspots like NYC or New Orleans."

Rather it is caused by my inability to gather courage.  I feel that grocery stores are not 'clean rooms' and thus I fear the C Virus germs everywhere by everyone.  So even tho I am 'suited up' with gloves, hand sanitizer in my left pocket and debit card in right pocket, once I GET to store I either do a U-turn and leave or once inside the store spend enormous energy trying to maneuver products into my bags and not touch anything else.  Further, I end up circling around aisles when I see someone else and in complete paranoia - getting maybe 60% of what was needed.  Forget ordering online - could never trust the UPS or FEDEX handlers sanitary measures.  The only positive is that I am used to using just the one hand when handling allergens due to our child's severe anaphylaxis. Sure wish they tested in January and also stopped all air travel.

However, when leadership is ""derailed"" by other more seemingly important objectives, whether they be personal agenda or political agenda or otherwise, then we are faced with a simple lack of highly effective leadership."
2020-03-29 13:03:16,"This article is helpful in hindsight, but by focusing solely on testing as a panacea, the article ignores the realities of the total picture.  
About 160,000 people were arriving every day from overseas at JFK alone. With the other airports, that is millions in a month.  Trump closed off people coming from China, for which he was labeled a racist.  He should have added Italy, but no one realized how bad the situation was there. 
We are talking about an innumerable number of tests for people coming from other countries. The tests were taking days to analyze.  People may not show symptoms, or may be carrying and initially test negative.  
China closed down Wuhan, and people had to have apps which could trace their movements if they left their house.  Imagine trying that in NYC.  What would have happened if, when De Blasio and the head of the health department told people to go out and enjoy themselves, and allowed the Chinese Lunar celebration to take place on Feb.9, Trump had told him to shut the city down?  There would have been one big NY raspberry from the residents and officials. 
After leaving much of the fleet sitting at Pearl Harbor, FDR pulled us through the war (with a lot more mistakes that were censored at the time).  Whether Trump and his administration can do the same, remains to be seen. But a lot of the Monday morning quarterbacks are the same people who ignored the danger themselves."

We were told to leave the masks for the health care professionals, well, they still are fighting for masks and they have thousands of sick patients. In Asia they were able to control the outbreak because everyone wears masks, the sick and the not sick. Of course masks and eye protection will stop the spread . It’s never too late to correct a mistake, everyone must now wear a mask when they are going to be out among other people. And if your in state where it hasn’t spread yet, don’t even think of leaving the house without a mask and eye protection . This should just be standard operating procedure from this point on. We already have social distancing which is very good, add a mask on everyone for good measure and we can turn this tide Let’s not talk about mistakes made  let’s talk about the ways to contain the problem.

My health care system is doing more than it’s best and rolled out an amazing drive thru testing program.  The people at testing center had a mixture of masks, some not ideal.  But did amazing work!
I was told, because I was on front lines, my test would be run ‘in-house’ and completed two days ahead of schedule.
Symptoms? I have cough, low grade fever (100.5), painful red eyes, and some chest tightness.  I’m not scared or even anxious, but my wife is terrified.
              My issue is the governments roll out of testing.  The american people deserve an apology, not excuses.  An apology means we can trust our government and right now we need that trust.

2020-03-29 12:57:13,"This is excellent in depth reporting which one rarely sees outside of the Times.

The Trump haters will see only what they want to see. It's all Trump's fault.  Which is of course true in the military sense that a commander is responsible for all the actions of his subordinates.

But, in the broader sense, one who actually reads the entire article has to realize that the unfortunate failure to better limit the spread of Coronavirus could have happened under any Presidency.

Bureaucracies will be bureaucratic.  The article demonstrates that the talking points  of Democrats about how the problem stems from budget cuts and Trump's action in ""disbanding"" the department whose mission was to prevent the spread of such pandemics into the U.S. is simply a myth.

True, if Trump had intervened personally earlier to get the bureaucrats to do what needed to be done,thiings would be better. Trump isn't a detail man.  One can imagine Jimmy Carter staying at the CDC headquarters until they got on track.

But it is in the nature of bureaucracies to be bureaucratic. That's why we shouldn't rely on them too much or give them too much power.  The irony is that Trump's strongest critics tend to the those who think that bureaucracies are the key to solving every problem. Just establish a new department with an appropriate title and mission and throw a lot of money at it and problem solved!

It's not that simple."
2020-03-29 12:54:03,"Without extensive tests, one cannot estimate the number of infected, the spread of the disease, and the actual curvival rate. Once the infected are found, they can be isolated, while the healthy can work. So in slowing the testing, Trump & co have destroyed the economy, increased the unemployment, and endangered Trump's chances of reelection. Don's ""gut feelings"" have once again driven all of us into the ditch."
2020-03-29 13:44:18,"With all due respect, this wasn't a failure to test, it was a decision to deny that a pandemic was on the way. Why? Because a pandemic would rattle the markets and compromise Trump's reelection.

If only it was a mistake. But no, Trump's every decision or declaration or whatever are always based on how it will make him look, how it will count as a win. Always has been this way and always will.

Now that the pandemic can't be denied anymore, his next bad decision will be to declare victory over the virus too soon. There is nothing this man will not do to get reelected, whatever the consequences. 

Happily, we have this courageous Congress that will protect us all from the calamities that are certain to come by blocking his every move or even removing him from office. Because they care more about the people, than their careers, right?"

We could have done the quantitative version of the test in 2000.  Thousands of labs had the qPCR machines that could test 96 samples every two hours.  Why these labs were not recruited is beyond.  The extraction media in the swab-holding tubes is so potent (think phenol/chloroform) that viruses don't survive.  The lab workers would almost certainly remain safe.  We could have practiced containment and now we're left with mitigation."

Remember all the comments by politicians and others that Chinese restaurants were fine to eat at and we should go to them.  They should have said don't go to any restaurant.  Testing will delay the spread of the virus and give people some time for better treatments or a vaccination.  However it is going to be here until vaccination or herd immunity (1-5 million deaths), also a slight chance for self attenuation which I don't know what the prospects are."

2020-03-29 14:17:10,"Even the current reported numbers are highly suspect.  Doctors are not sending patients for testing because there’s a shortage of tests and because, even if the test is positive, there is no therapeutic response... only the recommendation of isolation.

The memory issues may stem from either the sedative medication or insufficient Oxygen, or both; the PTSD arises because patients in the ICU need physical touch, emotional support, human contact and they are denied this due to being in isolation.

(Example: when Dr. Fauci attempts to correct Trump's lies and distortions, the hard right comes after him; don't they remember that his widely-revered national public health career began under their ""sainted"" forefather Reagan?)

Since Goldwater and Reagan, Americans have been fed the lie that ""government is the problem."" No, the institution isn't, but bad governance is, and our slow response to this crisis has brought out the worst in our worst administration in living memory. The only route I see to flattening the curve is for Trump to get out of the way and restore trust in actual, not acting, experts. If he won't do that voluntarily, I regretfully propose that his cabinet rise up and remove him from office using the 25th Amendment.

While illegal immigration had been on the decline for 20 years, and deportations up under President Obama, trump loved the applause line. He craves adoration, yet is too lazy and shallow to read, listen, question, learn and consider. When congress would not fun his wall, trump began taking funds from the Pentagon not to solve a problem, simply to keep the applause coming.

This preference for bluster and applause over problem-solving is now costing lives. Failure to learn. Failure to listen. Failure to act in a timely manner. Failure to lead.

Epic failure."
2020-03-29 13:39:16,"It is because this administration was more focused on building a wall and detaining innocent children in detention camps than governing. Let’s not forget facts in light of the economic rollercoaster we are all trapped on. 

Many workers were trained in emergency response and FEMA. Surely they remember? 

Incompetence and callousness of leadership is how we got here. Nobody wants to work for somebody willing to be so cavalier with others lives and livelihoods. Trump’s Plague indeed."
2020-03-29 13:41:12,"WHy didn’t Redfield use WHO’s test in the interim while CDC was developing their own test. In fact, WHY were we so fixated on developing our own test when everyone else around the world was using WHO’s test FAR before we started with out own? 

Redfield failed to have a simple contingency during the R&D process. He made a HUGE mistake and needs to be held accountable for his complacency in “trusting” his “veteran scientists” without having a backup plan that should have been the most primary tenet of CDC operation during this kind of  public crisis! 

In fact, the CDC actually anticipated this could happen one day, and it STILL didn’t have the proper contingency in place. What would have happened if we were hit with a virus that with no known treatment with a mortality rate of 25% across the ENTIRE population rather than just among the 75+ age group?! 

Horribly irresponsible management of such a critical public health agency."

Now everyone can see: the people we rely upon soldier on, while the suits are nakedly useless or worse. Do the elites really think those of us left alive at the end of this pandemic won't remember?"

2020-03-29 14:03:21,"Good leadership involves anticipating crises and taking intelligent action to prevent them. 
President Obama had to face the H1N1 pandemic and the Ebola outbreak. But, unlike Trump, he didn't ignore them and then tried to lie them away. Instead, he coordinated a worldwide response, which prevented them from exploding into the disaster we now have with the coronavirus."

2020-03-29 14:13:57,"The Federal Government willfully and negligently mislead the public about the threat of the coronavirus.  Despite Trumps statement that he knew this was a pandemic in January, the virus continued to infect the masses for two more months.  The Trump administration  failed to take any measures to ensure adequate testing, the necessary medical supplies were available for the health providers and enough hospital beds.  As a result there have been over 1000 deaths, mass hospitalization, overburdened hospitals and Doctors, quarantines, mass layoffs and the economy that has bottomed out.  

One gets the sense that Mr. Trump is more concerned with the appearance of leading rather than any actually leading this government. If the Governors and Mayors hadn't stepped up to help the people we would be in dire straits. 

 At the very least, Mr. Trump is guilty of criminal negligence.  This man and the administration that he hides behind should be removed from office for their failure to fulfill their sworn duties and obligations to the people of the United States!"
2020-03-29 13:18:03,"From the outside this looks like a failure of leadership. Incompetent people were put in positions of authority and, unsurprisingly, failed. It all stems from the top. It's one thing to blame the bureaucrats, you also need to look at how and why they were appointed in the first place, and by whom.

While this article is focused on the USA, and acknowledging it is having horrific consequences for you all, spare a thought for how this has affected other countries. The US was the source of more cases in Australia than any other single country. People were arriving back home from the USA only to find they'd been infected there, and in some instances it looks as if they hadn't yet detected it in those parts of the US where they got it.

Let's hope this fiasco is not going to be a blueprint for action/inaction on climate. I'm losing optimism."
2020-03-29 13:30:27,"As a retired Navy officer, I know that “leadership” has little to do with “expertise”. Yet, in the U. S., particularly in technical fields, expertise and office “politics” are how we determine who will be promoted to a position that, in a crisis, demands “leadership”. Thus, in a crisis, we have a wealth of expertise, but few “leaders” (not to be confused with “managers”). A leader makes tough unpopular decisions and is proactive vice reactive. Our “managers” are almost exclusively reactive, and routinely behind the problem. And in this case, as in the military, a lack of leadership results in needless deaths."
2020-03-29 13:58:29,"Like a lot of people, I've known about the virus for a long time, forever it seems. Our President and the people around him knew about it too. As it started to get out of hand nothing was done about it here in the greatest country in the world. 
I started to get a bit of a dry throat, I was nervous, after all I'm 76 years old and all I keep hearing is that I'm expected to get it and not survive, that's comforting. I called my doctor to see if I could get a test, he didn't have any. Was I in China? Did I have a temperature? How was I? No, stay at home and if you develop anything give me a call and I'll tell you where to go. I called my insurance company, Blue Cross as somebody told me they could tell me where to go, they didn't have a clue, I contacted CNN where they say Ask a question, no answers. I've now been in isolation for 14 days, I feel somewhat OK and from what I read there is still no testing for everybody, if you're not nice to the President you won't get help, thank God for Gov Cuomo and Dr Fauci. I intend to stay at home forever it seems, I walk my dog, take a walk everyday weather permitting, yoga at home and the grocery store and if I did get the virus I wouldn't go to the hospital to die alone I will stay put."
2020-03-29 13:40:47,"In a nutshell, the C.D.C. failed. They failed in that they allowed a president, someone with zero knowledge of medicine, to call the shots. And they did that because they were short-term thinkers. 

In medicine, depending on the circumstances, patients aren’t necessarily the only ones at risk. And that is what we are seeing today. 

The C.D.C. had to see medical practitioners at risk to take this seriously. 

In my book, that’s a shame on medicine. Heck, it’s the height of medical malpractice. 

Go back to the records when someone in medicine had said this was an emergency. About a week, maybe later, a gentleman from the C.D.C. appeared on Capital Hill and said it’s not an emergency. 

The C.D.C. failed at this task and the person in charged should resign."
2020-03-29 14:02:28,"This slide into failure of leadership is not new, but it gained insidious proportions when Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld blamed our intelligence agencies for the mistake of going to war with Iraq. Since then, the “deep-state” conspiracy has grown and festered until we see, recently, Dr. Fauci, being attacked for giving scientific advice to president Trump.  If this trend continues, we could very well have the Donald take over the scientific and medical field totally, not just through intimidation, and go on to repeat the disaster that an earlier Russian dictator, who was referred to by his first name. President Trump needs to work with all Americans who have critical information he can use to defeat the Corona crisis. For starters, he must forgo the sycophants everywhere especially in the media, and the unfounded attacks on our own government agencies."

2020-03-29 13:27:40,"Blinded ?

An exaggeration, at best.  Delayed our ability to assess the situation ? Yep.

But assessment and containment are two different things.

In January writers in this outlet and many others protested loudly when the administration propsed a travel ban, which was delayed until February because governors and opposition leaders were busy making political hay of the situation.

The severity was grasped early on.

But people everywhere typically don't act until they see something for themselves.

Well, they're seeing it now.

I feel bad for the emergency responders because they are charged with getting into the face of it all - a mess created by people ignoring the early warnings to wash, and distance, and by failing to restrict travel earlier because of lack of political will.

The good news is that federalism is working and the governors and their staffs are managing things, with the assistance of the federal government institutions put in place for exactly this purpose.

Sadly, early misqueues muddied the waters.

But we can't blame ourselves for this.

The Wuhan biolab was experimenting with ACE acting coronaviruses derived from bats and combined with human and other materials.

It's no coincidence that this outbreak originated there.

And no, not a conspiracy theory. Accidents happen. 

But, remember the anthrax event ? The Chinese Communist Party bears the ultimate responsibility, not Trump or any other American."
2020-03-29 13:36:05,"DId anyone expect a Trump administration to rise to any occasion?
Whatever the disaster, Trump has hollowed out the government of experienced leaders in favor of loyal synchphants. His measure of success for the VPs coronavirus taskforce is how many times Pence can praise ""our president"" in each press conference.
Here is hoping we make it to January 2021 without something else cropping up. 
Imagine a severe earthquake, a category 5 storm, an oil spill in the Gulf occurring on top of our already full plate. Then remember there are no more preparations for any of these scenarios than there are for cover-19.
Every family should have their own disaster plan. Maybe Trump will come and throw paper towels at you, but far more likely you won't even get that level of support."
2020-03-29 13:51:15,"It is not just a failure to test. It is a failure to stockpile respirators, ventilators, and prepare solutions that could track contacts of patients. 

It is a failure of colossal proportions considering the partial success in tackling the 2009 H1N1 epidemic, and the vast swath of knowledge already published by the CDC on pandemic preparedness.

We point fingers at specific individuals at our own peril. There are two main reasons behind this failure:

1) underfunding of the government: just as the number of individuals in a society grows, the size of the government needs to grow to keep up with the increase in complexity. 

Underfunding means that government agencies managed the decreasing funds allocated to them by this administration by using them for short-term goals. 

They were unable to stockpile; add the decreasing funds with the low morale during a Republican administration and it becomes difficult for government agencies to consistently retain their best talent.


2) politicization of the science and of the leaders: if you don't believe in pandemics, then why should you prepare?

Failure to guide rational decision making on science can only lead to irrational actions that lack the power of forecasting, as we see here."
2020-03-29 14:03:32,"I wonder how the Federal bureaucrats who did not have enough sense of urgency and leadership to mitigate this crisis sleep at night.  Even more, I wonder if they still have their jobs.   Have heads rolled?  This is the kind of thing that causes the right-wing of the government to say we should drown it in the bathtub, even though the real cause is short-funding and (evidentially) unwise hiring.  A sense of urgency has to come from the top.  On many levels, it apparently wasn't there.  I hope we have learned our lesson, but I doubt it."
2020-03-29 13:11:18,"Many western democracies tested early, but as of today they have significantly worse Total Cases per Population size results than US.   That includes Germany, France, Israel, Norway, Denmark and many others.

If you test, you must trust the testing results.  Dr. Birx pointed out in a briefing a week ago that the early testing regimes like that provided by WHO were not reliable - giving too many false results in FDA submitted data.   

So contrary to the thesis of this article, those western democracy countries that relied upon early testing seem to be doing much worse at present.

As Dr. Birx pointed out, the task force waited to have more reliable testing approved by FDA.

That strategy seems to be paying off when we compare the US numbers to much of Europe and Israel."
2020-03-29 13:19:27,"The fumbling incompetence, along with false and misleading announcement from government officials, echo the disastrous start of the 1918 pandemic. From the start, alarms had been sounded but officials refused to respond or inform the public. Military preparations for war forced millions of personnel into training camps and crowded ships. Millions of soldiers died in Europe before getting near a battlefield. Wishful thinking and denial of reality caused an avoidable catastrophe then and again now. As Bob Dylan asked, ""When will we ever learn?"""
2020-03-29 13:30:26,"For years experts have been saying that Trump's failure to attract, recruit and retain good talent would someday come back to burn us. While this article does not explicitly say so: now is that time.  The head of the FDA was only six weeks into his job. There had been two HHS heads in only 3 years. The top federal healthcare agencies had their budgets cut and had hundreds of jobs unfilled. Nobody knew exactly what the president wanted because of his failure to lead during the crisis. Instead he tried to wish it away, blame others, and in typical Trump fashion refused to accept accountability and ownership of a problem that confronted him. This lack of leadership sent mixed messages to FDA, CDC, HHS and other agencies and helped contribute to the uncoordinated and unimpressive response to a virus that had the potential to devastate the public health and economy. 

Harry Truman once said: ""The buck stops here."" And as millions of people who buy used cars know ""you buy it, you own it."" After 3.5 years in office Trump still doesn't understand those two simple facts of life. That's why his companies have failed. And that is why the US response to the Coronavirus has failed, when you boil it all down. Leadership matters. It was absent here."
2020-03-29 13:50:39,It sounds like the CDC was most at fault. They claimed to be ready to test and were not. To blame that on the administration is a stretch.
2020-03-29 14:05:30,"The trump administration treated the testing kit debacle as a real estate deal. So what if a party walked away for a while; the building wasn’t going anywhere.  Lots of real estate deals “die” before they get completed.  This time, it wasn’t the deal that had to die, but the American people, whose electoral college elected this man. Trump’s name rarely mentioned in this article, but any administration has to be judged “top to bottom”. So you know that responsibility for this starts with the President."
2020-03-29 13:19:29,"Truth is, we were not focused or prepared as a nation. The Trump administration seems not to have paid enough attention to what was going on in Wuhan China months ago. Trump probably sticking with his ""us vs them"" campaign theme.  

He has been focused on other things as we have seen from his assassination of an Iranian general to his endless twitter posts about the impeachment process, his campaign rallies etc. The rising global health crisis was never on his mind. It's that simple. 

We already had our first known case early in the year and nothing was done. So March was too late to begin social distancing and other public health measures. We have been way behind and all I see now is confusion and finger pointing."
2020-03-29 13:22:21,"Reading this article reminds me of the proverb: ""Too many cooks spoil the broth"".
There just seemed to be too many players with no one particular leader directing the whole process. Then there was Trump appointing Mike Pence as overall director without informing the Health officials in advance. (Why Pence anyway?).
One concern in Australia was that our Trump-adoring P.M. Morrison seemed to be following Trump's apparent lack of urgency about the pandemic. Fortunately he has moved away from that now, not without some prodding though. Even as late as Friday 13th March he introduced a 500 person limit on public events, but not to start until monday 16th March. That allowed his favourite church Hillsong to hold a convertion over the weekend with 3500 people attending each of the three days!"
2020-03-29 14:42:30,"I am convinced that this virus was around well before the end of last year.  My healthy, fit spouse with no underlying health issues came down with a cough in early November,  days after we got back from a two-week long European trip. The cough lasted for nine weeks, subsiding finally in mid-January. In all that time, he had no fever, pretty much of an appetite, but was so fatigued from the coughing (which kept him from sleeping some nights),  that he often skipped his daily bike ride.  
Eventually, he had a chest x-ray which was clear. And now we worry that he could have a recurrence, as no one can say whether contracting Covid-19 renders one immune to it."
2020-03-29 14:43:59,"Until this latest, I have always been impressed with the CDC, their professionalism, their straight talk, their ability to get things done right, the first time. Sadly it didn’t happen this time. This article explains part of it, but there must be even more reason why a normally first class agency performed so badly. I hope to live through this epidemic long enough to learn the full story."
2020-03-29 14:52:13,"There are plenty of lessons to be learned, for sure, but trying to reduce it to failure at the top and lack of testing are simplistic views. We know now (but not early on) that (1) it takes about 5.6 days from infection to symptoms; (2) spreading starts two days before symptoms; (3) at least 50% of infected remain asymptomatic or very mild carriers, infecting others for 10 days; (4) virus lives for 8+ hours on plastic, metal and cardboard. With 23,000 passengers landing every day from China after 10 hours on plane, the best decision was to stop those flights... Yes, contact tracing with fast precise tests should be been available sooner, but it would not have prevented the spreading. As such, US is in much better shape than several European countries in per capita peak infections and death rate. In addition, US economy was better to start with, limiting the domino effect we will see in Europe, I am afraid..."
2020-03-29 15:32:14,"I would have to put a large part of the blame on another government agency, the TSA. I traveled through several airports on March 2nd and March 13th and I never witnessed one agent that was checking IDs, tickets, baggage, etc. change their gloves. They only change their gloves when they go on break. It's hard to believe that there is no link between the 30 TSA agents working at JFK, Newark, and LaGuardia that have tested positive for coronavirus and NYC becoming an epicenter for the pandemic."
2020-03-29 15:32:59,"The infrastructure for large scale testing has to be in place, always. You can’t suddenly ramp things up when pandemic hits - especially when many of the materials needed are not made in America. For example, Colombia had wide scale testing right away, results back same day. Every city.  How did they do this?  Since they can get mosquito borne illnesses, due to climate, they have a system in place, staffed and ready to begin testing right away. So Covid happens - they are ready to go. Not fumbling looking for materials, getting labs ready, figuring out how to distribute the tests, etc.  US testing was a colossal disaster (I work at a large hospital and know how few and slow the testing was, and still is)."
2020-03-29 15:46:44,"I wish this story had more fully investigated why the CDC rejected the WHO test.  Were there technical issues, or was it simply the old ""not invented here"" syndrome.  It seems to me that even if they had reservations the U.S. would have much been better off if they had obtained and used the WHO test until such time as the CDC-developed test were readily available.  Germany seems to have done very well the WHO test that was developed in Germany.  Germany also has done much, much better with Merkel's leadership, but that is another story."

2020-03-29 00:16:51,"The Trump administration has failed at every level on this, in every possible way, and they continue to. This was clearly a major concern back in the early January.

--keeps its people informed and educated through a media system built for making money, 
--has a healthcare system with the main goal of making money, 
--measures its progress as a society by stock prices, national output, and other ways of making money.

---voted in by people who cannot tell the difference between real wealth and fake wealth. 

The politics of money has so corrupted our nation that tens of thousands of people, and maybe more, will die unnecessarily; millions will have the their lives ruined; and our nation will face unfathomable destruction and dislocations.

It's completely clear they are abject failures at it, no more capable of true leadership than I am of taking a giant leap over the moon.

Florida's governor, who saw no issue with kids on spring break all over the beaches and said nothing about sending them home, all of a sudden had an epiphany about the dangers of the pandemic on his voting block of senior citizens who now crowed about stopping snowbirds from arriving in the state.

The horse left the barn 3 months ago on the spread of Covid-19.  Our failure to test early when we had a chance is all on Trump."

It is exactly the same test used to detect a number of different pathogens, the only difference is in the sequence of DNA (the primers). To have this fail in such a colossal way should be just unforgivable. Tens of thousands more people will die because of it. If you don't want, or can't take the responsibility, then don't take the big boy jobs."

This fictional president -- along with a thoughtful Congress -- would have reacted immediately to early reports from China and from US expert epidemiologists.  She would have ramped up testing, ordered PPE, had more ventilators manufactured, and -- most importantly -- educated the public from January.   Instead of complying with StayHome orders, citizens would have rallied to comply with the GetTested! campaign.  Even testing 10% of the population would have provided data for a coordinated response.  Some costs upfront.  But not a total shutdown.  Total costs in both lives and economy would be way less.

Where does the buck stop nowadays?"
2020-03-29 08:31:31,"Screening can be used when the threat is on-board.  Going back further:  It has been variously reported that a test was conducted by the appropriate Federal agencies last year, summer I think, which used a fast-spreading virus originating in China (perhaps Asia, generically, not certain) as the ""incoming"" pandemic scenario.  The results showed many flaws in US preparedness.  The absence of any follow-up by this Misadministration is documented, possibly due to the gutting of the positions on the NSC set up to deal with pandemics, and which was designed by the orange man-child's hated predecessor. 

 Any leader with a quarter of an ounce of brains and integrity would have taken steps to protect those he was sworn to defend and protect.  It is clear the current oval office occupant does not meet even that minimal threshold."

Separately, Trump does not plan to abide by the law as to the transparency--reporting to Congress--as mandated in the new law regarding the $500 billion bailout.  He said as much in the signing statement.  Recall also that originally the law as proposed had no restrictions or checks to keep Trump and the Republicans from spending the funds to aid their reelection or enrich Trump and his family--we can assume that was their intent.  Congress would be foolish to appropriate the money until Trump agrees to abide by the law.  Any Court action might not be resolved until after the election."

If Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, one of the top govt. scientists advising the president on this crisis, still wonders why the country was “not able to mobilize on a broader scale” to respond to it, the answer lies in this Trumpian indifference.

When the mainstream media alerted us on the danger stemming from Trump's lack of preparedness, he lambasted at it. His favorite Fox News even characterized the reporting as a continuation of Trump's impeachment, which the House had just completed.

Trump belatedly recognized the threat, but couldn't help boasting about the efforts he started making to fight it: “It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.” If that is so, one may ask, why did he ask the president of South Korea ""to send as many test kits as possible from the 100,000 produced there daily,"" as stated in this report? 

We can bet that Trump will continue to claim, falsely, that the virus ""will disappear” fast, as long as those whose responsibility it is to give him the right advice nod approvingly when he does it. The only health official who had the guts to openly disagree with him whenever he did it is Dr. Fauci. Who knows, his days in the Trump team are numbered."
2020-03-28 23:52:34,Testing for the virus is one thing but for that month there were no directives to screen travelers returning from affected areas for TEMPERATURE.  Friends flew in from China and Hong Kong and walked straight thru customs. No questions asked. Why????

This is not realistic. Whose budget would have it DoD, NiH, Homeland Security?  Also, the complete health system is not wired for largest pandemic since 1918. How come Europe has 45% the cases & 67% of the deaths, they have the world's best public health system and where is their magical planning. They have let each country burn down. This is the most difficult thing the world is trying to manage since World War 2. Please read complex systems theory.  
The only place that has had any success is China and we A) don't know their real numbers. b) they waited a month to let the world know what was happening c) they still never shared the DNA/RNA data of their viral strains c) they are authoritarian state d) they already managed a SARS outbreak in 2002. 
The idea we can nationalize the supply chain is not realistic. We have a real time supply chain that is not nationally integrated. Our medical supply chain is regional, built around the regional demand. The production is global so using the DPA is not going to help that. 
The best we can do is have 2 tracks of testings a) scaling existing testing from 115k a day today, to 350k tests a day by April 15 b) get new tech example Abbott quick test system 650k a day so we get to 1 million tests a day by end of April we can have 100 million tests by end of July"

Often indifference to reality stems from a simple cause: conflict of interest. Rife, it can be said, in the Trump Administration. In the GOP.

What is critical to understand is Trump is STILL DOING THIS NOW. This wasn't an early failure that is being corrected, as it would be in a competent administration. No, this president is weaponizing critical life-saving medical care and supplies in the face of national pandemic. He cares about one thing: his reelection. He literally cares not one BIT about the lives of the people in ""blue states"" from which he is withholding supplies.

It would be nice if our Democratic leaders in Congress could do something, anything, to ensure that the president stop trying to murder us."
2020-03-29 14:54:21,"Dear America,

Remember the expression President Harry Truman had put on a desk sign?  If not, look it up on the InterWebs.  It applies to our inept President Trump.

""The Buck Stops Here""

It means a POTUS (or any leader) takes responsibility for choosing subordinates to carry our her or his delegated actions.  Responsibility.  Full stop.  Let that sink in.

Now recall DJT's March 13th response to a reporter asking if he felt he should bear responsibility for a delayed federal response to the pandemic.

""No, I don't take responsibility.""  

WORST president ever by any metric.  Trump does whatever he thinks is best for Trump always.  He does not have the capacity for empathy.  He regularly throws his own subordinates ""under the bus"", another expression seemingly written for Donald J. Trump. It's doubtful Trump could even spell altruism and certainly doesn't understand the definition of the word. 

VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO

signed,
a growing majority of We The People

P. S. - Make America Smart Again.  

We all can and must unseat Trump and Congressional Republicans in November.  Americans can AND WILL take back American government sadly damaged by DJT and his complicit Senate/House Republican sycophants."
2020-03-29 14:56:59,"Indeed, by now we know exhaustively well, that the expert civil servants who used to be responsible for our federal government have been replaced by incompetent political hacks and lobbyists. Will people who elect presidents and senators learn from this experiences? Apparently, no. The outlook for the moment continues to be dismal."
2020-03-29 14:17:25,"S Korea started to manufacture 100,000 kits per day much earlier than it hit them hard, and distributed the kits everywhere. They quickly erected multiple drive-thru test centers. Anyone who was suspected to be exposed was tested. The results were available within 1 hour. This enabled them to quickly detect infected individuals, trace all of their contacts, and test all of the contacts as well. Then they isolated all infected individuals. They didn't even have to shut down cities and companies or shut down their economy! Just quarantining infected individuals. 

Now compare it to what we did:

We didn't and still don't have enough number of test kits. Healthcare workers who get exposed are sent home for self-quarantine without being tested, because there are not enough test kits. This is losing workforce. Our test results take about 7 days to come back. Hence losing workforce for 7 days even if they are tested. This delay in the results also means we lose time in tracking the infected individuals and their contacts. Hence exponential spread of disease. 
If we were smart, we would invest a fraction of the 2 trillion in manufacturing massive number of test kits early on, and started testing every suspected case with taxpayer money. Would have saved billions if not trillions of taxpayer money now that we're paying for the stimulus package."

Bureaucracies grown to protect themselves. That is exactly what happened here.

Trump uses the word ""Deep State' which sounds insidious. The reality is massive incompetence has been exposed in more places than just our intelligence community.

The Trump voters were right when the rejected the status quo. Rejected sending jobs and our supply chain to China. Rejected that ruling elite than just bailed out big business again and dithered over things like $25 million for their favorite concert hall.

Trump isn't the cure but his election was the first embodiment of the malady in this country.

This is painfully obvious with every one of the bumbling presidential briefings, replete with lies and inaccuracies."

Second mistake was waiting for the WHO to officially declare this a pandemic before serious action was taken. The Who has been way behind the curve from day 1( I have my own theories on why they were so reluctant to call this a pandemic).
Third mistake was our stable genius of a president ( there’s to much to say here so I’ll just leave it at that).
All in all we’ve been lied to, and  our leaders and international bodies are either corrupt or  incompetent. I hope the nation will count the dead after this is all said and done and see that there’s Republicans, Democrats , rich , poor, black and white among then. We need to close ranks and re-evaluate the policies and procedures that led us to this place. I wish I could say it’s all Trump fault , but the fact that we can’t readily manufacture mask, gowns and ventilators In this country started way before he was elected."
2020-03-29 14:40:48,"Indeed, testing should have been a top priority from the very beginning. Then those whose tests proved negative could ride out this plague by simply staying in designated safe areas, whether it be their respective homes or apartment or some larger facility. 

The real shame here is that we are stuck with Trump during this hellish nightmarish event. Hopefully, we'll get this epidemic under control. But there remains the absolute necessity of separating the healthy from the sick. Only then will we ultimately prevail over this horrible nightmare that is threatening our lives and way of life."

We just do not take things seriously enough until and only until the enormity of the event forces itself upon us. The fact that we see the impending drama unfolding in front of our eyes does not help reinforce our response. Look at 9/11, look at Korea and Viet Nam et al, it was well understood by the people who needed to know what was coming down the pike. But our heads remained in the sand.

Also, both China’s and our political leaders were and are more interested in political face-saving than actually protecting their populace.  Trump’s puppet government has been highly ineffectual on all fronts except profit-taking and ordering expensive furniture.  How could anyone expect anything different?

If ventilators were necessary for health emergencies and our emergency stockpile needed them, that need should have over ridden private companies’ profits.  Even if one company bought out another, a contract with the Federal government to produce needed equipment should have been enforced.  Did the government officials just shrug their shoulders and walk away when contracted companies were bought out?  Too complicated, too many feathers to ruffle to enforce contractual agreements although millions of dollars had been disbursed?

Regarding masks, I have not believed for one second they are not necessary.  I do believe health officials lied because it was easier than pressing private industry into making them in sufficient quantities.  Plus, they would be a highly visual symbol of the power of a virus over our ego-driven President and cabinet of sycophants and their inability to act responsibly to an emergency."

Trump engaged in willful ignorance of events and conditions that would predictably lead to people dying as a result.  In the criminal justice system, this is the very definition of Manslaughter.  We have all heard and read AG Bill Barr's opinions spun out to claim that this sitting president can't be criminally investigated, let alone charged for his conduct while in office.  We have heard and seen Trump's legal team - including  washed up legal hack Alan Dershowitz - opine and insist that anything that Trump choses to do as part of his efforts to be reelected can't be even considered a crime.  

Hopefully, the next AG will revert to traditional understandings of the criminal justice system.  File those charges (Manslaughter and Murder have a slightly longer statute of limitations that Grand Larceny and Fraud), include as co-conspirators everyone of the enablers surrounding Trump, including those on his legal team and Bill Barr who were willing to cover this up.  Oh, and BTW, separate charges can be filed by state AG's for deaths occurring state by state.

Time to actually force responsibility on Trump and his enablers, even though he is incapable of accepting it on his own."

But then again, Azar and other bureaucrats that fumbled the ball were appointed by Trump and are continually threatened to lose their jobs if the message doesn't fit with the his perception of the world. This story is reminiscent of the Bush Presidency's attack on Iraq, based on false information and still disrupts much of the middle east."

It just puzzles me why he did not / could not, even a month ago,  pivot and say, on social media, hey everybody!  We've got this problem, and we all can work together and beat it by doing this, this and this.  Maybe the economy would not have been completely shut down, like Sweden and Germany.

She evades all questions and hides behind her position that data is insufficient to make any conclusions, rather than being an advocate for widespread testing, much less the timely delivery of equipment to treat the virus. 

What is unsaid, but probably at the center of the failure to test in early February or even early March is Trump's dismissal of the virus threat. That is probably why he has deemed deliberations as confidential. When the truth comes out I suspect that we will learn that Trump was the reason we did not actually test thousands of people in February to acknowledge the severity of the virus. He did not want the ""numbers"" to be known. Sounds vey cynical, but what else can I conclude from Trump who has not expressed the humanity that would have allowed him to grasp the seriousness of the pandemic. That he still has supporters attacking scientists and doctors without denouncing them is every thing that we have to know about Trump.

Individuals claimed this was like the flu or a bad cold because of what they heard on Fox until large numbers began to at least make them question safety.    Social media has attempted to curate some of the comments but still propagate distribution of incomplete, distorted information.

An uncharacteristically imprecise statement from Dr. Fauci. A more precise response would have called out a failing of the CDC. Their epic failure make a widely available, ACCURATE test in timely fashion is well documented in this article. Worse yet, they prevented state and local agencies from administering their own tests.

That problem appears to have been solved but postulating that successful early testing would have made a difference in the virus spread is likely no more accurate than the early projections of 2 million plus deaths in the US. Anyone who has been to a grocery store (a.k.a petri dishes) in the last month has likely been exposed. The horse so to speak, long ago left the barn. What accurate testing will do is provide the metrics needed to determine those vulnerable to it as well as its lethality. Hopefully both will be less than our worst fears."

The CDC director should be sharing the podium every day with Tony Fauci, giving the public much needed facts in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 - as opposed to a President who spews misinformation in hopes of helping his political future.

With testing being that difficult, it’s no wonder cases are increasing everyday."
2020-03-29 14:24:04,"One lesson to be learned from all this is that lack of preparation kills. From the number of lifeboats on the Titanic to the number of hospital beds in Manhattan it is a mistake to assume that the worst case scenario will never happen and « Just In Time «  inventory will cover all contingencies. 

We must make changes in how we manage our businesses, our governments and our lives.

« Murphy’s Law » is real. While we have sadly messed up the response to a pandemic we should have been more prepared for, we should be resolved to make sure that this does not happen again no matter who is in charge. Prepare for the worst, hope for the best, bite the bullet, buy a new horse and lock the barn door before next time happens."

2020-03-29 15:37:34,"In the U.S., the CDC projects about 43,000 deaths from influenza this season.  That's a rate of 131 deaths per million people.  The current deaths for COVID-19 per million in Italy is 16, Spain is also 16 per million and the U.S. is less than 1 per million.  And, we don't even test for influenza unless hospitalized.  If we could test everyone at the exact same time, we could isolate the virus.  But, we can't.  If we test people that have been exposed or those with symptoms, it's too late.  They've already already exposed others.  The article says, ""aggressive screening might have helped..."".  Might, but probably not.  Just as effective is to self-isolate if you've been exposed to someone who is known to have the virus or if you feel any symptoms.  If you're tested positive, you'll be told to do that anyway.  But, from less than 1 per million for this virus we have a long way to go to get anywhere near the severity of influenza at 131 per million."

AFAIK the United States is far, far away from getting control of the situation both in reducing the number of new cases and in treating existing cases; there will be plenty of time to find fault (and there is a lot of fault to go around) once the virus is contained and people aren't dying.
The FACT that so little testing is still being done in this country is an absolute tragedy. Unless/until we understand where/who folks are carrying/transmitting the virus the situation will simply get worse and worse. We should be testing hundreds of thousands daily and not just those who turn up at the ER."

Now of course the finger pointing starts, play the tape of Governors and Mayors, not just the federal government."

Over my lifetime America experienced its apex with the successful moon landing and numerous medical and scientific and technological post-war breakthroughs.

But it's been downhill for the last several decades.  We are no longer a country able to address and solve problems: gun violence, under-employment, prescription drug abuse, homelessness, under-insurance or no insurance, a ripped and torn safety net, poor health outcomes, massive inequality and all the rest.

Instead of bragging about how we are not--the greatest--why not be honest about what we really are: a system just muddling along and undershooting our ideals by a whopping and heartbreaking record shortfalling toll."
2020-03-29 16:08:38,"This piece is a comprehensive list of factors contributing to our lack of awareness.

I could add one more: the myth of American Exceptionalism. Some politician (was it the governor of Mississippi) said We're not China. He could have added ""or Italy,"" which was in the throes of their apex at the time that statement was made. What was he thinking. Is our biology different or our government so much wiser. Could he not see we have a shared humanity?

On a personal level, I will hold in abeyance my nearly life long praise of the CDC. It was our premier institute for public health data and research; as an MD with a MPH in Epidemiology, the CDC was my mecca. Whatever the cause of its current weakness (was it the drying up of funding?), a strong, national public health institution would have been a tremendous asset in the disaster unfolding before us.

As highly respected as he is, Dr. Fauci seems a solitary voice of medical expertise on the federal scene and he does not carry the weight of the CDC behind him. I wonder if his task should be only to re-interpret and make more acceptable the words of his boss, standing over him. That, actually, is not leadership; it is babysitting."

2020-03-29 02:04:29,"We need to stop pointing fingers during the COVID-19 pandemic immediately. The answer is simple. It starts at the very top. No test is necessary as to whose ultimate responsibility it was to take preventative measures to mitigate the yet to be determined spread of the virus and the overall loss of life. They are way in over their head for this type of scenario. COVID-19 certainly is not an impeachment trial that they can claim as a witch hunt, deflect, deny, and be acquitted from. Settled.

There is no doubt the United States of America has some of the most talented doctors, researchers, and scientists in infectious diseases and deadly pathogens at the CDC, other Federal Agencies, Health Care Systems, and private companies in the world. The expertise and knowledge they have in this area should always be taken seriously at White House meetings. The vital official positions throughout the world, never left empty. Yet, that is exactly what occurred well before the outbreak. Having no one at the top who cares fully enough to understand the complexities of deadly pandemics, the terrifying catastrophes they can unleash upon society-this group of dedicated and talented individuals often face massive hurdles at the onset of an outbreak. Hurdles that exponentially increase, due to an absent stable genius at the top.

This pandemic is extremely serious. The distancing guidelines put in place by the CDC and WHO are a doctor's note that everyone should use. Please be safe, and take care!"

Obama’s National Security Counsel briefed Trump, about the task force it had created to specifically investigate and PREPARE for exactly THIS situation!

It’s appalling failure in judgement that makes the so called “third world” countries come across as superb. The only person, in this story, who comes across as a reasonable and thoughtful leader is Dr. Fauci. What strikes me as odd is the FDA and the CDC insistence on holding endless and useless meetings on whether or not to approve private sector testing kits whilst on the other hand, South Korea, basically gave its private sector matching orders to produce testing kits. Yeah, I know, FDA is concerned about safety issues but how’s that going with the failed testing kits from the CDC. As the WHO official quoted in this story lamented, the CDC used to be a global paragon of excellence. The CVID19 has pulled the veil on its current failed top leadership.

So at least a month was wasted during which time Trump dismissed the true threat that the virus posed even as the virus infected people in every State of the Union. By the time Trump was willing to publicly acknowledge the serious threat, it was too late to implement a preventative strategy except for comprehensive national quarantine and shelter in place. We still have limited means to identify who is infected or recovered from the virus.  The blame for the current national paralysis of our society and economy can be placed at Trump’s feet. Trump’s narcissistic greed, malevolent character, and incompetence turned a manageable epidemic into a full fledged American pandemic with a worst case scenario that millions will die."

Trump didn't want testing so he could hide the extent of the disease and his incompetence. While at the same time trumpeting his ""never been seen before response and efforts to contain it.""
Our officials, including healthcare, etc. are afraid of Trump so didn't stand up and push him to the side and protect our nation.

It’s pathetic that we couldn’t do what South Korea and Norway and Singapore did. Tell someone to stay inside during a pandemic, and risk getting sued by that person.

You can argue with solid evidence till the cows come home, of his repeated failure as POTUS,  but it will all be in vain. 

His base suffers from a strong “motivated reasoning”. It is the ""tendency to find arguments in favor of conclusions we want to believe to be stronger than arguments for conclusions we do not want to believe"". It can lead to forming and clinging to false beliefs despite substantial evidence to the contrary. The desired outcome acts as a filter that affects evaluation of scientific evidence and of other people”. 

Recall his triumphant tweet from Warsaw “THE WEST WILL NEVER BE BROKEN. Our values will PREVAIL. Our people will THRIVE and our civilization will TRIUMPH! Evidently he has self-appointed himself the status as defender of the West.

Americans are not used to blindly following government orders and cherish their freedoms more than people in many other countries.  So they are less likely to self isolate just because the government tells them to. 

However, that is precisely why, had we had much more testing early on, a lot more Americans would have realized that they had Coronavirus and all Americans would have self isolated much earlier than they did."

I also have to wonder about the regulations that were put in place long before the detection of CV. While certain regulation is a necessity to protect a society against tainted foods, medicine, even regulation to keep the wealthy, wealthy, when crisis like this arrive, common sense would dictate that regulation needs to be set aside to combat the crisis. It appears that so much rule and regulation was at the core of this response to this pandemic. 

I tend to believe that we as Americans are also part of the issue. A litigious society as much as ours is was a cause for so much regulation. One has to wonder what will be the repercussions of this pandemic once it becomes controlled. Lawyers will be busy practicing law which is good. Better they practice law than what they are doing now which is practicing medicine. I mean come on! A lawyer as head of HHS? Only the best sycophants for this administration."

The presidents job is to assemble a high level team to guide the civil service in this process; a high level team that can competently assess emerging issues and marshall appropriate action.

How on earth can that be done with this President? The world learned very early on that President Trump didn't like his prepared morning briefings and in fact preferred Fox & Friends!

A few days ago Trump stated that the Spanish Flu killed 1 of every 2 who were infected. Not so. While statistics on the Spanish Flu aren't that reliable, it seems clear that the Spanish Flu and Covid 19 have similar mortality rates.

Americas biggest challenge for this pandemic is that of inducing Trump to use the powers of the presidency in ways that will reduce the death toll. 

That's hard to do when Trump is who he is, and his inner circle consists of sycophants. The public needs to step up."

He managed to settle the civil part for $25M, and somehow got out of the criminal part at the same time. When will we admit, whether democrat or republican, that this man was unfit to be president from the day he descended the escalator at Trump Tower? 
Trump is incompetent, irrational and makes schoolboy slurs against anyone who opposes or disagrees with him. It's a calamity that this great country could not have forced him to produce his tax returns, which may have shown his Russian connections that helped him to win the election. Lacking leadership, he bends to authoritative leaders with dictatorial powers.
Trump's incompetence caused him to seek out incompetent people to surround him and admire him. I will bet that his motive for not attacking this virus early was his fear that the stock market would fall, and that he would no longer claim the illusion that his presidency brought the market to its heights. He relies on perception to Trump reality -- no pun intended."

However, instead of pointing fingers at individuals it is time for Americans to look themselves in the mirror and recognize that this is our country, this is who we are and we are all responsible for this mess.  Americans elected Trump and far too many (unimaginably) continue to worship at his altar.  
To this day, far too many people, and not just Trump supporters, have proven unable to shelter in place and socially isolate, and insist on exposing themselves and others to transmission and infection. this society is incapable of adhering to this most basic requirement to control our destiny.

This administration is keeping infection numbers artificially low by directing states and doctors to not test. Instead of slowing the spread and saving American lives, it's more important to keep moneyed interests happy about how rich they are. They told us sacrificing our vulnerable loved ones is better than the rich being slightly less rich. Dragging their feet at every step not to spook the market and hurt approval ratings. It's so bad that Governor Jay Inslee turned his back on the feds and acted independently to prevent their greed from killing his people. Mild cases are just as infectious as the severe cases, but without a clear positive the mild and asymptomatic are less likely to alter their behavior to avoid infecting others. Their friends and family are less likely to alter their behavior to prevent infection. My employer wouldn't give me a break because I hadn't been tested (I stayed home anyway). My 60 year old mom didn't believe me when I told her to stay away, she let herself in. She's sick now. The US pandemic just started and thousands are dead. There will be many thousands more.

   When brushing your teeth’s an activity,
Homebound you clean up and tidy the den
    Outside concerns lie outside your ken;
Best case – the savings - for homebound beginners
    Putting away what you spent on dinners;

As the Corona virus began its rapid spread through Italy and Iran in late February and I realized from the reporting then that testing in the US was woefully inadequate, I postponed a second trip. I live in Milwaukee County. We had a couple of confirmed cases in early March today it is nearly 500. The Milwaukee and Wisconsin Public health departments are still saying I should not seek testing unless I have symptoms. Some epidemiologists suggest that the virus may be spread by asymptomatic carriers. We won't know without greater testing ability.

Just another newsy item, front page, yes, but CHINA's problem.  Information from that quarter has never been honest, accurate, or forthcoming.  IF the epidemic had originated in the EU, the US, and the free world, would have had as honest jump-start. 

Maybe Trump could have acted sooner -- and the CDC and FDA.  But they did not.  (And maybe Obama got lucky with the Ebola contagion -- it certainly hasn't achieved world domination like Covid19.)  

This is a well-written and informative piece, the bedrock for dozens of books that will be available by year's end.  But it's time to look to the near-future, the world beyond when Covid19 is finally under control or eradicated via vaccination and prepare, on a national (military) scale for the next epidemic.  We need warehouses of pandemic equipment -- this epidemic is being studied by fledgling terrorists around the world as I write.  Why attempt a ""dirty bomb"" when the skillful capture of an obscure pathogen will wreak world-wide carnage over that of locality?

We won that war because of her tireless efforts and the leadership and wisdom of her husband.

Compare that American history to the present where our president decides which states get ventilators based on whether their governors were “nice to him” and “showed their appreciation”. 

Compare Roosevelt’s generous Lend Lease program to Trump whose threatened to ignore recent legislation and dole out the $500 billion allocated to fight corona to whoever he chooses with no oversight.

My home state of Louisiana is being decimated by corona but all we get out of Trump is nonsense and campaign rhetoric. Where are the Americans who won WW II?

The Company has developed a biosensor that has the potential to be used at airports, hospitals, and other places where rapid onsite screening for the Covid 19 is desired. The Company’s test is rapid, easy to use, and can give a result in minutes instead of hours. This technology is based upon the unique properties of piezoelectric ceramics.T his material vibrates when electrified and produces a weak electric signal when stressed.When the coronavirus, binds to the surface it generates a weak electric signal that a handheld reader can pick up and alert the user. This simple reaction gives the test a very high degree of certainty that it’s detection (or lack thereof) of the target virus is accurate.TBT has successfully deployed this technology in a laboratory environment against other pathogens and is currently seeking federal assistance to validate its technology against the COVID-19 virus. Rapidly understanding who has COVID-19, and quickly isolating those people who test positive is key to ensuring that it is not passed to others. A fast test means that more people can be tested with the least amount of disruption to their lives and, if positive, the more quickly they can be isolated to reduce the risk of interactions with non-infected people, to slow the spread of the virus.

It is the group that would have created communications for state departments of health; for medical practices and hospitals. 

It is the group that would have sent out directives for early community spread including highlighting, counting and monitoring respiratory illnesses,even untested. 

It would have supervised the roll out of testing, and determined alternative paths when tests did not meet the schedule.

It would have coordinated the whole response, rapidly, because a coordinated plan would have already been in place, ready to be modified and updated to suit the situation.

This was a failure of Trump. This was a failure of GOP philosophy in which **only** tax breaks and federal courts have precedence. This was a failure of Reaganite conservatism, Grover whathisname's bathtub and the Tea Party ideology, and a failure of everyone out there who voted on a single issue like guns or abortion and dismissed the damage that incompetence will bring to reality.

2020-03-29 13:40:05,"We elected a fox. Ensconced him in the henhouse. But henhouse health wasn’t his jam. Not one bit. Only looking foxy mattered. Any hen that didn’t produce golden eggs—gone. Specialized hen teams—gone. The established ways of the hens, developed over centuries—gone. Really hens were just props. Over time, the henhouse stopped functioning like a henhouse and fell into a shammy state. A sleep state. Only the roosters who crowed with gusto about the fox’s greatness remained. 

One day, about three months ago, in a faraway land (a rival henhouse)—a huge natural disease struck. While hens of the world had seen diseases before, this one was new. Big. Scary. The fox secretly smiled. It made a competing fox’s numbers look bad. And all was “beautiful” said the fox. In fact the fox was gleeful. He got more and more time in front of the national mirror. Mirror, mirror on the wall—who’s the most beautiful of them all? “You,” said the only remaining hens and roosters. You. You. You they crowed dozens of times. 

The fox smiled. Yes, he noticed a few hens were dying. But that paled in comparison to This Great Moment of reality TV.

The sky is falling, said one hen. And she was correct. She was banished. 

Across the land roosters, hens, chicks and eggs were dying. 

Small henhouses thrummed day and night to save the hens. Efforts of remarkable proportion and selfless love.

The fox huffed and puffed and tried to blow the henhouse down.

But the house was made of Love."

No, they continued to ""see no evil, hear no evil"" until March.

Feb 25: “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus. I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.” 
Feb 26: “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.” 
Feb 27: “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” 
Feb 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this.  But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.” 
Mar 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it ... Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

There is a simple maxim:  ""Ask a person to do something they do not know how to do, they will do something that they do know how to do"".  

What Trump knows how to do, and it's about the only thing he knows how to do, is get into nasty verbal fights, name calling, insulting, smearing, etc.  That is what he is best at.  So he tries to turn every problem in a verbal spat between him and anybody else that he can insult and tear down.  He is utterly destructive in his behavior and does not have a clue  how to do anything productive and constructive, so he tries to get off the subject of his Covid19 failures and onto  a conversation of fighting and squabbling with others.

Why in particular would Obama allow consolidation within the medical field, inimical to reduced costs in healthcare, a primary focus of his administration? Why would Obama allow hospital systems to also consoldiate as highlighted too in the article? There was eight years for Obama to get this done and he didn't.

For all the social distancing, people stick together.  A woman leaves the store, shucking off blue nitrile gloves.  

""That's it.  They're out of eggs.""

Three people leave the line.  

A man in calls out, ""Cash only.  Card readers are down.  Whole city.""

This news is confirmed by the manger outside.  Two people leave.  A woman becomes angry and distraught.  She starts yelling at the manager.  The policeman steps in. He seems compassionate as he tells her the store has two ATMs.  She leaves the line anyway.  No cash?

Inside the store, it feels creepy.  Where 80-100 people might be shopping, only 30 at a time.  A woman sneezes.

I think that will be the memory I will always carry from this pandemic.  People stop and stare.  The look on her face is...  Embarrassment?  Fear?  Terror?  Where can she get tested?  Where can any of us get tested?

REGULATORY HURDLES (eg Trump’s fake Obama regulation excuse) 

Bogus anyway; initial EUA approval could have been wiped away much earlier than 2/29/20 if the Trump Administration had heeded outside advice sooner. 

IMPEACHMENT DISTRACTION (another Trump argument) 

Never mind the unexplained claim that Azar somehow was utterly powerless to rein in under him that weren’t interested in taking action...what’s the evidence for that assertion and if true, there would have to be specific reasons for that, wouldn’t there?"
2020-03-29 05:56:16,This article should mention the Seattle Flue Project debacle: a pre-existing project to survey for regular flu was blocked from testing for COVID-19.

One President Trump declared Covid-19 a Democratic Hoax any chance of testing (and publicly proving that he lied) was totally gone.

Will we ever return to a world where there is truth based on facts, where good triumphs over evil and where light dispels darkness, where Americans don't hate and threaten fellow Americans, where we work together for the common good and we look for morality, compassion, integrity and honesty in our leadership and in the news."
2020-03-29 16:46:45,It’s odd to me that the Times can cover this facet of the topic with such clarity while completely missing accurate coverage on the numerous NGOs and businesses that are trying to bring testing to market in spite of the government’s failure to coordinate. The slant on your home testing coverage that it is simply a “for profit” play or “not accurate” is too reductive. This article clearly articulates that the administration and each of our federal agencies responsible for coordinating testing have been completely negligent on this topic. So negligent they can’t provide accurate guidance to the NGOs and companies seeking to bolster access to testing.
2020-03-29 06:12:24,"The lost month? It's more like the lost presidency. After three years, the dysfunction, chaos and egregiously idiotic choices made by Trump and his handlers to ignore scientific evidence and even the most minimal reliance on rational thought, it was inevitable that a disaster was on the horizon. The only thing we didn't know was when it would happen and what it would be. It is now clear, it would be an epic pandemic that would wreck havoc, fear, and in many instances, misery on our citizenry and expose every neglected, ineptly run and hollowed out government agency and institution under attack since the beginning of this administration, by its own leaders.

The authors lay it all out for us. How and why it happened. There was the willful ignorance that characterized the pack of lies the president told the nation every minute, every hour he stood before us to shape his false narrative that all was under control, that the virus would ""disappear"" or it was a Democratic ""hoax""  when in reality,  nothing was being done because no one knew what to do.

The government had ceased to function when crisis struck. It is run by a bunch of amateurs who were shockingly uninformed and unqualified and whose only credential was blind allegiance to a president who is totally clueless about the most basic functions of the federal government. To say that he alone is responsible for this complete and total dereliction of duty is understatement."
2020-03-29 09:40:24,"Testing was vital because Americans look at the actual cases identified and make decisions from that. We are also personally fallible, feeling safety in observation: you don't serm sick, you must be OK.

Perhaps the biggest fault was hubris. Thinking we are the smartest nation on earth, we failed to learn immediately what China and South Korea already knew from painful experience. The pandeic team was disbanded. Second best is not wotking.

As we now understand this virus, with a lack of symptoms for many days, we have no clue who the carriers are. Our only defense is compliance with distancing. We fail to remind Americans up to 10 times the numbers of known infections are out there undetected. Our biggest defense now is judgment, both official and personal. And empathy where it exists.

The sad truth is disease doesn't kill the shortsighted and stupid. It kills the vulnerable. It's the shortsighted and stupid that are the delivery system. And in our case, that started at the top, propelled by a party that saw government and expertise as too expensive. To the point that we no longer appoint the best people, but those connected who echo what the disdainful want to hear. An institutional failure that can now be measured in lost lives and the prospect that we cannot even see what incompetence has unleashed that will inevitably still play out. Unarticulated by a madman who cares more for self-directed platitudes than swift, knowledgd based action with the right tools."
2020-03-29 13:18:35,WHspokesperson Judd Deere’s statement that it is “false” to suggest that President Trump did not take Covid-19 seriously early on makes clear that the administration is deeply infected by the cult-like devotion to an alternate reality created by Trump’s ceaseless lying.

a) In May 2018, Trump‘s White House disbanded the NSC team for leading U.S. response against a pandemic.

b) During White House press briefings in March, as well as many times since January, Trump not only caused total confusion, but issued to the public many false statements. That all may—and will—cost some Americans their lives.

If the same was done by some foreign leader (Putin, Orban...), that would be construed as an attack on democracy and welfare of citizens.

He did not see the importance to test, or he did not care about the future. His failure was criminal. The deaths are on his watch. He was told, but he blames the bearers of bad news and wants the news hidden. Our great leader, with the head in the sand. Some genius."
2020-03-29 16:50:29,"A fish stinks from its coiffed head.  President a Trump discouraged testing in the USA because he didn’t want to reveal “numbers” that might affect the financial markets and thus one of the cornerstones of his re-election bid, itself a plan to evade being brought to task for his many crimes both high and low.

2020-03-29 17:01:42,"We need both types of tests: 1. The nasal swabs to see who is currently infected. 2. The antigen blood-based tests to see who has immunity. Those that are negative on the first but positive on the second should be able to work and keep society moving forward. While there is some risk that the presence of the antigens does not guarantee immunity, it identifies people whose immune systems successfully fought off the virus. Put them back to work now, focusing on health and food supply chains.

We live in such a data driven society, and the data from these tests will drive our recovery, both economic and health-wise, moving forward. The fact that we didn't have this data soon is just that, a fact. We need to focus on how we best move forward from the present moment. We must include knowledge of past mistakes as we decide so that we don't repeat those mistakes. To err is human; to not learn from our errors is unconscionable. One mistake I hope we learn soon is that our President is not fit for the job of moving us forward from here. He is ""perfect"", which means he is incapable of learning.

I wish to God we had a Parliamentary system now that allowed for a vote of no confidence. Being unfit for office is not a high crime or misdemeanor, so impeachment won't work. But, the 25th Amendment is our only option to move quickly to put somebody in charge. Unfortunately, he is surrounded by sycophants. That's not going to happen. What to do until January 20???

Trump who has the power to print money has told state Governors to deal with the problem.  Governors do not have the funds to buy the equipment needed for our brave front line health care workers.  They are soldiers sent into battle without rifles.

Ok President Trump we in the states will handle the issue. Give States the authority to issue municipal bonds which bear the full faith and crediit  of the US Government.  If states default on these general obligation bonds  the US Government will provide the backing.
These  secured municipal bonds   would be quasi treasury securities bearing a very low interest rate since they are tax exempt.  Wall street could quickly issue the securities for public distribution and the Fed could move in to buy any securities which have not been purchased to support the market.

Demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of an authoritarian regime (or as some claim a totalitarian one) and a democracy/republic. It will take years or decades to get a final assessment of the fallout.

In the People's Republic of China, fear of being the messenger who brings bad news resulted in the provincial authorities covering up the emerging viral threat. At least one ministry in Beijing contributed to the cover up. 
Once it became a pandemic though, Beijing stepped up to the plate and mobilized its resources to contain and suppress it. They've also mobilized industry to produce what they need and have turned China into a literal fortress to prevent a new wave of infections from overseas.

Here in the United States, the failure was due to inflexible regulations, overconfidence in our abilities, and a White House that for various reasons refused to do what was necessary in the first two months. Now we have a disease that has spread from coast to coast, border to border, and city to the countryside.

It makes sense to minimize the introduction of new personnel to uninfected ships, as any infection would be shared.  Seafarers absolutely understand this.

That said, orderly arrangements for repatriation and  safe crew changes must be made.  It remains the ship manager's obligation to observe the labor contracts agreed, the terms as mandated by national and international laws.  Bad actors are out there, and they will take advantage of the situation.  But the industry has worked quite hard to weed them out through procedures, laws and regulations that are enforced globally.

As soon as quarantine and travel bans are lifted that will allow the landing, transport and repatriation of seafarers, the crew changes will continue with all dispatch.  Everyone wants to be with and protect our families in time of danger.

New crew members could wait up to 14 days in the Sailors' House, too, to ensure they are virus-free before going aboard a new ship. 

Seems like there would be a way to have a safe compromise if the companies had a will to find it.

Yes this is a tricky situation but continuing to operate with worn-out crews can have serious consequences. There is a direct correlation between fatigue and increased possibility of an accident￼. Groundings, spills, collisions￼, equipment damage, injuries, etc...it is a long list. Governments and maritime authorities need to step in and allow for reliefs of crew members that are due off. Shipping companies need to bear the additional costs￼. Failure to do so could ultimately be far more costly."

The German research vessel Sonne, with an international consortium of scientists (including at least three US citizens), has abandoned her research objectives in the southern Indian Ocean and is presently steaming to her domicile. However, repatriating the US contingent has proved exceedingly difficult as no nations will allow disembarkation even though the ship is clean and has been out to sea for over three weeks. The State Department needs to step up and get these folks home. And yes, I have a vested interest-- I was supposed to be on that ship!"

There is no conscription in the US for any armed military service, of which the US maritime industry is not an armed military service. Individuals that choose to go to sea for a living is voluntary not required. That being said, an abundance of merchant mariners lost their lives during WWII. They too were there voluntarily. However, some individuals that took to the high seas were not the best citizens and were given a choice; go to sea or go to jail! There are work hour/rest period requirements on vessels. Is there slave labor, yes. And that's a story for another time as I'm out of space."

So let them off. However, how will they be replaced? That, it seems to me, is the problem. Even if replacements can be flown to where the ship is (may be difficult due to travel restrcitions), there is then the possibility someone may take the virus on board. Then we have an even worse problem for the rest of the crew. Maybe the best solution is to give them a big bonus when it's all over."

However, if they were to be repatriated, and a new crew come to replace them, you then run into the global travel nightmare.  None of these ships are starting, or returning to the crews home port in all likelyhood, so they cant bank on the ship sailing back home for them to get off.   

These are wildly unusual times, but they are better off staying on board, and lengthening their scheduled work period by a few extra months until we get to the other side.  As the article noted - they are getting paid.

My far greater fear is that cargo ships start getting turned away, cruiseship style, from ports, and then global commerce rapidly grinds to a halt completely, adding to all the other economic complications we already have."

2020-03-25 19:21:37,"I was a mariner for 40 years, all of it on US flag ships, and retired in 2009.  I follow the Facebook group of my former shipmates.  This shutdown is one thing for those confined to their own homes but it is causing enormous stress and anxiety for mariners whose ""stay at home"" involves being separated from their families.  My experience is that mariners mentally and emotionally prepare themselves to be away for a certain period of time.  Going much beyond that drives many mariners into exhaustion, and I have seen complete shipmates suffer greatly.

I see a strong parallel between the plight of mariners today and our desperate shortage of medical equipment.  Both are caused by the demand of consumers for the cheapest possible product.  When I started sailing in 1969, the crew joined the ship in a US port, made a voyage of 2 or 3 or 4 months, and was discharged upon returning to a US port.  Those were The Articles*.

So I found this line in the article somewhat quaint:  ""Mr. Coles has been outspoken in his calls for governments to do more to protect their workers.""  Which government, Mr. Coles?  The government of a ship is the nation whose flag it sails under.  When that flag is a flag of convenience, the ship may never touch a port of the nation whose flag it flies.  Flagging ships is a business, and business has been very good the past 50 years.

They were not concerned about what would happen when they reached their port; they genuinely feared that they might not even reach that port at all. And in a North Atlantic patrolled by U-boats that fear was very real. Even ships travelling along the US east coast were sunk.

They can’t fly home and remain on board carrying on working, even though their contracts have expired. As crew changes have been suspended, they are trapped on a floating prison.

We know that if we're going to tell everyone to stay home, we have to make sure everyone has a home. The pandemic lays bare how deeply and completely interconnected and intertwined we all are. The idea of not providing testing and care to another human, anywhere on the planet, for any reason, is revealed as absurd. 

Federal funding should be used to provide: direct cash assistance (grants, NOT usurious ""low interest"" loans) to individuals and small (genuinely small) businesses; affordable housing; student, home loan, and credit card forgiveness; unemployment insurance; family and medical leave; nutrition assistance; no-cost medical (physical and psychological) care; no-cost mortuary services; remote education support; and no-cost child care for families with essential workers.

I really wish that America would jolt itself into the modern, caring world, and start providing for the less well-off. America needs to introduce a universal basic income (UBI) at a good level. $2,500 to even $3,000 wouldn’t be over-the-top. That payment, of course, would be over and above Social Security insurance, because that is something that Americans have paid into and deserve anyway.

I’d rather see vital national industries nationalized and their corporate management jailed than give in to the extortion we are witnessing.  No way should our tax dollars be used to bail out the irresponsible behavior of airlines, cruise ship companies and others who got great big tax breaks and immense profits only to buy their own stock.  Some of these corporations didn’t even pay any of the taxes that they now want to tap to cover their own incompetence.

Let’s hold these corporations responsible for messing up the American economy with their own shortsighted self-interest.  Let’s ban stock buy-backs and require that some profits be held in reserve for a rainy day.

Meanwhile, I hope the Democrats hold tough. Give the relief to those who paid those tax dollars … the working stiffs of America."

Why are Pelosi, Schumer hardly discussing this method of aid when it is in fact the most effective and easiest one? I hate to break it to them, but there are people who work and don't qualify for unemployment out there who could also use the help. Given that Republicans beat them to the proposal (yes, even if 1200 dollars isn't enough it would beat 0, but I can't underscore how bizarre it is they were the ones to propose this enough), wouldn't it stand to reason the thing they would compromise on here is maybe expanding that aspect of the bill?"

In recent decades, and most spectacularly under the McConnell Trump regime, Republicans stoke racial discord to sow division, while perpetrating tax schemes which set the wealthy far above everyone else. This ill prepares us for a unified response to disruptions.

First, go big.  The earlier recovery would have been YEARS faster, and less painful, if congressional conservatives hadn’t limited Obama’s options and budget (as Krugman frequently reminds us).

Second, make sure consumers and workers, not just businesses, are protected.  The financial bailout of banks never extended to borrowers, causing needless bankruptcies and home losses.  And it further entrenched resentment against Wall Street for unilateral benefiting from a rigged system.

2020-03-24 00:16:53,"What have 1929, 2008 and now 2020 have in common?  These are the occasions in which a serious economic disruption has occurred and despite what we have been regularly told that Capitalism and market forces will ""save the day"", once again, it has failed miserably in its bogus claims, collapsed and almost immediately runs to government looking for help to ""save it from itself"".

Bernie Sanders and progressives are correct. There is a structural rot within the American economic system that needs a complete overhaul and this is just another example in which the moment disruption occurs, the entire system essentially ""seizes up"" and without government help, can barely function.

So much for the so called ""evils"" of socialism, the capitalists love it, of course, strictly for them.  I am wondering at what point Americans are finally going to say,  "" we have had it and are being conned,  enough is enough""."

Evictions for rent arrears are now illegal, banks are offering mortgage holidays, business' large + small are being offered 0% interest emergency loans, private sector salaries are being covered (mostly) to ensure jobs are protected. Even seasonal railcards on privately owned railways are being refunded. Minimum welfare payments (Universal Credit + Employment Support Allowance) have been increased by 25%, empty hotels are being used to house the street homeless and allow them to self isolate. The private sector, specifically engineering firms, have been tasked with building thousands of ventilators paid for by HM Gov. There's even talk of penalising virus profiteers, you know the ones? They bought all of the face masks and toilet rolls and eBay them?
The trust in the British public doing the right thing was misplaced, it seems we're as selfish and stupid as everyone else, but now even that is dealt with, finally.

On Friday I learned that my 49-year old nephew had been taken ill and rushed to the hospital with what apparently was the virus even though no tests were available.  Today I learned that he was in critical condition in the I.C.U. I also was informed that my 36-year old son, a physician, will soon be asked to help with the Covid-19 patients at his hospital despite the lack of protective equipment. Needless to say, I and my wife are also in shock as we, like so many, are drawn into the dark web of this plague as it engulfs our family.  It's simply traumatizing.  And as much as we are in shock, we are also angry at what appears to be what I call the ""malign neglect"" of Donald Trump who seems to care more about the economy and helping save the wealthy corporations, including his own, than helping those who are sick and those who are charged to care for them without the equipment he could so easily provide to them. The economic pain will only go away when the root problem--the pandemic virus--is properly treated and goes away.

The economic, societal and environnmental consequences of population growth are being ignored, and going back to business as usual, which of course everyone would like to do, will lead to more pandemics.

Then many of these 'generous' corporations did share buy-backs giving to their shareholders. A one-time payment, which will feel good in the very short term is not the answer.

Earlier action to contain the virus and then mitigate the spread would have saved tens of thousands of American lives.

But instead, Trump decided the virus might hurt his re-election chances and so he decided to down play the impact. 

Instead of preparing by stopping sick people from entering the country without quarantine, implementing social distancing, procuring ventilators, medications, and PPE, Trump did nothing until the middle of March.

This is a particularly nasty virus. Experts have been expecting a pandemic. Obama warned Trump about it. But instead of preparing, Trump fired all the experts.

Trump is responsible for the suffering and death of tens of thousands of Americans.

I spent about a month in self-quarantine at home literally coughing my brains out. At one point I thought I was hallucinating. I was unable to sleep or eat.  I thought I should go to the hospital, but dreaded the thought of going to the emergency room. I took the antibiotic (even though it didn't do any good) and some over the counter cough medicine.

If you can't keep down medications like Tylenol while home, you can't have a decent night's rest. 
The solution may be an OTC chewable meclizine (taken the second you have nausea before you barf) or — if barfing has begun — a prescription promethazine suppository or, a prescription scopolamine patch which may be best as it works for a few days and is not inserted in any part of your body.
These are powerful drugs and the three should NEVER be mixed, ever! But, if you have COVID19 with nausea and/or vomiting, you need to ask your doctor which of these you can or should take if you are also taking any other medication.
None of these should be long term use. Just as “rescues”."

At first, I thought it was a cold or flu, but, after 2 days, the fever didn't really break.  When I went to  the doctors 6 days after first symptom, we thought it might be viral meningitis.  3 days later, I was definitely photosensitive and began ""pneumonia"" which I never had before.  I was out of commission for 2+ weeks.

However, for years (and only in the last year have things seemed to change), I had ""horseshoe headaches"" which started in my temporal lobe above the ear, looped around the bottom of my occipital lobe, and then back up the other side.  I rarely if ever got headaches in my frontal lobe - just these horseshoe headaches.

I am not sure if my cognitive functioning has degraded because of that or because of aging ten years (I am 57 now), but that was the sickest that I have ever been and I did think I was going to die and tried to drive around to pharmacies looking for oxygen.

The inversion describes my experience of the virus so that nowadays I apperceive the virus behavior much like a clever enemy.  Is my perception of it caused by the steady aggregation of our knowledge about its morphology, it’s intentions?  I doubt that.  Often I wonder what is it about this virus that enables it to avoid our immune systems so easily?  We are nowhere near it’s end of lifecycle, and whatever else it is or does, we are not going to resume normality as it was understood last year.  We are engaged in a paradigm change in the sciences, government, and letters; it is a change that is neither true nor false.

Many people are reporting serious bouts of unusual ill health in the few months before the official outbreak here. Many report testing negative for a wide range of debilitating illnesses - mono, lyme, bacterial infection - and being diagnosed with 'not the flu, but some weird virus that will run its course.' Their symptoms, the progress of the disease, and disturbing lingering artifacts align eerily with Covid19. Perhaps there are more than two strains? Arriving/appearing on different timelines?

Viruses are innumerable. Humans have a limited number of organs/systems and a relatively limited repertoire of physiological reactions/symptoms. At this point we just don't know and it is not the time for those of us still walking, however wobbly, to ask. But I hope later sorting it out will be of interest."
2020-04-06 15:24:16,"In the context of the current corona virus pandemic, it may be of importance to revisit findings of the Spanish Flu pandemic – which cause over a million cases of Parkinson’s disease, most likely as a consequence of cytokine storm, eventually leading to brain cell death. Brain immune cells, microglia and neurons can be activated in specific ways by viral RNA, independently or in the context of an infection that causes the flu like symptoms and disease (Jang et al 2012, Deleidi and Isacson 2012). In particular, it highlights that recording evidence of excessive cytokine activations in patients in the wake of successful elimination of propagating viruses, such as coronaviruses, could be very informative for anticipating future cases of certain neurological diseases. Finding the specific cytokines that cause to post-viral systemic and local inflammation that leads to serious disease and even death may allow interventions to prevent such outcomes.

I don’t know when will the day dawn in America where there will be bare minimum or no gun violence.

Hospital beds, ventilators and other protective gear are urgently required in bulk to face the pandemic. As rightly said by the surgeon, each and every bed is precious.

Our willful blindness is killing us.  Edward R. Murrow was right to quote Cassius from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar: ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves.""

Be angry, yes, but be angry at the leader of this nation who has sent many to die.  Can't we all agree on the terribleness of the situation and ban together instead of shooting one another? Shooting each other has never been the answer and in some instances, exactly what the government wants so they can continue the systemic oppression of those they deem lesser.

But now, the crisis becomes compounded yet again.  Americans are psychologically wedded to the idea that they need lots of guns in order to protect themselves from each other.  Americans are clearly their own worst enemies.  

And now, as if to say that they refuse to give in to the unseen enemy, the State of New Jersey has allowed gun stores to remain open when all other non-essential businesses must close and workers stay home.  So, in New Jersey, guns are essential?  Or so the State Government seems to think. This is another reason that America is on the fast track to fail as a society.  The growth of paranoia took a giant leap under the leadership of President Trump who has fanned the flames of fear and division.  Trump has convinced his followers that the rest of the world is out to get them.  

Right now, the border between Canada (your closet friend, and not just geographically) is closed.  Yes, closed.  We are not allowing people to travel to the US unless it is to deliver critical supplies (food, medicine, other necessary life saving things). Canadians are staying home.  We’re going to continue to stay home until COVID-19 has run it’s course and it is safe to get back to work and school.  It’s that simple.  

Here in Canada we do not have the added stress of hundreds of gunshot victims to add to the chaos in our hospitals.

With nearly everyone home now, its actually safer.  Even if you're one of the ones that has to still work, more of your neighbors are home and can look out for people that don't belong.  Burglars don't like going into occupied homes.  They want to get in undetected, and get out fast.  
Home invasions are actually very rare and when they do occur there's often a connection to drug trafficking.

Also if they think they need a gun now, what was different that they didn't need one before.

You would hope that social distancing would slow gun violence but the factors that feed it are not reduced in a lockdown, probably they are enhanced. But I suspect that the people lining up at gun stores are not doing it because of the chance of a burglary. They are anticipating the next wave of despair by those who will have nothing to lose when the food runs out. Just look at Venezuela if you want to see how civil societies collapse. And our society says having a gun in your hand is the best defense against ""the other"".

I could be wrong. I really want to hear from anyone who has previously shot a human being in malice and after reading this article is putting down his gun and is not going to do it again."
2020-04-01 12:53:30,"Thanks Dr. Kaufman for this piece. You're right, this is unnecessary.

Guns kill more than 30,000 people every year in the US. Why?

Because the GOP/Republican party needs its terrorist arm, the NRA. It needs the random death and destruction to push people towards authoritarian politics.

Meanwhile, even Justice Scalia wrote in the 2008 ruling on DC v Heller that gun regulations are necessary and constitutionally correct.

The big problem that has allowed the ongoing slaughter is that too many people have been fooled into ignoring or minimizing the topic of the Second Amendment, the first four words:

""A well regulated militia, ..."""
2020-04-01 12:57:27,"Ah...we need ""evidence-based solutions"". True, but then that would mean we'd have to believe in science and dispel America's gun culture. Lofty and worthy goals no doubt but Kaufman's seen the lines for guns and ammo. With millions losing their jobs, let's remember that they also will in effect lose their health care and access to mental health options because COBRA will be too expensive for many. Guns and untreated depression don't mix.

First, we need tactical and immediate solutions. Philadelphia has a naval shipyard. Use that space for hospital ships and divert non-Covid-19 patients there to free up space."
2020-04-01 12:57:48,"Well, this is very cynical of course, but at least we won't have school, church and concert shootings for the foreseeable future, due to social distancing and the restrictions on mass gatherings..."
2020-04-01 12:57:55,"This gun carnage touched all of us, if not the deadly toll of loved ones and neighbors killed or maimed, then the indignities of schools and public places on lockdowns or enhanced security, or the mental toll of fear and distrust, or the financial toll of the appalling healthcare triage being passed on to everyone in higher insurance premiums, already insane thanks to our unique for profit system.

Those of us who reject the madness of unregulated gun ownership don’t get to opt out of the consequences."
2020-04-01 10:11:06,"Tracking numbers of shooting victims in Chicago has shown more people have been shot this year than last year. I try not to look at the deaths too often. I know people are still getting shot very day. I am sure the story is the same in Baltimore and other places with high shooting rates. It just is not getting the space in newspapers.

Gun control does not work. Chicago's shootings and death rates were highest when there were zero tolerance no gun laws. People need to have a secure source of income, a secure home and food sources. They need to know their family is going to be safe. Chicago PD does not have enough people to investigate all the shootings. This leaves The People to hand out their own justice. 

People not from these high shooting areas do not understand and they do not want to hear that areas of Chicago are more dangerous than Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Nobody wants to talk about resettling people who want to leave these areas but cannot afford a city bus ticket. I was able to leave the Southside before it got too bad.

The ICU solution is simple first come first served. Harsh yes but real. I know most civilian doctors did not sign up for either war. We need to radically change the social welfare system if we wish to see a change in gun violence. We also must get a new health care system as the failed one we have feeds the gun violence."
2020-04-01 10:19:11,"The fact that many states are releasing convicts from prisons because of the coronavirus pandemic will increase the number of criminals on the street and thus the number of people visiting ICUs as the result of gun violence. Also troubling in this regard is the decision by many city prosecutors, including that of Philadelphia, to suspend arrests for most crimes."
2020-04-01 10:57:32,"As Krugman pointed out yesterday, the Corona crisis is in some ways just an accelerated version of the gun and climate-change crises, with all being fostered by right-wing politicians and media, especially Fox."

How many hospital beds are used because we choose to smoke, drink, use drugs, or fail to control obesity? 

Wouldn't it do far more good if people in terms of freeing medical resources if Americans stopped unhealthy eating and smoking than gun use?"
2020-04-01 13:07:32,"In my upstate NY county, gun ownership is common.  Gun violence is rare.  Murders are rare.  
The problem that this article is addressing is not due to the availability of legal guns, but the willingness of some people to kill other people over for any slight, from a wrong word, to an unpaid drug bill, to membership in the wrong gang.  While guns may be the preferred weapon, these are people who would use knives or other weapons if guns were not available.  
In Venezuela, Chavez banned the private possession of guns, ostensibly to reduce the high murder rate. The murder rate went up. Now the people who oppose the Maduro regime are at the mercy of his armed police.
There are some common sense regulation that would reduce certain types of gun violence, particularly those directed towards mentally unstable people.  But the city street violence is not caused by guns.  Guns are merely the weapon of choice.  
People stocking up on weapons may be excessive fear, but the policy of opening up the prisons while diverting the police to control violations of social distancing does not exactly encourage a feeling of security."
2020-04-01 13:12:41,"You can rage at how unfair it is, you can scream to the heavens until you're hoarse, but the time for gun control was 50 years ago.  Current estimates say that there are approximately 400 MILLION guns in the hands of civilians in the United States.   The genie will never, ever be put back in the bottle.   Repealing the 2nd Amendment is a pipe dream. Australia, Great Britain, and New Zealand are inapplicable to our situation.   With CMC machines and 3D printers readily available, the future of gun control is even bleaker than it was 10 years ago.   What people want, they can get.  As unpalatable as it may be, we must accept reality.  We are going to get much more bang for our buck by addressing the causes of violence than trying to take 400 million guns off the streets."
2020-04-01 13:14:19,"Thank you for this thoughtful article. No question that we must focus on the Coronavirus. But it is fool hardy to forget the large numbers of deaths caused by gun violence. It is almost as if we are collectively forgetting the mass shooting at schools, concerts, churches and synagogues.  These children and adults who were killed also count. May we move forward with speed in public health preventative measures to limit the spread of the Coronavirus.  May we also move forward in laws that result in responsible gun ownership that do not violate the 2nd amendment.  For example, ownership  of military grade rifles that have the ability to shoot hundred  of rounds in minutes, and on and on— and we know other basic safety rules that should be in place —Not doing so is akin to inviting hundreds of people to hangout together in a church or theater and then be amazed at how many test positive for the Coronavirus or who die. Reading some of the comments, one would think only gangs caused gun deaths in the US. We know better."
2020-04-01 13:16:16,"OR, maybe spend a small fraction of the value we have allocated to mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 virus on enforcing existing laws and getting guns out of the hands of those misusing them, or a fraction of the emergency legislative attention on emergency gun legislation.

I continue to amazed by the lack of proportionality between the COVID-19 reaction and the COVID-19 problem, versus the gun death/traffic death/drug death/climate change reactions and those problems. This is not to say that our COVID-19 reaction is unwarranted … it is just an outlier in terms of how big an effort we are allocating to how big a problem."
2020-04-01 13:25:03,"At some point, triage is going to take over and these victims of gun violence may find themselves on the short end of the stick.

Another facet of this unfolding tragedy."
2020-04-01 13:27:14,"News items, repeatedly from Philadelphia, an hour from where I live, are about victims shot not once but multiple times, to assure that they are dead.  Those who plead with shooters to stop shooting or assert that social distancing will diminish shootings don't know what they're dealing with. People who shoot other people, shoot to kill, are criminals.  Criminals, regardless of their life circumstances.  Criminals, regardless of how easily their guns were obtained.  Criminals are not doing social distancing.  They do not respond to pleas to stop shooting.  That's because they are criminals.  We lose sight of that."
2020-04-01 13:30:55,"In other first world countries, like the United Kingdom, there are first responders and ER doctors who have never had to treat gunshot victims. Not once. 

It doesn’t have to be this way. Guns in the hands of the military, some law enforcement and some rural farmers who need them to control pests and threats. Guns out of the hands of everyone else. 

It’s how most of the rest of the first world organizes, and they look at the USA and see no reason to change. It’s time for us to stop being a warning lesson to everyone else."
2020-04-01 13:31:01,"How does alcohol related hospital bed usage compare to gun related usage?  Alcohol related usage would include injuries from fights, car accidents, alcohol poisoning (drinking too much at one time).  Or how about drug use, first fights, unsafe driving, and stabbings."
2020-04-01 13:33:45,Thank you for this piece.  I was dumfounded when Governor Murphy allowed gun shops to continue to be open for all the reasons that you mention. Of course they must maintain physical distance in the shop but who cares if a bullet can travel 1000 feet.  I was supporting the Governor until he made this grave mistake.
2020-04-01 13:35:01,"The president was convinced by his economic advisors to open up on the 12th.  It is our good fortune that the scientists prevailed.  We have had a similar situation about the gun violence for a long, long time except the gun lobbies always have had their say.  And unfortunately, it is not about to change. Unless we begin to think about death as death regardless of how it occurs, we will never change our position on gun control. We need likes Fauchi and Birx to talk some sense into the minds of those who are slaves to the gun lobby."
2020-04-01 13:35:06,"We could dramatically decrease gun deaths quickly - Outlaw the sale and distribution of ammunition.  Do it for the duration of the emergency.  Ammunition is what makes guns work, if it is pulled from the shelves gun deaths will decline.  It is something we can do now without the ""They are going to take our guns"" debate.  Say that is it an emergency measure and will be reversed at the end of the epidemic.

Of course once people see the declines in gun deaths. . . . ."
2020-04-01 13:43:41,"Let's face it, we already have so many guns out there that even if there was a complete ban on their sale tomorrow, it probably wouldn't make any difference.

The only thing that might make a difference now is restrictions on the ammunition purchases.  If you fear not being able to easily get more, perhaps you won't want to readily expend it."

I had to take two weeks quarantine after a ski trip so I was at home when our gov. put the stay at home order on, exempting gun stores as ""essential"". I tend to be a bit more left leaning than a lot of gun owners and see this as pure stupidity. I don't mind helping people buy a new bird gun or a rifle for deer & bear but hand guns are a problem. I have decided I'm not going back until this virus problem is over. I may lose the job, no biggee since I am retired with a military pension and ss but I'll miss the people. I fear however that those people remaining will not be there since many customers will be fact & science denying trump supporters unknowingly sick with the virus who will spread it to my co-workers. Shame on the gov. for exempting gun stores as ""essential"" which they certainly are not. Shame on the organization like NRA and GOA for fear mongering people into buying firearms they have little idea how to safely use or operate."
2020-04-01 13:56:33,we Americans are losing our common sense approach to the society and humanity. we have become blind in the name of the constitution and our responsibilities in contrast to legal rights. i do not see any human rationale to make gun sales and liquor sales as part of essential stuffs as proposed by some states. if people are dying because they cannot eat no gun or liquor can save us - it is like having a civil war between have and have-nots.

Perhaps our greatest threat is from within ourselves, the violence within us that drives so many to strike out  with a gun  when it is impossible to do anything directly against the silent killer covid 19.  This tendency to violence  has been waiting to emerge in a crisis and the availability and stock piling of guns makes this tendency to express itself a trigger finger away.  It is also fed by poverty and hopelessness something we have also failed to face. The covid virus brings out the best and worst in us.  Which will we choose.  

It is easy to sit here at our computers and bemoan this violence.  Reaching out to others and our care givers it seems right now that all we can do until if we learn our lesson we can finally pass laws and create a better society where guns do not need to be a final solution."

The police should just sweep these communities, confiscate all guns, and put away all the known gang members. This is a state of emergency, and serious measures are necessary.

And may I state how pathetic it is that the mayor of a major city has to issue a public service message kindly asking his city's gangs to please stop shooting at each other? It's like in Dr. Strangelove when the President said, ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!"""

The gloves are not far from the bullet, they may take longer to hurt you, but the same. The bullets fired at a rival hurt a child, nobody speaks up.

fully digested, dr. kaufman's message seems to be: ""hey, cowboy! we can't solve gun violence, but no worries about the pandemic! just be glad guns don't kill 240,000 americans in a year, like this pandemic will. besides, projections say we'll only stay under that quarter million body bags if every one of us follows the behavioral CDC advisories exactly -- and who believes that will happen? those photos of the beaches, funerals and bars crowded with people -- they only prove the old saying: guns don't kill people ... people kill people."""

The gun violence epidemic, which is related to the drug epidemic, are societal, cultural epidemics which, by now, we should have found good ways to deal with. Instead, irresponsible leaders of a certain stripe have steadfastly allowed these cancers to fester, killing millions over the past few decades. 

Sadly, the initial response of that same cadre to the coronavirus threat -- as with climate change -- was to deny it, call it a hoax, and that it would magically go away. Instead, it is a global war whose raw carnage we have yet to witness, and unlike recent pronouncements by our fearless leader, there is no light at the end of the tunnel."
2020-04-01 13:27:49,"What was appalling to me was the graphic: there have been more gun deaths this year than COVID-19 deaths. As another letter-writer noted, the time for gun control has come and gone and come and gone, scores of times in the last 21 years since Columbine brought the epidemic to the front pages. Yet it continues to menace our society.

But the menace gun violence presents is also a boon to the gun and ammo manufacturers and the NRA continues to line the pockets of politicians and so for that reason, guns, like the poor, will always be with us.

All of that said, what has been buried in all the COVID coverage is the impact COVID is having on health and treatment on our normal medical emergencies such as heart attacks, strokes, diabetic complications, etc. - you know, those diseases that are the product of modern life in America.

How many will be hospitalized for a heart attack, but due to the ventilator shortage, not get one in time and die? How many will be hospitalized for a diabetic coma, contract COVID and die?

If one thought hospitals were scary before, now they are a nightmare.

Thank God for our frontline defenders - the doctors, nurses, staff, and paramedics!"

Quite shocking that the NRA and foolish 2nd Amendment followers continue their way regardless of these outcomes. The graph showing gun violence numbers contrasted to CD-19 virus cases a stark reminder of our separate worlds. Those like Dr. Kaufman et al are in this long war and are truly heroines. We really must pay attention to our bifurcated society. This pandemic in so many ways reveals the problems the GOP since Reagan has refused to address. I hope tht is is indeed an awakening."

I need to hug and kiss them now not just wave from a distance. We had to do that last night when they went shopping for us because they are afraid to have us go to the store.  Our leaders don't know what to do because they are confronted with an invisible enemy.  It is quite incredible that in this day and age we are laid low by an invisible bug that doesn't even have a brain.  I think it is Nature's way of warning us not to be too complacent.  I hope Nature decides soon that we have had enough of a lesson.

This response was completely unprecedented in this group, a plea for simple decency, and not at all based on the usual nonsense about the government taking guns away, etc.

In relation to Dr. Kaufman's moving report, I mention this as a modest sign of hope that America's gun culture can change, though not overnight and not until we view guns through the same public health lens we view viruses."

2020-04-01 14:45:41,"Gun sales are soaring in response to the coronavirus pandemic. A sad statement on a large segment of American society, who see guns as essential even more so in a time like this. I'm pretty sure that we'll see more gun violence in the coming months."
2020-04-01 13:36:37,"The mayor in Chicago bullied to close parks, while there have already been over 90 homicides in the city this year.  It's great for the police to get some respite while they guard and patrol against cyclists and joggers, not so great for residents on violent blocks as police resources are diverted."
2020-04-01 14:44:19,"What to do about something that kills hundreds of Americans on a daily basis? 

Something that will kill millions of us unless our fight against it is proactive and intentional, despite the right wing GOP resistance? 

Something that spreads through ignorance and carelessness, that is well within our ability to reign in?

Something on which the US lags far behind the rest of the world, even when we have far greater resources?

I agree—it’s time for serious gun control legislation, and strict enforcement of the ‘well-regulated’ clause of the Second Amendment, if not repealing it altogether. The virus of gun violence must be eradicated."

2020-04-01 14:38:01,I’m a US citizen living in Italy and Germany. We don’t have much gun violence here. Americans have to ask themselves what’s wrong in the US. I feel it will never change in the US.
2020-04-01 14:46:29,"Dr. Kaufman: That you are facing this horrific dilemma while the pandemic rages is beyond belief! We rank at the top of the charts in pandemic cases and deaths and also in gun violence. When the pandemic began its spread in earnest across the nation, gun sales began to climb. This is complete insanity! The medical center where you work is one of the finest in the world!"
2020-04-01 13:23:03,"Gun deaths, serious injuries top 100k+ each yr in America, every yr.,  a bizarre aberration re our peer countries.

A virus scare that may or may not result in the same number comes and we shut down the country and mobilize it like it was WW2.

That is the definition/stats on our cultural abuse gun sickness in this country."
2020-04-01 13:36:20,"""Across the country, more than 80,000 people visit the emergency department for gunshot wounds each year. About one in four will be admitted to the I.C.U., and they’ll stay for an average of three days.""

So, 20,000 gunshot victims per year in the ICU.  Divide by 365 and multiply by 3: 164 ICU beds are taken up by gunshot victims at any given time.  There are 68,558 ICU beds in the U.S. so gunshot victims are taking up 164/68558 = around two tenths of one percent of ICU beds, or two of every 1,000 ICU beds.  Yeah, that's a hospitalization crisis deserving an op-ed!"
2020-04-01 15:08:54,"There is a huge difference between Covid deaths and and those from gun violence, and that is choice. Covid attacks anyone at any time. But guns? In my county, most of the reported shootings involve people who chose to pick up guns and shoot at another human being for criminal reasons. The majority of shooters and victims are gang members and drug dealers (not always one and the same) taking care of business. I doubt that those guns were all legally obtained from dealers. ”Focused gun deterrence programs” are not going to change how those people operate. It’s like chipping away at an iceberg. 

I am not a gun rights advocate, btw. I’m just a realist. I am so tired of reading about shootings that are obviously gang related (both men wearing gangs colors, or a young man shot from a moving car) and the huge gun arsenals (often accompanied by large amounts of meth, cocaine and pharmaceuticals) discovered when officers follow up on a warrant or some other matter. That short barreled shotgun? Not legally obtained. Focusing on the guns is the wrong approach."
2020-04-01 15:20:19,"So interesting.... thousands of gun deaths...hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by cars...and yet, not a peep about changing laws regarding either of these.  Guns are apparently 'essential' to American life, even under COVID.  Privately-owned Suburban Assault Vehicles cause hundreds of thousands of death per year in the US, not only by way of crashes and collisions, but by creating local air pollution which in turn causes deaths by asthma, emphysema, etc.   But, this is the price the rest of us must pay for their 'freedoms'.

Deaths by COVID however are absolutely unacceptable however, and the world must stop.

I find this dichotomy positively fascinating, from a Psych 101 perspective.  Hysteria is a virus, and contagious.  Nationalism, and divisiveness within nations, particularly the US.  Heck, even COVID has become politicized, with the Far Right and the Far Left more firmly entrenched in their camps.  Social media (which is a reflection of society of course, and how they are currently feeling) has gone bonkers."
2020-04-01 15:26:11,"There is a cautionary tale in the gun violence for the virus. Once a problem is everywhere, doing much about it is extremely difficult and slow.

The guns are already everywhere and most of us are not tempted to murder someone. The virus is not yet everywhere and most of us are hard wired to get close to other people. For the foreseeable future, stopping the contagion is the most important task for all of us."
2020-04-01 15:26:26,"The $2T package should be changed for a gun buyback program.

You will kill two birds with one stone. I never understood the gun culture as simple stats shows that ""the more guns, the more you'll have accidents and deaths"". 

The gun culture started in the 70s when hunting started to be less popular. Hopefully, it's not too late to reverse it."
2020-04-01 15:29:44,"Dr. Kaufman, Thank you for this article. Gun violence is an epidemic in our country. Suicide and accidents when children find loaded guns account for a large part. Parents standing at the bedside of their adult children is heartbreaking as well. I don't know how many times I have asked a patient if they have a gun. When I ask how it is secured? In a closet. Is it loaded? Yes. Is it locked with a gun lock? No, if someone breaks in a lock would take too long to unlock. Do you have children or grandchildren? Yes, but they know better than to touch the gun. And so on."
2020-04-01 15:34:34,In what universe are gun stores considered an essential business and kept open? Especially now during the Covid-19 epidemic. Guns and bullets are not going to defend us against this invisible enemy.
2020-04-01 15:37:42,May I add drive more slowly?  There are fewer accidents when speed is reduced.  Fewer accidents = reduction in amount of medical care needed. Thanks and be safe everyone.
2020-04-01 15:54:15,"Who exactly are you talking to here? The condescension + paternalism on display here is the disconnect between analyzing the gun violence epidemic and understanding it as a symptom of income inequality, community divestment, psycho-emotional health, and the proliferation of firearms. It's not about choices that are reasoned and can be un-reasoned."
2020-04-01 16:05:12,"The ethics guidelines for rationing care to coronavirus patients should be extended broadly to all patients. If person who was using a firearm to commit a crime was subsequently shot by police, it is difficult to accept that someone's mother would die so that doctors and nurses can tend to this criminal. Otherwise, the ethics guidelines aren't worth the paper they're printed on. (Yes, I realize that the rationing is sometimes related to specific equipment shortages, e.g. ventilators. In those situations there is no rationing relative to non-coronavirus patients.)"
2020-04-01 16:13:01,"At the beginning of the shutdown in our county,  a gun store in our neighborhood stayed open.  It was noticeable because of the long  lines of customers out the door, crowded close together, ignoring social distancing rules.  It took the community four days to convince the county sheriff and government to shut them down.  Now all gun stores are allowed to reopen, thanks to lawsuits filed by the NRA.  Their claim that the 2nd Amendment is being violated is nonsense; the 2nd Amendment does not guarantee us the right to buy a gun every day of every year.  If any constitutional right is being abrogated, it is our right to peaceable assembly (1st Amendment) which good people are willing to waive in a crisis in the interest of the public good.
The NRA and gun stores are showing their true colors.  Gun stores are operating out of pure greed, as they report sales of more than five times the usual amount.  When the COVID crisis is over, we can call out the NRA for their lack of patriotism: cash over country!"
2020-04-01 16:15:30,"The numbers here could be clearer. The chart labeled ""gun violence"" does not include all firearm mortalities. The total number of firearm mortalities in any given year is twice what is indicated here--that is, more than 30,000 deaths. I assume the chart is leaving out firearm suicides which make up approximately half of those 30,000+ deaths. Of the 120,000 people who are shot each year, around 16,000 die. Of the remaining 104,000, some 20,000 will spend an average of 3 days in ICU wards. There are about 70,000 ICU beds in America. In any given year there are thus around 70,000 x 365 ICU bed-days available (a total of 25,000,000 ICU bed-days) of which non-suicide gun shot victims occupy 20,000 x 3 ICU bed-days (a total of 60,000 ICU bed-days). Presumably those who have attempted firearm suicide but survived add to that number. Ignoring firearm suicides, gun shot victims occupy about 0.23% of available ICU bed-days. That is a small number. All the same, it is the rough equivalent of 10,000 Covid-19 victims staying in an ICU bed for about 6 days."
2020-04-01 16:15:37,"This is a time of reckoning, if only we will heed it. Our failures as a society are being laid bare by a soulless virus. The greed and rapacity of our wealthy, the corruption and spinelessness of our elected representatives... all of these have led to the country we have today. Yes, gun violence is skewed towards one part of society. But we have to ask WHY? Why is there such high income disparity? Why is there such a disparity in the opportunities available to a child who should be born equal with all?

We have become a country in which lives are valued less than profits; in which healthcare is a luxury; where it is next to impossible to actually work hard and get anywhere. Yes, we will get through this crisis - at incredible cost and leaving far more lives in chaos and decrepitude than we would had we built a better society. The lesson will be given. Whether we learn from it remains to be seen. We must think hard about big bold changes to the way we want to rebuild, moving forward."
2020-04-01 16:38:40,"There’s something about the warmth, comfort and empowerment a firearm offers. Gun owners see themselves as heroes and protectors - if only in their minds. 

Another issue is the thousands of guns a year that are lost, forgotten or stolen. In attics, basements, closets and most often from vehicle break-ins and not reported.

They are time bombs patiently waiting to injure or kill."
2020-04-01 16:46:02,"What do the rise in gun violence, the drop in vaccination rates, and the delayed and inadequate response to COVID-19 have in common?  All are fueled by an anti-science ideology that has grown in the US for over 30 years, and has been embraced by the GOP.  

Yes, the SARS-CoV-2 is our current battle.  But the real war we need to win is against the anti-science ""conservatives"" in the US that put Americans and the rest of the world at risk from preventable disease and violence."

Wake up, people, and realize that your ""second amendment rights"" are not threatened by Democrats and that you are being conned and fooled into voting for people who do not wish you well.

I think this is a propaganda piece from the NYT.  Are some people arming up?  Of course. But the people who already have their guns arent shooting anyone.  Remember the recent 2A march in DC?  30,000 gun owners brandishing their weapons in public.  Liberal heads exploding about how many deaths were going to come from it and the march shouldnt be allowed. 
Remember that?  Not one person shot, not one shot fired and not a single person injured at all.   But the best are articles about 1st time buyers in tough gun states like NY, NJ, and CA complaining about restrictions and waiting periods.  Absolutely hysterical.  These are the loudest people on the forefront of gun control who pushed their states for these laws and now they are upset with them."

The numbers would be dramatically lower if the nation has rational and reasonable public safety and gun control laws.

The numbers would be dramatically lower if Americans stopped voting for the Guns Over People party, the frontmen for America's merchants of death.

For those still living in the fringes, we are way past the 'wild west' period, when the law of the forest was the only tool available."

This article wasn’t written for the millions of Americans who practice firearm safety religiously. It was written for those who don’t care about the value of human life, who engage in wanton bloodshed over trivial matters.

I suspect the overlap between Philly shooters and NYT readers is small enough to be negligible. Perhaps we could start enforcing the penalty for all gun crimes to a draconian standard? Law abiding citizens aren’t stripped of their primary tool for self defense, and criminals are strongly deterred.

Anyone interested in a well-reasoned examination of gun ownership should read Sam Harris’ “The Riddle of the Gun”"

2020-04-01 17:10:49,"I know this piece is meant well, and medical workers are to be commended for their extraordinary work in these times, but the theme is deeply patronizing. Gun violence is not something that can be turned off and on; it is inextricably linked to race, class, mental health, mass incarceration, and to the profound failure of our society to adequately address any of these. The epidemics of violence, poverty, and social inequality caused by those failings are far larger and more consequential than COVID-9 – literally, not just figuratively – yet they do not provoke national or global responses like this virus has. The doctor says people should stop shooting; poor people and brown people could ask society the same thing – and in fact have done so for centuries, mostly to no avail. These are troubling times and the doctor’s plea is heartfelt, but we should be careful how we assign blame for what’s going on."

You are also our crazy cousins.  Sometimes we don’t understand you at all.  We watch events like the Las Vegas massacre or Sandyhook shootings in unbelieving horror, and think, OK, now they will reinterpret their Second Amendment and put it in the proper context in a modern society.  You are so wealthy yet you tolerate poverty to an extent we literally cannot comprehend.  From that poverty comes lack of education, poor health, addiction, crime and gun violence.  You respond with policing and jails.  We like most of the world try and temper our response with public health, income support, education, dextox and substance abuse programs focusing on health.  We try and divert addiction-rooted petty crime out of the criminal justice system and especially out of jail.  Sick and self-medicating people in our view need mental health interventions, not punishment.

Dylann Roof, the shooter in Charleston, used a semiautomatic Glock and had eight 13-shot magazines.  He fired seventy-four shots and killed nine people.  If semiautomatic firearms were banned in this country, he would have only had a six-shot revolver.  With such limited firepower, he may not even have attempted it.

There were also 47,000 suicides.

While I'm all in favor of finding ways to convince people not to shoot each other, and not handle their firearms so careless that the discharge unintentionally, SERIOUSLY,  I'd also like to see us working harder to keep people from

B) drive recklessly and dangerously on our roads.

C) protecting themselves and others better from the common flu.

Not to mention, if you have a history of heart disease you shouldn't be eating that chicken-fried steak and that fatty dessert...more die from heart disease than anything else...so far.

2020-04-01 18:26:44,"Now is no time to learn how to handle guns responsibly. If you are worried about personal safety, grab a couple cans of hornet bomb at the hardware store. This stuff shoots 20 feet and causes temporary blindness. It will do in a pinch. That said, when the street drugs become scarce we may suffer violent consequences. And, anyone who believes that violent social disorder will not possibly happen need only to check the toilet paper supply at the local market.

Look at the political leadership in these areas first,they all have one thing in common.. liberal progressive Democrats in control. Such a false narrative just obfuscates the root cause providing cover for failed policies. There are many pockets of poverty in fly-over country where daily shootings don't happen inspite the fact most folks have guns.
 Asking for the shootings to stop is pathetic when leadership brags about eliminating stop and frisk of particular demographics while hospital ER's receive dozens of victims weekly.  This is convoluted political correctness."

2020-04-01 18:41:26,"I know exactly what this doctor is describing.  As one who nearly bled to death from gunshot wounds, I vividly recall entering a hospital in Dushanbe (Tajikistan) which was overflowing with patients from their nascent civil war. Following the surgery that saved my life, I shared a bed with another patient while his family sat huddled below us. 

When this COVID-19 pandemic passes, our nation needs to think deeply about how our leadership has failed us on both this and the now-concurrent and even more resilient epidemic of gun violence."

Instead, they are likely putting themselves and their families at risk, as cooped-up children are at risk of exploring these newly purchased weapons and injuring themselves or others.""

If I disagree with someone or a member of another gang has dissed my family name, so be it.  Go play poker or something.

I do wonder about the accuracy of the graph presented and the latest data, which of course changes week to week.

I live near the 15th largest television market in the US and nightly there were reports of the number of shootings, injuries and other news items which seem to have become all too routine (I recall several decades ago when a solemn anchor came on at 10 pm to report a shooting and death, which was shocking then).  

In the last two weeks there hasn't been a report, which may be the result of the producer deciding story after story of COVID-19 was more important, or there just weren't any due to stay at home and stronger police ratio of people on the streets.  Or perhaps there were shootings and we just don't hear about them.  

This is an important distinction and if the curve of gun injuries has flattened out, may be worthy of cause and effect analysis."

2020-04-01 16:37:35,I had to visit the ER 3/14. As I was nearing the entrance I heard a cop on a walkie talkie issue an order to locate the shell casings. I picked up my step and went through the doors on his coattails and was the last patient in before the hospital went under lockdown. It was a day or so later that people started taking COVID seriously. I later learned that the victim was a teen who pranked his girlfriend who then picked up dad's gun and shot him.
2020-04-01 18:43:53,"Stop shooting others?  But it's the essence of American Exceptionalism!  Didn’t you know?  Ask Iranians.  Or Iraqis.  Or Afghan tribesmen.  Or the Vietnamese.  Or our own American Indians.  Or Black people living here.  

Wantonly killing people whom are different from us — and self-righteously crowing about it later, even celebrating it, even sanctifying it — is the American way.  Ask movie director John Ford.  After all, his claim to fame was making movies that celebrated it.  So did John Wayne.  “She Wore A Yellow Ribbon” is very instructive."

Fox News tells them that the democrats are coming for their guns so they buy more.  They attend rallies and its all about them, there right to bear arms.  They don't want to fight for this country like the draft dodger in charge but they need those guns.

They dont care about the virus because it is all a hoax, .  Sometimes you wonder if we are all in a video where people get shot and jump right back up.  People dont die from gunshot wounds and they arent dying from the virus because it is all a hoax.  thank you Trump and Fox News"

2020-03-31 18:30:49,"when practices vary so much it makes the case that we just don't really know what ""best practice"" is. And it seems like few hospitals can really afford to be losing staff in these times over disputes about a mask."
2020-03-31 18:30:59,The hospital administrators in these facilities should round in the intensive care units and on the wards using the PPE provided to the medical and nursing staff in their institutions. They should never ask their workforce to go anywhere they refuse to go.The notion that masks will frighten patients is absurd.
2020-03-31 18:32:34,"Dr. Nikiciez  is clearly a very sensible doctor.  It seems very strange that hospital administrators put hospital image over medical safety. That is a very poor choice. We cannot be in the business of risking the health of the doctors, nurses, and staff members who perform the medical care work. If a hospital hires a doctor for his professional skill and judgement, then they should not micro manage the doctor."
2020-03-31 18:36:20,"From my air pollution control engineering coursework, it is obvious that masks of any quality will reduce the number of airborne droplets expelled by sneezes and decrease droplets inhaled by healthy people: the better the mask, the bigger the impact.  Masks also reduce the number of face touches which we now understand to be important in reducing virus spread from contaminated surfaces.

Once the mask manufacturers catch up to current demand, I predict we are going to see a much wider acceptance of them in many settings within & outside of health care facilities."
2020-03-31 18:41:42,A disturbing lack of awareness and empathy from hospital administrators who ought to be doing everything they possibly can to protect and support healthcare workers.
2020-03-31 18:41:48,"Administrators should not be overriding the judgement of medical professionals, on masks or anything else.

Those administrators should be ""suspended"", told to get back to shuffling papers and to stay out of things they are not competent to decide."
2020-03-31 18:43:30,"Great article .It exposes so well the struggle doctors have in being ''allowed"" to make decisions concerning their own health in health settings ruled by administrators not on the front line.The same can be said for nurses...although they are often lucky if they have a strong union behind them. Dr.Nikicicz made his decision to wear a mask based on the learning and experience he received throughout his scientifically based schooling and also what his intuitive sense told him he needed to do to try to maintain his own health in the circumstances he was in. That takes courage and he was initially punished for it. It is a small lesson to us all...stand up for what you believe is right."
2020-03-31 18:43:37,"I am an emergency physician. I have treated several suspected and confirmed cases of Covid 19 so far. Fortunately I do not work in the USA. When going to work, I wear a surgical mask at home, before stepping out of the front door of my apartment. I keep it on for my entire shift, and take it off only when I have reached back home. Of course, I switch to an N95 mask and use other PPE such as eye goggles, face shield, gown etc whenever the situation calls for it, especially while doing procedures. But the only time I am not wearing a mask, in the entire day, is when I am home. I also wear a mask while going out for any other reason, such as shopping for groceries. 

Every single person, everywhere in the world, should wear a mask, preferably a surgical mask, while stepping out of their home. Of course, they should also stay at home as much as possible. This is basic common sense. The more this virus spreads, anywhere in this world, the worse off we all are."
2020-03-31 18:46:24,"Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is a medical judgement. Administrators have no business making medical decisions about this, or anything else for that matter.

When this is all over my hope is that doctors will be back in charge of medicine, nurses will be in charge of nursing, and administrators will be helping doctors and nurses accomplish the mission which is caring for patients. 

I can dream."
2020-03-31 18:47:29,The administrators should require all hospital staff to wear masks - at all times.
2020-03-31 18:48:23,Seeing doctors and nurses in masks at hospitals doesn't frighten patients. Many could be non symptomatic carriers. Patients have never been bothered by medical staff wearing masks during surgeries. I would think most people would prefer to see medical personnel masked at this time.In my opinion management has it wrong this time.
2020-03-31 18:48:55,"If a hospital physician, vital for the smooth function in treating patients, feels the need of wearing a mask when exposed to other people, sounds very reasonable. Denying him that 'safety net' is preposterous!"
2020-03-31 18:49:42,"There is still much scientific debate about how easily the virus can be aerosolized, how frequently airborne transmission occurs, and how infectious carriers not obviously coughing or with fever can be.  But until the scientific dust settles, it would be wisest to err on the side of caution. Health care workers, by the nature of their jobs, are at very high risk for infection -- and to pass on that infection to their patients and colleagues."
2020-03-31 18:50:46,"Thank you for writing this important article.  I am a grandmother caring for the grandchildren of two health care providers.  The lack of PPE, the shortage of testing, and the conflicting/shifting guidance on proper protective procedures-- all the result of ineffective national leadership--generate this kind of conflict, putting all of us at greater risk.  Doctors and healthcare providers should not be expected to help governments or their hospital administrators save safe by not insisting on proper protection.  I'm reminded of Rumsfeld's reckless abandon of the noncombatant.... In this war, we are all combatants."
2020-03-31 18:51:43,"""In recent years, doctors have felt increasingly like employees working for cost-cutting companies putting profit ahead of medicine.""  Says it all. 
 The healthcare insurance companies care nothing except for perception and profit.  Doctors and Nurses need professional representation..call that a union if you will.  I call it professional responsibility.  It's really time to overhaul this broken system.  Universal Health for Everyone!"
2020-03-31 18:52:06,"Mass general seems to enjoy a good reputation for medical acumen. Seems like essentially all the medical staff there are masked all the time, as are many of the administrative staff. So are members of the cleaning crews. I doubt the administrators at other hospitals are better informed than the folks making those decisions at Mass General."
2020-03-31 18:52:41,"It seems very likely that one of the reasons Singapore and Taiwan and S. Korea had limited infection was because literally every single person on the street was wearing a mask. Everywhere, all the time. So the asymptomatic viral shedders were shedding less and the uninfected were also less likely to breath in virus. This is why the CDC is now considering making it the recommendation (a little late I'd say). The argument against physicians wearing masks all the time is that hospitals will run out of masks but this doesn't make sense because physicians are typically wearing an N95 mask that they already have, and not changing it unless they work with a known COVID patient or it gets soiled. As a physician, if I have a mask that I've used and is still perfectly good and nobody is going to use it but me, I see no reason why my wearing the mask reduces PPE for anyone else."
2020-03-31 18:52:58,"Hospital administrators/management can meet and greet all visitors to their heart’s content. All without masks... maybe hug and say glad you chose us. 

Doctors are the frontline and get to wear whatever they believe best protects themselves and patients. 

My daughter is an emergency room doctor at a large hospital.  I remain terrified for her."
2020-03-31 18:55:10,"The administrators at hospitals care are more concerned with the perception of things than they are about the actual safety of employees/workers.  Let's be real, if there were plenty of PPE to go around the recommendation would be that all workers in the health care setting wear N95 masks.  Period.  That would include while face to face with patients as well as walking around the facility.  There is ample evidence that this virus remains airborne for hours at times--thus the N95 would be the mask of choice.  However, there are NOT enough masks to go around.  Therefore, if some providers are wearing an N95 and others are unable to get them, there is a sense that some are more protected than others.   The hospital administrators do not want that perception (reality) percolating down to all employees--otherwise all employees will demand adequate protection which the hospital cannot provide due to the dearth of equipment.  This is about saving face, not about the safety of this doctor.  Typical behavior from the adminstration..."
2020-03-31 18:55:25,I think if all hospital workers and frontline workers can be protected properly when they have to face deadly Coronavirus the situation in United States will be different now. If the soldiers don’t have proper armors and weapons to fight how can they win the war?
2020-03-31 18:56:09,"The numerous stories about the attempts by administrators to either muzzle medical providers or prevent them from being safe are extremely disturbing. In addition to this article, there are reports of providers being fired or threatened with firing for speaking out about the need for PPE. There needs to be job protection and ensured safety for the providers, and so far that isn't happening."

2020-03-31 19:05:26,All doctors/nurses/hospital workers should be able to wear whatever protective gear they want anywhere in the hospital or outside of the hospital.  What's wrong with these administrators!
2020-03-31 19:05:49,"We have made regulations and administrative burdens such that - not to talk about payments such that the small practices and hospitals simply cannot compete anymore.  So medicine,  just like agriculture, is moving away from small independents operators to huge industrialized machines.  The outcome will be ugly - especially because we have allowed those big machines to be owned by Wall Street."
2020-03-31 19:08:28,"This is only one example of the ways in which the Covid-19 pandemic is exposing the shocking mismanagement of our healthcare systems.  

Other examples include: healthcare systems firing physicians and then requesting that physicians volunteer for extra duty; cutting physician pay while requiring work hours that leave no time for physical recovery; gag orders preventing physicians from going to the media or even posting on their personal social media about some of the dangerous practices being followed at many of our hospitals.

Nurses are well as physicians are being subjected to dangerous and exploitative labor practices, but unlike doctors, they tend to be unionized, so have better ability to push back."
2020-03-31 19:08:52,"thank you for writing this article and bringing public attention to the plight of physicians, who for a very, very long time, have otherwise been muted and forced to bend to the wills and impractical, nonevidence-based policies issued by ridiculous hospital admin and the c-suite (who have absolutely no idea what it is like to be on the frontlines, let alone see a patient).

this important article also sheds light on a much bigger issue that physicians face today and have been facing for quite a while including the voicelessness, loss of control, encroachment, and erosion of their own field by. 

at the end of the day, who would you trust to make critical medical decisions  and call the shots regarding your or a loved one's health? a physician who has gone through years and years of endless training or a ceo hiding out in their mansion? (ie see the story about ceos of mt sinai fleeing to their mansion hideouts in Florida). 

i guarantee you, the moment hospitals, large or small, are physician led and not by ridiculous admin who have no idea what its like to see sick patients, youll have better patient outcomes and much more informed and rational decision making.

physicians in this country have been used and abused for far too long and this global pandemic has really brought this to light.

thank you again for writing this!"
2020-03-31 19:15:32,Let's not forget that this doctor was not just protecting himself (against being infected by others) but even more important protecting anybody else who passed him.  Anybody having worked with a patient could be infected and not yet know it.  If I hear about a hospital that prevents doctors and nurses from making their own decisions about wearing PPE in public - that's a place I don't want to visit.
2020-03-31 19:18:31,"As a physician, this is especially concerning. Where is our autonomy on a matter which is so benign? I'm fortunate that my hospital in Chicago requires all hospital staff to wear a mask upon entering the building."
2020-03-31 19:18:44,"At my hospital every one who enters is given a surgical mask.
As an employee , some have chosen to wear the N95, aside from just in their unit.
I wouldn’t.
Besides it’s VERY uncomfortable.
Outside the unit, I just wear a surgical mask.
When I go food shopping , I wear a surgical mask, because if I cough or sneeze, people will scatter.
There’s enough chaos in the hospital.

When she eats lunch in a closed lunch room , she is given a Chinese food container ,which she opens and places the mask facing down suspended so nothing touches the outside of the mask ."
2020-03-31 19:28:29,"We need more PPE, period!  Masks were created for protection from bacteria, infections, chemical hazard and viruses too. The N95 has proved to protect HCWs from CoViD-19. However, all masks are not equal. Masks can CAUSE disease as well as protect.  PPE protects largely because they are disposable.  A mask which was just used during an intubation of a person with CoViD-19 may have this Virus all over it.   If he touches the mask the Virus moves to his hands.  That's why the mask was suppose to be discarded before he left the patient's space and then his gloves should have been discarded too.  If he needed a mask in the hallway to protect himself he should have used a new clean surgical mask, which could provide some limited protection.
Masks arn't clean once worn for awhile.  People are full of bacteria, especially their mouths.  That bacteria grows on the warm, wet surface.  Then the person breaths that bacteria back into their lungs.
Masks can be ""germ"" centers inside and outside.  It isn't the mask alone that protects you.  It's how it's used, the professional protocols,  matter just as much.   Not all Nurses and doctors are ""Germ"" or PPE specialist. 
Infections kill about 99,000 hospital patients annually.  Misused PPE can kill.
Everyone is focus on the equipment and not on use.  That's bad!  
Get more PPE now, so HCWs can use them as intended!"
2020-03-31 19:29:22,"Instead of being concerned about what the medical personnel say about their PPE, the hospitals should focus their energy on providing proper PPE. Certainly that's a challenge but that ought to be their focus."
2020-03-31 19:29:58,"I've been on both the provider side in the ICU, and the hospital administration side in the Legal/Risk department.  The medical expertise, and protection of our most valuable resources--our doctors, nurses, RTs, techs, environmental aides, security, and all other staff--needs to come before any administrative concern about image. Period.  The public will get over it.  Joint Commission will need to deal with it and adapt.  This is not the time to blindly adhere to rules which were not written with the knowledge we have today.  Bottom line--respect and value your providers because without them, we have nothing."
2020-03-31 19:34:40,"I see the bean counters still are in power. The MBAs started running our healthcare system in the 90s.I retired early as a RN almost 4 years ago because of unsafe practices.And I was in a union.

Healthcare needs to be truly nonprofit.The MDs and the RNs,honest ones ,need to be in charge."
2020-03-31 19:37:01,"The malignant relationship between doctors and the businessmen who increasingly own them is now laid to bare.  With almost 2 decades of front-line inpatient medical care under my belt, in 2 states and 3 health systems, I can tell you with confidence that if a patient care/quality issue that requires money/investment by the health system is made?  It will almost universally be declined.  We are told to work harder and smarter.  These hospitals that inexplicably enjoy “not-for-profit” tax status continue to employ marketing directors who wield astonishing advertising budgets.  They purchase physicians and flailing health systems with plans for competition-destroying behemoths.  Their motivation has never been the public health.  To practically all of my fellow colleagues on the front lines, this is met with a collective shrug, and a hope that the general public finally cares about how much of our healthcare costs are being consumed by the hospital administrators who will, rest assuredly, not be in harms way while holding teleconferences (Monday through Friday only, of course.)."
2020-03-31 19:47:21,This is one of the many bad effects of the doctors losing control of the profession in recent decades  I enjoyed a full career as a board certified Internist but I do not believe I would choose the profession again under present circumstances.
2020-03-31 19:49:07,"If I go to a medical facility and see staff and Doctors wearing a mask, I would feel safer and more comfortable knowing I am not at risk of getting infected. I had some back pain, but decided not to to go the Physiotherapy, since I was afraid, I might catch the Coronavirus during my visits there. Just like Hospitals are being administered by Non-Doctors - typically an arts degree with an MBA, many manufacturing companies led by non Engineers have outsourced their core competency to China and other places and run great American Engineering companies into the ground. Instead of using Engineering knowledge to reduce cost in the US, they shut down factories here and contracted it out to Chinese and other countries. Now we can't even make PPE without using the force of defense act.  There are too many jack of all trades leading Hospitals and Engineering firms into the ground due to low medical/technical competencies."
2020-03-31 19:53:37,"This is a problem endemic to healthcare now. Hospitals administrators are now dictating medical policy over doctors at the front line, yet, they are on vacation at home or hiding away in their offices."
2020-03-31 19:53:48,Wearing a mask at all times won't hurt and it might help.  There is no data because this is a real-time living experiment.  Administrators should base their decisions on what is best for their front-line caregivers not on worries about appearances.  When patients are critically ill no one has ever run around looking for an administrator.
2020-03-31 19:54:36,"I am an emergency medicine physician. From the begining of this disease it was very reasonable to assume (based upon other coronoviruses) that there would be significant exposure from asymptomatic cases - these could be patients, colleagues, or myself infecting others. Universally wearing a mask when there is community spread is well backed by multiple health systems, epidemiology, and common sense. I have been wearing a mask near continuously. 

I have inadequate PPE, I have been directed to use PPE in methods contrary to OSHA and manufacturer guidelines, and I have no doubt that if I make too much noise I will be ""taken off the schedule""*. Thankfully the hospitals I work at have allowed personal judgement and haven't been as bad as what colleagues are experiencing, but it's not reassuring that I have had to scrounge Ebay, Amazon, building supply companies and industrial suppliers to get the minimum equipment for me to (sort of) stay safe. Wearing a mask may not save my life, but it might save my patient's life or my coworker's life. I could easily become infected, remain asymptomatic, and shed the virus to others. Source control is washing my hands, wearing gloves, changing my gown, and wearing a mask. Leave the practice of medicine to physicians, not administrators!

* most doctors aren't fired, we are independent contractors with contracts that exclude all due process. No one get's fired, they aren't scheduled."
2020-03-31 19:54:53,"In my hospital, they weren't as harsh as some, but they told everyone that wearing masks outside of patient rooms was frowned upon.

Then they just told us to wear masks 100% of the time at work, but wearing N95s outside of patient rooms was frowned upon.

I have a feeling that, if/when the N95 supply goes up, as the number of sick health care workers skyrockets, they will be telling us to wear N95s all day long as well.

Of course, they could have just told us to use our own judgement in the first place..."
2020-03-31 19:59:45,"I'm concerned that hospitals not instituting universal masking in the hospital and CDC's advice to the public not to wear masks when out of the house shopping is being driven by the known shortage of masks and the fear that general use will make them unavailable to the front line providers.
This is a legitimate fear.
However, we could instead prioritize mask manufacture, compel companies to switch to masks instead of ? bedsheets, centralize the authority and the information about numbers made, ask for public forbearance and promise a clear signal when the health workers have enough and the public can begin purchase and use.
It is just not believable that use of proper masks adds nothing to safety."
2020-03-31 19:59:55,"This epidemic has laid bare the decline of medicine as a noble profession with autonomy.  Doctors and nurses are working without PPE endangering themselves and other patients they treat.  Those who raise the alarm are fired, or ""investigated"" and have their reputations destroyed.

Meanwhile as the NY Post has documented, NYC hospital CEOs, who draw millions in ""salary"" for running their ""non-profit"" hospital are ""working"" from their Florida and Bahama estates.  When this is all over, and the dead doctors and nurses are buried, they will give a pep talk of a job well done, appeal to the government for more funding, and invariably they will give themselves a big fat bonus.

I do not think this system will ever be fixed.  I will never let my children become doctors and become canon fodder in epidemic like this.  I write this with great respect for the amazing health care professionals."
2020-03-31 20:00:47,"I am a physician who had to consult on a patient in the ICU.  This involved exposure to significant amounts of Covid-19 infected blood.  Who knows if this virus is transmitted through blood or not?  The employed physicians and nurses all had extensive protective gear (as they should).  I did not.  They did not have the gear on hand for me, and made up makeshift gear for me.  In retrospect, I should have refused to care for the patient, but that would not have been in his best interests. The shame of it all is that the employed physicians have become the bridge to the CEO's and business people who run the hospitals.  The private practitioners (like myself) are being pushed aside.  Except in emergencies like this, where we are suddenly necessary and available.  We are risking our lives, while the administrators are comfortably at home accepting large paychecks."
2020-03-31 20:08:02,"Hospitals need to be re-educated on why hospitals exist in the first place.  If I were a patient (or family/friend of a patient), I would be comforted by medical personnel protecting themselves.  The message to me would be that they care enough about ALL patients in not contracting or spreading any disease.  I also want the physicians, nurses, therapists, admin staff, maintenance workers, and everyone else at the hospital to STAY healthy.  Without them, we would have no care."
2020-03-31 20:10:46,"Hospital administrators are always about image and profit. 
I say to all healthcare workers:  
There is safety in numbers.  Wear your masks anywhere in the hospital. Of course there is virus in the hospital.   They need you now.  Wear any protection you want."
2020-03-31 20:13:38,"Currently, I feel more comfortable with a doctor or nurse wearing protective gear than one who is not!  It is unfair to expect these professionals to risk their lives, and that of their families, just to project an image of “health”.  We don’t know for sure who has the virus and who does not.  We also need our medical staff to stay healthy and all indicators are that frequent, repetitive exposure to the virus intensifies the severity.  If wearing protective gear throughout the hospital protects and keeps them healthy, I am all for it!  To fire them is a ridiculous management decision and those managers should be fired!"
2020-03-31 20:16:53,"Where has reason gone?  Of course everyone wearing a mask is safer than people not wearing masks.  Will they protect 100% - No.  Will they allow a slacking off of all other safety measures - No. But it stands to reason that keeping respiratory droplets out of the air provides some amount of protection.

It's crazy that we are arguing about this."
2020-03-31 20:19:04,"In the name of solidarity and to protect their precious images, the hospital administrators should be forced to work from offices inside the hospitals WITHOUT a mask if it's not such a big deal."
2020-03-31 20:20:04,"What you are seeing is administrators making medical decisions instead of medical professionals.  This has been going on for years since docs have become employees and administrators pushing to make more money for their institutions.

Nonmedical personnel make 'regulations' that can be changed at will.  These regulations are then used to lever medical care.  A common example is ER docs being pushed to do more tests for chest pain because that complaint gets a higher payment.

For-profit medicine at its best.  Why do think that the 'best medical care in the world' has so many dead people from Covid-19?"
2020-03-31 20:23:25,This is what happens when administrative costs exceed the Physician costs in a hospital. Too many paper-pushers with no science background what to do and Doctors allowing themselves to delegate their professional opinion and judgement to the paper-pushers. Its time that reform began to mean doing what's best for patients and ourselves as a profession.
2020-03-31 20:26:22,"I am  physician seeing pts with covid. Hospital administrators are bungling the mgmt, no doubt, but this guy is no hero.  Wearing a mask around a pt with covid (or any other infection) then throughout the rest of your day puts everyone else you see at risk.  Masks are supposed to be discarded, or more likely these days, disinfected after each interaction with a potential covid pt. there are very specific procedures as to how to remove and decontaminate the. 

Some of the physicians in my hospital wear their gear all day, and I stay far far away from them. Because they are putting everyone but themselves at higher risk."
2020-03-31 20:26:24,I left the field of hospital administration in the mid 80’s for these sorts of reasons. In my next lives in the health care system I dealt with them regularly before I retired. It sounds like things are even worse.
2020-03-31 20:28:03,"Until hospital administrators will attend the emergency departments, operating rooms while patients are being intubated and extubated, work alongside patients with Cov 19, I would suggest they have NO say.  
I’m sure if they did, policies would be very different."
2020-03-31 20:31:15,"The CDC clearly doesn't have justifications for either side of the argument - on the one hand, masks aren't needed and on the other, if masks are unavailable, bandanas are ok, even for health workers. I haven't kept track - is there a new CDC Director appointed by Trump?  If so, that would explain the errors, the waffling and the contradictions."
2020-03-31 20:31:20,"I am amazed at the responses from the medical professionals commenting. Not one administrator would ever think of saying anything to me as I round on my patients wearing masks or whatever PPE I thought was appropriate. I established this relationship early on with the administrators at my hospital and they know when it comes to clinical decision making, they are out of their depth."
2020-03-31 20:35:21,"The prime mission of health care is direct patient care; hospital administrators and insurance companies need to get back in their lanes which is support staff for the caregivers, providing whatever is necessary for them to carry out their work. The health care hierarchy is currently flipped upside down, with the mostly non-medically trained administrations making the rules for the cannon-fodder little people (that is, the doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, etc.)"
2020-03-31 20:36:24,"Can we talk about staff nurses? There's more of them, and they don't have anywhere near the power in a hospital that a physician does. I'm worried about everyone, obviously, but the physicians seem to be getting a ton of press and the nurses very little, apart from social media. Can we focus on the nurses a little bit more? They likely have some excellent things to say."
2020-03-31 20:38:43,"Please explain to me the rationale of business people running a hospital and overseeing doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals? Doesn't make rationale sense that doctors themselves would surrender their autonomy to practice medicine to a MBA. Who also sits on the Board of these hospitals - more business people or doctors? Sounds as if marketing managers and business professionals have overstepped their authority at the detriment of healthcare professionals and patient care. Time for an awakening to put back the power of patient care into the hands of healthcare professionals. The healthcare professionals who speak out against the practices that undermine patient safety and care are the true heroes. In the meantime, healthcare professionals unite together in the battle you are fighting and support your colleagues and each other. Your battle should not be with administration now. Your battle is just beginning as you fight for your patients' lives and your own."
2020-03-31 20:43:43,"Can hospitals be that disconnected from reality, to the point that they endanger their most valuable resources and every patient who walks in there?  Or are they just out of their minds?  If this is happening to Doctors, I don't want to imagine how little regard is shown to nurses, aides, etc.  When huge corporations, big pharma  and insurance companies own hospitals, expect more of this to follow."
2020-03-31 20:49:40,"Medical workers have the right to work safe, and we all need to support their refusal to work under unsafe conditions--obviously bad for staff and for patients. Several petitions are circulating on this situation, but we need to start seriously voting our way out of the messy lobbyist-driven medical system that routinely fails patients, obstructs good medical practice, and now, enabled by Trump et al, has helped incapacitate and endanger us in a serious emergency ."
2020-03-31 19:08:20,"Perhaps the administrators should take a walk around the ""public halls"" throughout the hospital and see if they feel comfortable as they pass by coughing people and sick patients without having masks or PPE on -- have them do this for an entire shift, which can last 12 hours. Then the administrators can let us know whether they can ""control their emotions"" about wanting to put on masks around the hospital, given how viciously and quickly the virus seems to spread everywhere. Only then would they understand why doctors (who, by the way, are risking their lives fighting this virus, while the administrators are sitting behind their cushy desks in enclosed office spaces) are being perfectly reasonable and practicing common sense in wearing masks around the hospital."
2020-03-31 20:12:09,"I hope I never have to go to University Medical Center in El Paso. I notice the administrator told the Doc his chances of getting the virus were no better than at Walmart. In other words, there is a chance, but the administrator was willing to take that chance on the doctors life. I hope I never have to go to University Medical Center in El Paso"
2020-03-31 20:48:46,I took my daughter for an MRI at Albany Med last Thurs and was horrified that all staff was not wearing masks when interacting closely with us. If a nurse had treated a asymptomatic patient with Coronavirus a few days earlier she easily could still be asymptomatic and spread it to us. Health care workers are interacting with dozens or more people a day and need be masked at all times. How frustrating and tragic for doctors that ignorant administrators are keeping them from protecting themselves and their patients.
2020-03-31 19:20:46,"Often when a healthcare worker is quoted in articles their name isn't given because they ""are not authorized to speak."" The hospital administrations   desperately and often immorally want to control the message while so many of the healthcare workers desperately want to get the truth out."

After all, it was the state’s lieutenant governor who felt it was fine to sacrifice some lives to get the economy going again.  So what’s the loss of another doctor?

It seems that wherever conservatives lurk, they’re incapable of dealing with coronavirus effectively.  Maybe it’s greed, maybe it’s their warped sense of what freedom means in America.  Maybe it’s why I kiss the ground in the blue state where I live."
2020-03-31 20:50:03,"Rather than a new ""Space Force"" branch of the military Trump should be creating a Health Care Force, modeled on the National Guard.   Just like the National Guard, health care workers will keep their regular health care jobs in their own communities until there is a great need as currently exists.  As we have seen from the current pandemic, the case load is not extreme in all locations simultaneously.  A pandemic rolls across the planet like a wave, peaking in different locations at different times. 
These workers would receive special training and would arrive with the necessary PPE armor to protect themselves and their patients.  
Global trade and international travel are not going to disappear with Covid-19.  Our wonderful and vibrant cities are not going anywhere.   We have had several near misses with pandemics in recent history and should have been better prepared for this one.  There will be another pandemic; it is not a question of ""if"" but rather of ""when""."
2020-03-31 18:31:20,"Yes, these are the words used about us: insubordinate, disruptive - before Covid-19 we were then sanctioned by state medical boards due to some bogus complaint that would follow. Our licenses and reputations ruined for no good reason other than being good doctors."
2020-03-31 19:36:15,"The job of a ""hospital administrator"" is to cover the behind of the hospital, and maximize its profit. The job of a physician is to heal the sick. Unfortunately it includes the ""sick"" administrators as well."

2020-03-31 20:04:38,"I worked in a hospital 7 years; currently for a health conglomerate in non-clinical.  We have suffered medical errors. Two of my neighbors died from negligence.  We use the buddy system, no one ever goes to a provider alone, ever. One year we have pharma advertised on television as a super fix, later we have legal advertisements for the same.  We live in fear of losing insurance, or being hit with astronomical bills. Providers are so stressed we  get either indifferent or arrogant and you question what was the point of the visit.  I manage our healthcare and pay an exorbitant premium for a PPO so I can see the specialists we want, always always question, advocate aggressively and avoid pharma and interventions like the plague.  Most providers hate patients like me. The smart ones respect me and we get along fine. 
Front line medical workers are true heroes and I have immense respect for them because I can’t do what they do. 
Our medical-industrial-profit complex is broken.  Administrators cannot act in the best interest of the public because the #1 priority is profitability or at least solvency. 
Wear a mask and gloves.  Educate yourself and follow protocols as best as you can.  Keep yourself out of the hospital any way you can. 
Front line workers are about to be forced into impossible choices  due to the negligence of elected officials and administrators. God help them.  Individuals are also forced into choices. 
If I get sick I will stay home and beat this or die."
2020-03-31 19:09:05,"Administrators sit in their cushy offices making Million dollar salaries and gamble with Healthcare workers lives. Enough is enough. Doctors on the front lines know what they need to protect themselves. Administrators need to get out of the way or get sued.

N95s should be left  in place all day if only one is given for the day. Taking them off and on after they have been used risks spreading the virus that may be on the outside of the mask to the wearer. Remember, these masks were designed to be used once for high risk procedures and then thrown away when the procedure is over!"
2020-03-31 20:14:23,"The time to think of "" Not panicking the general public, or sending the wrong message to patients, "" by not wearing PPE is wrong and terribly misguided. These administrators had better get on board with protecting the Medical professionals that stand between medical success and absolute chaos as these people fall ill to the same disease that infects their patients. I would be comforted in knowing that not only health care professionals but essential workers were not only being allowed, but being forced by their employers to think about their health first so they can continue to care for us. This mindset of masks being taboo will sicken and kill thousands."
2020-03-31 20:56:37,"Sounds like an administrator making a medical judgment to me.

Seriously though, medical professionals on the front line need to protect themselves, and along with this horrible lack of PPE, that often means putting a mask on at the beginning of their shifts and not removing it until the end. They can't risk their and our lives by removing it to pretend everything is okay while in a public area. Everything is not okay. We know that, and by now we are well aware that we are quite often being fed lies.

It is absolutely imperative that doctors make health decisions, not admins. Thank you Dr. Nikicicz, and all the front line professionals who are there to save us. University Medical Center in El Paso should be publicly shamed, and a few choice administators should be released to join the ever-growing ranks of the unemployed."
2020-03-31 21:02:13,"These are the same administrators who failed to stock sufficient masks, gowns and other PPE. Here in our county, hospitals of the two largest health systems had to ask the county to put out a call for PPE from the general public. This at a time when we had fewer than two dozen confirmed cases of the corona virus in the county. Their actions place critically needed doctors, nurses and technicians at risk when we need them most. Who should be fired?"
2020-03-31 21:02:42,"Hospitals are influenced by their marketing departments —look at the barrage of advertising coming our way. I would love to know what percentage of private for profit hospitals have a no mask policy, compared to public not for profit hospitals. I feel so fortunate to live in a state where our hospitals are not for profit. The rich and the poor use the same hospitals."
2020-03-31 21:07:29,"Suspending a doctor from wearing a mask?  Really?  I'm sure other hospitals will snap him up mask and all.  This is unconscionable.  An argument regarding health safety between doctors and administrators makes no sense.  The doctor should win every time.  If the doctor becomes ill, there will be no one to treat the patients.  If the administrator becomes ill, he will regret suspending a well qualified doctor for trying to protect his own health."
2020-03-31 21:12:51,"Thank you for reporting on this very serious issue impacting￼ thousands of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals.￼ I find it abhorrent that the administrators working from home and completely oblivious to the severity on the front lines￼￼ think that it is their right to dictate when masks should be worn or not. There are healthcare professionals who are worried about losing their jobs over a mask? It’s unbelievable. At a time when everyone’s focus should be on patient care and personal/family safety, they are threatening the very foundation and assets of their hospital. I would like to see how they would come outfitted to the hospital if they actually had to be there.￼￼ 

These doctors and nurses are just trying to stay safe for themselves and their families, as well as their patients. We do not always know when a COVID-19 patient presents to us, much less if they are asymptomatic. If there is a mask available, then it should be worn.￼ Healthcare workers lives are just as important, and none of them signed up to die just so an administrator feels better about their public image. At this point our patients probably expect their doctors to be wearing a mask, and it’s time everyone got used to it.￼"
2020-03-31 21:14:15,"Is it time to investigate the possibility of a Coronavirus cover up? If there are no tests or not enough, the numbers of cases will remain low - our President (and others) like “lower numbers.” Is it possible that test development and distribution was delayed or at the very least NOT expedited by leaders so that numbers would remain artificially low? We still do not have an adequate number of tests in our state to test everyone with symptoms. Anecdotally, I am immune-compromised, in the over/70 age bracket, and called my local hospital and doctors last weekend with symptoms. I was told unless my temp was 102 or above or I was having difficulty breathing I did not meet public health criteria for testing due to very limited numbers of tests available locally."
2020-03-31 21:15:26,"Sounds like a not-too-bright decision by the hospital's  administrators.

Why lay off a critical staff member when you will desperately need every staff member very soon.  Oh, and don't allow staff members to do everything they can in order to stay healthy enough to keep working when the hospital is burdened.

Image over common sense?

Appears this hospital is most likely full of other not-too-bright rules?   Not sounding good for patient outcomes."
2020-03-31 21:18:22,"Patients and the general public are now beginning to see the ruinous effects of profit-based and a capitalist-run health infrastructure.  Doctors, nurses and other clinical staff have been marginalized to having basic employee status and little influence in an environment that was originally designed to prioritize patient care and its best practices.  The vast majority of hospitals are run by business people with no alignment to the mission and purpose for what it is they are responsible.  It's all about image and $$$.  

Now, we clinicians are appreciated only when something goes well for a patient of status, scrutinized in retrospect for anticipated negative outcomes and labeled as ""disruptive"" or ""insubordinate"" when we stand-up for patients and ourselves.  

The day of reckoning is upon us.  Morally, socially, politically or otherwise."

2020-03-31 21:27:47,"What's the scientific basis for ordering MD's not to wear masks?  Maybe they help the wearer, most likely they do protect patients from inadvertent infection by an asymptomatic but infected MD.  In any event shouldn't the matter be left to each individual MD's medical judgment - at least in the absence of a compelling public health reason to not wear masks?"
2020-03-31 21:29:15,"I think the hospital administrators who are enforcing “no mask” policies should be sued for negligence when a physician, nurse, or other worker inevitably gets sick. Many peer-reviewed studies have shown that masks work to slow transmission.

Two bottles of Everclear cost me a total of $70 including shipping."

He is doing a favor to everyone else in the hospital when he wears his mask.  If it keeps him healthy and able to do his job under very uncertain circumstances, he is a hero to me.

If I were using that hospital for any reason, I would be delighted to see the physicians and other health care, custodial and support workers all wearing masks.  The public relations nightmare is the short-sighted administrative ban."
2020-03-31 21:49:55,"""THERES NO MORE WUHAN VIRUS IN THE HALLS AT THE HOSPITAL THAN WALMART.""

I am a physician in New York City. Over the past three weeks I have received many hundreds of e-mails, updates, briefings, policy statements and changes, bulletins and personal communications regarding the Covid-19 medical crisis we are dealing with. Not once have I read, or heard a physician use the term ""Wuhan virus"", Mr. Trump's name for the disease.

The all-caps statement quoted above was texted, not by an administrator but by a ""physician"", the head of anesthesiology at that hospital. This ""doctor's"" use of the term Wuhan virus speaks volumes about his politics and the way that influences his professionalism as well as his understanding of the threat posed by this virus."
2020-03-31 21:55:20,"If I was a patient (or hospital worker) and saw physicians walking around me wearing PPE while I had none, I would assume that I was inside of a hot zone and be upset that I wasn't given the same level of protection. That is the panic that the hospital is trying to avoid. 

If I am on a boat and the captain is wearing a life jacket but won't give me one, should I believe it when told that the boat is safe?"
2020-03-31 22:00:45,"I am a Hospitalist (Internal Medicine) physician.  I had essentially the same story as Dr. Nikicicz.   The hospital's CEO attempted to fire me for wearing (my own N95) mask around the hospital.  My group contracts through the hospital and went to bat for my rights to ""use an overabundance"" of caution.  

This moderately large hospital chain currently still does not allow employed physicians and nurses to wear any kind of masks at the nurses station or for any kind of patient care not involving respiratory issues.  The basis for their decision is very grey guidance from the WHO, an organization which is basing their recommendations not on science, but on worldwide supply.  

As you might guess, their now seems to be an outbreak occurring among hospital nurses, and it's horrible to consider, but likely true, that they are infecting patients who came to the hospital for another reason (non-infected patients).  

To be clear, they don't have a current shortage of masks, they are concerned about a future possible shortage, and are willing to bet staff and patient lives on the theory that asymptomatic people are not contagious and that those staff with symptoms will self report and not come to work.  I can hardly stand watching this foolishness and the toll it will take on patient and staff lives, but the last thing the administration wants to hear is a different opinion from their own."
2020-03-31 22:04:22,"Protective masks are not protective on the outside. If a physician has just seen a COVID patient wearing the mask and goes with the same mask to a public area, that is going to infect those there. Re-use of masks could be one of the biggest problems out there."
2020-03-31 22:04:48,"This sums it all up:

""In recent years, doctors have felt increasingly like employees working for cost-cutting companies putting profit ahead of medicine.""

My husband is dealing with the same - being told masks aren't necessary in the PT clinic. He touches people all day. Administrators and their attendant lawyers need to the get out of the way and let these doctors - who actually understand the science - do what is necessary to protect themselves and their families."
2020-03-31 22:05:33,"A friend at a different hospital has explained her employer's policy--not only are personnel forbidden to wear masks most of the time, but if they contract Covid19, it is listed as ""community  transmission"" since it cannot be proven they contracted it on the job.  Since they didn't get it on the job, they must use their personal sick days (with or without pay, depending on their status), and they cannot claim any work place protections or other OSHA benefits.  Our medical system is too often designed and run by people who are only concerned with maximizing private profit.  Maybe this crisis will wake Americans up to the fact we need to change our health care system.  But it will be hard--even as doctors, nurses, cleaning staff, and other people in the medical labor force sicken or even die, a whole lot of investors and owners will profit from this crisis, and they will not be interested in changing the system."
2020-03-31 22:06:06,"Our hospital's managed by CEO's , they are more concerned about their brands image than their employees health.

2020-03-31 22:12:04,"This is, unfortunately, true where I work as well.  About 14 days ago I was briefly exposed to a family member with symptoms,   The family member could not get tested for COVID due to ""lack of criteria"".  After thr quarantine I was able to return to work in a limited capacity, but  I chose tp wear a mask to protect my patients from me (an outsider, coming into a non-COVID skilled nursing facility) than to protect me from them, who have been quarantined for more than 14 days without symptoms.  As of yesterday, was told that wearing a mask was increasing anxiety among staff and other patients, and to not wear it despite my concerns.

Short sighted, just like everything that has come before."
2020-03-31 22:24:12,"What is an acceptable rate of health care worker infection with Covid-19?  I believe 0%. Not 1%, or 0.1%. - ZERO.  

What is the attitude of most hospital administrators?  Well, it is certainly not zero.  I do believe they feel this is a situation where a lot of the staff is going to have to fall on their sword. 

I have been scolded for wearing a mask in low risk patient encounters.  

A lot of these administrators like playing doctor - they just may get a chance when we decide this is not worth it. 

Doctors, nurses, anyone working in patient care should DEMAND a mask or refuse to work. Relying on screening questions to decide who might have the disease is ridiculous.  Until there is accurate and ubiquitous testing, everyone needs to be treated as if infected."
2020-03-31 22:24:54,"I could care less what administrators say, I wear a surgical mask everywhere in the hospital. If they prefer to do my job without a mask, I will gladly stay home. I am doubtful they will even consider it"
2020-03-31 22:25:16,"Our hospital (major, well-known) was forced to clarify its internal policies and claims when it clearly experienced a pushback from the staff. Yet it still tried to dismiss or minimize the likelihood of infection at the hospital and instead blame it on ""community infection"", by comparing the percentages of infected hospital staff with overall hospital staff.  Which is a ludicrous comparison and argument to use: just because you could have been infected through the ""community"" at roughly the same rate doesn't mean you didn't get it through your work at the hospital, where, as a medical practitioner, you would spend the majority of your time. In fact, if hospital conditions were perfect, versus that of the general public, you shouldn't have any risks or infections at all.

Getting tested for the virus remains as challenging for medical staff as it is for the general public, unless if the person had contact with patients.

It took quite some time to get to the stage where everyone must now wear masks (due to PPE shortage).
Although there is now stricter enforcement as to who can be on the premises (based on actual need), the lack of readily available, inexpensive testing means that continuing access is solely based on a self-attestation; which is worthless if you are asymptomatic and don't know you are sick, since you can't get tested. This is more a result of the nation's continuing problem with equipment than one specific to this or any other hospital."
2020-03-31 22:26:10,"Maybe doctors should tell facilities that do this stuff that if those are the rules, the doctor is just going to leave and not return. End of discussion."
2020-03-31 22:26:32,"Interesting, our hospital took a different approach. EVERYONE must wear masks in public and clinical areas. huh."
2020-03-31 22:30:37,"The local hospital system for which I worked for decades had a problem with the few doctors, nurses, and especially medical students who were slovenly. They wore a mask, shoe protectors, etc  in the OR.At lunch break in the cafeteria they still wore the same garb, with the mask pulled down to allow eating and drinking and socializing. Back to the OR and a new patient, and they didn't change. They just pulled the mask back up. 
Today the norm must change to an abundance of caution, period."
2020-03-31 22:33:05,"Its a conundrum.  Hospitals don't have enough masks, so they decide to deploy them in the highest risk areas (ICUs, emergency departments, etc).  A few employees (whether physicians, nurses, or other) make a reasonable decision to wear masks routinely in their day to day work.  Then the hospital runs out of masks.   It's possible that everyone is working with good intentions but still at odds."
2020-03-31 22:35:37,"This is what happens when a bean counter is in charge. I was in NYP Queens for most of the day repairing their portables with 99.9% of the staff masked with N95's or surgical loops or a combination of both along with eye protection.  Every patient was supplied with surgical loops while some with N95's of their own.

The CDC knew in their earlier guidance that there were not enough masks for the healthcare providers and staff as well as the general public, thus the flip flop now."
2020-03-31 22:39:26,"""Hospitals"" do not fire or suspend doctors. Administrators who do fire Doctors for wearing protective masks, gloves, or other protective wear should be fired with loss of pensions and all benefits.

2020-03-31 20:59:46,"I think hospital administrations demanding doctors not wear masks is indicative of just how ill-trained even physicians are for a highly contagious disease. I suspect many doctors and nurses are foolishly ""John Wayn-ing"" it when it comes to PPEs, all in the nominal name of saving lives. In fact, as many suspeuct, they are probably causing more loss of life.

I think one day of intensive training for administrators and all medical staff on wearing, removing, and disposing of PPEs would save many lives. This would then be accompanied by quality control staff who monitored every move medical staff make with patients.

So it seems to me from the cheap seats, far from New York.

throwing their colleagues under the bus.  They are being exposed and will likely be dealt with harshly when this is over.  Shame on them!"
2020-03-31 19:01:38,The administrators are most likely republicans and trump supporters that bought into and helped perpetuate all the misinformation and lies about this crisis. What will it take to get them to acknowledge that they were wrong? Deaths of doctors and nurses?
2020-03-31 19:07:06,"Look, if the federal government would declare face masks essential protection, these hospitals would not be able to hide behind these absurd guidelines set by our commander in chief.

2020-03-31 19:50:55,"My brother is an ER doctor at a major hospital, and here's the deal.  The hospital was incompetent (like the government) in having a stockpile of masks.  When they saw Wuhan, then Korea, then Italy, they should have immediately put all efforts into sourcing masks.  But like Trump and because of hospital bureaucracy, they delayed and are now frantically searching for masks.

The hospitals don't want to look bad, so they are rationing masks and administrators (knowing nothing about science or medicien) are telling doctors when and how to use (and reuse) masks.

Also, Customs and the FDA is ridiculous.  You have KN95 masks (China standard) that are the exact same as N95 masks (US standard).  But because they went through a different certification standard, millions are being held up in US customs.  Make an exception!!! Allow them in."

Call me cynical, but I know this is a nation of penny-pinchers."
2020-03-31 21:50:17,"My wife, an ER physician was reprimanded for wearing her own PPE in the hospital. Her colleagues at the University Hospital have faced similar scrutiny. 

According to the memos the reprimands are because wearing masks in public scares patients.... I at first thought of this as some sick joke. Patients and people should be scared and not come to the ER unless they are truly ill. Otherwise they should visible see the risk of exposing oneself to COVID-19. My wife is scared as most medical staff are, but she is highly trained and a rockstar at her job. 

She has had to fight management to try to obtain access to the hospital's cache of PPE with every single C-suite and VP putting up road block after block. She has championed for the other doctors, nurses, Admitting Staff, techs, even security guards in hope they can have full access and wear PPE freely. However it is almost as big of a battle with upper management as it is with the Virus itself. 

Fortunately we had a decent PPE supply  (n95, respirator masks, filters) on hand in our household due to my never ending love of home projects. 

TN COVID-19 count as I type this comment is 2,389; 23 deaths."

It makes sense that you don't wear PPE in areas that are presumed to be safe.  If I need to be wearing a respirator and you aren't, one of us is in the wrong location.  If the hallway is truly dangerous, than the hospital would be negligent in letting people in the hall without the proper PPE."
2020-03-31 21:32:57,"This happened and will continue to happen for as long as hospitals and the administrators that represent them make decisions with impunity.

2020-03-31 19:26:26,"Hospitals are incredibly powerful institutions, as Governor Cuomo noted this morning. They make the rules and along with the ""healthcare"" industry spend more money lobbying Congress than the military. 

Then with their unlimited power they price-gouge naked patients with Covid-19 gasping for their last breath; they force doctors and nurses to work without personal protective gear; then they fire people who complain.

After this epidemic is over, the government needs to rein in the hospital industry which has grown arrogant and patronizing toward patients, doctors, and governors alike. First, no more price-gouging. Second, they should be governed like utilities; no more shutting down rural hospitals just because they want to make more profit in the city. Just, nope, no more. They should be non-profits and public, not just in words, but in accounting. Fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh ... They need to be told whose boss and it's not them. It's us patients and our government. 

Vote Democrat in November and take back control over these rapacious, profit-driven, ""healthcare"" institutions. Republicans believe neither in government nor in rules. The healthcare industry has gotten away with murder because of the absence of rules. Republicans just kiss the rings of the CFOs, get their campaign contributions, and amplify doctors' and patients' misery. Enough."

2020-03-31 19:56:06,I am a physician. The US healthcare system is top heavy in administration. Professional judgement falls to marketing and Press Ganey scores. They are the problem. Not the solution.

Of course healthcare staff are questioning the judgement, integrity, and motives of the people who are issuing the guidance. They are not stupid. Hospitals better be careful how they treat their employees in this pandemic. The ongoing shortage of PPE, the surging number of cases, and the increasing numbers of infected healthcare personnel do not allow them the ability to trample on their employees."
2020-03-31 20:31:29,"Shame! 

Hospital administrators are clueless about what scares the public. Spoiler Alert! It's not masks on doctors.

Medical personel are highly trained professionals who know what is best for their own bodies.

If administrators really don't want to scare the public, they should put a hard focus on making hospital services pricing transparent. 

Multiple layers of opaque pricing
that depends on who you are, who you know, where you live, where you access services and what insurance company you're stuck with is what really scares  American families."

2020-03-31 19:21:26,"Good on Dr. Nikicicz for standing his ground.  It’s way past time administrators got their comeuppance.
I worked forty years as a nurse in the hospital system, twenty years of that in the ‘corporate’ system. Over that time ‘administrators’ became increasingly enforcers of a system that looks at medicine as a product to sell to ‘clients’, thus the need for image’ and advertising. Employees are expected to promote the hospital ‘brand’ and if they do not follow the rules they will be punished.  Sickening.  So glad I am retired from this abusive system."

2020-03-31 20:10:06,"The risk for asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 is a known risk and these policies dramatically reduce the risk and protect both the staff and patients.  It is obvious that the use of masks for health care workers should be mandatory during the COVID-19 outbreak, not only to prevent infectious spread but to reduce the need to quarantine staff.  The CDC has stated that if a health care worker has either casual or direct contact with a COVID-19 infected person that they do not need to be placed into quarantine for 2 weeks.  However, if a health care worker unknowingly has contact with either a patient or coworker that has been infected, they will not be able to work for at least 2 weeks.

It is only a smart policy to protect the integrity of the health care work force to mandate that masks need to be worn even if the risk early on was low for exposure.  It only takes one infected person to come in contact with multiple staff (doctors, nurses, etc) to cause a major disruption in the ability to staff the health care team.  It is disappointing that hospital administrators were unable to understand the larger picture and the rapid direction that this disease is heading.  Their number one responsibility is to protect their staff and to have adequate numbers of staff to care for patients.

2020-03-31 20:25:14,"Pretty much all hospitals and medical industry parts are run by lawyers, money grubbers some of whom have an MD after their name.

What if a nurse is asymptomatic but spreading? Having them wear masks prevents secondary infections.

OF COURSE all medical personnel should be wearing masks at all times to protect themselves and the public, in the hallways and treatment rooms. What are these administrators thinking? Everyone SHOULD be scared out of their minds. I believe the doctor should put tape around the N95 and then a surgical mask over that to keep the N95 clean and re-use it as much as possible. The public should be wearing masks as well (as in China); some mask is better than no mask! The same bureaucratic FDA and CDC  a....s charged with keeping the public safe  are now giving advice contrary to commonsense to cover up their lack of preparation in this disaster.

2020-03-31 21:18:44,"The way to tamp down fear is to offer maximum protection against transmission of the virus. It is astounding that some hospitals would rather remove critically needed medical staff -- doctors caring directly for covid patients -- than to deviate from the completely baseless myth that masks (a) scare people; (b) are useless in stopping transmission. If universal wearing of masks were mandated as they have been in many countries (that successfully brought down their transmission rate), maybe hospitals wouldnt now be so overwhelmed with cases.

You walk in with a broken leg, carried in with a heart attack otherwise virus free and leave in a coffin or sick with the flu.

But if they tried they would have to fire me.  *Nothing* will stop me from coming in every day to care for my patients.  And *nothing* will stop me from taking the precautions that I judge prudent.

Hospitals are desperately trying to design protocols to save as many lives as possible.  A doctor taking a break isn't as high a priority for PPE as a doctor in the emergency room serving heart attack victims.  Tough choices are being made and some managers may not be communicating those tough choices very well, but someone had to make them.  Throwing accusations at those making these choices is wrong.
Hospitals need funds to compete in the PPE market that Trump has thrown every hospital purchasing agent into.
The circumstances can lead some bad managers to make bad decisions and even more bad communicators to explain the choices badly, and you can bet, out there somewhere are some crooked managers selling supplies for profit to other hospitals.  It won't be many but you can bet they are out there.
The FBI should be hunting bad players down.  Both buyers and sellers.

Knowing this, most large academic medical institutions (Harvard/Mass General, UCSF, U. of Chicago, NYU, etc) have instituted universal masking policies.  The asymptomatic transmission rate is between 20-50%, and while asymptomatic carriers are only about 1/2 as infectious as symptomatic carriers, there are twice as many of them.  Social distancing is not feasible in a hospital environment, so by definition physicians, nurses and staff should all be wearing masks.  Without them elderly hospitalized patients are at risk for asymptomatic transmission from staff (and vice-versa).  It’s astounding that hospital administrators cannot grasp this very simple concept.

(Everyone should be wearing paper surgical masks when they’re out around others.) Hospital staff ALL need at least N95’s, for all contact with people suspected of having COVID (which in my ER right now is literally everyone). If hospital administration is not going to help me protect myself (which it’s not, they are only allowing the proper PPE when doing an “aerosol-generating procedure” like intubating), then it AT THE VERY LEAST needs to Get.

2020-03-31 21:33:17,"“UR WEARING IT DOWN A PUBLIC HALL. THERES NO MORE WUHAN VIRUS IN THE HALLS AT THE HOSPITAL THAN WALMART. MAYBE LESS.”

The ""chief"" anesthesiologist who wrote this text should be fired for a) overt racism, b) spreading a lie (hospitals are far more likely than Walmart to contain people with the coronavirus) and c) ignoring the concerns of at risk employees during a global health emergency.

The reality is that all humans should be wearing surgical masks while out in public right now, especially healthcare providers. If the concern is over scaring the public, well, they should be scared!"
2020-03-31 23:58:01,"Given a bag of ""PPE"" at the beginning of their shift, a close relative working in a Chicago area ER, has to go to the nursing supervisor and plead their case if more is needed.  They previously tested positive for Covid but are now back at work after some asymptomatic days.  We are sacrificing the front line of protection and care provided by the healthcare workforce, not just MDs, RNs, APNs but also the person who cleans the room and cooks the meals.  How could anyone ask them to continually put their lives at serious risk without first doing everything humanly possible and bringing to bear the full force of federal government  to protect them.  It seems our country is willing to sacrifice precious lives on the petty altar of ideology and ego."
2020-03-31 23:59:18,"The trend is moving rapidly towards wearing masks in public spaces - for everyone. I hope those hospital administrators have the character to say to their staffs ""We were wrong."""
2020-04-01 00:03:00,"I practiced for over thirty years and can attest to the rarity of hospital administrators who are sufficiently savvy about medicine. Their ignorance comes to the fore when a crisis involving infections hits. I once had to put up with flies in the operating room and recovery room of my hospital. The administration had done nothing for weeks. When I cancelled my surgical cases, and urged my colleagues to do the same, all of a sudden they showed interest. The administrator had to be shown where the operating rooms were. I'm not in the least surprised at the abuse of this anesthesiologist, having seen similar situations in my day."
2020-03-31 23:43:46,"IMO, forbid people to protect themselves from harm ,virus or otherwise , is abuse of power and should be punished."
2020-03-31 23:41:26,"Doctors and nurses should be able to protect themselves from the covid19 virus whether working in a patient room, an operation room or riding a public elevator in the hospital. Shame on the Cleveland Clinic, a well-regarded institution, for not allowing their personnel to take these precautions. Haven’t enough doctors and nurses and other hospital workers been infected, some leading to deaths? We need them more than the hospital’s need outdated policies that don’t protect the health of their staff. Keep speaking out medical workers. Americans need to hear the truth."
2020-04-01 00:09:09,"Medical purism lasts until the hospital goes under. The fact is that few doctors, nurses, lawyers, or accountants are professional managers, and when such individuals are passed the reins, most of them provide terrible leadership. This is because they wing it, and have no management education, and have never practiced management, and don't understand what it is, let alone want it.  People who choose to work in hospitals are naturally exposed to a multitude of risks, not just COVID, because they are in frequent contact with ill patients. And that's life. A balance always has to be struck between what a particular medical professional deems best and what makes sense for the community. Medical administrators may err, but they are not unsophisticated, inexperienced, or uneducated. Quite the opposite. This is a fluid situation and as the article indicates, hospitals will make changes as they deem fit. Meanwhile, just because you're an MD or RN, that does not mean you somehow have a monopoly on the truth."

2020-03-31 23:22:45,"I am a pulmonary critical care fellow in a hospital in nyc. The idea that admin can try to tell us, the critical care , ER or anesthesia physicians what we should be wearing around the hospital is sickening. These 3 specialities are more than any other the ones in the trenches with these patients. Literally in their faces, phlegm, mucous, breath and all. If an admin wants to tell me to not wear N95/surgical mask/face shield at all times around the hospital then I invite them to emergently intubate the next gasping, blue COVID patient I am called to help. This event is a catastrophe. Period. It requires a radical change of thinking at all levels of the healthcare system. When the wave finally comes to these hospitals mentioned in this article I hope to God that these admin change their attitude, as it seems to have changed in NYC thankfully"
2020-03-31 23:26:10,"The American Academy of Emergency Medicine (AAEM - The professional association of ER doctor's) has this to say:
""AAEM believes that emergency physicians are entitled to wear self-supplied PPE including respirators that meet NIOSH standards when, in their medical opinion, hospital or healthcare facility supplied PPE is inadequate.

AAEM will offer support to any emergency physician threatened or terminated for attempting to protect themselves and their patients in this manner. This includes assistance with filing an OSHA complaint and pursuit of litigation for wrongful termination.""

What a time we live in where medical professionals, trying to protect themselves and their patients from illness, are threatened, lied to, and in some cases, fired, for doing what their decades of training have taught them to do.

The beancounters upstairs in their offices with HEPA filtration air and ""emergency supplies"" of N95S by the closet-full, or who are protected behind emails, memos, faceless all-powerful committees, or telecommuting should be ashamed. The day these so-called ""leaders"" - read Administrators - brave the front lines in the ER, ICU, or urgent care clinic and actually have to make life-or-death decisions that matter, they can tell the doctors what to do. 

Until then, let the doctors do what they do best - take care of patients. The best way to do that is for them to avoid becoming patients themselves."

2020-04-01 00:17:41,"On the contrary, were I to go into a hospital today, I would WANT to see all the doctors and other healthcare workers in masks.  If they weren’t wearing them, I would worry that they could give people the virus."
2020-03-31 22:18:27,"Fellow doctors, and especially those who will completing residencies and fellowships and signing contracts in June - REFUSE to sign noncompete agreements. Just REFUSE. If all (or even most) doctors refused to sign noncompete agreements, we would all be impervious to the evil machinations of hospital administrators, their Human Resources and PR lackeys. When some hack administrator threatens to discipline or terminate you for using your medical judgment to do the best for your patients, it’s hard not to cave into their demands when they’re holding a noncompete clause over your head. When upholding your principles means getting fired and being unable to work in your community, you might as well have never have gone to medical school. 

As pathetic as our national gov’t is in this crisis, our obscenely greedy hospital administrators and insurance company executives are to blame for their grinding focus on cost cutting that has driven medication, PPE and technology manufacturing overseas. 

Why don’t you have PPE? Because your corporate overseer wouldn’t spend an extra 5 cents to buy it from an American manufacturer. Why doesn’t your patient have a ventilator? Ditto. 

Let’s use this terrible crisis to retake the reins of our profession."

2020-03-31 22:17:14,"As an emergency physician about to head into my COVID tent shift, I must say that the elephant in the room is not just the mask but the entire PPE guidelines. After they figured out what they were dealing with, Asian healthcare worker (HCW) infections have been reportedly very rare due to their strict PPE and donning/doffing guidelines. In contrast- Italian HCWs, who use the same PPE guidelines we do, continue to rack up over 500 infections a day. (Totaling over 8000 last time I checked before it was removed from the gimbe.org Italian official tally website.)

Our HCWs around the country like me are being sent like sacrificial lambs to a russian-roulette slaughter because we assume requiring full-body Tyvek suits for the entire country is not realistic. Really? Why don’t we try? Our citizens and businesses can do amazing things when called upon, but the need must be made clear. Meanwhile, the Google subsidiary has hoarded all the Tyvek suits on the market for their very strict PPE at their drive-up testing sites. The greeters at the Google sites who meet the cars (with windows rolled up!) have the PPE I wear to see infected patients in the ER. The swabbers wear full-body biohazard seam-taped Tyvek 600 coveralls. Do you think Google knows something that we don’t? 

It’s not about the mask.
It’s about all the PPE. 
Get us the right PPE. 
All of it."
2020-04-01 00:25:49,As a patient I would feel safer and more confident in a hospital or clinic if all personnel wore masks. It signals that they care for us and don’t want us to be sick.
2020-03-31 23:14:14,"Administrators should listen to providers on the frontline.  The decisions administrators make are from a position of personal safety.  They are not risking their lives or those of their families by doing their job. Their primary motives are not the same as physicians or nurses and other direct patient facing workers.  Marketing should not be your first objective in times of crisis.  You're afraid of letting people know your facility has sick people?! Let providers wear whatever protective equipment they feel necessary and can find. In a crisis do you really care what they're wearing?! What an astonishingly selfish and short-sighted approach.I am the spouse of a physician. For me, a 14 day quarantine restarts itself every day he comes home from work. We're both over 60. Every day, I live with the fear he will get sick. The least administrators can do is let him wear PPE whenever and wherever he chooses."
2020-04-01 00:31:12,"The entire argument about masks is completely wrong-headed.

It's not about (standard surgical) masks protecting the wearer, and in that sense, this story is highlighting the wrong reason people should ware masks. 
Surgical masks are not designed to protect the person from infection, but to protect the surgical field, or in the case of an easily transmissible infectious agent, protect others from the person wearing a mask. The pretty poor protection a surgical masks (in contrast to N95 masks) provides to bearer is too easily eliminated by the increased tendency of fiddling with it, bringing hands near the face, the worst thing to do in a contaminated environment.
The principle reason health care providers SHOULD ware masks is that they are at prime risk of being INFECTED because of what they have to do, so protecting patients and others FROM them is a very good idea. Remember, according to the CDC (as of today) 25% of infectious people are asymptomatic.
Certainly an argument in favor of widespread mask use to break transmission - it would help if we had more of them and did not have to ration them."
2020-04-01 00:33:02,"Since childhood I’ve always followed the doctor’s orders.  And so far, they’ve always worked.  The last thing you want at a time like this is some administrator interfering with the medical staff as they work to keep us healthy, to save our lives.  Listen to the doctors and nurses, they know what’s going on.  The administrator doesn’t."
2020-04-01 00:34:24,The US healthcare system has layer upon layer of administration with zip in added value. The titles they give themselves would have one believe they are indispensable to a functioning system. Know who hires administrators? Mostly other administrators.
2020-04-01 00:34:46,"That's the problem with American healthcare, business modeling takes priority over safe practice.  If the hospital had even been paying attention for the past week, it would have known that masks have been recommended, when available, for as many people as possible to prevent asymptomatic infected people from shedding virus to others.  The doctors will eventually band together and put administrators in their place when they act this way because the hospitals cannot function without them, especially in the middle of a pandemic."

Our front line hospital, clinic, ambulance, emt guys, firefighters, bus and taxi drivers, grocery/pharmacy store, food delivery and *any other frontline face-to-face hands-on people* are the TrueHeroes Of The Year - potentially, Of The Decade."

Little local not-for-profit hospital here requiring all staff to mask at all times.
Hospital owned OB group is spreading out prenatal visits and having women check their BP at home after 36 weeks and doing phone checks to keep them out of office as much as possible.
However, the privately-owned, for private, internal med group with many elderly pts is not cancelling non-urgent visits
Corporatized medicine is better than socialized how?
How DARE these administrators countermand any measures the health care providers feel necessary for self protection, ESP those at higher risk, but ANYONE'S personal risk evaluation. And these providers have families at risk because of their jobs, too. 
Let administrators work themselves to exhaustion while sharing the same level of risk. Let them earn their overpaid salaries.

 They should be kissing your feet in appreciation..from a distance, of course. 
Thank you for being there at all and working so desperately to help others."
2020-04-01 00:41:07,"If there is one small good thing that will come from this horrible time, is the exposure of healthcare administrators as all emperors with no clothes, filled with meetings, spreadsheets and dictates - but no power to do the ONE thing that hospitals should exist for: patient care.

But this crisis has exposed American hospitals as primarily profit takers and business centers, they are not for patient care.  If a few thousand hospital administrators in this country are forced to get real jobs in exchange for doctors and nurses proper PPE and appropriate resources for patient care, then that is a small price to pay indeed.

Other commenters have said it best: not a single hospital administrator to be found within a thousand feet of a patient!"
2020-04-01 00:41:52,Like everything else this is a political issue. Many MDs especially the highly paid specialists support the GOP and therefore its false narrative about the virus. Likely hospital admins fall into the GOP group and support this narrative.
2020-04-01 00:45:22,"The conflicts described here between medical professionals  and hospital administrators darkly illuminate how corporate governance, ownership and control of American hospitals runs counter to public health.  I pray that this pandemic and the human misery it brings will at least usher in a massive fundamental reorganization of this inadequate, expensive and inequitable US health system."
2020-04-01 00:46:53,"Hospital administrators are juggling a lot of different interests.  I think that employee safety is lower on that list than ""resource management"".  They defend themselves by talking about the ""bigger picture"". Unfortunately their ""big picture"" doesn't include individuals working in their facility."
2020-04-01 00:47:07,"As an MD at a major academic teaching hospital, i honestly feel our institution has acted thoughtfully and appropriately. But, the tsunami of stories from around the US of small-minded, out of touch and frankly greedy administrators is appalling. One fallout of this COIVD-19 crisis I hope to see is a complete overhaul of how American hospitals are managed. For too long, non-MDs/RNs have dictated how we practice medicine. One saving grace of all of these administrators' emails and reprimands - they are forever saved and will be used as evidence to their crimes."
2020-04-01 00:47:41,"This is why hospitals should not be allowed to employ physicians.  Hospitals are about profits, not quality, evidence-based medical care."
2020-04-01 00:51:26,"I work at a pediatric teaching hospital and this week the hospital instituted universal masking in patient care areas. Also, mandatory screening of all staff and visitors.

2020-04-01 00:54:37,"Unfortunately, as I'm told by a friend in Bellingham, the only hospital there (not sure if its Peacehealth) can only run five COVID-19 tests a day for the 120K plus people in the country. Not surprising, since they're firing their doctors. Its hard to believe that this was even considered a first world country once."
2020-04-01 00:59:04,"Preposterous to have concerns for anything other than life savings supplies, protective equipment, and maintaining a healthy and willing staff.  Those things are vital right now. In a pandemic administrators are a dime a dozen."
2020-04-01 01:01:12,"If I was a doctor told to not wear a mask, I'd be absolutely certain to make many, many face-to-face maskless visits each day to the administrators giving me such an order. And during each interaction, I'd momentarily forget to stand farther away than six feet."
2020-04-01 01:02:25,"Don't people know how to prioritize anymore?

Or is this a case of business administrators telling doctors and clinical staff what to do because to many of the people on the business side of health care, the two most important priorities are image and finance.

I taught at an academic medical for 3 decades and saw the shift from doctors largely being in charge of how hospitals function to more MBAs and business majors being given more power and holding higher positions in the hospital organizational chart.  As a student once commented: ""To bad these business administrators never had a course in microbiology, pharmacology, and infectious medicine.""

The transformation was well underway in the 1980s when Reagan and the business model were touted as superior and soon superimposed on the public sector, where the values of business (profit, market share, image, and maximizing income while minimizing operational costs; also pleasing investors) became clearly at odds with the values of health care and medicine of serving medical and public health needs and doing no harm.

Another student told our class when he worked as a respiratory therapist, he worked at a hospital in Seattle where every administrator had a degree in some clinical health care specialization or an MD degree.  

He noted there were far fewer problems in communication, and you didn't need to explain infection control to someone who was more concerned with budgets, image, and career promotions."
2020-04-01 01:04:56,So let's see.. 1. I guess the hospitals do not really need so many doctors and nurses. Good to know. 2. It seems that you can't catch the virus from people in the halls. Good to know. 3. It also appears that the administrators have not been listening to what the EXPERTS have been telling people. I'm guessing that administrators have no medical training.
2020-04-01 01:05:10,"I think any medical worker should be allowed to wear whatever they think will keep them safe. No one really knows all the ways this awful virus is being spread, so we should be protecting our most precious resource, our health care workers. Here's an idea - let's have the people who are not allowing masks shadow a doctor or a nurse throughout their whole 16 hour shift, and then see how they feel about it."
2020-04-01 01:05:37,"To mask, or not to mask.

Let’s hope not."
2020-04-01 01:10:49,"It’s worth noting that Dr. Jim Merlino, the administrator quoted from the Cleveland Clinic who seems to be driving this inane policy that endangers patients and doctors lives, is a recent hire.  Prior to December 1, 2019 he was an executive at Press-Ganey, a healthcare marketing and consulting company.  I’m truly shocked that an institution like the Cleveland Clinic would rely on marketing administrators  to make key medical decisions that affect patients and doctors health. He - and any other administrator who supports this dangerous policy - should be fired.  I’m sure they can pick up a good marketing position  out there."
2020-04-01 01:15:22,It's the hospital administrators who need to be fired. They do little other than thoughtlessly follow corporate policy which is at odds with medical practice and unnecessarily interpose themselves - adding to the cost but not the value of treatment.
2020-04-01 01:16:02,"Unfortunately, the CDC has contributed to this mass confusion/delusion among hospital administrators and health professionals by contradicting themselves over and over. A bandana is not PPE, but can be used when nothing else is available. OK, so the health professionals are conscripted soldiers who may die of this disease without being given a choice? Dear lord, the CDC needs to get a standard policy regarding masking in place, and it must be grounded in science, not making up for shortcomings in the national PPE stockpile which have been severely limited by political decisions. The CDC should not be a political appendage, but unfortunately they have become one and have led to grave consequences for our healthcare professionals personal well-being. Shame on them for enabling this mass chaos."
2020-04-01 01:23:16,"Physician here. This is the logical endgame when there are 10 administrators for every practicing doctor in a health care system. When mail-order MBAs dictate hospital policy during a pandemic, it should come as no surprise that tensions arise and questionable institutional decisions are made. When the proverbial COVID-19 dust settles, my hope is that there is a national reckoning, and at least some autonomy is stripped from the health care industrial complex and returned to physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals on the front-lines of medicine."
2020-04-01 01:23:46,Direct caregiver  ICU RN here. Our director of nursing working “remotely” says a lot about what is being communicated to front line caregivers versus Feds telling us what to do and how to protect ourselves and families. To hear Dr Birx lying about the availability of testing was especially depressing as are Trumps daily statistics about his ratings and “unbelievable “ numbers (including anticipated deaths!) I feel we are viewed as expendable.
2020-03-31 21:49:55,"So we’re talking about a bunch of overpaid hospital administrators who have essentially no medical knowledge or experience telling doctors on the front lines to place themselves at greater risk in order to make their hospital look good. Oh, and most of these administrators are “working from home,” too afraid to help shoulder the load, willing to sacrifice a doctor or two for their hospital’s image. I am currently home with fever, chills, cough, and other signs of Covid 19. And I spent the day trying to get tested, but with no luck. My HR department is charging my paid time off to punish me for being unwilling to work sick or to possibly infect vulnerable patients. Money and greed are placing doctors and nurses in harm’s way, while administrators dictate policy and hide. If I were either of the doctors cited in this report, I would have walked out of the hospital and opened my mouth so that people far and wide will know what’s going on. When my chance comes I will do so without compunction. Doctors have sworn an oath to care for the sick, but they do not swear to follow the dictates of some MBA who faints when his / her blood is drawn. The CDC is lost, just as we all are, in this pandemic. Their suggestions seem to change daily, and their recommendations are only that ...... recommendations. It’s every man fo himself on this new frontier, and medical professionals have to do what’s right for their own protection. Dead doctors are not good at patient care."

2020-03-31 19:28:19,There is so much to be enraged about and this is one more. My gut is closing in on over load. We don’t have a single coordinated effort at the highest level. We have our front line health care providers in harm’s way and there is no visible urgency to remedy this situation. Incompetence or a plot to weed out the weak and the poor? A breaking point is coming. What a ship of fools.

2020-04-01 00:12:01,"According to NPR, Dr. Nikicicz was hired through some kind of staffing agency. And another doctor, Dr. Ming Lin was taken off the rotation at the PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center in Washington after he blew the whistle on the lack of PPE.

So is that what's happening throughout the healthcare system — life-saving professionals are temps because hospitals want just-in-time masks and just-in-time doctors in order to wring out that extra bit of profit for their CEOs who are sitting pretty in Florida while directing their mid-level henchmen to lord over doctors/surgeons/nurses et al.?

Of course, I'm not happy about Covid-19 but I'm grateful that the greed and dysfunction of our for-profit hospital business is more widely exposed.

2020-04-01 01:35:00,"What about the right of the health care workers to protect their own life? Who would choose to go to a hospital that lets politics in the way of hygiene and science, once this crisis is over?
If hospitals in the southern US state are in denial then it’s going to be tough for them when more and more doctors fall sick. They may have an avalanche of patients coming to hospitals and not many doctors to treat them."
2020-04-01 01:35:38,"Seriously? We are all scared.  50% of people I see on the streets are wearing masks. Not 95s but masks none the less. We've all read the news and know that healthcare professionals are not in a position to practice their profession and social distancing. We need these professionals. Those of us without medical experience are relying on them to save us, or our loved ones if it comes to that and we are putting them further at risk?

Honestly, I'd be more scared of a healthcare professional without a mask knowing they care for and come in close contact with these patients. Its as much for my protection as it is for theirs.

So disappointed that we are not doing more to protect and value these invaluable healthcare workers."

2020-04-01 01:35:46,Hospital administrators are a lot more easily replaced than clinicians. Period.
2020-04-01 01:39:09,I understand that these hospitals are in sad shape. And I understand why and don’t hold it against them. What angers me is that things like this are being done to maintain an image. But what these petit functionaries in management are showing me is their character. And their character tells me that their image is more important than patients and their staff. That is not a good image.
2020-04-01 01:41:42,Single Payer; Medicare for all. Are we ready now?
2020-04-01 01:44:46,"Delighted that the anesthesiologist in El Paso has been reinstated and is wearing a mask at all times.  Glad that other doctors have won their fights, too.

If supplies permit, hospital medical professionals who are treating patients should be permitted or required to wear masks in both treatment or common areas.  This is necessary to minimize CoViD transmission.

Medical personnel with underlying risk factors should always be protected."
2020-04-01 01:46:17,"First do no harm.  And then remind me why you want a doctor, who may or may not have coronavirus, breathing all over me in a hospital setting. A mask should be a requirement, not an option. Put a mask on.  And do.no.harm."
2020-04-01 01:48:41,"At every hospital I've ever worked at, it was an absolute no-no to wear any type of isolation gear outside of a patient room. The sole exception was wearing a light surgical mask when coming to work while sick, and yes, we are expected to come to work while sick. However, these are not normal times. If I were in a hospital now, I would want a mask on all the time! And I hate wearing them! I understand that in some hard hit hospitals, RN's and RT's are wearing the same gear for a full shift, and never removing it even while going from patient to patient- something that would have been considered completely unacceptable just a couple of weeks ago.

It's been my experience over the last 15 years or so that hospital administrators (who never seem to be medical professionals) are increasingly out of touch with the concept of providing health care and increasingly in touch with maximizing their own personal financial gain."
2020-04-01 01:48:53,"Why use FRIGHTENED in the title? Health care providers are acting out of knowledge, out of precaution, out of safety for themselves and others. It is our for-profit health care systems that demand that they see patients at all cost...putting them at risk AND moreover providers at risk. If you want health care providers to do their job and live by the oaths they take and the honor the trust the public has in them...then leaders of healthcare institutions needs to start SPEAKING THE TRUTH and saying what they mean and DOING what they mean...and stop the double speak.

History will judge them."
2020-04-01 01:49:34,"What’s exactly wrong with wearing a mask? Does it really signify danger or antisocial tendencies? On a separate note, why are Asians in America being shunned, spit on, or even attacked for wearing face masks?
When I was a child in an Asian country, we always wore masks in winter. They protected us from cold air, pollution (worse during wintertime) and whatever germs (preventing us from touching our faces). Back then we only had masks made from white gauze or cotton, but later I learned that face masks had become part of the wintertime fashion. Now there are all colors and designs to go with your outfits.
One suggestion to Americans, especially to the elderly: we should make it normal to wear masks on the streets in America, even after covid 19. That way a lot of deaths from the standard flu would be avoided."
2020-04-01 01:52:28,"Thank you to all the brave professionals out there tonight.  There is a pit in my stomach knowing we will likely see a number, if not a list of names, of all the medical professionals we will ultimately lose to this virus.  Because our ""rich"" country can't afford basic protections.  It's infuriating."
2020-04-01 01:54:47,"Seriously? We are all scared.  50% of people I see on the streets are wearing masks. Not 95s but masks none the less.

Not to mention, maybe if people see doctors with masks they will understand the gravity of the situation seriously, and practice appropriate social distancing rather than run right past you with two inches to spare when they could put 6 feet in between you and them so that maybe we can get the numbers down to less than hundreds of thousands of dead. 

Are we really so callous that we'd rather put perception ahead of thousands upon thousands of lost loved ones, friends and family and a world without doctors, nurses, nursing home or other healthcare aids?"
2020-04-01 01:56:21,"Hospitals are the place where germs are in residence.  The goal has always been to get patients out of the hospital because the longer they are there the more likely the risk of contracting something they didn't come in with.

Hospital administrators are focused on the bottom line, always.  They report to the board, not to the employees.  Definitely not to the employees.

It absolutely boggles the mind that any administration, right now, today would say not to wear a mask because, why?  To adhere to a rule that is in no way applicable to this virus, this pandemic?  When we need our health care providers to stay healthy.  

It is unconscionable that the administrators who very seldom if ever go to the floors where the patients are, and certainly not now, would force these health care providers to take the masks off."
2020-03-31 19:11:57,"So sad about this great nation! Even great american doctors are fighting about whether to wear masks within hospitals and public area. Any ordinary man who has a little bit common sense should know COVID-19 causing respiratory disease and transmitting through aerosol. There are so many asymptomatic virus carriers. Wearing mask to prevent virus spreading in public and others you may contact is basic logic thinking. I do not understand why the government of this great nation, especially general surgeon of the great American told everyone not to wear face mask! How many American people they want to kill? If you do not have enough face mask, tell the truth, do not lie, do your job to manufacture them! Tell American people do not wear face mask during this pandemic is the government's excuse to be lazy and incompetent."
2020-04-01 01:59:05,"doctors must must must put their lives on the line, making decisions about the best interests of others day and night, but they may not make such decisions for themselves in case it contravenes hospital administrators, who are safely tucked away in the board rooms.

give me a break. leave the docs and nurses alone, you pencil pushers, they do know what is needed."
2020-04-01 01:59:09,"Physicians deserve to be respected for their scientific knowledge and clinical judgment.  An individual physician is best able to decide whether it makes sense for him/her to wear a mask in a public area of a hospital.  If he/she is concerned about a recent exposure that implies a risk of being an asymptomatic carrier of the coronavirus, his/her wearing a surgical mask reduces the risk of his/her transmitting the infection to others.  If he/she is especially at risk for severe illness in case of infection, and if there have been numerous recent cases among staff and visitors, his/her wearing an N95 mask might be reasonable for self-protection.  In any case, the judgment should be the physician's alone to make, and it should respected. Medicine is a learned profession, and physicians are far more than ""healthcare providers"".  When I graduated from medical school over forty years ago I could never have imagined the dystopian future of my vocation."
2020-04-01 02:06:16,"This is rich: hospital administrators firing doctors and (no doubt) other front line staff during a pandemic.

In a week, they will be begging these brave workers to come back as their hospitals are overwhelmed. Somehow, I don’t think overpaid administrators will be in similar demand.

Overbearing and penny pinching management has never been more out of place."
2020-04-01 02:08:28,I’ve never been happier to work at an academic medical center. The empiricism and pragmatism in play which allows us to equally advocate on our behalf and to protect patients is a rarity in the private practice world. This article exemplifies the worst instincts of the private for-profit medical environment.
2020-04-01 02:12:12,"Dr. Nikicicz was right to protect his health.  We need him.

If I were unlucky enough to require hospitalization right now, I wouldn't care if the staff showed up in wetsuits and welding masks.  I'd be grateful to have their help."
2020-04-01 02:13:00,"What, exactly, are these hospital administrators who put the “image” of the hospital over safety of doctors actually doing, besides making health care more expensive? What value are they adding?

There’s a lot of fat and waste and unnecessary costs in health care. Overpaid and useless hospital bureaucrats and administrators is one reason the U.S. pays so much more for health care than other countries. Another reason we so desperately need Medicare For All."
2020-04-01 02:17:16,"Often times the administration of hospitals are out of touch, sometime dangerously so, with what is going on within the hospitals.  This is because those administrators are largely stuffed suits, MBAs, or strictly business men and women.  Imagine, more worried about image, how it might look, over the health of the very doctors and nurses working to heal the patients.  A  hospital is not serving big Macs or Whoppers."
2020-04-01 01:03:33,Have the administrators spend an hour in the ER instead of their office.
2020-04-01 01:21:37,I am an academic professor who teaches undergrad and MBA business courses. This situation of Administrators taking over at medical institutions is exactly what has happened in Academia. They come into the organisation on high salaries and in the guise of trying to act productively they totally ruin the institution whose mission is education. Academics are being pushed around by these same types of parasites just as doctors are in this article.  All in the name of trying to gain an extra dollar of profit.
2020-04-01 01:08:39,"Ah these are the same administrators that are right at this moment reducing the salaries of doctors and nurses?

The same administrators that brought nurse to patient ratios to the point of disregarding care of the patient and the sanity of the nurses? 

The same administrators that fleece uninsured patients, that implement onerous facility fees?  

I say show them the door! Remove them from our care system. Good riddance!!!"
2020-04-01 01:06:33,I am a pulmonary doctor and I find it despicable that front line doctors are being told how to protect themselves. We still do not know exactly how the virus is spread and we should assume that everyone we come into contact has the virus.  How dare administrators tell us what to do.  I don't see them walking down our hallways at my hospital during this epidemic!
2020-04-01 02:21:44,"""In the days that followed, Dr. Nikicicz said, he was told that his job was at risk because policy at the hospital where he works, University Medical Center in El Paso, prohibited the use of protective masks in the hallways.""

If I had been Dr. Nikicicz, I would have shoved that protective mask down the administrator's throat."
2020-04-01 01:07:58,It was his right to wear the mask in public. I'm sure another hospital would love to hire him.
2020-04-01 02:00:54,No hospital worthy of the name should be denying their staff the protection they need.
2020-04-01 01:50:38,"There are many administrators in hospitals and throughout the healthcare system who will need to be replaced when this is over. Better yet, many of these positions simply need to be eliminated."
2020-04-01 01:02:30,"Any adminstrator who disciplines or suspends a health care worker for ""insubordination"" should immediately be scheduled to take over that worker's clinical duties.

This is madness: physicians have become commodities. They should begin to walk off the job like Whole Food clerks.

This country has lost its way."
2020-04-01 01:42:47,"amazing.  the MBAs are now making clinical decisions from the standpoint of ""appearances"".  really??  the issue of masking is in flux.  even the cdc is reviewing that policy of masking.  as a physician, i trust my informed clinical judgement, and that of my peers, above and beyond the opinion of these posers."
2020-04-01 02:15:58,"A businessman in the White House and corporate CEOs heading hospitals... now we have proof that experience in business does not benefit the welfare of its citizens.  People who put money first should never be in charge of a nation or a hospital or education.  

Public service, of whatever type, is a calling.  It involves ‘SERVING” not the wielding of power and making PR more important than serving the public.

Medicine used to entail a great deal of independence, based on long education and professional development.  Now it appears that physicians have become (or are treated as) cogs in machinery and serfs to big business.  Healthcare should not be a “business” but a public good.

I am old. But I begin to despair of this society.  Unless huge value changes are made.  Many changes are needed.  But unless and until we base our society, its governance and institutions on values, we are never going to dig ourselves out of this misbegotten hole we’ve dug ourselves into.

For shame!"
2020-04-01 00:39:03,"These hospitals' decisions are illogical, the evidence suggests that this virus can spread through droplets and even aerosol.
Maybe they just want to put the profits ahead of public health."
2020-04-01 01:38:41,"This is an abomination.  Four of Boston's largest and best-known hospitals said on Monday that in all, 345 of their employees have tested positive for the coronavirus.  How can anyone fault doctors for taking precautions when we're still in early days of learning about COVID transmission?"
2020-04-01 00:51:42,"Wow, in the space of about a week those guys ended up on the wrong side of that argument.  The masses might just get angry enough to vote for some universal healthcare this time around..."
2020-04-01 02:07:50,"How dare the administrators of hospitals, in their nice carpeted offices on the top floor (or in another building altogether, or even in another city) put front-line workers of any kind (nurses, doctors, housekeeping, sanitation, techs, etc.) in danger due to worries about public image and the bottom line?

This is unconscionable."
2020-04-01 00:39:21,"Everyone is wearing mask at my hospital. The MD I worked with today said he was not eating or drinking at all for the whole day so he would not have to remove his masks, he was wearing 2."
2020-04-01 02:22:44,"During a pandemic, everyone may be an infected person, without a test was done, you just don't know. So wearing a mask in a public place is not just to protect yourself, but to protect others."
2020-04-01 01:50:11,"To all hospital administrators: protect your medical personnel.  

I do not want to be cared for by an doctor, nurse or technician."
2020-04-01 02:04:35,"It sounds like some see the evidence as demonstrating only droplet precautions, and others see aerosolized transmission.  Can't someone at the head (?CDC) look at the demographics from early on in the pandemic and make a conclusion??  [I have mine but am not an epidemiologist].   Why are so many doctors, more trained than most to interpret information scientifically, feeling the need to mask - I would guess they view the scientific evidence as warranting it.... (doctor training tends to have doctors minimize their emotions anyway)

I bet there are going to be a LOT of legal cases when this is all over citing negligence on the employers regarding the deaths/illnesses of health care professionals who were told not to mask or weren't provided PPE."
2020-04-01 00:49:56,"Hooray for the doctors, nurses, and others who are taking proactive actions. Saving their lives saves our lives. Replace the administrators. Write new rules for a new paradigm. It is a medical war, and doctors need all the ammunition they can obtain. The bottom line means nothing if the front line is annihilated. Wake up administrators, CFOs and bean counters!"
2020-04-01 01:01:22,To all doctors who have lost their jobs because of this type of bureaucracy please consider coming to NY.  We need all the help we can get.
2020-04-01 00:55:29,Hospital administrators think they can afford to bench medical professionals during this crisis?  I thought there was a desperate shortage throughout the nation.  Disgraceful.
2020-04-01 02:24:03,"I don’t even work in health care and even I can figure out that in hospitals, everyone should be wearing masks at all times. The coronavirus is often spread asymptomatically. This has been a well-established fact for a while now. For that reason, anyone who feels totally fine and not sick at all could be infecting everyone he or she comes into contact with. In order for doctors, nurses and other health care workers to not get sick, they must wear masks to protect themselves, which will in turn protect any patients they come into contact with."
2020-04-01 01:23:41,"China has managed to slow the infection rate to the minimum.  We might be smart just to do what they do--everyone wears a mask.  Then the mask becomes a badge of solidarity while protecting those not infected from those who are.  Surgeons wear masks not to protect themselves, but to protect the patient.
That and wash your hands and keep your hands off your face."
2020-04-01 00:47:21,"My partner ( IM/Hospitalist) was reprimanded by an Administrative M.D. at our hospital for wearing a regular surgical mask while rounding on patients in hospital ( we are an epicenter - ICU full, had to create second ICU, 3 units for COVID19-only patients).  We all received an email from the CEO forbidding us from wearing regular hospital surgical masks while rounding - we were told we could bring homemade masks as long as they ""don't like like standard surgical masks""!!!"
2020-04-01 00:53:29,So hospitals let doctors who are positive for corona virus come back to work and see patients without making sure that they are retested negative for the virus.  Brace yourself for more corona virus infections.
2020-04-01 00:54:10,"Hospital Administrators are businessmen.
They should mind their own business and stick to business and leave medical matters to physicians."
2020-04-01 01:20:44,Masks help prevent the spread. They know that in China and elsewhere. When will The United Staes catch up with this simple fact.
2020-04-01 01:45:09,Criminal on the part of hospitals to fire a doctor because he is trying to protect himself. Fire the administrators.
2020-04-01 02:27:47,"“What’s wrong with our hospital system?,” the doctor asks.

This country has a for-profit hospital system that has been run by CEO-businessmen for a very long time. No hospital system has been put under this kind of pressure in our modern, profit-oriented history, so just like the political system, it does not have the skill set to deal with the monumental sea changes needed. The CEO-businessmen then fall back on the only paradigm they know: ‘we made the rules; you must follow them...because we say so, not because they are good rules.’

As people begin to die by tens or hundreds from this novel coronavirus, the for-profit hospital systems set up for profit, not real health care, will fail. And doctors will die because of it."
2020-04-01 02:28:20,"It seems the hospitals in question have turned that very difficult corner of now not caring what other people think. It’s a hurdle that we in the US will probably face. Other countries have no qualms about masks in public, we’ll get there, too, I’m sure. Change is hard."
2020-04-01 02:38:34,"The medical professionals who are taking care of patients, but the for-profit hospitals making money off this crisis are pure evil. The healthcare system in this country needs a complete overhaul. We need a PUBLIC HEALTHCARE system that puts the heath of the community above business profit."
2020-04-01 01:55:02,Doctors are not a dime a dozen.  All they need to do is act just a little bit collectively.  They win.  Immediately.
2020-04-01 01:58:43,"This is what privatization of healthcare has gotten this country.  The doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, nursing assistants, phlebotomists, radiology technicians, dietary assistants and housekeepers keep the hospitals going and expose themselves to sick patients every day. We need to change our gloves multiple times a day, sometimes several times with each patient.  We need fresh masks for each patient with this disease. 

When CEO’s come upstairs to be exposed to the blood, sputum, vomit, urine and other unmentioned bodily fluids, they can make the rules. 

We NEED sufficient PPE to protect patients, ourselves and our own families. Why would we take protective gear home, Mr Trump? We want it where we need it; AT WORK!"
2020-04-01 02:17:29,How to the administrators expect to find replacements for fired doctors in the middle of a pandemic? Are they planning to order some from Amazon?
2020-04-01 02:40:26,"What?! I have gotten as far as the third paragraph, and I cannot understand. These people are putting their lives on the line for the rest of us in the worst crisis many of us can remember, and they are not supposed to protect themselves fully? Drop the rules and consider compassion and creative flexibility in a horrible time."
2020-04-01 02:22:09,"Come on, Americans dont wear masks, measure in kilometers or  weigh in kilos. like the rest of the world . Americans are exceptional !"
2020-04-01 02:23:14,"I cannot wrap my head around how hospital administrators are admonishing, suspending or firing doctors who dare - imagine this!- to protect their own health by putting on masks or other personal protective gear so they can safely go about doing their jobs of trying to save lives.  How dare they put the medical front line at risk as well as the patients? I agree with others who say if administrators of hospitals are so confident that doctors, nurses and support staff don't need the protective gear, then let THEM join the fray unprotected. Cruel and unusual abuse of the most important components of their operations: the medics."
2020-04-01 02:30:02,"This pandemic has proven that money is all that matters to many hospital systems and administrations. Doctors, nurses, techs, and staff are disposable. What about the community they are supposed to serve? First, protect your image and your bottom line. My hospital still (STILL!) is telling outpatient clinics that it is “business as usual.”"
2020-04-01 02:35:06,"Right now, wearing a mask in public is a good idea for three reasons:

1. A mask is an excellent way to train ourselves to not touch our faces—a behavior directly connected to the spread of infection.

2. We need to become accustomed to seeing each other in masks—so we will begin to accept mask wearing as a positive, rather than negative, social behavior—maybe even a fashion statement.

3. Mask-wearing in public should become a national  symbol of support for our health care workers—who are in the trenches sacrificing themselves for us every day.

Let masks become a symbol of our solidarity as a country to defeat this virus—masked together!"
2020-04-01 02:39:38,So hospitals think that the solution to not having the proper supplies is to fire or suspend the doctors & nurses who are in harms way while caring for the sick? Who do they think is going to take that job when it becomes available? It’s time to start thinking about a first responders and medical care providers relief fund to provide for those on the frontline who have soldiered on despite inadequate supplies while exposing themselves & their families to Covid-19.
2020-04-01 02:45:55,Healthcare professionals are in a shortage and yet they get fired for exercising the best judgement for themselves and others. What is going on in this country?
2020-04-01 02:48:54,"This seems like a pretty normal situation.  The administrator is answering to his superiors -- the hospital profitability team -- who are protecting the image of the hospital, and hence its desirability as a care center, by forcing the doctors to not wear masks and spread panic.  Their focus on profit -- above all else, and indeed misplaced during the pandemic -- is their job in a private industry.  They want to make as much money as possibility for the private business.

Now if the doctors want to wear masks, to minimize the risk to themselves of an early death, this needs to be cleared with the profitability team, because it's clearly more important that the hospital make money than it preserve the lives of its workers.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the doctors are in an morally -- and even spiritually unsupportable position.  

In the religion of pure capitalism, all norms and behaviors are subservient to the impetus from the investor class -- mediated by the administrative class -- so that in this case the doctors should willingly forfeit their lives in order that the investor class may profit.  This would a be a righteous death, and doctors and nurses should be true to the great capitalist calling and give of their very lives so that the investor class may profit and drink of the best wines, dine on the finest foods and sleep on the softest mattresses.   It is as if the Lord himself has commanded it, we should submit to the investors, as if unto God himself."
2020-04-01 02:54:33,This is analogous to Li Wenliang the Chinese doctor who tried to blow the whistle. Kudos to this doctor for standing his ground and I hope the policy changes immediately. Thanks NYT for shining a light on this issue.
2020-04-01 02:56:37,"I know of a doctor who was admonished by a hospital administer for wearing a mask. ""You are scaring the patients"", was the comment. I also have a son who is running ICU services in a large hospital serving low income population. As a retired intensivist I worry about my son and his young children & wife. Wonder if these administrators who should have ordered & stocked PPE ahead for the expected onslaught of patients to the hospitals take any responsibility for the shortage? It is easy to blame the politicians. Those in charge of getting supplies in place have MBAs & healthy salaries. Some of them even get percentage of profits in the so-called non-profit hospitals."
2020-04-01 02:59:35,"I have never in my life been so disappointed in the Cleveland Clinic!

2020-04-01 03:05:34,"Re: N95s removal & replacement 

since we have a shortage of N95’s & healthcare workers have to reuse the same one for up to a week (or potentially more), 

I suspect that constantly removing & replacing them to suit hospitals’  “image protectors” will stretch out the elastic bands that hold it to the face, 

that would diminish the seal & decrease the effectiveness of N95s. 

Allegedly, some healthcare workers are forced to masks that expired years ago given the shortage. 


Apparently the elastic on some of those broke right away. 

Thus the seal on expired masks may already be weakened"
2020-04-01 03:06:17,"I am a physician assistant at one of the top three medical facilities in the RTP area and I was fired today by my supervising doctor because I wanted to wear a mask at work while seeing patients, whereas the protocol at the facility at this time is that no medical providers is allowed to wear a mask unless with a Covid-19 patient. Given the high mortality rate of our patient population due to COVID-19 I felt that, to safeguard the safety of my patients should I be asymptomatic but infected as well as to protect my family and myself, wearing a mask would be a sound practice entirely consistent with the medical literature. I was told that there aren't enough masks for everyone, so I brought in a mask that I fashioned myself at home and I was told I was not to use it while performing my duties. I even offered to make masks for all the staff in my unit but was again told that the rules at the facility currently prohibit medical providers from wearing a mask."
2020-04-01 03:08:02,"If asymptomatic persons can transmit Covid 19 and health care providers are constantly in contact with patients who have been exposed, the health care workers should definitely be wearing their masks throughout the hospital.  Further, if administrators are unable to provide adequate protection to providers and staff, they really have no standing for rigidly enforcing policies or telling providers what to do to protect themselves and their patients.

Projections are 100K - 240K dying from COVID-19.  These medical administrators should be taking care of their staff! When your doctors and medical staff start getting sick or dying off, who's going to staff your hospital?  Who's going to take care of the sick patients in your community if they are unable to come to work?

I seriously have to question - are these administrators qualified and compassionate to provide care if they don't care for the well being of your medical staff.  How is your hospital going to make money if your doctors are out?"

Those administrators, like Trump, want to look good, not do good.
As business men continue to take over health care, medical knowledge takes a back seat to decisions the business people think will enhance their revenue and their income.

Much of that is predicated on finances (mostly finances!), public relations, and administrative minutiae that have little or nothing to do with health care and patient or employee safety.  

The ratio we need is 10 to 1 (MDs to admins), not 1 to 10.  

Where I work, the administrators have been actively telling the MDs (attendings, residents, fellows) not to talk about the dire conditions in the hospital (PPE shortages for example), lest it reflect badly on the administration.  Dishonesty breeds mistrust.  The system is broken beyond repair."

Here’s the reality.  In many hospitals masks in particular should be considered a “scarce resource”.  

If your supply of masks is in doubt and you want to assure that doctors and nurses can have appropriate protection in the riskiest situations for the foreseeable future, then you might have to curtail use of masks in less risky settings today; even if you understand the low risk setting is not zero.  

What would you prefer?  Having masks for everyone (not just doctors), in all settings in a hospital for 3 weeks, and then no masks for anyone even for encounters with known infected patients after that??

That’s what we’re grappling with.  If there was ample supply, we wouldn’t care who wore a mask at any point.

Some hospitals have an ample supply, but many are running out.  While I may be willing to walk down the hall today without a mask and practice social distancing, please don’t put me in the position of deciding if I should sacrifice myself and see infected patients without any protection when we run out because we didn’t allocate scarce resources properly today."

My colleague and others pushed back against the hospital with the message: ""Wearing a mask shows that you understand the gravity and ubiquity of the threat; that you want to protect the staff, as well as the patients."". This week the medical staff overruled the hospital and now all employees, from surgeons to garage attendants are wearing either surgical, or N-95 masks at all times.

When the dust settles, we must find out why the CDC so atypically underperformed, and changes must be made.

The correct public health response is to encourage masks and frequent hand washing and physical distancing, and  then repeatedly hammer home this clear, consistent message.  Prior recommendations to not wear masks are only because our current CDC leaders folded when faced with the predictable resistance to the coming reality of a pandemic by an anti-science WH.  They were unable to do their most important job in December and January, and one that those of us who came before learned to do in other administrations - stand up and publicly declare the truth and risk their jobs to save lives.   If they had done so probably PPE production could have been ramped up and we would not have a PPE shortage that has led to these nutty and changing messages regarding masks.

Regardless, given need to protect the limited supply for health care workers in the context of horrific CDC management, non-healthcare workers should not wear masks unless recommended.  We are all in trouble if our physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists are unable to work due to COVID-19. 

Also, administrators who are now worried about MD's wearing masks in hallways are unfit to run hospitals."

Obviously, this study won't ever be done.  It would not pass ethics committees - and rightly so.  Lesson being, beware of people, administrations, bureaucrats hiding behind such statements!  Also, given how little we actually know about how many people have been infected in the population but either show very few or even no symptoms - the idea that fever and a cough are the only concerning symptoms is simply head in the sand thinking."

We put our patients with a positive or a R/O Covid in negative pressure rooms, or at least we used to do this when we had these rooms available. Why a negative pressure room? There is substantial evidence that this virus is transmitted by airborne/droplet. Some particles are so small that when they are released it would be counterintuitive not to quarantine these patients in a ward, ICU, or admit them to negative pressure rooms to prevent further transmission of the pathogen.

On masks: The particles can get through a surgical mask, but if that is all that is available to you, then you go with it. We are fighting a battle for our patients, and will continue to do our work. But, we need the proper PPE. A soldier does fight a war without armor. Medical staff need their protective equipment to fight this battle.

However, the administrators are in charge. It's called the bottom-line. It's about money.  I have been in this for thirty years, and the financial aspect of this business is multi-layered. It is not spoken. It is not transparent.  

Health-care is important for everyone. We are the only industrialized country that does not have health care for all. This virus cannot distinguish the wealthy from the poor.

How on Earth are our experts admonishing an entire population with regard to the most obvious and proven form of personal protection from virulent and contagious pathogens? Our own surgeon general: Stop buying masks! The CDC: You do not need to wear a mask. The notion that we should not wear masks because they must be saved for our health care workers (painfully true) is partially short sighted.

The common strategies employed are: 
1. Adding more work load on existing staff, be it RNs, MDs instead of hiring more staff members. Not to mention added burden of paperwork which no one knows about. 
2. Promoting policies like “Satisfaction Scores” “Survey Scores” than practice the right medicine, not only hurts the patients, but also the doctors and costs way more in the long run. I cannot tell my patients to lose weight to control their diabetes or hypertension; because someone will take an offense to a medical advise, and add false nasty comments on my surveys.

Even though the Chief Medical Officer who I worked with said it was unwise for me to get a shot again because my reaction would only be worse the 2nd time, he still wanted me to follow protocol and get the shot because ""everyone has to do it."" I refused and was fired.  This same hospital system had record profits in the millions and were celebrating their bank accounts when I countered to them, ""If you are making such a high profit, shouldn't you lower the price of care so that people do not lose their homes to cancer?""

Meta-analyses showed that surgical masks had a 68% risk reduction, and N95 a 91% risk reduction.  Washing hands more than 10 times a day was associated with a 55% reduction.  Of course, these people will argue that Covid-19 is not SARS, and that there is no evidence yet to show that masking is effective.  So, they are telling the unwitting public and coercing the knowledgeable doctors to become involuntary guinea pigs in order to gather enough evidence.  The fact that Hong Kong and Singapore, both very high density cities with universal masking policies, have a far lower rate of infection, is I guess not enough of an anecdotal evidence to convince these people.
I also note with irony that in a state such as Texas, which allow people to wear guns to protect themselves, that they are not allowed to wear masks to protect themselves.  I guess masks are far more deadly."
2020-04-01 05:46:11,"For someone who had just been in contact with a COVID infected patient and given the uncertainty over asymptomatic transmission, isn't it prudent for healthcare givers to wear a mask just in case? This is not an issue of over-reaction but of caution. Though there is no medical proof that wearing a mask will prevent catching COVID-19, neither is there medical proof that wearing a mask won't reduce the possibility of being infected. So in uncertain times and in absence of medical proof, I say better to be safe than sorry."
2020-04-01 05:51:33,"I visited Kaiser Permanente hospital 3 weeks ago to  drop off  a
form . I was surprised then ( March 9 ) to find none of the hospital staff wearing  a mask. I would have found it reassuring,
as in 'Good, these guys are taking this seriously'."
2020-04-01 05:53:23,"I'm not in that environment anymore but today I would have my low life friends and bidness associates set fire to the car of any hospital administrators who threatened to fire me for wearing a mask while on the job, as it quite literally is a threat to my life."
2020-04-01 05:55:32,"Wearing face masks has become obligatory in most hospitals, including University Hospitals in Germany for all staff, any time. It appears to me that US hospitals which prohibit using face masks would deny the risk of spreading the infection by not wearing a mask."
2020-04-01 02:49:41,"This action by hospital administrators is outrageous. While in the middle of a global pandemic, with medical professionals risking their own lives, to treat the sick and dying, some pencil pushing bureaucrat has the nerve to do this?"
2020-04-01 03:05:21,"At the NorthWell Health System in NY (multiple hospitals, outpatient offices, and therapy areas), all employees including receptionist,porters,car valets etc are required to wear masks at all times. They are the loop surgical type. N95 masks are reserved for those working directly with Covid 19 patients and are covered by a surgical mask as the N95 masks are being reused. Many of the sub specialists like cardiology, rheumatology etc are being redeployed in order to take care of the increasing volume of patients and the hospitals are continuing to try increasing their bed capacity as the surge approaches. Most of the country will face this, and they’re lucky if they have more time to prepare, instead of calling it the “Wuhan Virus”.

I was particularly offended by the actions of all the hospitals mentioned. You would assume all hospitals would want their physicians and nurses to remain healthy as possible, and loosing staff at such a moment will be disastrous. It demonstrates the gulf between actual health care providers and administrators, many who have not been in the trenches. I would like to see one of them walk into a unit full of Covid 19 patients with the ad hoc PPE’s that many hospitals are now using. That’s why NY already has had 2 deaths among nurses and hundreds of illnesses amongst health care providers."
2020-04-01 03:15:11,"I had to have a flu injection yesterday at a small rural but isolated regional medical clinic. The Doctor (only one for this part of the universe) wore a face mask all the time. All I thought was  - how uncomfortable. 
It is a massive job for medical people at the moment and they are putting their lives at risk. 
This area covering a radius of 120 miles does not have any ICU beds - so people are doing their best to isolate themselves because they don't want the burden of causing someone else's misery.
I read this article and I cannot believe some hospital administrators focus on image. I think they need to be taken on tour of people who are suffering. Clearly they don't get out much - much less in their own hospitals. 
Actually it reinforces my believe that world is being run be a ship of fools."

2020-04-01 03:59:34,"This is just bizarre.  I am a doctor who worked in hospitals for decades and never encountered any of them banning face masks in any area.  What possible reason could there be for that?  People wore masks for various reasons, and now there are better reasons than ever.  I have encountered grossly incompetent, dishonest and even criminal hospital administrations, but none of them ever tried to ban personal protection equipment."

Yet again, we the people applaud him and threaten our front line medical providers who are dying while serving our sick. Am I the only one who questions our allegiance?"

The physician is self admittedly wearing a contaminated mask out into public which is him exposing all of us not vise a versa. He should’ve ditched the n95 in the OR and donned a clean surgical mask to wear in the halls as we all have too.

2020-04-01 05:31:30,"Doc's have known for several years now they are considered ""just a piece of meat"" by administrators.
 That physician who cares for you, maybe even saved your life, means nothing to a hospital administrator. The administrators will fire or even ruin a physicians career if she or he bucks their edicts. Edicts which have nothing to do with patient care and all to do with the bottom line and maintaining their authority. These MBA's are essentially practicing medicine without a license as they make decisions that impact the healthcare of patients and well being of the staff and are not held accountable.
If a physician objects to irresponsible policy by an administrator then the administrator will have the medical staff officers, who they employ and bonus, declare the physician disruptive which could end their career.
We need to put all our focus on COVID 19 right now but when it's over, kick these bums out and get folks who care about the health of patients and safety of the staff established in leadership roles."

-shortage of protective masks, 
-shortage of detection devices for the virus (PCR kits or serology kits).
The experience from other countries did not help anticipate anything.
Worse, the major problem in both France and the US is an all administrative direction of hospitals, incompetent, insensitive and  jealous of doctors and nurses."
2020-04-01 02:44:57,"These are the bitter fruits of corporatization of medicine.   Administrators who are business and marketing “visionaries” with no experience of ever caring for patients, enforcing policies which are at core business decisions.   They wear the fig leaf of not for profit while reaping 7 figure salaries and generous bonuses decoupled from medical care.  We need experienced physician administrators."
2020-04-01 06:01:34,"It's not just a violation of common sense and public health recommendations, but in the case of Dr. Henry Nikicicz, it's illegal disability discrimination for the hospital to refuse to allow him to protect himself and to retaliate against him for doing so by wearing a mask because he has chronic conditions that make him more susceptible to very serious Covid-19 complications.  It's outrageous that a university (or any other) hospital doesn't know that and doesn't care about its healthcare providers."
2020-04-01 06:10:28,"Reading this article is unfortunately like Deja Vu for me. First thing my hospital did after cases started piling up in California, was to remove masks from common areas, second admin workers were forbidden to visit hospital (they have separate office building). I work in OR, we obviously are allowed to wear masks there, but there are signs everywhere to remove your mask when exciting OR.Nurses in Recovery Area are allowed to wear masks
(patients are still sleepy and cannot notice I suppose), but nurses in preoperative area don't have access to masks.Just about 10 days ago my boss asked me why am I so worried about this ""new flu"". Now my medical group is more proactive, but we have to fight for everything and it seem as administrators playbook is to follow CDC and local county health department guidelines but many including myself think this is not nearly enough. There are signs of slow progress and proactive policies of California Governor seem to start bringing results. This is our only hope. Unfortunately there are many other States or areas with less proactive approach and people there are definitely in much worse situation!"

Many states including California have laws prohibiting retaliation for advocacy against unsafe practices in healthcare settings.
Physician advocacy organizations should be able to enforce standards by court order. Unfortunately the physician organization leaders are compromised by their incestous relationship with hospital corporations.

In some countries of Europe, people must not step out of their home without a nose and mouth covered, or must not enter a supermarket.
Because of shortage of masks, people are encouraged to make them at home if they have a sewing machine.
Of course the mask can't protect 100%, but it can catch the deadly droplet of saliva from a person close to you, who may not realise he/she is infected. Or the other way round.
I think the medical advice regarding masks will change as cases increase, and more masks are produced or imported."
2020-04-01 06:27:41,"If I walk into any medical practice today, I want to see everyone wearing masks.  Not wearing a mask makes someone more likely to infect me, and having not worn one earlier makes them more likely to have the virus to do so.

We should be conserving PPE, since apparently we are not capable of adequately supplying them in 21st-century America, but that is the only reason why a doctor should ever be out in public without a mask while this epidemic is ongoing."
2020-04-01 06:30:44,"The profit motive is a very poor basis for a medical system. It leads to many distortions, resulting in inefficient, expensive and inequitable care. Every other developed country ultimately does it cheaper, better and fairer than the US."

2020-04-01 06:44:34,"""Frightened doctors"" is the wrong way of describing this.  Like the featured doctor in this piece, I have been wearing a mask to protect my patients as I am the major risk of exposure for them (I round at the hospital and then go to clinic).  Fear is not really part of the equation but a basic understanding of the science- coronaviruses are not new.  Infection control is not new.  Clearly administrators are motivated in this crisis by their desire to contain costs- it is their job to save money and control cost- somebody has to do that by the way.  The ""supplies on demand"" way of doing things has been utterly exposed and was a predictable failure for any major crisis.  I would contend that administrators knew this would happen and did nothing.  They are being exposed as frauds (they claim as their primary duty the health and safety of the patients) and we need to be clear that they have irreparably lost credibility.   The CDC has also failed all of us Americans in the biggest health crisis of our times.  We doctors are not afraid, we are mad.  Let the revolution in healthcare begin- this may be the silver lining in this crisis- we need real change to stop the sinking ship of healthcare that existed even before this crisis, but the ship is clearly going down now.  Most of our hospital leaders do not deserve to survive this crisis- we will need a clean slate and we will need credibility.  Shame on us if we think the status quo is tenable."

We purchased a respirator online because her hospital has a poor supply of personal protective equipment and leadership has given no indication that their safety is a priority.

The idea that a doctor could be 'taken off the schedule' (note this is like being fired, but without the actual firing) for protecting their own health is asinine.

Its hard to prove a negative, and rigorous research would endanger the subjects.
It is uncontested that ill patients shed the virus attached to water molecules; obvious that face masks offer some protection against the transference of water molecules.
Duh!
We're so fashion snobby that we've chuckled for years at images of folks in Asia going around wearing face masks all over town.
Wearing a face mask is evidence of being considerate of others. We should learn."

They would touch the door handles with their gloved handles all the way. Even better when they would walk all the way to the snack bar and get coffee. Latter you couldn’t tell if the dried coffee was blood or coffee.

2020-03-31 19:03:47,I think Governors of largely hit states need to step in and prevent hospital administrators from preventing Doctors and Nurses from protecting themselves. It is their lives and their families that need protection. Anything from preventing these heroes from bringing the virus into their homes is fair game and they should decide what is safe for themselves! This is horrific on the part of Hospital administrators. They should be ashamed!

2020-04-01 06:03:27,"As an industrial hygienist on the SARS Scientific Committee, I have first hand knowledge of Vancouver Canada in 2003: no transmission of SARS-1 virus to healthcare workers. Multiple reasons included consistent use of fit-tested N95 respirators in clinical settings. Toronto had inconsistent advice for health care workers and went through 3 waves of SARS resulting in multiple infections and 3 deaths of healthcare workers.
Take a look at the photos of healthcare workers in China: full protection way beyond N95 and goggles. For a Zhejiang hospital treating 78 severe and critically ill patients, there was no transmission to health care workers.
For speaking out, let us praise Dr. Nikicicz as an American Dr Li WenLiang, the Chinese physician who first spoke out in China and was issued a warning letter by local cops. Li Wen Liang died of COVID-19 and his child will be born fatherless in June.
An American hospital administrator who calls it ""Wuhan Virus"" should be immediately dismissed by his Board as an incompetent fool."
2020-04-01 05:43:01,Someone needs to read the riot act to the nation's hospital administrators.  It's inconceivable that people are being threatened for wearing personal protective equipment.

This actually happened to a friend who works at Montefiore, who, by the way, was not given any masks.  I provided my friend with a mask which was disinfected with Lysol after every shift and reused.  

Let's hope this assinine and dangerous policy is changed before anyone else comes down with the virus and potentially dies."

I have spent 60  hours reading materials on masks these past 12 days and have come to the conclusion that NOBODY should go to any area where they will encounter other members of the public without at least a Type I surgical mask. 

It is designed to keep the the wearer from spreading germs and and provides a decent degree of protection from germs entering your respiratory system.  It was mandatory for use in public in many areas of China during their outbreak. Still is.

Even if doctors can’t wear disinfected work goggles and a raincoat, someone mopping a contaminated floor, a first responder, or someone in line outside a hospital could use this protection. People are frightened and working in dangerous circumstances. This suggestion is not about blaming anyone in the medical environment. Call it the “Dunkirk Spirit”. Please be safe."

Yet they are absolutely absent from the hospitals during this crisis. If they know so much about medicine and healthcare, why aren’t they on the frontlines, ill protected like the rest of us, fighting along side us as “leaders” there too? I’m a physician.

In my hospital (and I daresay most other major hospitals in Singapore), all healthcare workers, whether you’re a doctor, nurse, allied health professional, receptionist, porter, radiographer, patient greeter, or a cleaner, wears a mask across all areas of the hospital. Shortage of masks and other PPEs is of course an unfortunate reality. I am thankful that our government has had the foresight to stockpile these, as we had learnt from our experience with SARS. However, the stocks are finite and we have to be careful with how we use them. My hope is that enough masks and PPEs will continue to be manufactured and fairly distributed to all countries and hospitals in need. Hospital Administrators also need to learn to be receptive to what’s happening on the ground- and that means listening to and respecting what their healthcare workers have to say."

Guess what, that ""fog"" is coming out of you all the time, even when it's not cold.  Since an infected person can be asymptomatic for many days, of course it's just common sense that people should be wearing masks when in shared indoor pubic spaces.  Doctors and nurses in particular should be wearing masks.  In fact Doctors and nurses should be putting on clean masks after working with confirmed cases and then moving on to unconfirmed cases or non-covid 19 cases.  To preserve the supply of surgical and N95 masks, the general public should be making their own to wear in public indoor spaces.

When inquiring why some do and some don’t, the explanation is that administration requires it when that RN is one who has refused or cannot take a flu vaccine. So masking is specifically required by admin in order to protect fellow staff, patients, and the public to prevent inadvertent transmission of influenza by a potentially transmissible person. With a new disease, this virulent, this deadly, this silently transmissible, why oh why would admin take the opposite stance? Oh yeah, not enough protective equipment procured to provide adequate infection control! But apparently doctors, nurses, patients, and the public are the expendable ones. Horrific. It’s so hard to fight stupid, especially when it holds the pocketbook. If we all wear masks, there are no adverse optics. Then it becomes solely a symbol of “I care about you and want to protect you.”"

PPE and test kits followed by respirators are what is most needed.  

We need to focus the trillions of dollars on breaking the log jam in the required chemical reagents preventing delivery of test kits and we need to test everyone at the earliest possible time.  There are many who show no symptoms that are carrying the virus.   If we test everyone with reliable test kits and lab testing, we can isolate everyone who is carrying the virus, treat those who are sick from it and re-open America quickly.

I am amazed that the nation that beat the fascists through a massive organization of industry can not produce enough modern, reliable test kits to test everyone in this nation now.

As for this doctor and anyone in a hospital now, they should be wearing N-95 masks in public and medical locations in the building.   Of course, hospitals are the concentration point for virus carriers.

Health care in America is not run by medical professionals, it is run by giant corporations that only value profits, even if they claim to be ""not for profit"". There is no clearer proof that they have no concern for anything but the bottom line. Why is health care in America so expensive? Because that is our goal! If you want something else out out of the health care system, such as actual caring for our patients, capitalism does not work."

2020-04-01 03:45:16,"Reminds my of the Men in Black at a prominent children hospital I was working at some years ago, asking me to discharge an uninsured child from outside the US with acute lymphoblastic leukemia following his first round of chemo. “Doctor, the patient can now be treated in his country where care is available”. Which was obviously not true, and therefore a likely death sentence.

My answer was simple: “Please come to the ward and deliver the good news to the parents. My job is to treat, yours to manage dollars”.

Bottom line, have the administrators come to the COVID battle field, and see for themselves how their directives apply. In the real word. 

Lead by example. From the front line, not the rear."
2020-04-01 11:37:58,Universal precautions are based on the assumption that all patients a healthcare worker encounters are potentially infected and has been the accepted standard of care for over 30 year.  It applies equally today as it has in the past.  Assuming everyone is infectious and wear a mask.

Health care is not an optional commodity, it is the manifestation of a fundamental human right.  In for profit systems,  the mission renounces that principle.  The mission is to maximize profits, and medical care provided is a ""loss"" in the budget.
In a healthy non-profit system, (not having to compete with  for-profits to survive), the clinical mission, to provide as much of the best health care possible with  the available resources, is the bottom line - the profit, if you will.  Clinicians and administrators need to collaborate on leadership decisions, whether they be clinical policies, or allocation of resource decisions.  Most important, clinicians and administrators should have the same bottom line,  maximizing success at the clincal mission, not maximizing profits."
2020-04-01 12:13:17,Majority of Administrators are driven by budget not clinical practice. Other's are driven by ego thinking they know better and are dismissive of reasonable clinical caution.

The CDC is unable to articulate its position backed with published research, evidently thinking that anyone outside the CDC are ignorant unwashed masses unable to peruse research papers."

These were the countries that has had covid-19 under control. Look where we are now in the US? Already at the top of the global pandemic chart, and we are still debating whether protective gear is justified, even in the setting of a hospital.

Let's just forget about CDC and WHO guidelines, no matter how well intended they were -- be it under the name of not stirring public panic or not exhausting medical supplies. If either organization has been doing their job right, we wouldn't be in this giant mess. I know this sounds ungrateful, but their performance over the last three months have shown themselves to be institutions that spend most of their time catching up with facts of this pandemic, not leading the fight."

2020-04-01 14:09:02,"This article and many of the comments are extremely interesting.  I would caution, though, about thinking that a system controlled by government would be any better.  It might be even worse.  Most of the time, and I do not mean now, government does very little well, and managing something like our healthcare could very easily spiral into an even bigger mess.  This is not to say, that the problem profiled here isn't a major concern, because it certainly is.  The administrator who tried to stop Dr. Nikicicz needs to be swiftly removed.  And make no mistake, that kind of mindset is all over the country."

Now the physicians are getting some of what these other healthcare workers have experienced for many, many years and it's suddenly news? Welcome to the new world of healthcare, where your degree in medicine is no longer an exemption from poor labor practices.  And now you care."

As corporate structure has made its way into more and more hospital systems, they are expressing the same sort of mild sociopathy that exists in mainstream corporate America. We promote socially assertive fools with MBAs over smarter people who pay less attention to corporate hierarchy all the time. They are usually smarter than average, but nowhere near the top of the heap. Their hierarchical positions cause them to believe that they are, and their slavish conformity to the current managerial consensus and optics makes them push the occasional bit of idiocy down upon their staff. They are, more than anything, ""team"" players. ""Team"" here meaning ""the self-supporting team of management"". Doctors and Nurses: use your own best judgement and err on the side of caution.

After 35 years working as nurse , I know the truth . You the administrators we I’ll prepared for a disaster. You all probably denied request to increase supplies when information started leaking out in January. Now you have egg on your face but as always you want someone else to wear it .

They make enough money and have enough status to get their own way in the end, since they are the show pony’s of our health care system. Your article is confirmation of that.

No, empower the nurses to decide. They are the ones who do the most patient care and are therefore the most qualified to decide on masking procedures. Of course, that means the nurses need a powerful union to represent them. Without that union, administrators, who are always more interested in pleasing their superiors than focusing on patient care, will ride roughshod over the nurses.

Results: when we need those products we have to get them from somehwelese else, China mainly, and in the meantime we have to weather the storm with whatever we have on hand. Same with hospitals: greedy clever people decided that investing money in hospitals to make them profitable was where the money was.

Make no mistake: these people, who should be models of corporate responsibility, are engaging in dangerous practices with dire consequences. They should be called out immediately and exposed for their malfeasance. 
Nothing moves them better than exposure. Contact local media:TV stations, newspapers, state and local elected officials and plead with them to expose this destructive practice.

I think everyone should be realistic about hoarding behavior and the tendency to over use cleaning supplies. Feeding people of course is critical but it sounds like common sense guidance needs to be applied. This doesn’t feel like a time when you threaten to cut off food supplies just like it’s not a time to cut off medical care.

They give employees the option to stay and work even when they feel sick, allow sick employees to come to work, and there has been ZERO attempt to keep the store clean and sanitized. The only action that has been taken is the taping of the floor for social distancing, but customers do not comply. They stand within inches of one another at the checkout lines and have zero regard for the safety of the employees. Walmart is going to be responsible for the spread of COVID-19 and they could care less. This is no joke! I fear for my daughter who has to face the conditions she faces every time she goes to work. She works for OGP and is exposed continuously for 8 hours. Walmart is more concerned about their customers, but are too ignorant to see they are going to cause further outbreaks due to their corporate greed. The CDC or local agencies need to enforce stricter standards for this situation. This is no joke, yes, we need grocery stores to remain open, but stricter guidelines need to be implemented to protect the employees and their families. Customers need to take advantage of the curbside service and Walmart needs to limit the amount of people allowed in the store. Walmart is happily encouraging large group gatherings and the result is going to be catastrophic."
2020-03-31 12:22:20,"In recognition of their essential contribution to managing the crisis and their vulnerability, all shoppers should be well compensated and protected. I'm sure many of users of shopping services would be happy to pay extra for these assurances.
From a public health strategy standpoint, it makes sense to 1. limit numbers of shoppers in stores; 2. protect those workers from infection with suitable PPE and supplies; and 3. ensure that shoppers who fall sick are supported adequately with sick pay and medical care so infected workers are not compelled to work when they can transmit illness.
Shoppers provide a vital service to the community--though not healthcare workers, they serve to limit infection rates of vulnerable consumers,  thereby reducing hospital admissions. Because shoppers must handle groceries, protecting shoppers also protects their clients most at risk."
2020-03-31 12:28:36,"The main problem is not the companies. At Amazon, for example, workers are told to stay 6 feet apart. Sometimes, that's impossible. However, some workers make it worse by constantly talking on the job to each other while working about trivial subjects disregarding the fact that there is a pandemic going on and that while talking constantly they are spreading germs to others who want to be safe. Coughing is not the only way to spread germs. They might not have any symptoms, but they might  be sick. Right now, socializing, chit chat, and hanging out together while working is totally irresponsible than during normal times. Even in grocery stores, customers constantly talk about unnecessary subjects on the phone and with relatives they bring with them. If you have to work or shop, stay away from others and refrain from talking so those that are providing essential needs to prevent civil unrest can make their contributions."

The distinction between employees and independent contractors is a fine line and needs to be eliminated.  Most people actually work, but business owners bank the profit.  Fortunately, the national stimulus package ignores this distinction, traditionally determined by a ""three-prong test"" with multiple factors.

As the percentage of the labor force represented by unions has fallen, we've seen a number of problems.  Polarization of our country based upon wealth, illegal immigrants taking the jobs citizens could do - and would if they were compensated fairly - and a lack of benefits and protections for workers on the front line who become ill.

Ask yourself one simple question: how much would someone have to pay you to do the job that other people do?  That's the measure of its true worth.  And that should command double-time compensation in the coronavirus economy."

Having lived in US for more than 15 years as an alien expat, I got to observe that society closely and developed a somber compassion for the unwashed working masses, who even if hurting inside, have to put on smiling faces to customers. I do not know if it is nurture or cautious adherence to the policy of their soul-less employer companies. Given that most cultures are WYSIWYG, I know how difficult it is. Once I realized this, I felt pity.

I still remember it hit me poignantly, the first  many times I walked past the very old infirm greeters at Walmart, who have to smile and greet, when I clearly see it comes from a place of hurt and need. Once it hit me when, during lunch at a restaurant, my girlfriend and I decided to tip big to the old infirm lady waiting on us. I felt extremely guilty dining there.

Even if I know that the US is really run by corporations, at some point there are people running them no? I genuinely think, do Americans not really have compassion towards their fellow citizens? I cannot wrap my head around it.

Being from the outside it is a jarring juxtaposition of contrast, seeing the US always compulsively portray itself as a macho powerful glamorous country to the outside, but I scratched the surface out of curiosity, and it is majority full of sad hurting people compelled, rather condemned, to suffer silently.

Instacart is an expensive service that is only profitable since they rely on gig workers labor to get it to those willing to pay for their service. But now in the face of a deadly virus these workers face getting infected by working in environments exposed to many others without productive gear and when the Instacart model service is most in demand because folks don't want to go out themselves and the virus is the singular reason they pay for the service. So Instacart if they are smart will equipt their workers in every conceivable way to protect them and pay them far more for the risk they take and also to protect their customers from harm as well. The customers will appreciate that Instacart does not wish to spread the virus to their customers nor among their workers. The customers will pay far more in these times to use the service and they should hire gig workers as regular employees paying a fair wage and have a far greater reputation to keep everyone safe as well as have a fantastic service for those who demand it.

Allow either grocery staff and hire Gig economy people to work inside the store to shop only. They will all be instructed how to stay away from each other.  They can wear home made masks. Set up handwashing stations in several locations. Set up the aisles so they are all one way so everyone enters and exits the same way. 

Inside shoppers then put finished groceries on a table to be driven to homes by drivers. Stay 6 feet away from drivers.   

Divide the tasks to make it safer for everyone.  Apply ingeniuity instead of fear"
2020-03-31 13:23:08,"Grocery stores + services like instacart are surely making a killing right now. 

I would dream of all the workers banning together + striking to get health insurance, paid time off, hazard pay -- in France this would happen, I'm not sure here in America. 

We should support them."
2020-03-31 13:14:38,"Amazon is owned by the richest man in the world. It shouldn't be sending its workers into packed Whole Foods stores to do everyone's personal shopping and exposing them to hazards in its warehouses. The company needs to figure out hazard pay and safety measures to keep its workers in its warehouses safe and move its personal shopping for Whole Foods into a warehouse that is set up for personal distancing. It's not only cruel but inefficient to have these workers running around an actual grocery store during a pandemic. Even WalMart is putting up plexiglass and basic safety measures. Pay your workers, Bezos, and get them out of harm's way. And politicians: crack down on companies exploiting their labor and exposing employees to danger."
2020-03-31 13:37:59,"Amazon always says the same thing...Our employees safety and health is foremost on their mind.  Other than a newly initiated temperature taking routine, Amazon seemingly has done little to mitigate the working conditions of or effectively communicated with their employees regarding their concerns.

But given the unspeakable and ignorant incompetence of our president and the zombie GOP, (best exemplified by Texas Lt. Gov. when he said, ""that he and other American seniors would be willing to risk dying from the coronavirus in order to ensure that the economy doesn't slide into a serious recession,"") and the corporations' shameless grubbing to get, once again, their taxpayer""bailout"" there is nothing about Jeff Bezos that suggests that he is any different. 

Bill Gates has been deeply involved in world public health for years through his foundation. The only thing Jeff Bezos seems to be interested in is his adolescence preoccupation with his sex life with Lauren Sanchez, which only demonstrates just how shallow he really is.  He's no Gilded Age multimillionaire, many of whom having savagely exploited their workers and having grown so obscenely rich, they felt they had a public obligation hence many great institutions (NYC Public Library system).  

These legacy building philanthropic efforts do not wipe away the stain of profiteering, lawlessness & social damage.  The only accomplishment of Trump's foundation was to produce a life size painting of his ugliness."
2020-03-31 13:44:18,"With neither of the two parties willing to advocate for labor in any meaningful way, our workforce is the most abused and oppressed among the world’s wealthy nations."
2020-03-31 13:44:23,I wish the writer had expanded on the concept of contract/gig workers. Instacart and Amazon are just a fraction of the companies using them. There are countless jobs now filling that category: My Linkedin box is filled with them daily.
2020-03-31 13:55:22,"We canceled our Instacart order when we heard about the strike, and not just because we wanted to be safe. We are appalled that the workers are being exposed to COVID-19. 

The companies in question – Amazon Instacart - are owned by fabulously wealthy people. They can afford to pay their employees fairly and protect them against a deadly disease. In doing so, they are also protecting the public that receives the packages that the workers prepare. 

I agree that, for as long as the risk continues, people should not be permitted to shop in supermarkets and other food stores, nor should they be allowed in drugstores. A small staff, well paid and well protected, should be assembling packages for curbside delivery. That is happening in one or two stores in our area, and it works."
2020-03-31 14:03:20,"Instacart is a nuisance, even in normal times. I find it almost unbearable to shop at my local Whole Foods due to the swarm of Instacart pickers flying up and down the aisles stuffing their carts. Its like trying to shop in the middle of an episode of Grocery Games. All shopping by these services should be done in off hours and prepared for pickup the following day, especially in now with the need for distancing."
2020-03-31 14:04:25,"The ""stimulus bill"" passed by our clueless politicians just rewarded restaurant, hotel, and non-essential retail workers with a $600/week federal handout on Top of their state unemployment handout. These workers will collect this windfall for sitting at home and watching TV/playing video games.

The ""stimulus bill"" passed by our clueless politicians offers nothing for workers (nurses, grocery clerks, delivery workers, warehouse workers, etc) who are actually Still working during this crisis and putting themselves and their families at risk of catching the virus.

These folks have a right to be upset."
2020-03-31 14:04:38,"Where is the story here? It doesn't appear that there have been significant numbers of workers participating in these walkouts, and there apparently hasn't been any impact to operations. This is an attempt by organized labor activists to use the pandemic to try and organize non union businesses. Why else would a ""former"" Trader Joe's worker be trying to organize friends who still work there?"
2020-03-31 13:52:34,"Jeff Bezos needs to be arrested. Its simple. Arrest him, feed him bread and water , daily. His lawyer too. No human should be that rich, it means , in some ways not known, hes killed people. Thatmuch wealth doesnt come from "" hard work"", it comes from death."
2020-03-31 14:09:03,"Corporate America should pay these workers MUCH higher, including delivery workers. So much wealth concentrated for corporate management and others. Now, finally, it's time to pay fairly to the workers who actually do the work!"
2020-03-31 14:02:35,"I just received an email from Instacart trying to assure me their response is so great. The main points:

Their volume was up 40% yesterday alone
They will now give hand sanitizer to their shoppers
They will increase the default tip amount. 

THAT'S IT! Hand sanitizer, customers pay more all while their volumes are through the roof! This is despicable to say the least!

Instacart is seeing manifold increase in sales and all they can do for their workers is give them sanitizer and leave the pay at the discretion of the customer? They couldn't give the $5 hazard pay per order when the orders are much larger now, as everyone is trying to stock up for a few weeks. I and everyone I talk to already pay very generous tips to the shoppers. How about the company, which makes all these profits, compensates the people who risk getting sick more adequately."
2020-03-31 13:42:46,Good for these workers. Why it's almost French - take to the streets.
2020-03-31 14:05:28,"I stopped patronizing Amazon about a year ago. I've never used Instacart or any of the third party delivery services as the exploitation of these workers has always seemed pretty obvious to me. I understand people love convenience, but seriously, stop patronizing these exploitative, monopolistic vulture companies and shop your values. Maybe it's more inconvenient but the more we vote with our wallet, the louder the message we send"
2020-03-31 13:58:46,What new house is Jeff Bezos looking to buy today with his billions?   Shame on him not taking care of his employees who are on the front lines during this national disaster?   He turns my stomach.
2020-03-31 14:09:47,Their leverage to strike will never be greater than now.  I hope they win the concessions they're asking for and that the movement spreads.
2020-03-31 13:48:22,"Give them masks , so they are protected and the people they deliver too are protected, if you are going to give cops masks, then these people must be given masks as well... are their lives less important?"
2020-03-31 13:49:28,"These companies are making additional hundreds of millions, if not billions, from the health crisis. The way they treat their workers is morally reprehensible. Instacart offered a $25 bonus, what an incredible  insult to every worker. These capitalist CEOs are rolling in money at home in their mansions.  Their public statements are meaningless public relations comments, compared to the lived daily experience of those workers so essential to us all. It's hard for me to express my full outrage over their greed and selfishness."
2020-03-31 13:29:29,"Note to Jeff Bezos: 

We will remember. We will remember how you failed to require that your employees be protected as they filled order after order.

We will also remember how you and other multi-billionaires are failing to contribute significantly to alleviating your fellow Americans' financial worries. Toss in a few billion for rent and food and medical bills. You'll still have billions. (Especially after selling stock worth $3.4B.)"
2020-03-31 14:10:51,"My relative in a high coronavirus area had fever, cough, fatigue and body aches. Told had corona, no test available.  Then his wife got the same thing.  Both lucky to 1. Recover 2. Work from home.  However, as no test done--they did not meet criteria for limited testing  available, thanks Trump-- had they worked for Instacart, they wouldn't get sick leave, tho instructed to quarantine 14 days.
In what world is that fair?  Oh, right. The United States."
2020-03-31 13:56:55,"Who is providing you with more value right now...

A grocery store cashier making minimum wage with little to no benefits, or a gifted athlete making 10 million a year?  

A janitor whose work prevents more infection at the store or hospital, also on minimum wage I suspect, or a movie actor in his/her second home in the Maldives? 

The truck driver delivering supplies to hospitals or seniors' residences or Jeff Bezos sitting comfy in his palace trying to find ways he can benefit from the stimulus package?

Think about it. Hundreds of thousands of people working the front lines to keep the rest of us us fed and alive are unprotected and earning poverty wages.

If we can recognize, respect and compensate the workers for the value they bring to society, not just now, but at all times, then this pandemic will have had a silver lining (the drastic reduction in air pollution being another)"
2020-03-31 12:58:24,"The Instacart work stoppage was not about paid leave ( many or most Shoppers work part-time and do not rely on this activity as their main or full-time job ) or disinfectant, but about the financial abuse, Instacart subjects shoppers to by withholding tips up to 10 days for no justifiable reason.

Instacart also subjects Shoppers to other practices that also don't fairly compensate them.  

What has magnified this financial abuse is that the pandemic has doubled and tripled orders and customers have greatly increased tips that Instacart continues to refuse to pay Shoppers. The company has benefitted from a tremendous increase in revenue while they double and triple the work for shoppers with no increase in compensation or acknowledgement of the urgency or importance of the work during this crisis.

I am not aware of the basis for concern at Amazon, or other concerns, but Instacart caused the stoppage by treating Shoppers unfairly and refusing to pay Shoppers money they have earned."
2020-03-31 12:53:11,"Delivery workers, grocery store employees, gas station attendants, as well as health care providers are basically soldiers on the front lines of a battlefield.

2020-03-31 14:23:26,"Pay the workers! Keep them safe! It should be the law of the land!

I've been a self employed carpenter running a small business most of my life. I stopped hiring employees because I couldn't afford to pay them a living wage. I've always been of the conviction that I would rather not work than work for nothing!"
2020-03-31 14:24:56,"As a consumer, I stand with you!"
2020-03-31 14:29:05,"I absolutely agree with their concerns. They deserve protective gear and hazard pay. We all know Bezos has deep pockets. No doubt he can afford to pay his workers more, but he's also a sociopath who can't see past his own nose and doesn't really care about the people who make him his fortunes. This is evident by their firing of the whistle-blower.

Many grocery stores can't afford the protective gear or the hazard pay, and in those cases, the government needs to step in. These people put their lives on the lines so the rest of us can eat, and it's very brave. I'm totally fine with my tax dollars going to these fine American heroes. The should get every penny they deserve."
2020-03-31 14:42:07,"Amazon has been trying to secure protective gear for their frontline workers like all the hospitals have. They’re prioritizing shipments to doctors and nurses in hot spots. Employees will be provided gear, however the government is now buying up millions and millions of PPE at once and shipping to those they deem are in most need sometimes other countries who will pay more. That’s correct, shipping to other citizens not us.
Amazon employee."
2020-03-31 14:43:30,How can we support the strikers?  Is there a support fund?  Should we boycott targeted stores...until the stores put pressure on Instacart?
2020-03-31 14:45:56,"The availability of protection is a must, however a strike over pay at a time of extreme emergency is poor timing. While highly trained health workers are in the midst of the crisis and are bravely going about their jobs."
2020-03-31 14:46:12,"According to multiple other news outlets, the Amazon walkout garnered very little support, and the guy who organized it got fired for violating a directive that he remain at home in quarantine because of exposure to an individual who had tested positive for coronavirus.  

The Instacart strike was likewise a major fail.  

If these folks want more money and better working conditions, they should wait until this pandemic passes.  They will garner more sympathy from the public rather than  withholding their services when vulnerable people need them the most.  It makes them look callous."
2020-03-31 14:46:56,"COVID-19 is not spread through food. It's incredibly selfish and tone-deaf to be going out on strike now when people are dependent on delivered groceries and prepared food. I hope Instacart, Whole Foods and Trader Joe's treats these people on the harshest terms possible. These problem makers are easily replaced by the millions of recently unemployed."

For the investor class and the tech bro’s behind the “gig” economy labor and those who do it are commodities to be used and abused as needed. All the spokesperson spin and public relations lies to the contrary."
2020-03-31 14:45:55,"I posted this yesterday -

This is when the progressive feel-good liberal model rubs up against the classic conservative pro-business model -- 

Conservatives will tell you if the workers don't like the way they're being treated by their employer - they can simply quit and get another job - 

They will tell the liberals that if they don't like the way a company treats its employees - then they can simply refuse to do business with that employer - (and many liberals do just that) - and if enough people refuse to do business with them - they will lose money and go out of business -- 

Of course - even while refusing to patronize places like Walmart - the liberals don't want Walmart to go belly-up because then all those low-wage workers - the one's who can't ""just get another job"" - will be left unemployed -- 

The liberals don't want those people to lose their jobs - they want the company to pay their workers a ""living wage"" - provide them with health care, paid sick leave, vacation and maternity/paternity leave -- Guess what -- ? 

That's what labor unions are for - but these days, everyone hates labor unions because they have ""too much power"" -- 

And the real tragedy is -- if all those workers at Amazon, Instacart, Walmart, etc quit and walk away from their jobs -- there is always a seemingly-endless supply of replacements ready to take one of those below-the-poverty-line jobs -- 

Apparently - this system is so strong and powerful - even a pandemic can't put a stop to it..."
2020-03-31 14:49:12,If you can afford to have groceries hand picked and delivered you can afford another 5 dollar surcharge and a higher tip. Now is the time for solidarity.

We thank you for helping us during this pandemic.  We won't forget your sacrifices."
2020-03-31 14:52:47,We are not workers.  We are the skilled trades.  OSHA requires the employer to provide PPE.  Wage and Hour requires we be paid.  These laws are a result of all the Unions and their hard work.
2020-03-31 14:53:40,"I was at Wholefoods yesterday and none of the workers were wearing masks or gloves. Since I was wearing both, I was concerned not for myself but for them. Management should in fact be insisting that everyone is masked and gloved for their own protection. We should learn from the Asian countries where they know how to protect themselves from past experience.  This is one of the reasons the pandemic is far worse in the US."
2020-03-31 14:54:15,"Hmmm... about ""tipping"".

It seems like this is another situation where our contemporary social practices create vulnerabilities in a situation like the Covid-19 pandemic.

It seems likely that an exchange of cash for a tip provides a chance for transmission of Covid-19? 

Perhaps it would be an improvement if workers were paid more and we did not rely on tips for those workers to supplement a meager hourly pay rate?"
2020-03-31 14:56:17,Companies whose full and part time employees are on the front lines fighting the coronavirus should be required to provide health and life insurance for their families covering at least one year of expenses.
2020-03-31 14:57:41,Walking off the job may not be the shrewdest strategy as mass unemployment looms. None of these workers has bargaining unit protection so striking is not really the concept since they have no protections other than the employer's continued good will.
2020-03-31 15:07:46,"They are heroes to us.  Because of them, the health care workers do not need to treat us.  We are 75 and have been sequestered in our Bay Area home for three weeks, leaving our property only for walks.

We have very low personal anxiety ONLY because Instacart workers, postal carriers, and UPS/FedEx/Amazon drivers continue to deliver vital supplies.

Those deliveries go into our detached garage, where we have set up a sanitation station where anything touched by ""an outsider"" is cleaned as we wear nitrile gloves that are disposed in a ""hazmat"" garbage bag.  Perishables go into a second fridge in the garage for several days before being brought into the house, cleaned again in a segregated sink, and stored in the kitchen fridge.

We are safe, because they continue to make sacrifices that protect us.  They are the living definition of heroes.

And they get very generous tips.  They deserve them."
2020-03-31 15:07:59,"An Instacart worker is quoted as saying, ""Workers are touching every single thing that a customer receives in their order. If we get sick, invariably that means they are going to get sick too."" This statement represents a widespread misconception about coronavirus: That it is easily and frequently transmitted by touching contaminated surfaces. That the primary means of transmission is through the air seems not to be registering with some people. 

As the Times notes in a section at the end of this article, ""How does coronavirus spread? It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It MAY also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face."" (Emphasis added.) 

While there is great concern among store employees about catching the virus, there is as yet no clear evidence that store workers are actually at high risk. Most store employees encounter customers only very briefly, and usually at a distance of several feet. If there is a rash of store-related-cases or deaths, we have yet to hear about it. It might help to calm many fears if case-data included information about the patient's occupation and how the patient is thought to have acquired the virus. My guess is that family contacts are a much more common source of transmission than work contacts."
2020-03-31 15:09:28,"People on the front lines (hospital workers, shoppers) need a huge compensation package as well as all the proper gear to keep them safe.  These workers are performing a national service to keep the rest of us safe.  I hope we take a step back to see how our civilization has veered off course if and when we emerge from this pandemic.  It is time to respect hard working Americans who put their lives on the line and stop worshiping athletes and entertainers who do absolutely nothing to hold our nation together in time of need.  There is so much we have forgotten in the Me-Me society we live in.  The reckoning is long overdue.  If Instacart comes to my door they will get a very generous tip for their service and my appreciation.  They are true American heroes."
2020-03-31 15:11:07,"There is a real affect on the instacart service, in DC at least. We have been using them for the past 3 weeks with Costco and Safeway. We had a delivery scheduled yesterday from Costco that got delayed 30 minutes at a time until getting canceled after 8 - when trying to reschedule there are not open times. Trying to call the support line last night I was on hold for over 90 minutes and gave up when I was told it would be another 75 minutes, and then this morning it  was still over a 50 minute phone wait time the recording said.

Customers are willing to pay these workers who are risking themselves to help keep us safe. We might have to use instacart now in an emergency, but how they treat their team (employees or contractors) during this time will be remembered afterward by both those team members and their customers."

Coverage of the pandemic by corporate media, CNN and MSNBC, Nytimes is similar to the coverage of gun violence.  A focus on heroic efforts of individuals and blaming particular people like Trump.  There is no attempt to look at the deep causes about our unpreparedness...the rot that exists in our political system and the media. The blind eye to poverty, homelessness, the thousands of people we cage that Clintonian Democrats and Reaganite Republicans are both guilty of.

2020-03-31 17:34:14,"Why won't people share? Jeff Bezos has a personal fortune of $119.9 billion. Okay, so he doesn't have all of it in his mattress. But surely he could access a few billion, right? He could provide some security and safe working environments for 10 million or so front line retail, shipping, and supplier personnel -- the folks who keep all the rest of us going, day by day, and who are perpetually underpaid for high-risk work. Surely he and his counterparts in other industries could do that and keep the country running, till we're all through this thing. And maybe they could help out with health-care workers too. Please don't come at me with charges of socialism and how anti-American that is.

What has the world come to when people don’t even shop for their own groceries? Talk about being completely removed from the sources of their food.

Yes, I understand that the home bound or elderly might need these services, but the rest of us should be ashamed. You don’t have time to walk or drive to the grocery store and interact with the people of your community, but you have time to binge several shows a week?

Every neighborhood should have community gardens, farmers markets, locally owned grocery stores, locally owned restaurants and shops.

NOW is the time to shut down Amazon, Whole Foods, Walmart, etc. and return to the model of locally owned stores which operate as a part of the community.

Convenience and a little time saved are not worth the destruction of the fabric of our society. Buy Local.

2020-03-31 18:03:08,"My husband is a cashier for Whole Foods.  He will not go on strike despite the fact that he is over 60 with health issues that make him more prone to the virus.  Why - because he feels he is being treated fairly on his ""store level"".  He is provided with gloves, hand sanitizer and is required to clean his area between each customer and he sometimes works the closing shift, which means he witnesses that the store is being thoroughly cleaned and sanitized at the end of the day.  He also takes pride in what he does and his regular customers are thanking him for being there.  This is probably not true for all stores because they operate under different management.  

I would, however, like to blast the CEO Jeff Bezos, the RICHEST man in the United States because I feel he takes advantage of his workers on a daily basis, but especially during a crisis.  It isn't fair that his makes BILLIONS in profits each year, while his workers are now on the front line of a crisis and dangering their health.  If his workers can be paid an additional $2 hourly during this crisis, then he can afford to pay them that increase all of the time."
2020-03-31 18:58:12,"If we had a progressive government that had labor/wages enforceable regulations then these robber baron companies would have to treat workers so they could afford a middle class.

Workers shouldn't have to rely on striking to get the considerations they deserve."
2020-03-31 19:07:42,"I suggest caution on the part of these workers.  When all of this is over, there will be many people out of work, and employers will remember who sought additional pay and benefits during this period of time."
2020-03-31 19:09:57,"I find it hard to believe that this walk-out is organized by Whole Foods Team Members. Reading through the linked website, it sounds like it was created by a union. Whole Foods is notorious for taking excellent care of its employees (I was one for 10 years). The unions have wanted Whole Foods Market's employees' business for decades, and now they see an opportunity. I feel strongly that employees should receive protection, especially right now. Maybe Amazon culture has permeated Whole Foods culture more deeply, but my instinct is that this is externally-organized. The business practices of the grocery unions has been deeply shameful and misleading in my experience. NYT should take a closer look at who is organizing, and for what purpose."
2020-03-31 20:45:44,"Unfortunately workers who speak up for health and safety are fired! Kris King did a noble thing when he stood up to management, knowing he’d likely be fired. The workers sacrifice gave these corporations huge profits during this stressful time. Are wearing disposable gloves and using some hand sanitizer really that offensive to customers? Keep our frontline workers safe and healthy!"
2020-03-31 21:37:31,"Instacart said it was going to suggest customers tip more.  So leave it to the customers to pay more, the workers to risk their health, and the profiteers to keep raking in the money.  
And Jeff Bezos, with all his brilliance, could not figure out that his workers would need ppe.  Every Amazon employee and ""contractor"" should have full medical care and paid sick leave, at least for a year.  Bezos can afford it."

2020-03-31 23:00:24,"I am in full agreement with supplying workers with safety equipment like hand sanitizer, gloves and masks. None what so ever. But I do have a problem with the hazard pay. This is ridiculous. Perhaps I say this because I am a physician and will receive absolutely no hazard pay while taking care of sick patients during this pandemic. None. The workers at Amazon and Whole Foods ought to be happy that they have a job, because many have lost theirs. Small businesses are closing. At this point in this outbreak everyone is functioning under risk. So why should one group get more for that risk than another? The fact that the unions are behind this explains a lot and I think it is despicable.

Demanding safety equipment for essential workers is righteous. Demanding hazard pay is akin to price gouging."
2020-04-01 00:11:15,"Not surprising.  After the Black Death in the middle ages, the shortage of labour was so intense that the wages of farm workers went up significantly, and the balance of power between the peasants and the landed gentry changes irrevocably."
2020-04-01 00:55:18,These workers should get at least $5-10 more per hour for hazard pay. The shoppers are in markets all day exposed to the virus in different venues. Cashiers and super market workers are as much on the frontline as medical workers . These people deserve gratitude and respect but even more they need protective gear and a big raise.
2020-04-01 01:13:25,"When Mother Nature decided to stop majority of human enterprise, so many truths--large and small--came to the forefront. All humans are equality precious or expendable; it doesn't matter whether you are royalty or homeless. Yet the health care one will get and the other won't is very different, country to country and class to class. In the US, the pandemic is proving the inequity, inaptitude and greed of a very expensive system that delivers mediocre results to our society. Only the wealthy have access to healthcare that compares to the one accessible to every citizen in Finland among many other countries. The Amazon example has brought home something that was becoming evident before--not only gig economy workers have little protection in ""normal"" times, but they are treated like expendables in times of pandemic. After decades of union bashing, these folks are facing what factory workers among many others faced decades ago. It's time to unionize, and as with every worker movement, expect to see push back from the boss."
2020-04-01 02:32:18,"This is the second story in two days where Instacart has said the strike actions have had no impact on their operations. My groceries were not delivered as planned (though I have paid already). Didn't get an email until about 8 PM asking me to reserve a new time, in which I could not. My friend a couple towns over was supposed to receive her order on Monday and did not get hers as well.

I believe the workers definitely deserve what they're asking for, but the company needs to come clean and stop painting a picture like it's business as usual. And also, proper communication (in advance) would be better. I have two small children at home and we will have to figure out what to do if the groceries don't get delivered a second time around."

2020-03-30 17:40:21,"As somebody who quite literally hates most of the music heard in this house-bound telethon, I still salute the singers who appeared (I refuse to use the term 'artists'; sorry) for their goodwill effort to enhance the coffers of a worthy cause. I hope they were very successful. Two things I do object to, one more than the other: 1) These were telecast on just about every Fox TV station and outlet in the nation, but that does not appear in the heading, and is mentioned only once, in the first sentence, by Mr. Pareles. Good for Mr. Pareles, as I'm sure the Times would have been just as happy to leave this attribution out of the report, and 2) The article does not mention how much the concert raised for its cause, surely a matter of interest to readers. Quite honestly, I was somewhat surprised to see it reported on at all in the Times because of its Fox association, but I do hope it was successful, so let us know."
2020-03-30 19:38:02,"While I respect and salute the performers, I could not bear to watch anything connected to the FOX Network. The very name gives me the shivers and makes me so angry that any possible enjoyment is negated. Ain’t got time for that these days.￼"

I believe over $3.3 million was donated to Feeding America, which I know is working extremely hard to sustain its nationwide network that feeds the hungry, of which there are sadly too many in this country. Thank you Elton John and everyone who sang, talked, listened, and gave generously!"
2020-03-30 20:41:58,"I watched and thought it was great. Many thanks to Elton John for doing this. I particularly thought Billie Joe Armstrong's ""I Walk Alone"" and Dave Grohl's ""Hero"" were very moving.

The only disappointment was Sir Elton himself only performed a single verse of his classic ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me."""
2020-03-30 20:51:59,Only a sitcom showed.  No concert.
2020-03-31 00:25:06,"""Elton John, the host of the hourlong show, called for donations as he introduced the performers. He also pointedly connected the pandemic to a previous one: H.I.V./AIDS.""

I watched the show and enjoyed it.  And I was appreciative of the effort to raise funds for a good cause in troubled times.

However, I found Elton's comment linking the current crisis to the HIV/AIDS pandemic to be wholly inappropriate, and a little disingenuous.  I don't mean to minimize the tragedy of the HIV/AIDS tragedy - it was terrible - but we understood fairly early on how HIV was transmitted, and how to prevent its transmission (with far less serious social and economic consequences than with the current coronavirus).  

HIV was never something that threatened you just by virtue of walking outside your home or shopping in the local supermarket."
2020-03-31 15:24:57,"Can we please stop looking to celebrities to tells us where to divert money most of us don't have? It's bad enough many of us (myself included) has wasted so much of our own personal, highly limited, wealth on their products to make people like Alicia Keys and Elton John fabulously wealthy, but now we have to listen to them preach to us to do the right thing? We all already give a huge part of our income away. It's called taxes. How about diverting some of those monies away from military spending (which, depending on where you look, is as high as 24% or out total taxes) and move that towards helping those individuals who are being crushed by this virus (and, yes, the foodbank). Better yet, how many pennies does it take for someone like Elton John to match our contributions? Not took much, as he'll be able to right it off his taxes  anyway."

2020-04-02 15:10:43,Maybe the quick stay at home orders by Democrat Governor Pritzger of Illinois is why the rates of infection and deaths are far less than in Mew York which acted at a snail’s pace.
2020-04-01 13:12:55,"It appears as though we've been hoodwinked on the mask wearing. Look at countries where it is common to wear masks. The virus is under control in many of them. Why is CDC still just ""weighing"" an advisory? CDC studies show that it helped during SARS, and they are still offering the lame excuse that it may not be socially acceptiable in America. Please."
2020-04-01 13:25:44,"Please answer this question : is it fair to assume that asymptomatic individuals go through a similar incubation period and length of illness as someone with symptoms? This question is not directly addressed. In other words, what I’d a typical range if time , from contracting the virus to recovering, that asymptomatic individuals can be contagious? 

 As I understand it , after  symptoms generally appear within 5-14 days of exposure ( with perhaps some unusual outliers) and then the disease runs its course. 

is this time frame applicable to symptomatic carriers as well?"
2020-04-01 13:26:21,"It was all about managing supplies, which I understand and agree with, but the point is an easy one and basic common sense.  Even if only the sick should wear the mask, when a virus is undetectable, even for a day or two, like most flu, if everyone wears a mask, all the sick are wearing masks as well and the spread curve is flattened.  It’s a supply issue that I fully blame on this administration, the last several administrations and, for some reason this group is getting a pass, HOSPITAL ownership and management:  why is only the government responsible for maintaining supplies for a pandemic.  Either your a private company with adequate supplies and a supple supply chain or your not."
2020-04-01 13:35:17,"The lack of testing is also leading to a gross underestimate of the population of infected but asymptomatic (better to say subclinical) people.  

South Korean data showed about a third of their infections were among twenty to thirty year olds, yet almost none of these people ended up in hospitals.

Perhaps more concerning than the young adults, children are almost certainly infected but display recognizable symptoms rarely.  They can infect each other readily and then bring it home where they infect their families.  How many tests have been done on children?  

We failed completely.  This could all have been prevented."
2020-04-01 13:35:48,"Because of the asymptomatic carriers, it is vital to ramp up the availability of tests so we can identify those who have the virus and who does not. Until we can test everyone multiple times, we will not be able to contain the pandemic."
2020-04-01 13:41:01,Just a little bit of pain and a little patience now can go a long way to make this as short and as harmless to others.
2020-04-01 13:45:18,"When experts widely share information that defies common sense, it breeds mistrust and elevates fear even higher. Perhaps we all don't need to be wearing N95 masks, but it is obvious that any mask will cut down on inadvertent spread from coughing and sneezing, etc. Along those lines, I am still going to be cleaning my groceries and setting shelf stable things aside for a week in my garage."
2020-04-01 13:45:25,"Without testing, how can the epidemiologists know where we stand?  It was disappointing when Dr Birx rationalized why there were 26 million tests that had been left unused, and that we were waiting to use the newer and quicker ones.  This feels like another month of lost opportunity to collect data, not to mention treating the people who produce positive test results."
2020-04-01 13:54:37,"This article severely underplays the numbers of aymptomatic people and cherry picks from articles.  For example, on the princess cruise, this article says 18% of the infected were asymptomatic. However, I read this in the linked study:

""Of the 634 confirmed cases, a total of 306 and 328 were reported to be symptomatic and asymptomatic, respectively. The proportion of asymptomatic individuals appears to be 16.1% (35/218) before 13 February, 25.6% (73/285) on 15 February, 31.2% (111/355) on 16 February, 39.9% (181/454) on 17 February, 45.4% (246/542) on 18 February, 50.6% (314/621) on 19 February and 50.5% (320/634) on 20 February""

As time went on more and more people got infected and more of them were asymptomatic:50.5% on Feb 20.

This is more in line with  the Vo, italy study which found 50% to 75% of the infected were asymptomatic.

Other conclusions here such as infection just by breathing the shared air on the infected people has been obvious for some time now: Clearly people are not spending time around coughers and sneezers these days, ergo regulary breathing of shared air is a major source of infection."
2020-04-01 13:58:00,"taking this with yesterday's stories about hospital administrators and physician department heads punishing their provider staffs for wearing masks in hospital corridors and the attempts to tell not just the public, but also providers, that masks were only needed in cases of certain symptoms is it any surprise that we are where we are?

I've been masking in any patient situation that might be virus related (fatigue, sore muscles, etc.) as my husband is immune suppressed from his cancer therapy.  
it's been a four year habit at this point for us and yet, like providers everywhere, I wonder if I've done enough to keep my family safe while caring for my patients.  
and I wonder how many patients have picked up this virus in the course of seeking care. 

when we come through this so much needs to change, starting with who is in power and how they share information and arrive at decisions - at so may levels in both the public and private sector."
2020-04-01 14:00:00,"The CDC has been thoroughly incompetent during this epidemic. First, they botched the tests and then refused to use the WHO test depriving us valuable time to get ahead of the curve. Now they are still prevaricating on mask advice when it is clear from the experience of other countries ( and are previous studies on flu) that it would help. 

The FDA also bungled and they are now hesitant to approve home tests which can expand testing without exposing medical workers.

I think we have come to believe we are a great nation and don’t need to learn from others when what makes nations great is a willingness to learn from other’s experiences."
2020-04-01 14:01:36,This also highlights the need to be able to test the entire population to see if they have developed the antibodies consistent with having had the infection and otherwise recovered. Those people could go back to work safely and also become potential serum donors.
2020-04-01 14:01:57,"Love to wear a mask. Looked all over yesterday, including online.  Nothing available at any price until late April.  Thank you President Trump and the administration's love of the private sector."
2020-04-01 14:19:26,"It still comes down to the matter of testing and availability. If a significant number are carriers how does this compare to other viruses and common bacteria? Is this an exaggerated version of a Typhoid Mary type scenario? If we test and mask could we bring much of the economy back on line? This is as much a failure of imagination and resource allocation as it is a medical crisis. We know how to make masks & other protective gear, we are or have developed tests that deliver results, the time between test and results is narrowing significantly. Yet leadership continues to dither and posture. The solutions are simple, the political and societal will is the impediment. The very leaders who were in denial about the breadth of this crisis continue to refuse to take the required actions to have both testing and protective gear as a national & international priority. If you think locking down the economy is a dangerous path to take then insist that Trump use his emergency powers. He should designate testing and protective gear as national security requirements require industry to produce these “necessities” now, not when its the most profitable. If this is “war” and testing and protective gear are “weapons” then its past time for our “war time” president to do his job instead of posturing, photo opps and press conferences."
2020-04-01 14:31:25,"There are almost no population-level studies yet, but 100% of one small town in Italy (3,000 people) was tested for the virus. 50% of those who tested positive were free of symptoms. A further large slice can be expected to have had mild symptoms, and not notice them in normal circumstances. All of those people would have been able to infect others.

The spatial pattern of the epidemic is suggestive of both asymptomatic spread and a relatively long incubation period. 

The resistance to wearing face masks is something that distinguishes Western countries from East Asia, where wearing a mask when showing symptoms of cold or flu has long  been regarded as a sign of consideration for others. Thus, extending wearing to everyone was a fairly small step. In Europe or North America, however, there is a large ""maskophobia"" to overcome."
2020-04-01 14:38:31,"The decision was made by the medical community that all masks, N-95 or regular surgical type masks, must be preserved for Covid-19 health care providers.  Anyone paying attention knew the statement for the public not to wear them was driven by a desire to keep the general public from trying to hoard and use them - none of this was science based.  Even at the start there was a clear disconnect between only wear a mask if you are sick... but a large chunk of people with the virus have no symptoms to know they are sick.  In essence, in an effort to preserve masks for medical professionals we increased the spread."
2020-04-01 14:41:50,"The disease and what it can do to us is not going to change regardless of whether we have a mask on or not, only we can change and if putting a mask on everybody does that then we should all put one on."
2020-04-01 14:42:13,"Chinese medical staff now working in Italy have warned Italian authorities to not make the same mistakes they did early on.
Those with mild symptoms can not be sent home to self isolate. You need to quarantine those individuals in an another setting.
Their experience has shown those who isolate at home transmit the virus to family members who are then transmitters too.
We need to use best practices."
2020-04-01 13:19:13,Everyone should be wearing. There should be no shortage of something as essential as a mask.

Trump is visiting the CDC during a global pandemic of proportions we haven’t seen in over 100 years. And in it, he’s wearing a campaign hat, Keep America Great.

Even in our greatest struggle, this guy is worried about campaigning and is marketing himself. That should tell you everything."
2020-04-01 13:52:54,Look the Corona virus would be here.   The tragedy we are experiencing could have been mitigated if we had leaders instead of political hacks.

If masks did not protect people from the transmission of germs, i.e. bacteria and viral spread, then why on earth do medical people wear them for every procedure.? This along with the testing debacle and the lies coming from the White House have made this pandemic all the worse￼.  Thankfully, local leaders and state leaders have wrested control of messaging and in many states, such as mine, common sense measures are in place and have been for sometime. I have an N 95 mask and I wear it when I go out.  I don't care what people say. Instead of spreading misinformation, health authorities could have been of service by instructing people how to wear with the masks.  Everywhere I go I see people with the masks on incorrectly. Will we ever again be able￼￼ to trust those in charge?"
2020-04-01 14:24:01,Let's be honest.  Authorities misled the public for the purpose of reserving masks for healthcare workers.

If you get the virus and are asymptomatic, how long are you contagious?"
2020-04-01 14:35:10,"The general public has little or no access to N65 masks, hand sanitizer or hand soap. The government at first advised the public didn't really need masks. Now they're leaning towards everyone should wear a mask but there are none available to the public because they are going to the first responders who need them, deservedly so. What a conundrum!"

The Administration seems to want to not disturb Americans by having us wear masks as it creates Chinese and China as the Enemy.  Masks are common in China and us Americans would rather blame China than kowtow to foreign elite over educated scientists. Blaming China because ""they released this on the world "" is not a good reason to continue to allow the spread by doing the same things China did. We are promoting the spread by limiting testing ""so our numbers look good ""."

2020-04-01 14:10:06,"Why doesn't the CDC just admit that this virus is airborne and that although it doesn't affect everybody, just like the common flu, it does some?
It will take a long time to figure out who those persons, their body chemistry, their makeup that made them more prone to be affected while some people will just be carriers and many more will likely feel no effects or be affected at all.
I would love to actually read something that will give a definitive answer as to where and how this virus came to be.
I've have heard from a bat.
Are there other bats in the area that have been tested to see if that has any validity and have they determined who is person or persons 'A', who were the original host(s).
I can understand, based on the logistics of how an original infected person has now made this virus that started in one area of the world has now affected the entire world.
It reminds me of the bubonic plague in many ways.
But most of all we need to know the truth.
And a question that has peeked the minds of many.
Was this, or could this be the results of an experiment gone bad?"
2020-04-01 14:13:45,"I was on a delta flight yesterday from Minneapolis to Phoenix. While there were only twenty or thirty passengers, one young woman was coughing. I heard her coughing in the waiting area. She did little to cover her mouth when coughing. Thankfully I wore a mask and nitrile gloves. No one amongst the crew said anything to her. In China we saw people with thermal guns checking temperatures on passengers in airports. So? What? We just succumb to the inevitable? Why did delta not act responsibly here?"
2020-04-01 14:48:40,Will/does recovery  from Covid-19 confer appreciable immunity from re-infection?  Are there variants to Covid-19?  Medical treatments to flu and common cold seem weak.  Does research suggest a better outlook for 'chemical' treatment of Covid-19?  Is a possible re-establishment of the virus back into local domestic or feral animal populations a concern?
2020-04-01 14:49:52,"""But studies by his team have shown, he said, that some people never notice their symptoms, others are unable to distinguish the infection from their smoker’s cough or allergies or other conditions, and still others may feel every pain acutely.""

It's this ""hidden carrier"" aspect of people who are still able to spread the illness even without symptoms that I've always found so chilling.

Absent testing everyone, impossible when it's still hard to test those who need it, the only way to operate in today's landscape is to presume everyone has it, will have it, has had it, or might have it and thus be able to spread it.

Thus masks.  The discussion of masks has been badly managed from the get-go, because  clearly preventable shortages are dictating public health rules, when it should be vice versa."

If the people hoarding masks and gloves would just pass them out to neighbors that don't have any it would  help things. Every person that gets a mask is one less person that might spread the virus. But, too many selfishly hoard."
2020-04-01 15:06:36,"I see a new reality/future for Americans, whereby once this COVID thing is over, more of us (esp those who live in dense cities) will continue to wear masks as a matter of course (similar to what is seen in  China, Japan, etc.), and in particular when we are riding mass transit, attending the theatre, etc.  I think if we view the wearing of a mask as a 'public service', more people will be inclined to continue to do so, going forward."
2020-04-01 15:16:59,"We've been hearing about the possibility of pandemics for years. Why have governmental agencies not been stockpiling masks, tests, ventilators, surgical gear, etc. for immediate availability? 

We have national reserves of oil.  Why not this?  Apparently we are capable of learning from disasters only AFTER they occur (if then).  This was predictable."
2020-04-01 15:02:25,"No one should be waiting for an 'official recommendation' to wear a mask.  Put the masks on now.  I've been shocked and dismayed to see so many service workers (i.e., cashiers at the market with no masks, and no temporary barriers installed - such as other markets now have - to separate customer from cashier).  I've been wearing my mask for over a month now, as their statement that only 'the sick' should wear them (whatever 'sick' meant?) made zero sense to me.

Masks surely cannot hurt you to wear.
They just might prevent you from getting COVID.
With many being asymptomatic, your wearing of a mask is also performing a service to others.
Masks remind us not to touch our faces (nose/mouth).

Still, we also need to understand that a mask guarantees nothing, and that distancing and hand-washing must be done in conjunction."
2020-04-01 15:08:53,"South Korea did it right but they don’t have civil liberties as we do. 

Before this hit the states I thought I better make sure I have masks. I got scolded online for wanting to wear a mask and that I shouldn’t buy any and save them. Now look. Months later “ we should all be wearing masks”. What kind of CDC do we have ? Look at this gross incompetence- it’s not just Trump. We all could guess this was going to be spread to the USA .

Never did I think I would see my childhood home of NYC w trucks of bodies and tents in Central Park. I can’t even think of it without tears . I’m not there but my heart is w you NY. 

We should have been testing in January. We should have been wearing masks. Did anyone read the news in December? We knew this was coming. - all of us. Why didn’t we care then?"
2020-04-01 15:15:06,"TEST, TEST, TEST. To control something you have to be able to measure it."
2020-04-01 15:15:22,"Two random thoughts/comments:
1. There is very little info so far on the sensitivity and specificity of the covid-19 tests. (Frequency of false positives and false negatives.) This is another challenge in accurately identifying the rate of asymptomatic infections, as a high false positive rate would overestimate it. (Link to geeky but excellent article about this: <a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/31/covid-19-overcoming-testing-challenges"" target=""_blank"">https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/31/covid-19-overcoming-testing-challenges</a>/)
2. The increased suspicion about aerosol transmission may be another reason why long term care facilities have been hit particularly hard. Nebulizer treatments, which are an ideal vehicle for aerosolizing the virus and allowing it to both spread farther and stay airborne longer, are common in these facilities during flu season. Perhaps that is a warning for anyone at home with possible covid-19 symptoms. Neb treatments may be a particularly efficient means of passing the virus to family/housemates."
2020-04-01 15:22:08,"This is why everyone should be wearing a face mask when out in public. It reduces the chance of getting infected, but it massively reduces the ability to spread the virus. 

Even a three-layer bandana over your nose and mouth will help."
2020-04-01 15:11:52,"Asymptomatic carriers is one of the known known's. Typhoid Mary being a legendary example of the problem oft used to drive home the importance of following medical guidelines even if you do not comprehend why it is necessary to follow them. 
I get the feeling all this talk about known known's as if they are new information to the general population are attempts to avoid talking about why no one in authority acted to limit the damage (also a known known) when the problem was known to be a problem at the beginning of January?"
2020-04-01 15:18:02,"The good new is that labs are reporting that COVID-19 appears to be stable. It does not seem to mutate rapidly ad continuously does flu. This means A COVID-19 vaccine, once developed, should be highly effective. 

The labs are also reporting that people infected with COVID-=19 develop antibodies. Once infected with COVID-19, people will be immune or partially immune to future outbreaks .

 All this makes COVID-19 less dangerous than flu. Flu has already kill more than 24,000 American during the 2019-2010 season, which runs until October 1. During last flu season, flu killed 61,000 Americans. There has not been a season with less than 12,000 flu deaths since the CDC started keeping count in 2005."
2020-04-01 15:35:09,"Given the new evidence coming out regarding transmission of C19, it seems more reasonable now to ask everyone to wear a mask, in addition to social distancing. There are a few reasonable objections, but the burden of evidence now seems to be on the side of wearing masks in addition to all other preventive measures. I ordered mine today!"
2020-04-01 15:41:45,"I may have been in this group:  The last week of February, I had the weirdest headache across the back of my head with terrible neck/shoulder muscle pain.  I was still taking the bus to work at this time.  

The symptoms felt bad for a day, better the next, and then worse the third day.  The next 2 days I wasn't in pain, but just tired - and then I was fine.  I never felt feverish or had a sore throat/cough.  

This was a week before my office began working from home!"
2020-04-01 15:42:56,"Sounds like a plan to me, but where do we get the masks, if hospitals, ERs and first responders can't get them?

2020-04-01 15:19:50,"Let's think about talkative people who not only exhale, possibly transmitting the virus, but who also take it up a notch with spirited conversations. How many supermarket employees have to listen to people yakking away at the other side of their counters, either directing it to them or their cell phones. How many times have you caught a tiny cold drop land on your body from just a mere conversation? Yes, masks can help maintain the waterworks.

So it's a good idea to keep the spirited spittle at a minimum in public places also, even if you think you are 6 feet away.

I've heard this said: ""Think positive---meaning think like you are CV-19 positive and act accordingly"". We know that there's a high percentage of asymptomatic transmission,  and we have known for a while---so be vigilant and mindful in everything you do."
2020-04-01 15:22:36,"This is why we will never contain this virus. The best we can do is slow the spread. i hope we learn from this for the next time, because it’s “when” not “if.”"
2020-04-01 15:26:47,Maybe the test is not very good? Could many of these asymptomatic carriers simply be 'false positives'?
2020-04-01 15:26:50,"Of course the use of face masks for everyone would slow down the spread.  Look at Honk Kong's example.  The CDC is incredibly incompetent and very late for this suggestion, which is still not a recommendation.  Of course, there's not enough masks to go around, unfortunately."
2020-04-01 15:28:21,"“Rapid tests for infection might help detect people...”
Might??? Why is this merely speculation? The “president” originally said testing would be available to everyone. If only that were true. 
How can anyone make statements on the number of infected people when tests continue to be largely unavailable? The number of cases reported are nothing but estimates. When maps show areas of the country with very few cases, this is dangerous misinformation that can give people a false sense of security, putting them at even greater risk. 
The federal government has shown gross negligence, mishandling every aspect of this crisis from the very beginning. 
And tragically, as a result, hundreds of thousands of Americans will die."
2020-04-01 15:36:09,"Massive confusion about Masks for everyone started at the CDC of all places.
Having access to all Covid 19 info, they refused to do the same what China and Korea had done immediately; provide. everyone with masks.
Ridiculed by foreign governments, including the USA, China and Korea have proven to be the only countries who did it right and have the lowest death toll.
Our CDC, their hands cut of by large cuts of Trump’s anti science actions, were fully unprepared for this virus, despite all the info available to them.
Especially unprepared for even the most common supplies, like masks, gloves and face shields.
To hide the governments fully unpreparedness in supplies, they denied that masks would help, to make the few that were available to healthcare workers.
Although I can understand that, it doesn’t absolve them from their failure to have demanded a massive stock pile of Hospital equipment, supplies and medication in the first place.
Fema, always unprepared with their infamous incompetent leadership and their outdated expired American stockpile, is useless.
The un-preparedness of for profit hospitals itself, shows that capitalism will never care for their citizens. American bussiness plans have always been to wait for the disaster and then wait for the government to jump in with massive bailouts to make even more profit.
These CEO’s, along with Trump, his   White House clan, the weakened and easy to influence CDC, they all share complete responsibility for many deaths."
2020-04-01 15:38:05,"The fact that the coronavirus is being spread by people who feel perfectly fine is all the more reason why there should be scientific random testing of everyone, not just people exhibiting  symptoms or serious symptoms.  Israel has started random testing.  What are WE waiting for?"
2020-04-01 15:40:05,"The attempts at quantitating viral transmission by those who are infected but asymptomatic, apparently reveals that yes they can spread the disease but at significantly lower efficiency than those who are actively sick. I think the remedies are the same. 

Practice social distancing. 

Wash hands thoroughly, especially after being in a public space or with someone in your home who is infected. 

Just never touch your face as this is the primary mode of transmission, i..e. from a contaminated surface or infected person to your mouth, nose, eyes. 

Wear some sort of mask or scarf when out in a crowded space like the grocery store. If nothing else, this should help you remember to not touch your face.

If you are sick never go out until you recover.  

On a bright note, I have been watching the daily numbers in Italy for some weeks. It really does seem that they reached the peak of daily infections about 4-5 days ago. So our Italian friends may be able to move about more freely in about 4-5 weeks. 

I wish everyone well."
2020-04-01 15:41:20,"When the CDC says the only the sick should wear masks, they are correct. The problem with their incomplete guidance is that all people in the United States should assume they are sick."

2020-04-01 15:51:46,"Interesting about the Dr. suggesting that people where masks in supermarkets. I have a mask that I could have worn in the market yesterday but decided to leave it in the car. My reason is that I wanted to keep it wearable until we get to the higher transmission rates that are expected later this month. That, or if I get infected and don't care to spread it.  I did notice that the number of mask wearers had doubled in my area market since last week. I'd guess it's now nearing 30%. 
During my stroll around the market, it took some effort to stay a safe distance from others. Some people shop like they drive. ""Must tailgate now."" There was one woman who was coughing a bit. I looked at her and saw that she had a surgical mask on at least. Then some yo-yo walks by me in the main aisle just yacking away on his phone. I veered as far as I could but might have only cleared 5' or so. I thought that this was a new type of rude in this environment of caution. Perhaps supermarkets should post ""No cell phone conversations in store, unless wearing a mask. Texts OK.""?  That would seem prudent if the virus is being broadcast by relatively normal air expulsion."

China and other Asian countries have been saying this since at least Feb. Today is April 1st and CDC just realized that?

2020-04-01 15:54:00,"So much of the fear and doubt in this article would be erased if we just had access to adequate testing. Notice that people you interact with seem to get sick? Test yourself for COVID. Your relative who's been in an airport arrives at your door? Test them for COVID.

Two out of four members of my household are currently sick (with not perfectly COVID-like, but not completely un-COVID-life symptoms), and we are being told by our doctors that there is not a means or a need for us to be tested.

What percentage of the population to we intend to let occupy this place where they are neither sure that they do nor sure that they don't carry the disease?

I am curious how, if we estimate that between 7% - and lets say 20% - of the population is asymptomatic, this affects the models?  I would assume it means it spreads faster than we originally thought, but perhaps it means we reach some form of herd immunity quicker?

Politicizing this outbreak and going over and over our leaders' missteps is at best unhelpful and at worst demoralizing to our country.  (I'm looking at you trolls - we all know you're out there.)  If Trump underestimated the virus, so did de Blasio (clearly) and so did every other major government figure across the globe except a handful of those leaders closest to China who learned from SARS.  What we can do as a national is make sure that we prioritize pandemic preparation in the future so that we are well-prepared for the next one."

We should all be wearing masks! Give it a chance now and maybe 200,000 or greater Americans will not have to die. Let’s all do what it takes to lower the numbers. Of course the supplies go first to the police,fire fighters and health care workers!"

Also, their use should be normalized through PSAs, and with the voluntary assistance of entertainment stars and social media influencers.

Experts in this field knew back then what the answer was: not nearly as much as NOT doing the test in everyone.  You can not properly treat a patient or a population without a diagnosis. Trump bungled the who affair and continues to do so. COVID-19 has laid bare all his many inadequacies and we are and will continue to pay the price. His lack of leadership and reckless actions will cost thousands of Americans their lives."

In fact, the article studies medical students who were not wearing masks. There is no mention anywhere in the journal article about masks. 

The Surgeon General has thus based his guidance against masks on either on an outright lie or a serious impairment of capability.  Adams is clearly unqualified and should step down immediately. 

No one in the media fact checked this assertion as far as I can tell yet it was widely reported. That is also really bad. In the daily briefings our public Health care leadership consistently references ""the data"" as the basis for their decision making. 

In fact, there is no peer review of their decision making process about the ""data""! The journalists in the room prefer not to ask tough questions of Fauci and Birx, and Adams is shielded almost completely from scrutiny. So sad and tragic that our lives so much depend upon these appointed officials actions or in actions. We in the medical profession need to do much better in raising our voices in this crisis about this fundamental problem. 

The tv doctors on CNN, FOX do a disservice when they are willing to fawn over our public health officials without doing what the public needs journalists to do, to ask and demand answers to tough questions."

Here in the States, the medical establishment first recommended that the mask does not work while people get the infection from the asymptomatic carriers.

Moreover, wouldn’t this lead to the achievement of at least some form of herd immunity quicker than we think?

At the same time as we develop easily accessible tests to see who has this thing, let’s try to develop tests to see who’s recovered. At least that way we might be able to move more quickly past these draconian containment measures to more of a targeted approach to protecting the most vulnerable, like they’re doing in some other countries."
2020-04-01 16:25:12,"You have articulated, in this article, what has been a concern to me and my colleagues. I am a labor & delivery nurse and our patient demographic is generally young and healthy. We screen patients coming in for recent symptoms related to COVID-19 per prototcol. If they screen positive, we put them on the appropriate precautions until their testing is back. However that is less than 1% of our population. The 99% case are ""healthy"" women. 

During the course of labor & pushing we are in the room with the patient continuously for hours. During which time they are breathing heavily and exhale forcefully with every push. 

We have not been told to use or provided with masks in dealing with our patients that are not on ""protocol"". Most of my co workers are bringing masks from home to use on the floor.

Each day we go into work, we hear something different about the appropriate PPE for our patients, which right now, evolves around the understanding and guidelines from the CDC  that the virus is spread though droplets and specific  aerosolized procedures. Yet, we seem to be overlooking the fact that laboring exhale forcefully ""aerosolized droplets"" and if they are asymptomatic carriers, we are putting our care providers and other patients at risk."
2020-04-01 16:30:08,"I'm intensely curious about the reported ""asymptomatic recovered"" -- people who have had the virus but never developed symptoms during their infection.

While a huge problem for disease spread, I'm wondering how this works.  Is it genetic?  Is it somehow tied to initial viral load exposure, perhaps people who were exposed to a smaller number of virii experienced something akin to a vaccination effect, while those exposed to a higher level develop acute symptoms?

I hope somebody somewhere has started to do genetic sequencing on acutely ill and asymptomatic recovered to see if there is some genetic link to the asymptomatic recovered.  If there is a link, the genetic links to asymptomatic recovery might hold clues to therapies or even possible novel vaccinations.

Even the ""low initial viral exposure"" theory, if true, might suggest some reduced risk means of acquiring immunity simpler than a traditional vaccine if very low initial viral loading produces an asymptomatic recovery and immunity."

A college employee who allowed his name to be used has the virus.  He reported watching people playing basketball and baseball all day long in a park near his house while he is in isolation.

People, wake up--masks or no masks, stay away from each other!"
2020-04-01 13:46:47,"The stance that masks only help health care workers never made any sense.

Before we closed everything down, every one of my co-workers who coughed or sneezed swore it was just allergies. I myself went to work feeling vaguely achy after trying to stay home but feeling guilty about it because I wasn’t really THAT sick. 

So yes, of course we need to all be wearing masks. Not hospital grade N95 masks, but a covering for nose and mouth. 

For various reasons, people cannot be relied on to always do what’s safe for everyone. Isn’t that why we’re closing everything in the first place??"
2020-04-01 14:38:42,It can't be stressed enough how we need mass testing. If we could manage that then we only need to isolate the sick and the carriers and everything else can go back to normal. And we desperately need that before it all comes crashing down.

2020-04-01 15:30:17,"Another strategic and tragic failure of his country's response to this pandemic? The truth coming out is that broad use of masks in Asian countries helped enormously to contain and mitigate the spreading of the virus.

Why did it happen? Because the CDC let itself get caught in a squabble with the WHO about the apparent shortcomings of the model the WHO was using, and our preference for an American model. And yet this is the same model that China, Korea, Taiwan, and other Asian countries have used to sharply mitigate the spread of this pandemic. 

And at least in part it happened because the new president in 2018 disbanded the White House pandemic task force who might have decided to follow the example of these countries and recommend masks for everyone.

And third and perhaps most tragically we had a president who pooh-pooed the idea of a pandemic which had already arrived at our doorsteps in early January, losing precious weeks in the process.

So now Trump is saying he would accept 100,000 deaths as a sign of his success in dealing with this huge tragedy."

When you limit testing to not only just sick people, but only the sickest people, which everyone, including China, has been forced to do, you miss the prevalence of walking carriers. Even the initial data out of China showed that over 10% of positives didn't have a fever. Put on a mask! Make your own. A well-tied bandana is not rocket science. And you don't need a Phd to understand the fundamentals of germ theory."

2020-04-01 14:05:28,"We have been given mixed signals from the beginning of this crisis from top to bottom. Now its about masks and whether we should be wearing them.
Common sense dictates that we all should be wearing some type of mask when we have to venture out of our homes. When I see someone wearing a mask I appreciate that they are being careful and responsible, not only are they protecting themselves but they are protecting me."

Alright, then, let’s go..."
2020-04-01 16:46:56,"Dr.s Fauci and Birx, as well as most other public health experts, have said that case identification, contact tracking and broad public screening is how to limit the spread of the virus (S. Korea did this).  These  actions are also necessary in order to obtain the data to inform the models making them as accurate as possible. However, because of the lack of available tests d/t incompetence in this administration, those tests were not available, and when available there were not the quantities needed to do the necessary testing. This was not d/t having an ""obsolete"" mechanism of ""bad tests"" as stated by Trump (remember, it is never his fault), it was because he failed to recognize the magnitude of the problem and did not want testing that would reveal increasing number of cases refuting his claims.  While both Dr.s Fauci and Birx have tried to give accurate information to the public, I do fault them for not being more forceful in indicating that if available, broad testing is  the best path to follow. However, in the land of Trump, others good acts are often impaired by the Trump agenda."

These viruses most likely all have one thing in common- they arise in and from bats. Unfortunately, I have read bats have some necessary effect on pollination and plant generation so we can't eliminate them all. But we should exterminate as many as we can that have their caves/areas of navigation that are near human areas of settlement. At the same time we need to  educate people in those societies/cultures that engage in the barbaric practice of eating bats. The cultivation/killing for food is how these bat to human viruses spread, for the most part.  We will still have to contend with pig viruses, but if we can teach cultures not to eat monkeys/bats/etc it will go a long way to reduce the suffering many are presently experiencing. I'm sure the PC knives will come out, but that holds no interest for those concerned about human health."

The nation will see trillions of dollars lost in GDP, and wide economic disruption due to this pandemic.   Yet the nation could not spend 50-100 billion dollars over a period of several years to actually build up and stockpile in advance for a pandemic response. 

And not just the feds here... when Schwarzenegger was governor of California, he actually budgeted 100 M to build up a state response and stockpile for a future pandemic, so California would be prepared and not forced to scramble.  Yet, due to severe budget issues and revenue loss post 2008, the state withdrew funding of this program, and many others, in order to keep the state on strong financial footing. 

object lesson here:  a pandemic is no longer a theory, and you can spend a smaller sum up front as insurance, or you can pay the extreme economic price later for opting for no insurance in the form of a stockpiled infrastructure and supplies response."

Meanwhile, we all wonder when we can get back to going to work, school, the movies, to a restaurant or cafe. The longer it takes the more severe the economic downturn.

If our president was a great leader he would be advancing a national strategy to get masks distributed, to get people tested for antibodies and conduct a 'track and trace' program that enables us to know if we have been exposed, are a carrier, or not.

With such a program, kids and teachers could begin returning to schools, and people could begin returning to work.

I also believe that one primary reason we were told that only the sick should wear masks is that they are desperately needed for healthcare workers.  

But there is more recent news about how far the droplets can spread when one expels from their lungs (cough, sneeze, singing, etc.).  And, how long they remain viable in the air.  

What we all need to recognize is that our experts are learning daily from data coming in from around the world.  This disease was not known at the beginning of the year, except in China where they lied and hid from WHO.  So, don't assume that experts are lying; assume that news will continue to change and it will be for the worse if we all do not stay in place."
2020-04-01 18:17:28,"This feels like one of a couple areas I've noticed where we've been getting shortsighted opinions from experts:

1)  Regarding masks - Too much was being made about how masks don't block 100% of harmful particles, and hence might not fully protect a wearer.  However, they can block a lot - it's good.  Even more important, masks are actually tremendously effective in preventing an infected person from spreading the illness.  We need to act like we have the virus, even if we don't or don't know we do.  I fear that there was a lot of expediency in the CDC's pushback on wearing masks that was geared more towards preserving supply for physicians.  That makes sense, but it would have been better to communicate THAT as the reason, and encourage people to wear them when they're available - or scarves and other things that can block some droplets.  I'm afraid early messaging convinced most citizens that masks were ineffective as tools, and that's simply not true.

2)  Influenza:  There was similar messaging early on, before there were many cases (but while Wuhan was raging), urging people to keep COVID in perspective by emphasizing that so many more people were killed by influenza.  This was pushed by many doctors.  Again, I can't believe how shortsighted that was.  We knew there was a significantly higher fatality rate from COVID, that it spread quickly, and that it was a new virus that there wasn't herd immunity to.  It was inevitable COVID would be big, but they chose to minimize."
2020-04-01 18:29:47,"As posters have stated, mixed messaging has caused uncertainty where common sense should prevail.  Yes, it's true that N95 masks are vital to all medical and other personnel whose occupations put them in contact with the population, and those masks in short supply should go to them.

However, common sense tells me that if I have to go out in the next week or two to buy food at my local  market I will wear a mask, gloves, and possibly even go so far as pull my hoody up over my head.

I have a mask I bought many years ago for sanding furniture.  It was one of 4 in a package and never used.  I will put two coffee filters inside to hopefully help its effectiveness.  My attitude is as I shop, keeping my distance even though masked, is I am protecting other shoppers  and my cashier, even though I feel fine.  As I encounter another person masked I appreciate this person is helping to protect me."

1)The Federal govt has to mandate it for all states with penalties based on amount of assistance if not enforced 
2) States should close their borders to all residents of states that are not instituting this requirement or mandate 14 day isolation at the persons expense.

It didn't begin with Goldwater, but he gave it more credence than such people before him.  Reagan famously ran on that idea, as did succeeding GOP candidates.  It provides a convenient way to whatever a Republican in power wants to do, and it undermines education, expertise, and American institutions. Advisers such as Ed Rollins saw an opening to land working-class and other disaffected voters--anti-intellectualism and monkey-wrenching.  Trump has merely taken this destructive method to a new and more dangerous level.  Hire incompetents and fire those who fake him out and manifest a modicum of honor and responsibility.  It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."
2020-04-01 18:43:43,Mask-wearing should be as obvious as social distancing. So why are the big shots not wearing masks in photos. It would surely help to set a good example as well as curb the virus spread. Or did Trump threaten them to attack them with nonstop vindictive remarks and ejection from his inner circle if they dared to wear a mask in public?

Meanwhile, my visitors managed to get on the daily homebound UA flight to SF on 30 March, and then changed to another flight to another state. No paperwork, no temperature checks. Nothing, upon arrival at both US airports. 

The US is smack in the middle of a battle and still unprepared. 

Whatever happened to Trump's Homeland Security Border Patrol? Why aren't they in the airports taking temperatures and tracking people from arrival through to quarantine?

But in true, only-in-the-US, I'm not making this up fashion, gun shops have been declared ""essential services"".

2020-04-01 18:15:47,"In Asia, it is considered a civic duty to wear masks.  Here one gets a dirty look in the supermarket, and worse a beating if one looks Asian.

In a separate NY Times report, even medical professionals got fired for wearing a mask in public area.  You'd think medical professionals should be able to decide for themselves, especially if they have weak immune system, etc.

For all the talk about shortage of PPE for medical professionals and first responders,  Politico just reported that on Monday alone. roughly 280 million masks in warehouses around the U.S. were purchased by foreign buyers.

Surely there must be some smart people in the government who see the shortage coming, and should have banned export of PPE months ago."
2020-04-01 20:16:37,"The high percentage of people highlighted in the limited studies in this article infected with the virus, but not showing active symptoms,  is chilling.
It does not  however absolve Governments from carrying out a testing and contact tracing regime, which is a proven way of preventing the spread of Ebola, SARS and MERS.
Without a regime of  testing and contact tracing every healthcare system descends into anarchy and chaos, as we are witnessing now in Italy, Spain, UK and in the US.
What is good for tackling Ebola in third world countries, must be followed in advanced industrial countries.
Testing for COVID-19 in the UK has been extremely low relative to the size of the population of 66 million. Only 152,000 tests had been carried out. The number of people who died today spiked to 563 compared to 381 yesterday. The total number of official deaths is now  2,352, with London being the epicentre. These tragic deaths included children age 13 and a teenager age 19.

We have Boris Johnson as PM, who has not prepared from  January when this virus rapidly emerged in China.  He has failed entirely to treat this virus with respect and the perceived danger it poses to  everyone. Johnson has now fallen victim to the virus.

 Trump also, has been an exercise in volatility, irresponsibility  and a failure to comprehend, that failure to lead and prepare for this pandemic leads to a catastrophic loss of life and healthcare systems  forced into meltdown.
We all deserve better than this."
2020-04-01 18:23:28,"The fact is, and I saw it here in Seattle ever since the virus began, people who have a small cough or are sneezing will not stay indoors in isolation.  There is a pervasive, ""Who? Me??"" attitude that no one thinks they are causing harm.  Having everyone wear surgical masks or the equivalent is long overdue.  So what if we have to wear masks for two months?  By Thanksgiving, it should all be over.  We will either be wearing masks, or not, but we likely will be out and about by then.

At every step of the way in this pandemic the U.S. Government (or what's left of it after ""draining the swamp"" of scientists) has stumbled or flatly lied, ""to prevent panic.""

She was widowed young, opened a dress shop in Brooklyn, and lived above the store with her two daughters. During the Depression and WW2 my mom never knew whether she'd be sleeping in her own bed, or bunking up with Nana. Because people in the neighborhood knew,  Nana had lived on the edge and was always ready to help. Some things are universal.

Most of us know little of Afghan society - warlords and mullahs. But that is entirely inaccurate. Read Fredrik Barth's 'Political Leadership Among the Swat Pathan.' Centralized government was an anathema (no wonder attempts to impose it keep failing.) Instead there was a delicately balanced system of social, political, and religious connections and obligations.

It is satisfying that no study reports that those who receive the drug do worse than those who don't overall. There are logical reasons why it can lessen serious symptoms without attacking the virus.

True efficacy will require double blind protocols, much larger sample sizes, and careful avoidance of selection bias, and peer review.  Side effects must be evaluated and drug interactions defined.

The effects shown could be simply placebo related in the #hydroxychloroquine group.

Let's wait a little bit for the outcome of larger drug trials that are presently ongoing, with chloroquine and many other potentially repurposed drugs."

Yes chloroquine (a synthetic analog of quinine, a natural substance) has that function. As does quercetin and ecgc from green tea extract (there are published studies in medical journals about this). You don't need the prescription drug to have the cellular zinc impact. Zinc is part of nature, as are zinc ionophores, and viruses for that matter."

2020-04-01 17:06:58,"Speaking strictly politically, if chloroquine works to an extent, imagine what kind of boon for Trump would that be and embarrassment for those who would rather let people seriously suffer (die?) in order to protect them from the undesired effect of the million times used 60y old medicine.

The negativity and reserve that certain part of media and people have towards chloroquine is baffling and incomprehensible - no one ever said anything about that drug that is unreasonable and unhinged, such as 'this is it' or 'it's the cure', and yet those media do their best to paint such picture."
2020-04-01 17:10:32,"pending confirmation, it seemed that HCQ could prevent sick patients to progress to a more severe status (0 in the HCQ group vs 4 in the control group).

2020-04-01 17:13:02,"This is great news. I hope all pharmaceutical companies begin making this drug ASAP in huge quantities so that it can be given to any COVID patient who requests it.

I also hope it is fast-tracked through testing and approval.

Even if it is not yet approved for use in COVID patients, I hope that anyone who is sick with COVID and recommends this drug as treatment gets it. 

Who cares if the sample size is small? People's lives are at stake here. 

Anything that potentially helps should be offered for those who request it. Maybe something can be signed saying that I know there are risks taking a drug for an illness that is not yet approved for, but even though I know the risks I want to take it anyway.

Maybe there can be a government mandate or something to require pharmaceutical companies to start manufacturing this drug in large quantities."

2020-04-01 17:33:28,"While this is hopeful news, I'm concerned that articles like this will create even more of a run on hydroxychloroquine. 62 patients is a tiny study, and while we all understand the incredibly urgency of the situation, individuals around the world who suffer with malaria (which still kills many, many people) as we as lupus also need access to the drugs, which they're now finding unavailable. Moreover, the FDA is fast-tracking so many things now (literally hours or days to make decisions), that there well may be unintended consequences.

The medical community is trying to balance the dire crisis with getting the data right (enough) and not causing additional harm. Just as President Trump has no business touting medications he ""feels"" might help, the media would do well to not publish articles about every little study related to coronavirus, as tempting and financially lucrative as that may be. Let's move as fast as possible, but also get the science as right as we can. Lives are at stake."
2020-04-01 16:18:14,"When President Trump first suggested that the FDA follow-up on preliminary and anecdotal evidence, and investigate hydroxychloroquine two weeks ago, the headline in the Times article was ""With Minimal Evidence, Trump Asks F.D.A. to Study Malaria Drugs for Coronavirus"" and the subheadline was  ""The use of the existing drugs against the new virus is unproven, and some shortages have already been reported.""  (article link below).  

The lead sentence in the article was ""President Trump on Thursday exaggerated the potential of drugs available to treat the new coronavirus, including an experimental antiviral treatment and decades-old malaria remedies that hint of promise but so far show limited evidence of healing the sick.""

To many of us, this seemed like biased reporting by the Times.  There is a strong and inappropriate negative spin in this initial article.

The current article, by the same reporter, is more balanced.  The small study from China is indeed preliminary, and too small to justify conclusions.  But it does justify further investigation.

The Times should endeavor to be more objective in is presentation of the news.

2020-04-01 16:08:57,"It would be impossible for me to find it back, but the French original study was called a hoax by a medical researcher. Not the disease, not the symptoms, but the results. The original study suffered of several problems:
- It was too small to be definitive and statistically relevant
- The control group was not followed the same way, tested the same way, as the ""drug applied"" group. So the outcome was not clear. Basically the patients in the control group did not want to come back for tests and scans, if I remember correctly.

As a consequence the data were invalid and not statistically relevant. The group here talked about is also quite small and may be statistically biased by how the patients were chosen. 

I am not statistician (just a regular scientist) but to write  a title with ""Malaria Drug Helps Virus Patients Improve"" is in my opinion plain and simple irresponsible of the NYT. 

Indeed, we need a larger and more relevant study because there MAY be something there, for SOME patients. 

In this case, shame on NYT for sloppy reporting."

It can't be shown to be effective, because then Trump would be right, and we can't have that can we?   Plus, people getting better doesn't make for pageviews orhelp Joe Biden's chances.   So please, go back to ignoring and discounting any treatments.   Remember, unless we have multi-year, randomized studies with a million patients, it's just not proven effective or safe.   There, hopefully you are back on track with the approved DNC/MSNBC/CNN/former Obama official talking points."

If this was effective as a strategy against corona viruses it would have worked against many common cold strains a long time ago. There is no prospective mechanism for how these drugs might help in this situation. Our effort should be to focussed on vaccine development, which is a proven strategy for fighting viral disease, and on testing more rapidly and accurately so we can understand the disease's means of transmission. Please stop going down this road. To scientists like me it looks like a total joke and you (and other news outlets and the people at large) are being played for fools."
2020-04-01 17:08:07,"It's from China, who relationship with the concept of truth is not the same as in the west. It's not peer reviewed. It's a small study. The story sub-headline says ""moderately ill"" and the story itself says ""mildly ill."" Four strikes and you're out."
2020-04-01 17:11:56,"None of the actual numbers (17/31 versus 25/31) seem statistically significant. 4 cases out of 62 got worse. It's interesting that they were all in the control group but the sample size is so small I'm not sure that it isn't random. Obviously, in a crisis, we need to let go of some of our standards but maybe the NY Times can get the advice of a statistician familiar with clinical trials before they help promote bad science?"

The main issue with the French study is that it was even smaller (48 patients, 24 in the control group) than the Chinese study cited here.

Someone at the Times needs to actually read the French paper, which, thankfully for them, is in English so it ought to be a pretty easy read: <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996"" target=""_blank"">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996</a>"

They are scaling up treatment and monitoring of patients (at least 700 for now) with a combination of Hydrochloroquine and Azitromycine, and claiming good results in lowering the viral charge in a matter of days (4 to 6). The key is to treat early, before the virus is doing too much damage, but as we know this gets tricky because of delays and shortcoming in testing. The medical community has been understandably cautious, but results are promising and the IHU is sharing their results and calling the treatment a ""first line of defense"", cheap and already available, before new medicines get potentially approved."

2020-04-01 17:52:53,"Apart from the question of chloroquine, this article raises serious question over how Americans are treating coronavirus patients. In China, South Korea, and Germany, people who test positive are treated in the early stages of the COVID-19 disease. They’re often brought into a low-level hospital and given medications and oxygen in a aggressive protocol to stop the progression into serious respiratory distress. In the U.S., patients are told to go home and self-quarantine, and many do not show up at the hospital until the ambulance brings them in (hence, so many sirens in NYC). It’s clear that early treatment and supervision reduces the rate of death. We need to completely change the way we treat COVID-19. I fear that this waiting until too late is driven by the huge number of Americans with no health insurance or with large deductibles—how many Americans are we losing because people are rightly afraid that COVID-19 will bankrupt them?"
2020-04-01 17:53:01,"I have been involved with designing clinical research projects.  What everybody has to know, an uncontrolled study is meaningless.  Observational studies and anecdotes only serve to give you ideas about what to do controlled studies of.  This has been shown time and time again.

He will claim his support of the drug was what resulted in the tests and a “ cure” for many. It does not matter about clinical trials. Trump will assert he knows more than the doctors who are running the studies."
2020-04-01 18:21:14,"Just because a drug is old and has had common use, it is not protected from price gouging. Quite the opposite. Watch out for a pharmaceutical doing the controlled research in exchange for market control for so many  years. It does not matter if it has been used for decades for another use. 

The prime example is Colchicine which had been used for gout since 550 AD. A company did controlled research that had never been done, because everyone knew it worked. This gave them something akin to patent control over the drug. Once they had control they were allowed to raise the price and prevent others for producing it.  Pills went from ~10 cents to ~ 5 dollars a pill. This raised the costs for govt insurance programs from 1 million to 50 million."
2020-04-01 18:21:37,"People, n=62. That is, 62 patients were involved, 31 in each of the two groups. This is a very small sample to reach a conclusion with. 

This study's result can be produced by chance. If the positive effect is real, further studies will produce the same result as here.

So WAIT for confirmation of this result BEFORE dashing out to buy this stuff OR deciding that, since your aquarium chemicals contain something with a similar name, you should drink it. Also pay careful attention to the side effects associated with some medical conditions.

IMO hyping this treatment at this point is irresponsible. Treatment decisions must be evidence based. Let the studies be completed.

It is still a small study, and not a perfect outcome for all the active group patients, but it remains promising.

From what I hear many NYC hospitals are already using the drug routinely, although obviously hospitalized patients do not have mild symptoms."

It becomes harder and harder to categorize these studies as ""anecdotal"". It will be months before we have results from any of the US based studies.

2020-04-01 19:20:37,"Yes, they have to be careful and Trump opening his yap has created a problem. My late wife Tina developed lupus in 1982 before they knew on how to really treat it. Since 95% of the individuals that have it are women they used to send them to see shrinks. Only after so many died and two young doctors (we were lucky lived in Boston where they were and also had good health insurance), began to report they realized it was a medical condition. My wife has been gone for four years now, but so where along the way that became one of her many medications, also to avoid exposure to the direct sunlight. I was always amazed how after a quarterly visit she would know which meds were to be increased and when to take each one. She was the organized member of the family. Now, there is the risk of putting into serious and I might ad fatal consequences for lupus patients that need that drug. Doctors should not be prescribing this to everyone who asks for it.

2020-04-01 19:22:48,"Who’s paying?  Who is deciding? 

Are the patient’s wishes considered before the triage vectors are decided upon?  They should be.  

Does the patient have hh own private hospital and staff?  Then go back to the first question.  If not, then we should collectively decide using aggregate fast data from best sources to determine the sustainability of this life when compared to the lives of others.  

This is not something people do with years of training.  It’s something people with years of training can do collectively by placing their data into computers.  And, honestly, to be truly self-governing people, it needs to include requisite training and simplicity for those governing themselves to make good decisions.  

Otherwise, the world is lost to those who simply take the power by whatever means they choose.  That too, by the way, can dictate the framing of such an aggregating social network, i.e., dictators would soon lose their powers as a result of selections made by their constituents."
2020-04-01 16:08:58,"Unfortunately, they were already throwing the kitchen sink at these 62 patients and then added hydroxychloroquine which severely limits interpretation of the results. Bacterial infections and viral infections cause pneumonia and if they were also on antibiotics(? same antibiotic/at same doses) then they can improve from antibiotic therapy alone and not necessarily at the same rate. They also were on antiviral medications that may or may not be effective--they usually are not.  Clinically,you can improve even if the Ct scan still shows changes of pneumonia after 1 week. This is not a controlled enough study  to conclude anything except more study is warranted."
2020-04-01 16:53:50,"As an MD expert in clinical trials, I have reviewed the available data from the small studies of hydroxychloroquine coming out of China and France.  It is extremely premature to draw any definitive conclusion about it's efficacy for coronavirus.  There are many flaws in these studies.  But, the conflicting and premature findings do seem to warrant looking further into whether Covid19 patients could benefit.  This can/should be done with small, efficiently designed adaptive trials to get at some answer as quickly as possible.  Now that FDA has made an unprecedented move in authorizing it's use, we will lose the chance to carefully evaluate the question.  What patients will now willingly enroll in a trial when they might be randomized to standard treatment without hydroxychloroquine?  Whatever open label data can be collected from patients who will now receive it will be a disparate collection of information that will be exceedingly difficult to interpret and we'll be no better off.  And it will delay or prevent other therapies from being studied.  This is not the first time that FDA appears to have bowed to political pressure, but it may be one of the most consequential decisions, and not for the better."
2020-04-01 19:34:00,"I see patients in clinic with autoimmune disorders who need hydroxychloroquine daily to manage their chronic conditions. Pharmacies in our area are calling concerned that stock is running low due to high demand as a result of inappropriate prescribing of this drug. While this treatment may be promising in the long run, greater care must be taken to ensure that this life saving medication is still available for those whose lives already depend on it."
2020-04-01 19:37:11,"Look, everyone wants this drug to turn into a successful treatment for the coronavirus. All we know is that it's promising, so it's definitely worth further study. Just understand that lots of promising things don't pan out under bigger, more controlled studies later. 

Still, if you have the coronavirus right now, and you and your doctor want to try it, then I say go for it. It's not like we have lots of other options!

I can't stand Trump, but if this does redound to his credit later, I don't care about that. Saving lives is more important.

The fact we are even having a conversation about Trump at all here is a testament to the confusion and divineness he just can't help sowing under all circumstances. In regards to this drug, Trump is like a used-car salesman who, for once, has a halfway decent car on the lot. It shouldn't be that hard to sell it because it's not a complete lemon. But his past behavior tells everyone that you have to approach anything he says warily. If Trump says the sun is shining, you still have to look out the window for yourself."
2020-04-01 19:40:39,"Hydroxychloroquine, and in some cases, azirhromycin, may be beneficial when given in early disease.  But these are small studies. As this article points out, early mild disease is the best time to administer these agents before a patient becomes severe. 

However, these medications have some significant side effects. 68 patients is not enough to assess safety in COVID. And if your mild disease is most likely to resolve on its own, there is great risk at just giving this drug. Many comments here talk about just “give the drug, why not” or that there is a political opposition to Trump. If you have a death from a adverse event in this drug (which has been described with COVID), that is a issue. You want the benefit to be clear and the drug to be safe 

When politicians say that this is a miracle drug, they give the impression that anyone could benefit. This is not political opposition but a bad message given the risk of these drugs. 

What is needed instead is a comprehensive targeted approach to give this drug at the right time to the right patients where the benefit is the highest. Blanket administration of this drug without large trials to anyone with Covid could be harmful so it must be used wisely. Not widely"

Imagine my surprise when it turned out that the lede was about Trump and his mention of chloroquinine. The thalidomide story was just a cover. The real story is that Trump is a fool! It made me realize that the news is not simply the news. But for Trump mentioning chloroquinine, would NYT have run an article on thalidomide?"
2020-04-01 18:40:12,"after multiple articles disparaging trump that he denies science, again the NYtimes has demonstrates it typically aims at misinforming.  This article corrects some of the misinformation.  Both the Thais and Chinese (and possibly also Vietnamese and Iranian) early on treated with chloroquine (see medRxiv), and unlike the US doctors cited in this article understand the cellular mechanism -  it is an endocytosis inhibitor,  a step required for infection.  It is clear the Asian doctors are better educated.  Also as mentioned here, 'controlled' clinical trials require a control group that is not treated.  This may not be a good time for  scientific purity.  -  we just saw another good example of that with the faulty PCR kit test from the CDC that delayed the implementation of wide testing."
2020-04-01 19:08:59,I really wish the media like NYT would not post headlines about a scientific article without writing out the abstract of the article. Remember what happened when Trump said something about this drug? One died and the other is in the hospital. The study is bad because of a small sample. 60 people is not a good sample size. You need at least 10 times more to get some meaningful result. Do not consume something until a good study with a good sample size is published.
2020-04-01 17:24:43,"This is a lesson for people to be less partisan and keep an open mind. Most of us in the medical community can at least theoretically appreciate how hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin might work, but the media and partisan hacks tore this apart just because Trump had said it."
2020-04-01 17:25:39,Someone should tell the Governor of Nevada who seems perfectly happy to kill his own citizens by withholding these treatments. As long as his policy is in opposition to any Trump guidance he's happy.

2020-04-01 18:05:57,Why anybody would trust China on this is beyond me.
2020-04-01 18:07:34,"So it is a total fraud when Trump talks about it, and he is slammed for even mentioning it.

But it turns out to be real enough that it's now worth a story?

We are all supposed to not wear even common fabric masks because (God knows why, no explanation is coherent).  But now the CDC and WHO say it in fact helps to reduce the spread of the virus in ordinary, aerosolized exhalations from ordinary breadth

2020-04-01 18:51:01,"The University of Minnesota is conducting a large randomized, controlled, blinded trial currently looking at:

1. Is hydroxychloroquine effective in preventing illness in patients with exposure to a known test positive COVID19 individual? (currently 581 enrolled, goal is 1500)
2. Is hydroxychloroquine effective in treating mild, early cases of COVID19? (currently 124 enrolled)

More participants are needed, please go to www.trialcovid.com for more details. The faster they get enough participants, the faster we will get the answer with a larger trial on whether or not hydroxychloroquine is effective."

It might be that the benefits from hydroxychloroquine may be its ability to calm down the immune system which is what is killing many people.  There are other drugs that are specifically designed to do just that.

This preliminary research may lead to a therapy that reduces death from the corona virus.  That doesn't mean all is good.  Nobody wants to get sick from this illness.  Almost dying is not a desirable outcome.

P.S. To my fellow Trump antagonists.  He didn't think of this.  It wasn't his idea.  The scientific/medical community came up with it.  He just talked about it.  He doesn't get credit for it.  He wanted to go ahead and use it all over the place.  That's dangerous.  This is the way to do it, with controlled studies.  Let's see where it leads.  It may set us on a path to something that works really well.  Whatever therapy is finally used, Trump will take credit for it and that's when we start making some noise."

Why on earth the same study they are not conducting in NYC? This virus is killing people there since early march. They have thousands of patients available, in all categories.

2020-04-01 18:00:30,"The macrolide antibiotic Azithromycin blocks viral reproduction and also has a calming effect on the immune system. Famous MD Raoult, who, prior to 2020 had prescribed hydroxychloroquine more than 4,000 times (!) is using it in combination with azithromycin. It is the combination which is most effective, PhD Raoult showed. Instead of looking at how good patients seem to be doing, Raoult looks at viral loads, measured directly. That’s much more scientific. 

Raoult is a very serious scientist: he discovered the MIMI giant virus, perhaps a new form of life, 69 species of bacteria, some named after him, and elucidated the cause of several well-known diseases.

There is a second Raoult study, on 80 patients, out two days ago, using Raoult's combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin. It was found that the viral load, objectively measured, disappears in ten days. Here the control measure is that large Chinese studies showed that, for patients who recovered, it took a median twenty days for their viral load, objectively measured, to disappear. 

The first Raoult study of 24 patients had two large control groups. 

By the way, there are other existing drugs which are known to have antiviral effects (including against ebola and the flu). In particular, statins, especially simvastatin. The statins interfere with the fat metabolism. SARS-CoV2 is made with two lipid layers. If it can’t make them, it can’t reproduce."

Now three small studies have shown that Hydroxychloroquin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in people.

And the risk profile for Hydroxychloroquin is well known.

And we are looking at 200,000 deaths in the US if we do nothing.  While I agree that we are not sure how Hydroxychloroquin works, the prudent thing is to give Hydroxychloroquin to SARS-CoV-2 patients rather than wait for the large double blind studies and let 200,000 people die.."

It is incredibly irresponsible for doctors to prescribe this without proof that this medication works for covid-19. It is also irresponsible to prescribe the drug for people who are not even sick yet. These doctors need to get their licenses revoked. 
I am appalled that there is a shortage of these drugs because of doctors' abuse of their licenses. Because of this irresponsible behavior, immuno-comprised people need to risk their health even more because they can't get access to the drugs they need. Without these drugs, people with autoimmune disorders not only have to suffer from the dangers of their chronic illnesses themselves, but also may be at increased risk of contracting covid-19 with diminished chances of fighting it off. 
Doctors, please be responsible and stop prescribing these drugs without proof that they work, especially for yourselves, family, and people who are not even sick. People like me need these drugs desperately, and it is unfair when we can't get these necessities because people who don't need them get access to them before our refills are due.

Such a study has yet to be vetted in peer review, meaning it is raw data without scientific consensus. The scientific process can only be rushed so fast without risks outweighing the benefits. Seeing the data doesn’t point to a new standard of care for COVID-19, only the possibility for treatment of certain circumstances. The fine difference is important.

Anti-malaria drugs are safe, right?   Well, side effects can include symptoms of neuro-toxic poisoning of the brain and brain stem which can result in tinnitus (ear-ringing), dizziness, vertigo, intestinal issues, nightmares, insomnia, anxiety, personality change, and heart irregularities, among many others.  I learned about the above, years later, from Armed Services veterans groups, not the Federal government.  (Again, I am not a veteran.  I never had the privilege, although I did wear the uniform while in Baghdad performing reconstruction work after the invasion.) I continue to have a number of the above symptoms that began after I returned home ""safely"" from Baghdad.

That said, how is it that some of the most hopeful news amid this crisis comes under such widespread attack while the nearly daily conjectural stories on how doctors might have to make conscience-taxing, Sophie's choice-like decisions on who gets treatment (ventilators) and who doesn't go unquestioned. I've read no news report yet on this actually happening on any appreciable scale. No one has their head in the sand; yes, given the shortage of ventilators, this could happen.  But we have not heard of it yet at even those hospitals at the epicenter. This is not the time to raise false hopes on ""ifs."" Got that. But it's also not a time to raise fears of horrible medical decision-making based on what has not happened."

I have read 4; they uniformly indicated that these drugs showed evidence of ability to block  replication of coronavirus. That matters because SARS was genetically similar to Covid-19. 

The studies in question were performed in vitro (in cultured tissue samples),  not live patients, but some of them delve into the molecular and biochemical reasons why the drugs appear to work.

I've recently read that research dollars moved to influenza studies after SARS ended because it represented a larger payoff for drug companies and because researchers genuinely thought flu was a bigger threat. 

In any event, while there have not been large scale clinical trials, there is plenty of solid science indicating that Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine work against this class of virus."

Consider Apollo 13. Before all the Apollos launched, there was a massive amount of careful studies to determine the safest way to design them. That is one approach.

The other approach was what happened after Apollo 13 had its problem. The engineers on the ground figured out might be done to improve the odds of a safe return, making many an ad hoc device and fix. 

It would be nice if we could pursue the first approach exclusively. 

But we have a problem. Covid-19 is killing thousands of people. This calls for the second approach. Less careful but fast and ad hoc studies are what we need until we have time for more cautious studies."

2020-04-01 20:47:38,"An infamous British bankruptcy was once described as a normal one with a lot of extra zeroes after it.

This situation is similar.  Respiratory failure leading to dependency on ventilators is nothing new.  The problem is the number of patients.  Anything that could keep the volume down, reducing the need for hospitalization and beds in the ICU, would be worth doing.  So ""caution"" isn't the important thing here.  Unless the drug can't do anything to reduce the number of patients progressing to ventilators, the treatment should go forward."

That said, the NIH website provides NYT's readers with similar small studies, as do the French and UK websites.

In light of the risks of spiraling into ARDS, Respiratory Failure, and requiring ventilation and intubation, or death,
America might want to review studies on other antiviral medications in order, "" to determine the best way to use it.""

Currently the CDC Influenza 2019 algorithm to assist in the interpretation of influenza testing results and clinical decision making states, ""Initiate antiviral treatment as soon as possible if influenza is suspected and the patient is at high risk for influenza complications""' and this is if and when the Influenza test is NEGATIVE.

     Tamiflu websites encourage patients to notify their physician if influenza symptoms are present, as soon as possible, and within 2 days of the onset of symptoms.

     In a similar vein, medications for Herpes Infections encourage the rapid initiation of appropriate antivals.

The study which compared two different treatment options showed the drug theoretically improved outcomes in mild to moderate cases.  The President’s advocacy for the malaria drug has put it at the forefront but there might be other options that should be investigated.  

Like most diseases, the key issue is early detection and treatment … something only extensive testing can do.  Unfortunately, the US is behind in that aspect of the problem.   When you must wait until you can’t breathe to get a test, you may already be past a point of no return as far as severity is concerned.  Until the testing issue is solved the virus will continue to overload medical capacity."

This is a small group of patients who were:
a) hospitalized, 
b) sick, but not too sick,
c) had differences between the two groups: fever and cough were more prevalent in the control than in the hydroxychloroquine group (were they sicker despite random selection?), and
d) who were received other  therapies ""...with or without corticosteroids.""  It now appears that corticosteroid treatment probably worsens COVID-19, and we have no way of knowing how many in each group received steroids (nor even if they other additional treatment types each group received were similar.)

It is neither safe nor wise to generalize this as being a good treatment for everyone.  We have no idea what this medication does beyond a potential improvement in immediate respiratory and fever symptoms. 

But, it's equally unwise and unsafe to hold out for the ""gold standard"" large scale,  placebo controlled, blinded clinical trial in the midst of a worldwide health crisis.

If I were treating a moderately ill, hospitalized patient, would I consider adding hydroxychloroquine after discussion with them?   Sure.

Is this something that should now be standard of care for everyone who has symptoms?  Certainly not based on the data thus far."

This one seems more promising, but 25 out of 31 improving vs. 17 out of 31 improving is not a large difference. Hopefully it helps, but it's not the magic bullet. More important, these patients did not have severe cases and didn't have a host of issues (quite common among corona patients) that may make taking hydroxychloroquine dangerous.

Its use in lower risk people may be justified if it reduces illness duration and transmission to others. However, the use of this combination probably should warrant a before and after electrocardiogram. In sicker individuals admitted to the hospital, the risk of adverse effects is higher and careful risk-benefit analysis is needed since cardiovascular complications are common. All of the above statements are predicated upon a assumption of clear benefit, which is not yet proven. The studies are ongoing and results should be in soon."

If a person is moderately ill they will probably recover without hydroxychloroquine.

We are living in a world of not thinking in the United States.

The only test of any value would have to be people that are seriously ill, and the hydroxychloroquine might kill the people.  Even seriously ill people may recover.

If you want to try hydroxychloroquine you should deal with a great deal of work using animals.  The animals would have be given in some way the virus."
2020-04-01 22:28:30,"This summary leaves a lot to be desired. It provides so few details that it is little better than saying hydroxychloroquine seemed like it might help a little bit with perhaps some of the symptoms for maybe a few people.

The article did point out the small sample size and that only patients with mild/moderate symptoms were included.  But there are other issues with the reporting.

Pneumonia ""improved"" in more of the patients receiving the drug.  But by how much?  Dramatically, modestly, or slightly?  Was the improvement even clinically significant?  (I'm assuming the results were statistically significant, but even that was not reported here).  CT scan results can be quantified. Perhaps they were in the study, but there's no way to know from this article whether the results were impressive or barely perceptible.  

Coughing and fever ""eased"" about a day earlier.  In all the patients receiving the drug?  And again, by how much did these symptoms ease, and was it clinically significant?  

Certainly hydroxychloroquine should be further studied, and certainly the press needs to keep the public informed of progress.  But the reporting needs to be more rigorous. Using generalized terms like ""eased"" and ""improved"" with no indication of the strength of the effect will likely result in people leaping to the conclusion that this drug has been shown to be better than it actually has been, at least so far.

3. The French and other overseas studies are too small.

4. The drugs should not be used before months or years of the FDA approval process.

5. Other people need chloroquine and aren't getting it (although reportedly it stays active in the body for 40 days, so a hiatus among current recipients is okay if this is true).

6. Dr. Fauci is skeptical, and like the letters of transit in ""Casablanca,"" his skepticism is not to be questioned.

Typical is this Washington Post headline: ""As Trump touts an unproven coronavirus treatment, supplies evaporate for patients who need those drugs.""

To be sure, azithromycin and chloroquine may prove to be ineffective. But, applying syllogistic reasoning to the predictably negative coverage, it boils down to this:

^ Why does The New York Times continually solicit the opinion of a controversial doctor who repeatedly told everyone that the coronavirus would be ""a blip"" and nothing more? This is the same doctor who said the flu kills far more people every year and dismissed the threat of the virus.

“Coronavirus will be a blip on the horizon,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. See The New York Times' article, ""Should You Be Worried About the Coronavirus?"" (29 January 2020). 

""The coronavirus isn't anything to worry about,"" said Schaffner in other news reports back in January."

2020-04-01 23:39:33,"The science driving the use of hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine use age is that in vitro it funnels zinc, in an anti-viral ion form, into human cells, where the zinc kills the viral RNA.  Zinc acetate
can kill coronavirus in ones mouth or throat, but cannot penetrate the cell membrane without a zinc ionophore.  The hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are among prescription requiring compounds that perform the zinc ionophore task;  queretin and EGCG perform the same zinc ionophore task as vitamin supplements.  Interestingly enough, Mung bean, which is sold as a cytokine suppresser, with EGCG, may help protect against the ravages of the coronavirus cytokine storm impacting the heart."
2020-04-01 23:39:46,"I’ve seen a lot of comments that say something  like, “Ha ha, liberals, Trump was right.” But I think this  misses an important point: Trump didn’t actually know whether we was right when he recommended hydroxychloroquine.  Trusting one’s gut, or having a good feeling, is not the same thing as scientific proof.  More to the point, a true belief is not the same thing as knowledge, because the former doesn’t necessarily require evidence while the latter does.  We need the president to give us clear, evidence-based advice. I’m glad that hydroxychloroquine works, but it is important to follow the proper procedures and approval processes before recommending a treatment."
2020-04-01 23:41:43,"Printed at the top of the study:
""This article is a preprint and has not been certified by peer review. It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.""

Of course, lots of people take meds for off-label purposes. Lots of people take herbals which haven't been clinically shown to help at all.

Throughout history, many drugs/treatments that were trusted for generations were later shown to be harmful.  Leeches anyone?

On the other hand, the ""placebo effect"" is real (even at statistically valid levels).

The question becomes one of balancing potential risks versus potential benefits. That's precisely what government regulatory agencies are entrusted to do. Plus, it's their job to protect unknowledgeable (and gullible) people from rushing out to use a substance that could potentially harm them.

Unless a substance can't be obtained legally, people have the free-will choice to take try whatever they wish on their own body. So, if you can find a doctor who'll prescribe it, go ahead and take it if you wish.

However, that doesn't give you the right to blindly criticize the experts whose job (and ethical responsibility) it is to proceed with caution, nor dis those who trust them.

Trump's ""gut instinct"" doesn't earn him any credibility or plaudits; after all, his gut told him that we'd be down to 0 by now. One lucky guess doesn't make him a genius or a savior.

Besides, Rush Limbaugh (a smoker) still has lung cancer."
2020-04-01 23:44:05,"From the published studies on hydroxychloroquine from China and elsewhere, the drug works by stopping the hijacking of the virus of lung cells via the ACE receptor. It would make sense that it is most effective at the earlier stages of the disease, and this is consistent with the latest findings. I only hope that the fact that Pres. Trump was intrigued by the drug's potential does not bias observers in the press and medical world from giving it a fair trial."
2020-04-02 00:11:19,"This is very hopeful news. Trump's advocacy of the drug should not be a factor in its assessment at all. Someone told him about it, he seized on the early reports and touted the treatment before the results were in--that's all irrelevant. If future trials continue to validate the use of hydroxycholroquine, kudos to the doctors who first thought to use it and let's expand usage and start testing other agents that we know to have similar effects."

2020-04-02 00:43:53,"""The illness turned severe in four patients — all in the control group.""

1. This is not a peer reviewed study yet; it has only been posted ""an online server for medical articles, before undergoing peer review by other researchers.""
2. Even if it passes peer review, it does not mean it is fact or even close to fact.  This study needs to be replicated more than once.  I am sorry but science does not advance like in the movies.  Science is hard and it takes testing, multiple times with many reviews before we have any confidence in an hypothesis and before we can accept it as a proven theory.  
3.  This is a one study with a small sample.  Many such studies have been misleading before. The original French report was seriously flawed and can not be trusted.
4. This is a chinese study so while it might be good we need to take some time to review and check it.
5.  There are several other studies being conducted right now, so it won't be long before there is more data.  So let's  be a patient and reserve judgment.
In general, take a deep breath, we hope this drug can help but we need more evidence. If you are frustrated that is understandable but this could still be bogus and it is dangerous to believe and use something before there is more proof.   Remember, first do no harm, premature action can easily cause more harm than good.  Also remember there is additional data on the way and it will be available soon.   We all want some effective response to this virus.  Many lives are at stake."

At most that experience may be suggestive of a possible reason to pursue systematic review of its use in controlled studies

This and other articles (and reader comments) suggest the possibility of an overactive autoimmune response (sepsis) as a potential cause. 

Hopefully, universities, pharma  and other researchers are delving into this potential symptom  — not of the Coronavirus itself, but one of its often fatal impacts on infected individuals. 

This seems especially exciting because as many readers have pointed out, there are widely available drugs that can lessen or block sepsis.

2020-04-02 00:25:14,"Another set of research preprinted today has a theory for why this works.  It posits that the virus actually attacks your blood cells and keeps them from absorbing oxygen in the lungs.  It's not the virus that is damaging the lungs and killing the patients, it's the the lack of oxygen that is doing the real damage.  The hypoxia that ends up killing people is not so much from damage to the lungs as it is from damage to the blood.  The ground glass appearance in the lungs is assumed to be from the failure of the blood to perform its normal role in the lungs.

They posit that Hydroxychloroquine (HQ) prevents the virus from damaging your blood cells.

They posit that this is why HQ won't work once the lungs appear damaged, but seems to work before, as a preventative.  It's not that it has any effect on your lungs, but once your blood cells are damaged, the HQ can't repair any damaged blood cells, it can only prevent infection of the healthy ones, and once your blood cells can't hold sufficient oxygen or carbon dioxide, your body can't fight the virus and you die.  Your body can only regenerate about a pint of blood every 8 weeks, so healing becomes more and more difficult.

So the theory is that HQ+a blood transfusion should bring these people back from the brink.  The blood transfusion would resupply healthy blood cells and the HQ would prevent those healthy cells from being infected.  

The research is just a theory, grounded in science, and has NOT been proven or tested."

2020-04-02 00:15:00,The Montreal Heart Institute is launching a trial called COLCORONA based on the active ingredient Colchicine.
2020-04-02 00:43:26,"This was not a new study.  It was actually completed Feb 28, 2020.  As with anything, you should not believe a stranger in a comments section about this. Instead, check it out for yourself:  

Go to clinicaltrials.gov and do a search for ""hydroxychloroquine"" in the box for other terms.  Scroll down to the eighth trial.  

You could also follow the link in the article for the study on medRxiv and click on the pdf for the study.  Or just go here:

After doing all of that, ask yourself why we did not know about this sooner.  Also ask yourself why people claimed there were no controlled or double blind study completed  (there was) and therefore everything was anecdotal (it wasn't).  

Everyone got blinded a little when Trump made it seem like it was his discovery.  It wasn't and his ""discovery"" was made a month after it was listed as completed on a government site.  

It should also be noted that HCQ will not fix everything.  What it can do is help individuals in hospitals with mild or moderate symptoms get better faster.  This will free up hospital beds. 
It will ease the tremendous pressure on our health care system and allow our medical professionals to focus on patients with serious conditions.  

It is merely a step in the right direction, but it's a big one."

They began by reporting that ""This week, the World Health Organization endorsed the use of experimental drugs in the fight against the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. That is the right decision. There is no proven vaccine or treatment for Ebola, and in light of the severity of the current outbreak, experimental treatments that have not been tested on humans should be an option.""<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/opinion/can-statins-help-treat-ebola.html?searchResultPosition=21"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/opinion/can-statins-help-treat-ebola.html?searchResultPosition=21</a>

2020-04-02 03:32:19,"The limitations in our current data bring out some difficult ethical questions - do we hold off on treating people with hydroxychloroquine despite evidence suggesting it could save lives and reduce complications, so that we can get better data? I would support treating while studies are underway. However, I am also concerned that current studies may miss some important issues. First, the half-life of hydroxychloroquine is around 30-50 days. This means that rather than getting close to a maximum concentration after one or two days, the drug will continue to build up. Therefore, it would seem more logical to start with a loading dose (as in treating a case of malaria) to get more quickly to an effective level. Second, after the original SARS, a study reported an alarming chronic fatigue rate of 40% and psychiatric illness in over 40%. As a provider who focuses on chronic fatigue related illness, I can say that the substantial effect that fatigue can have on function and quality of life is poorly understood among healthcare providers and the public alike. If the rate of chronic fatigue after COVID-19 were even 10%, the public health burden would be massive. Are studies going to be following up to look for effects of the drugs on chronic complications? The potential for chronic complications would be another factor that argues strongly for leaning towards treating. Let's look ahead rather than realizing in hindsight we should have treated more aggressively."

Here are just a couple of quotes:

""A common interpretation of off-label use and compassionate use of drugs is that if the patient died, they died from the disease, but if the patient survived, they survived because of the given drug,” Kalil wrote in a column published March 24 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. “This is not true.”  (Dr. Andre Kalil is an infectious disease specialist at the U of Nebraska.)

""People can die from these drugs, and we would never know they died from the drugs because we didn’t have controls,” said Dr. Andre Kalil.

""With the 2014-2016 Ebola virus outbreak, many doctors took the “let’s just try it” approach, without control trials, Kalil said. Because of this, we still don’t know whether some of those treatments worked or were actually hastening death instead of healing patients.""

There's a reason scientists follow the scientific method."
2020-04-02 09:46:24,"Looks like everybody missed the point entirely. The study indicated that the ONLY patients whose illness turned to sever were in control group. So, essentially the patients who ended up in ICU were the ones who had not received the drug. What proof of drug efficacy they need more?"

2020-04-02 10:27:05,"Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are decades-old drugs.

If they do prove effective the Trump administration should not let the manufacturers increases their prices like they did with Insulin and EpiPens."
2020-04-02 05:34:54,"Right.  So, Trump was right, again, in saying that this version of chloroquine -- Hydroxy-Chloroquine= taken with with Azithromycin, looks like it is a good treatment for CV19.  After, of course, the NYT and the Democrats broadly all dismissed this as just more Trumpist fantasy.  Unproven, they said.  Nevada and Michigan governors banned its use, simply because Trump said it probably worked.  Now, of course, those same governors have lifted their bans.  Probably realized that banning a life-0saving drig during an election year wasn't a particularly good strategy."
2020-04-02 11:48:17,"Small trials attesting the benefits of Chloroquine (Q) or Hydroxychloroquine (HQ) are appearing. Advantage of these drugs is that their safety is established. We know them and their side effects when used for malaria and rheumatoid arthritis. A new substance if developed now will take months or years to establish the efficacy and safety. 
The reported study is on mildly affected patients, where their efficacy was noted. In the control group, two turned serious later. Those patients surely should get Q or HQ. We still have unanswered questions. What should be the safe, therapeutically effective dose to treat coronavirus? 
We should now test treat with HQ or Q a group of seriously ill, with a matching control group. We might decide on the dose schedule guided by their treatment for malaria. Injectable preparations are available, for patients who cannot take it orally. It is imperative to monitor these patients, testing the retina and recording ECG to assess the QTc. It is also important to assess the progress of the groups, and depending on the efficacy or the lack of it, randomisation should be stopped. Medical personal, highly stressed under these extreme circumstances, may find it difficult to evaluate the patients very carefully. Leaders in medical world should work out the strategy."
2020-04-02 14:42:02,"Actually, the French study did include a control group. However, it used virus in the nasopharynx, rather than clinical improvement as an outcome measure. Also, its handling of the data about patients transferred to the ICU or deceased was inappropriate. I guess the reporter didn't read the study."
2020-04-02 15:10:16,"Of course Fauci and Hahn declined to endorse it. They're big-government bureaucrats. It is only because Trump is getting the regulations out of the way (which also slowed the testing as private labs were not getting permission to have their tests used) and pushing the beauracracy to get things done that doctors can even use these drugs for COVID-19. As an RN, I know Plaquenil has been around forever, and Z-packs are prescribed thousands of times per day. They both have excellent safety profiles, and if you sat down and took them both with no symptoms or illness of any kind you'd probably be fine! This is an emergency. We have to try to find treatments ASAP that are safe. Yes, we ultimately need the long term, double-blind gold standard clinical trials to prove the efficacy. But if they are showing promise even anecdotally and patients are getting better, we must use it. I'd take them both in a second!"
2020-04-02 14:49:02,"Don’t we have a built-in Control group of everyone else who doesn’t get the drug? Can’t the people who get the drug be matched with others who don’t get it (even retroactively based on admission data) and make a comparison? Not all important research is “placebo controlled double blind”, gold standard research."

The trend was to encourage privatization or to back-door privatize parts of the medical infrastructure. This happened under the leadership of politicians in other regions besides Catalonia. Some people paid for private insurance in order to expedite certain medical procedures. Nonetheless Spain's medical services are on par with the best elsewhere and so is the generosity of people in the medical profession."
2020-04-01 14:00:40,The majority of residents should be very comfortable with the idea of isolation. Igualada is fervently separatist and once the pandemic is over Catalan nationalism will resume its crescendo to the detriment of a country and region struggling to get back on its feet.

One day you get up, go to work, stay with friends and family and the next day you can not move from your house. Four walls. That's all. We all know that is the right thing to do, specially when you heard about all the coronavirus infected and the almost collapse of the hospital. We all hope this situacion ends the sooner the better and all of our support to the hospital staff, police and the other people fighting outside for all of us. We pray for you!"

That would break me. I started tearing up. When this is all said and done we will need to confront the toll this has taken on the mental health of our frontline healthcare providers."
2020-04-01 16:09:00,"1.25M die globally, every single year, in car crashes and collisions.

18M die globally, every single year, of cardiovascular disease (which, btw, is mainly preventable, with auto-emissions/local air pollution being a huge contributing factor).  

Not a peep about these largely preventable deaths.  We simply consider it the price for our 'freedoms' and our way of life.

And yet with COVID, the world has gone positively bonkers.  Mass hysteria is a virus unto itself.  Dictators and Communist parties are using this as a way to further control their populations.  In the US, as if we weren't divided enough, COVID has itself become politicized.  You either think Trump can do no wrong...that he is the victim here...or else you think Trump can do no good....that Trump is responsible for the COVID mess here (and apparently in the rest of the world as well?)...any suggestion that perhaps we are over-reacting is met with 'all you care about is money...you want to throw grandma under the bus...you are a monster'.  Since COVID, there is now a revolt brewing between the haves and the have-nots.  If you are able to work from home (vs being considered an 'essential worker') you are now labelled one of the 'elite', scorned by the masses.  Celebrities (even those formerly loved by the masses) are now reviled for having the audacity to own a second home to which they can retreat.

The world has gone entirely bonkers due to all this hysteria.

We are all going to die, of COVID, a car crash, etc"
2020-04-01 17:17:10,"In reading the comments thus far, I am deeply saddened by the lack of compassion and empathy shown in the majority.  Instead, there's the evil spectre for our time, politicization.  Everything viewed through the lens of politics, blaming and self interest.  We have loved every moment we've spent in Spain, and my heart goes out to all Spaniards, from the empty streets of Igualada to those of Santander and Madrid."
2020-04-01 18:32:15,I’m a firm believer in referring to history books on how human behaviour alters during such a thing as a pandemic. Those with a seeming lack of the empathy gene revert to the ‘everyone for himself or herself’ attitude while others do what they can to consider others and make a difference. Enlighten yourself and read about the times of the Black Death (1337-1350) and see if you recognise similar ‘head in the sand’ behaviour. If you do isn’t it better to be the latter and get behind all our frontline workers anyway we can and being good citizens by acting responsibly.

2020-04-01 21:30:03,"It's obnoxious to read about the catalan  ultra nationalists, that are politicizing the tragedy of this pandemic. The healthcare system in Catalonia has been managed by the separatist catalan Goverment. Since the radicals took over about 5 years ago, demanding independence based on their propaganda that they are superior to the rest of Spaniards, their attention has been concentrated on agitating for independence and not in the needs of the people. They neglected their health system, so they are to blame for  any deficiencies. We americans should support the central Government of Spain and not these fanatics."
2020-04-01 19:40:27,"With 70 deaths and ~40,000 population, the Igualada area is saturated with COVID19*.  About 15% of the population will need hospitalization (6000) and 4% will need a ventilator (1600.) 

The Igualada hospital has about 240 beds with 10 ICU beds.
(6 beds/1000 population, about 2x the US) They might have 40 ventilators.
They've already been shipping new admissions to other hospitals because about half of their staff are sick and all their beds are full. Another 5500 people from the area will need a hospital bed. Another 1500 will need a ventilator.

This is what the peak looks like when we don't
#FlattenTheCurve early enough.

*From NYT article a few weeks ago--Deaths occur on average 18 days after infection.  Assuming the deaths are among over 60 year olds, there were at least 10 cases 18 days ago for each death today. The doubling time is 3 days. Six doublings (18/3) means 64 infections for every one 18 days ago, so 640 cases now for each death up to today.  70 x 640 = 44,800, more than the local population. Likely 80%+ of the population has been exposed."

Evidently defying science and medical professionals by people like this is OK, and they are somehow protected from having to adhere to the laws of nature and to any medical advice.

Question:  Does Liberty have any physicians on campus, or any health care of any kind?  Ventilators?  Protective gear?Just wondering, and hoping these students survive this brilliant decision, which was made, I suppose, after one of those direct-line calls.  

If parents send their children back to school, I wish them the best as well.  I guess  if you pray hard and long enough, the virus will simply ""Passover"" Liberty, right?"

I hope parents of students understand how their children are being used as pawns in a futile, deadly game between a supposed evangelical leader and a virus that doesn't care about God."
2020-03-30 13:34:51,This type of action or rather lack of action by the University should be a signal to all not to attend Liberty.  Its' focus on politics and not on its student body or the local community as well as blatant disregard for State and Federal law indicates an underlying issues that warrants further legal investigation as to additional questions practices carried-out by this supposedly educational institution.

And then Falwell has the nerve to say, “We’re conservative, we’re Christian, and therefore we’re being attacked,”.  Nope, you’re being attacked for saying you are Christian but then behaving like you do not care about other human beings.

There have been many experiments to see if prayer works.  It turns out that praying for a specific outcome is less effective than simply praying without expecting an outcome.

So beneficent prayer is the way to go.  If you choose to pray.  But as the old saying goes:  “God helps those who help themselves.”

2. If Democrats were powerful enough to bring about an pandemic simply to bring Trump's downfall, they'd have used their power to win the election

3. If Liberty is worried about people criticizing it every time they sneeze, perhaps they could base decisions on science, common sense, compassion, and judgement rather than o ideology, hubris, and ego.

Would he have an epiphany, and realize his mistake and attempt to make amends, or would he stay the course and declare that it was “God’s will”?

Indeed, Liberty's mission statement pronounces:

""Persons are spiritual, rational, moral, social, and physical, created in the image of God. They are, therefore, able to know and to value themselves and other persons, the universe, and God.  [We] Encourage a commitment to the Christian life, one of personal integrity, sensitivity to the needs of others, social responsibility.""

Most colleges around the country took this kind of mission seriously, and were among the first large gathering places and workplaces to close.

Falwell's irresponsible decisions and impulsive actions contravene the principles of higher education.

But what's even more troubling is the way Falwell has behaved since then: denying and lying about fact-based evidence; politicizing his own mistakes (and bragging about them to a national audience), and lashing out at his own students and employees in vicious personal attacks.  

That's not appropriate behavior for a president of a college, and it belies the stated mission of his college.

But worse, it promulgates the same confrontational, divisive, and non-Christian message with which the Right continues to cleave our country, even during a national crisis."
2020-03-30 14:12:18,"If CV hits as hard as some experts fear, Liberty University will close its doors and not reopen. The school’s financial cushion is minimal, no matter a $2b endowment.

He needs the money and is hoping the pandemic passes without wiping out a meaningful portion of his student body. But if he guesses wrong and CV spreads on campus as if on a cruise ship, Liberty closes and Falwell’s career is toast."

This makes me proud of the university in my city. The administration was proactive in planning to not have students return after break and in transitioning to online teaching. They made the adaptions needed for staff to work remotely, temporarily transitioned some staff to new roles as student/university needs changed, and began to make a plan for appropriate refunds for unused room and board. The faculty and staff are giving 100% to try and make this unanticipated mid-semester transition happen as smoothly as possible. Through all of this the university has been transparent with our community. As difficult as it is economically to not have the students here supporting local businesses (not that many are open), the actions of the university have likely been one of the reasons we have only 7 known cases of covid-19 in our city of ~111,000 people and only 15 in our tri-county area. I am certain this difficult but appropriate response to covid-19 is being played out in a similarly responsible manner in thousands of university communities across the nation. How tragic this is not so in Lynchburg."

I doubt Falwell himself was on campus pressing palms, sitting in lecture rooms, breathing in droplets of Covid19 coughed out by sick students. No, he will have been far away, protected to the hilt.

The students who returned, and the parents who let them, are also to blame for the new infections - what part of ‘stay at home’ don’t they understand? This is not a drill. It is not a hoax. It is a deadly pandemic that picks off the most vulnerable in our society in the most horrific way. Drowning in your own body fluid, lungs so overwhelmed that patients can’t breathe.

Young, healthy students may get over it, but it’s the height of selfishness to pass this virus around the community. I thought (stupidly) that being a Christian meant protecting the weak - what was all that about The Lamb of God? 

It’s despicable to have even suggested the campus should run as normal, it is even more despicable that people are so utterly stupid they don’t even trust their own common sense.

This poisonous rebranding of faith has catastrophic results without any concept as to how or why these ideas started. Their staunch Pro-Life stance is actually just a relic of political unification with Catholics in the 1970s (even the Dallas Theological Seminary was Pro-Choice before 1974), their viewpoints on Environmental health are firmly rooted in rural expansion and local government vs Federal government issues. Their dismissal of science goes all the way back to court cases permitting evolution to be taught in schools. Evangelicalism is one giant contradiction to all we now hold logical, and it does not even realize that historical origins of its opinions are entirely based in other issues. 

Now that fear of science (which brought my 8th grade science teacher to inform us that Lucy was a hoax by secularists and had already been proven as such but that secularists were hiding the truth) is resulting in illness. Why? Because Falwell cannot follow the advice of scientists and liberals who, in his paranoid mind, must have a secret agenda to destroy the word of God through safe health practices.

““We’ve lost the ability to corral this thing,” Dr. Thomas W. Eppes Jr. said he told Mr. Falwell. But he did not urge him to close the school. “I just am not going to be so presumptuous as to say, ‘This is what you should do and this is what you shouldn’t do,’” Dr. Eppes said in an interview.”

2020-03-30 15:56:33,"Fallwell is the epitome of the stupidity and paranoia that runs rampant in Trump circles.

It's too bad, as others have pointed out, that Falwell is just another Elmer Gantry huckster hiding behind ""religion."""
2020-03-30 16:01:40,"As a Christian leader, Mr. Falwell should surely be familiar with Matthew 4:7.  
The Devil has taken Jesus to the top of the temple and tempted Him to throw himself down.  Satan quotes Psalm 91, ""and He (God) will give His angels charge concerning you, and they will bear You up in their hands, lest You dash Your foot against a stone.""
Jesus replies, ""Thou shalt not tempt The Lord Thy God,"" quoting Deuteronomy 6:16.
Jesus is saying, ""just because you know that God cares about your safety and well-being does NOT mean that you should do stupid stuff, thinking all will be well.""
A foundational Scripture is ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you,"" also stated by Jesus. Ergo, don't bring students back in the midst of a pandemic - it's bad for them and it's bad for you.
As an evangelical, I assure you that there are many of us who use the brains that God gave us.  I grieve when so-called ""leaders"" of Christianity give us a bad name.  I am sure that God does too."
2020-03-30 15:34:07,"Falwell is doing what primitive tribal leaders do.  The sciences that predict his behavior are sociobiology, evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics.  If your rule is based on superstition you must use this tool to maintain it.  Blaming your accuser's motives rather than examining what he says, is a technique used by all authoritarians.  Do not be surprised if he continues this strategy even if his student body is hit hard by COVID-19."

This sentence begs a lot to consider.

1. How does Jr. define “community?” (Let alone “appropriate”). Jr. speaks as if Liberty University, and the whole of it’s neighbors are separate entities.

2. “…As…required by law.”  How is this different than the  Pharisees’s legalism? In so, it shows an approach completely void of grace.

3. Just like the Pharisees, Jr. speaks and acts as if they are an enlightened group there to help the sick, the needy, and the lost. They are sure to keep their “White Messiah Complex” in view for the press and media. Or maybe it would be more accurate to call it a “White House Messiah Complex.”"

Mr. Falwell, your evangelical spells will not keep death away from your students & staff...your ignorance will cost lives. But what is even more frightening is the way some political and religious leaders will gladly walk lock step with Mr. Trump, happy to stay in his shadow while they compete for top fan-boy. Maybe these really are the end times...and maybe rightly so."
2020-03-30 15:42:31,"Wow, it seems, if there is truly a God's plan, that covid-19 is perfectly engineered to rid off of evangelicals and far-right pseudo Christians.

When will people stop listening to conmen like Trump and Falwell?    Falwell is a huckster not an educator, a pastor or anything else -- he's a huckster.   My bet is that he didn't want to have to refund the tuition paid by these kids when schools were shut down around the country so he decided to re-open the school so he could say ""well, you could have returned to school and you didn't, no refund.""  My other bet is that he didn't have the money to payout refunds having already spent it on himself as he's done repeatedly in the past.  Maybe the pool boy needed some new swim trunks."

The majority of the students included in this 1900 number lived off campus and came back to Lynchburg of their own accord.  The campus is not teeming with people, at all!

Example? Falwell will give a ""$1,000 credit for the next semester's tuition"". Current tuition Spring 2020 -- $395 per undergrad credit hour. A full load of 12 credits -- $4,740.

So, he keeps ALL the tuition this semester, gives a 21% discount for Fall 2020, keeps every penny of cash flow he has acquired to date. All this within Federal and State tax codes which exempts ""non-profit"" church activities.

If we walk our dog around the block we wave at a stranger looking out their window.  We clean out our garage and set out items someone may need with a Help Yourself Sign.  Most of all we do not travel, we hunker down.  Share your wealth if you are so lucky.

This is about mind control.  They control the messages their student's receive and they control what students are taught.  I would be wary of any research that comes out of that organization.  

Trump and his allies have managed to gain control over millions of minds through selectively controlling where people get their messages and tightly controlling those messages.  Do you honestly think these people will admit that they were wrong and all these ""fake"" news organizations were right?  They can't. They will lose control. They rationalize, blame, twist, and outright lie-which is what Trump does.  Who will people believe?  

And people wonder why Christianity is dying?  What it says and what it does are contradictory.  They do not see it. They live with blinders on.

I have seen organizations that push their people to be ""warriors for Christ.""  Their training is closer to the religious radicalism seen in Christianity's early years.  Christianity was never designed to be a terrorist organization.  Those people do not understand Jesus.  They are blinded by their prejudice and bias."

2020-03-30 14:08:17,"""Separate church from state"" - Jesus paraphrased

Here we have a clear cut case of Darwinism taking place. The Virus is a recently evolved new natural phenomenon. So it's evidence of evolution. Some of the poor students and religious right, some of whom refuse to acknowledge any aspect of Darwinism, are failing to adapt their behavior to the new situation and so some may die from the infection. If they have not already procreated, they will be taking their DNA out of the chain of life. Another example of Darwinianism.

The current events has science firmly subordinating  religions (shutting down religious services indefinitely). The fallout from this in the near and medium term future will be interesting to see. 

Falwell may well have blood on his hands. I imagine a difficult conversation between him and Jesus when the time comes. How could he ignore Jesus command to separate church from state, and so harm the children that have been put under his charge. 

Back on Earth Falwell may face civil wrongful death charges (See Judge Learned Hands formula for determining negligence - by that formula he is most damned, and I imagine some families will be angry, especially those victimized by exposure to students after they traveled home). I'm less sure about criminal law (its been a while, and I've never studied Virginia's)."
2020-03-30 15:20:04,"As if we needed further evidence that these people are charlatans and money grubbers in the mold of Elmer Gantry. 

Science denialism in the name of biblical absolutism is at the heart of places and decisions like this. Falwell quite literally believes in ""end times prophecies."" He does not care if people die because he attributes it all to a ""god"" who is sorting out the ""heaven bound"" from the ""hell bound."" 

... And people complain about Islamic sharia law."

Falwell is one of a number of right-wing religious and political leaders who embraced President Trump's early claims that the Coronavirus pandemic was a hoax... a conspiracy by Democrats to unseat him. These leaders have allowed their partisan rage to override their better judgment. 

Any religious or political leader who ignores public health warnings out of misplaced political loyalty to President Trump should be removed immediately. And if, because of their carelessness, these leaders end up causing mass illness and deaths, they should be arrested and prosecuted for manslaughter."

Further, as the school is not prepared to offer online classes tuitions should be refunded. Falwell claims to be a Christian. But he is not. He is nothing more than a con man. A sheep in wolfs clothing. A snake oil salesman. He sells morality which he does not live by.

To open his tweet with “I’m as right wing as they get” is his attempt to elevate his credibility with Falwell before he criticizes him. It didn’t work because credibility doesn’t persuade cult leaders.

Will Brittain ever be able to understand that he and his three children are members of a cult? Will this brief moment of disagreement with Falwell lead to further evaluation of the spell he is under? Most likely not. 

Falwell and Trump are cult leaders. They continue to weave narratives that appeal to their followers. Their narratives are not for the rest of us. They are only for the purpose of giving followers reasons to ‘keep the faith’. Thus we hear from both Falwell and Trump that criticism of them is for the purpose of discrediting Liberty University and/or to persuade people to not vote for Trump. 

These are cult leaders, not empathetic human beings. The purpose of cult leaders is to maintain followers, not to save lives. The sooner we accept that, the better off we will be because we can then stop turning to these men expecting them to help the rest of us or make decisions in others’ best interests. They simply do not have the capacity to do so and never will.

This quality is distinctly lacking with the current administration's leadership, and ripples with the legislators who are worried about trying to carve an opportunity with this crisis and with tone-deaf governors.

A very few people remain on campus - most are unable to travel home and the campus is keeping a skeleton staff to keep them fed with take-out food only. 
Much of the Falwell quotes are from early in the month when NYC officials were still telling people to go out to restaurants & movie theaters. Taking quotes out of context is fake news.

Both like the limelight, but don’t know how to react when faced with a big problem. Neither has problem-solving capability, nor will either accept advice.

Trump has few expert advisors to consult and distrusts those he does have. Dr Fauci has become the acknowledged expert, and, thus, is undermining Trump's prestige. Uh-oh.

Far be it from me to question the infallibility of Falwell's expert advisor, but his communication with an all-knowing, all-powerful counselor seems to be a bit fuzzy. So he looks to Trump who listens to his gut—and we know what's in there. Uh-oh X 2.

We can only hope that when this pandemic has run its course, Americans will understand that all that glitters is not gold, and value is not found in gold alone. Puffed-up charlatans should never be put into positions of power, no matter how enticing their claims. Our president was buddies with Jeff Epstein, and Falwell still trusts his judgement.

The thing that needs to happen is that mold needs to be broken up to bits so we can start minting mature adults rather than man- and women- babies.  But instead, the government response to this crisis has been to extend that magical pixie-dust ""deferred payment"" line of credit to governors who are afraid to preside over what is an inevitable NATURAL disaster... and instead keep engaging the power of the state in questionable (from not just a Constitutional standpoint, but also a public health standpoint) actions designed to kick the can down the road.  If we can get a vaccine or a reliable respiratory drug then they will look like geniuses for stalling, but otherwise they look like peace-nick's who are unfit to lead in time of war.  Demonizing a university for allowing students to return is nothing more than a different form of passing the buck.

But the fervor with which religious conservatives would sell their souls seems mystifying. Do they doubt the science? Do they feel they're on the right side of god and safely in his good graces? Plagues as retribution were a feature of biblical times, but hundreds of years of scientific and medical accomplishments after the enlightenment should have tempered such outdated thinking. 

No, I think conservative religious leaders aligned with J Falwell, Jr. are willing to make the same sacrifices among their followers (as well as collateral damage among those near about) for a greater goal.

2020-03-30 23:52:09,"I am a college professor in Canada. Where possible, our classroom-based courses are now delivered online for the rest of the term. Our domestic students have been encouraged to go home but our international students who are in residence have been allowed to stay in residence. This is understandable - while they're encouraged to return home, they are worried about how online studying from their home country might impact their student visa status, and we cannot tell them definitively if their next semester (which we run from May to August) will be affected.  Some of them have only been here since January and they're still experiencing adjustment shocks to being in a different country with a very different culture. Besides all of this, I think it's inhumane to evict these foreign students from residence and onto the streets if they have nowhere else to go and no one here in this country to rely on. 

We shifted from classroom-based learning to online learning starting on March 16th. Earlier this afternoon, an email was sent from administration - we now have our first presumptive positive case on our campus, a student in residence. I imagine more cases will emerge. 

I wouldn't want to be a decision maker in the upper echelon of our college administration. Kicking students out of residence if they have nowhere to go is not palatable. But inviting *all* students back to campus like they're doing at Liberty University? That's asking for trouble..."

The author thought the story to be dubious, but it makes a good point. I traveled through Narita last year and my mile let me upgrade. Those toilets in the lounge? Wow!!! Then when my Father was dying. my little brother installed a fancy bidet in his Hospice room. Boy did the CNA's appreciate that.

A friend of my wife is coming up later today to get some from us.  She said she'd pay $10/roll, as a joke, but for people who can't use water, you could charge them almost anything.  They gotta have tp and can't imagine life without it.  People are really strange.

2020-04-01 18:31:08,"As a French person I must say the notion of ""bidet"" is quite outdated. Bathrooms were equipped with a bidet before WWII (that's 80 years ago…) because in most houses they were merely a ""cabinet de toilette"" which had no shower or bathtub and merely consisted of a washbasin plus a bidet (the ""lavatory"" itself was, and still is, in a separate tiny room known for generations as the ""petit coin"" (little corner), a vanished expression. Everyday washing was merely done on ""strategic"" parts of the body: face, neck, ears, feet and intimate parts. Grand washing was done once a week with a large basin laid on the floor. Bathtub was a luxury. Shower didn't hit before the 50's.

I'm 72 and all my life the ""bidet"", when there was one, was only used to drop dirty underwear and socks before taking them to the washing machine. 
This is not to say that we don't obviously overuse toilet paper with devastating results to collective life and the environment… and I traveled in many countries where cleaning oneself with a bucket of water was common. 
I feel we can do the same in our so-called ""civilized"" western countries without the need for another piece of equipment in our bathrooms. It's more a matter of organization than anything else.
In this regard the Japanese option is interesting as it combines two needs : answering the call of nature and being clean without environmental harm at both ends of the process (waste of wood and harming rivers and water ressources with bleached paper)."

Every toilet I used there (except one squatter), in from hotels to gas stations, had a simple bidet nozzle affixed in the toilet, which you operated by a knob or handle on the wall that looked like a shut off valve. They weren’t fancy but they worked great. You hardly needed any toilet paper—just a small amount to dry off. They were awesome. Unfortunately I never see these basic models here—they all seem to be associated with luxury toilets as described in the article. But they don’t have to be."

It's one of the things I miss the most when I'm away from home. I'm especially glad that I have it now since it cuts the toilet paper I need by at least 75%.

These cheap bidet attachments are easy to install by yourself. They usually come with tools and a a T-valve to use the toilet's water supply, but you might need some extra parts depending on how your toilet is set up. If you order one now, don't spend more than $50 on a cheap non-electric model. Many sellers on Amazon and eBay are gouging bidets right now."
2020-04-01 17:17:28,"In all the hotels where we stayed in Cambodia, there was installed from the wall next to the toilet a simple spray device that looked and functioned exactly like the ""sink sprayer"" that is standard issue on most US kitchen sinks. When we returned to Ghana, my travelling companion installed these in the restrooms at his place of business, to cut down on the expense of toilet paper. So far, they experiment has been working well, although I have reservations about the spread of intestinal parasites even by means of this no-contact sprayer. 

The first time I saw a bidet was several years ago while travelling in French West Africa. I thought it was a ""janitor's sink"" or a foot bath. I never thought I was supposed to expose my nether parts to a spray of water from a calcium crusted faucet with a rusty handle. There are intestinal parasites that could be spread by use of a poorly cleaned bidet. It is a fomite. ( One of the things that spreads intestinal parasites but also diseases like Cholera or Typhoid: Food, Fingers, Feces, Flies and Fomites--which are object you touch in the environment.) Which makes the spring loaded handle of the kitchen sprayer a fomite, too. I will stay with toilet paper and wand washing."
2020-04-01 18:00:40,It helps to be mindful with the TP.  Do you really need a handful with every go?  I've started taking a few sheets at a time and adding more as necessary.
2020-04-01 18:10:41,When I designed and built my barrier free bathroom 2 years ago I indulged in a Brondell 1000.  One of the best house products I ever bought.  Once you have it installed you will never look back or regret this smart purchase.
2020-04-01 18:45:26,“Embracing the bidet” a bit risky these days.

2020-04-01 17:35:37,"When I designed and renovated our apartment, I specced a Duravit toilet with an integrated washlet seat.
It heats the water, the seat is heated and it has a fan for drying.

The thing is great! Life altering… ;-)

Toto sells a variety of retrofit seats with similar features.

I really don't understand Americans' aversion to them.
Stand alone bidets I can understand the hesitation."

2020-04-01 17:16:47,"So many environmentally sustainable and healthy practices such as washing after a bowel movement, taboos against using the left hand while eating, not sipping from glasses, washing hands before and after meals to ensure hygiene were practised for centuries in Asia and elsewhere.  But these were deemed 'backward,' 'filthy' and 'underdeveloped' by modernisers from the west and thereafter by local elites. For the most part today these cultural practices have been erased from modern memory except among the lower classes who cannot afford the cost of modern ways.  
Today, the production and consumption of toilet paper, disposable plates and utensils, paper napkins and much else contribute to the GDP and 'development' touting national progress in many countries.  COVID-19 is perhaps an intrusive visitor urging us to take a second look at the ways we live and change the world. Who knows?  Nature and other cultures might still teach us a thing or two about our youthful disregard and arrogance around other ways of doing and being.  Our cultural diversity, not our homogenization may hold the key to our survival."
2020-04-01 17:45:32,"Yup. Said this ages ago, but I've been to Turkey. Of all our problems, and they are many, this is not one.

Get over it. Even without a bidet, if you're out of TP, just use some soap and water. Rinse. Towel or air dry. All clean. 

Then wash your hands well, of course, which you should be doing anyway, TP or not.

If this is the biggest challenge you face throughout Covid-19, count yourself blessed."

He didn’t know the name but I and my table mates had a chuckle. Presently, I have a handheld sprayer attached to the water supply. It is cold water but I’m ok with. I use bidet for 60 years. No, not right after I was toilet trained."
2020-04-01 17:00:16,"Just make sure your bidget is good quality. We installed one at our house, and about a year later I came home to find the house flooded. The top had popped off and it poured water onto the floor for who knows how long. Our insurance company tried to locate the manufacturer, but found that it was an obscure company in China they couldn't locate."
2020-04-01 17:57:15,"I installed a Brondell bidet attachment right before the pandemic hit, just by dumb luck. It was about $30 and works great. In the past three weeks, I've used less than one roll of TP. It's so nice to be clean and not waste so much paper."

If you have a roomy stall shower, a hose-attached shower head with a selection for ""jet"" or similarly-named setting will be as effective. The shower head can then be switched to a suitable setting for thoroughly washing the shower with the hose and detergent."
2020-04-01 18:54:04,Yes.   I lived in the UAE for 5 years.   It is not only more sanitary but wonderful.   I can’t wait to get one installed in my house.   Saving.  They are not cheap

2020-04-01 19:16:08,"Long ago when visiting Buenos Aires I made my first acquaintance with a bidet.  I knew about the concept, and once I had figured out how to use it properly (after flooding the bathroom)...I ran out, bought a bottle of wine and a pack of smokes and spent the evening ""rinsing.""  That said, back in NY, in my tiny apartment with a hand held shower device, if you time your daily ablutions properly, one can go months on a single roll of TP."
2020-04-01 18:52:30,Been using a cheap cold water version for a couple years. Works great and is much more environmentally friendly. Use it before the shower.
2020-04-01 19:08:43,"I bought a basic bidet seat attachment in 2003 from biobidet for less than $50.  I have since purchased more than 15 of them, for each person who tried it,including everyone in my family, and loved it.  Once you've used one, you can never go back.  We've even purchased them for our toilets here in Paris and haven't opened a new roll of toilet paper since we've been in containment, 16 days ago!"
2020-04-01 19:09:22,"Bidets don’t install themselves. I imagine plumbers, like so many other workers, suddenly find themselves in mortal danger on a regular basis. This doesn’t seem like a good time for “elective plumbing”. It is a good time for Americans to stop being squeamish, become their own “service worker”, and put their non-standard wiping paper in a tightly sealed trash bag. Let’s not also further endanger sanitation workers."
2020-04-01 19:10:41,"Our household uses a hand held bidet that is universal in Vietnam.  I always assumed this was a French introduction but after reading the article I am thinking maybe not.  I only remember seeing a French style bidet once in Vietnam in a very old luxury hotel.

It is basically a trigger activated nozzle on a short reinforced hose.  It came with a valve that lets you tee in to the water source under the toilet tank, no special tools needed.  It is easy to find on the universal online merchant site (begins with A,)  There may be some splash-back on to your hand if not careful, so washing is necessary after use.  Because of this device, a Costco pack of toilet paper lasts us nearly a year."

Don't do silly things like flushing wipes. Buy a bidet. They aren't even expensive. Enjoy."
2020-04-01 19:11:42,"Bidet YES!

2020-04-01 19:23:42,"Yes!! And why won't they? I don't know how anyone could think they are clean down there after they've moved that stuff around with paper. They think that's acceptable? No, it's not. It's a really gross stop-gap measure until you next take a bath. Use water, be clean, save paper (and money), save time (no more hunting for TP).  Use a few sheets to pat yourself dry after cleaning with water."
2020-04-01 18:06:31,"I live in a rental apartment and can't install a bidet, so I've come up with my own solution.

I bought 40 cheap washcloths to be used only for going to the toilet. When I urinate, I wet one of the washcloths in the sink and then use it to wipe myself. Then I take a dry washcloth and wipe myself dry.

Then, as one would do with dirty diapers, I put the washcloths into a pail of water with bleach. They sit there until it's time to do the next load of laundry.

For defecation though, I still use toilet paper. But I have very little left and am not sure what I'll do when it runs out."

2020-04-01 18:32:27,"Was sure there would be a mention of the Tushy product.  Is that what she calls a ""smart toilet""?  Wish she hadn't made this article as much about bidets instead of the Tushy-type alternatives."
2020-04-01 18:38:47,"We have the bidet in our private house in Staten Island.  It is great, it is what my whole family uses after number two, sorry for tmi.  But it is much cleaner this way.  Once an electrician came to our house and went into the bathroom and asked, why do you have two toilets? I said, jokingly so that we are not bored.  The bidet was next to the regular toilet."
2020-04-01 19:27:41,Let's be completely honest: getting wet is not the same thing as getting clean. Sometimes a peripheral spritz is just not going to do the job. On occasion what is required is not just water but also soap and a little ... intervention.

2020-04-01 18:26:29,Wherever there is a bidet there is also a regular toilet. So you need space for two fixtures.
2020-04-01 18:54:05,"For all those lamenting about the enormous increase in water usage, how many gallons do you think it takes to spritz off your tush?  And let's not forget that paper mills are located on rivers, for goodness sake, to make use of all the water necessary (and with some degrees of pollution) and returned to the river.  In the winter the plant near here is easily visible with the clouds of water vapor pouring out of them.  

The clear winner is the bidet for water use.  Think of how much water goes down even the mini flush toilets?  After all our President thinks it takes 10-15 flushes per use, doesn't he?

I'll have to see what retrofit kits are available for already installed toilets.   I hope they come with heaters, the idea of a cold blast isn't too helpful."

2020-04-01 19:35:19,"We’ve been using a bidet seat on the toilet in our home for 5 or 6 years.  I now can’t imagine any other way.  What is taking this country so long?  My unit replaced the toilet seat and has a choice of two nozzles that extend when you push the attached water lever.  The water supply tube was easily connected from a tee in the toilet supply line just above the shut off valve.  I did this myself with one wrench, a very quick job.  Way less toilet paper and much more thorough and sanitary procedure.  It makes leaving home feel like a descent into a crude universe.  Of course, there is the element of western privilege, since so many people on the planet don’t have water supply to their toilets.  But it does save a huge amount of paper."
2020-04-01 19:37:13,"I'm continually amazed by the people who get grossed out by this. Installed one in our place a year ago. Amazing. Have sold a few folks, but most people just can't talk about it.
I would suggest spending the money on a decent one. Not a great thing to get cheap on. There's a Toto in the $400 range that's perfect. We went for something in the $700 range, which wasn't necessary, but OK."
2020-04-01 19:40:46,Far more hygenic and though a slight bit more water usage this is easily offset by the savings from cutting virgin forests to make disposable paper that is flushed into water systems.  A matter of habit changing and of course the young will lead the way here.
2020-04-01 19:59:13,"Once you get one, you never want to go back!  We installed a Brondell washlet type in MBR bath. My husband installed and we loved it.  Later, half bath remodel, installed a Toto washlet, also fantastic.  My adult daughter thought we were nuts until she tried it, now she bought and installed a Tushy, inexpensive solution for apartment living, only problem, water not heated, ;).  
My husband was originally skeptical, but now he is more of a fan than I even was, and purchased a little travel wand type one for traveling.  
In our house, we use a bit of TP first, then the bidet, dry with a bit of TP.   Many models including ours has a warm air blower to dry but often we just are too impatient to wait for a full dry, hence a bit of TP.  
Still cuts down on TP use, also feels much cleaner and is helpful for people who have hemorrhoids etc.  
I imagine it would also be very nice after childbirth.
Could use for #1 but I don't, generally, mainly again due to my personal impatience.
Don't knock it till you've tried it!"

2020-04-01 19:45:41,"As the happy owner of a Toto Washlet, I'm sorry to inform you that while it does many wonderful things as noted here, it still requires the use of toilet paper. It may cut down a bit, but it's still a luxury item for most at around $1,500 installed.  That's quite a lot of toilet paper."

We didn't have a bidet in Dublin and he never once said anything about it. And as far as I know, he doesn't use the one in our new house in Milan. It just sits there, an unused piece of sanitaryware. I guess he's out of practice?

Whenever we get back from a vacation, other than say,Japan or South Korea (where smart toilets are common), we are excited to be back to our civilized toilets. We'll never go back. And yes, we still use TP, after the spritz, but much less."

We have the best sanitation in the world ,now just up grade the features of the commode."
2020-04-01 19:45:49,"Installed bidets in all of our home toilets several years ago. Installation is quick and not difficult, and there are a number of good ones that are not expensive.

What a difference! I'll never go back to being bidet-less, and hate it when I'm forced to do so elsewhere (which, in this country, is virtually everywhere).

And we use so much less TP now - usually just one time around to dry things off."

add on bidet.It was very fancy,with a wireless remote control
and several choices of cleaning modes.After a few years it sprung a leak.Being a do it yourself type, I took it apart in
an attempt to fix it.Let me be as discreet as possible here
in describing what I found. In places that were impossible to clean as they were covered by other parts I found  a large residue of  caked ""you know what"". In talking with my wife
I found out that she had stopped using it as she kept getting
bladder infections from it.(She hadn't mentioned this to
me before as she is very shy about talking about certain 
subjects.I do wish she had mentioned this earlier.)To
completely clean it,you would have to take it apart every
time. And this would require a lot of knowledge about the
construction of the unit and a few tools.Not something the
average person would know how to do or would want to do. None of this was mentioned in the instructions.And this was a top of the line Japanese brand, advertised widely.So if you
So if you are thinking about buying one of these units,do your homework."
2020-04-01 20:08:39,"Bidets use simply water, to my knowledge.  If that same output (fecal matter) were on one's face, would only water -- and not also soap --  make one comfortable and sanitary? No, no, no. The bidet alone is not for me.  
After a bathroom use that requires TP, I use a disposable kind of wet wash soap-infused towelette that, obviously can be thrown away -- but not into the toilet!"

2020-04-01 20:36:27,"I don't know how much water would be required if everyone had a bidet, but in California where we are so often facing drought it may not be the best idea."
2020-04-01 21:02:24,"I use both toilet paper and a hose bidet (similar to a hand held shower). The combination, in my opinion, gives me the cleanest feel and minimizes usage (3 square of TP followed by 10 seconds of spray)."
2020-04-01 21:02:29,"Back in the mid-seventies my late wife and I vacationed in a small town in the Costa Brava in Spain. We rented a room in a local house. When we wanted to shower in their small square-shaped tub, the owners would turn on the water heater for us. One time I thought I might conserve some water by setting the faucet/shower control lever at the halfway point, thereby stopping the flow. As I leaned over to do this, I felt a spray of water hitting my bottom. It was a triple-function tub!"
2020-04-01 21:16:48,"I've considered installing toilets with a built-in bidet, like the one pictured.

But I have a serious question (and hope it will be taken seriously).  In cultures like that the author describes, where people use a bucket of water, I assume that involves the use of one's bare hand.  If so, how does one sanitize one's hand afterwards?  I'm thinking that would require a LOT of scrubbing with soap and water."
2020-04-01 20:18:19,"If you've ever lived in an unheated house in upstate New York, you'll understand why toilet paper is popular. Indoor plumbing too. Spraying your backside with unheated water is not fun. The less clothes you take off the better.

That said, we have a hose attached to one of our toilets. The idea is to rinse out reusable diapers. Eureka. You have an impromptu bidet. You could use reusable toilet wipes instead provided you have a washer and dryer. The attachment cost like $15 I think."
2020-04-01 17:24:19,"I was in a serious motorcycle accident about a year ago. Broken leg, broken arm and fractured vertebrae. The rehab facility I was in for 5 weeks had a bidet and I first started using there. I have never stopped. It made things much easier and when I got back home, I installed it on every toilet I have. It has cut down the use of toilet paper by at least 80% for my family. We are on septic so this reduces the amount of waste that needs to get pumped out yearly. Friends come over and try it and laugh but soon realize the benefits.

I've seen comments about the use of water (minimal) and getting use to it (takes a bit but well worth it). Don't slam something unless you've tried and then it's not for you. I would never have used one unless I had the accident. Now, I'm a convert."
2020-04-01 21:18:56,"I've been using a very free version of a bidet for several years--the peri bottle I got from the hospital after my first child was born. It's the perfect amount of water and if you squeeze it hard it's the perfect amount of force to clean front and back at the same time. Then I just dry with a couple squares of TP. Might only work for women, but I highly recommend buying one for $0.95 to understand what being TRULY clean feels like."
2020-04-01 19:41:08,"The US is the only modern country who hasn't adopted the bidet, thanks to a $16 billion toilet paper industry that pushed expensive bathroom wipes on everyone to combat it.  But as more people travel, the word spreads.  My family members have installed hand-held, temperature controlled bidets a few years ago, following a member's travel experiences.  Once you've used one you'll never go back, because you realize just how not-clean you are with TP.  A roll of TP lasts me a month.  Anyone can install one, it's very easy, and they're readily available online.  Although they were selling pretty fast when everyone started hoarding paper."
2020-04-01 17:18:45,"Ah, finally I get to comment on something more positive from here in Italy!!!! 
Almost all domestic (and a lot of public) bathrooms in Italy have bidets. There never was a run on TP here because there didn't need to be.

Please also consider, they aren't merely good for your personal hygienic cleaning. They're great too if you don't feel like taking a big shower. They're good for soaking your feet after a long day. You can do hand laundry in them. You can even wash your cats easily in a bidet.

They are truly a nice thing to have."
2020-04-01 21:20:43,"Possibly I'm a bit dense, but what exact technique is the writer description? The velocity of water from a watering can doesn't seem to be enough to get the job done. Nor can I imagine the bodily contortion required to get gravity to work in one's favor."
2020-04-01 17:55:56,"My family in Italy keeps asking me what the big deal is about toilet paper. And shortage?
I found it hard to explain that American bathrooms do not have bidets. Yes, it is like telling them that bathroom do not have sinks."
2020-04-01 19:12:58,"After a couple trips to Europe over the last two years, I couldn’t understand why we Americans haven’t adopted such a great invention as the bidet. A little research found that you can purchase ones that go right on your current toilet and are super affordable. We installed them on all our home toilets last year and I can’t imagine every going back! Skip the TP hoarding and just go squirt water bottle and clean washcloth/hand towel at this current moment."
2020-04-01 19:09:53,"In Italy, there is a law requiring the installation of the bidet. I quote the article of law. Ministerial Decree of 5 July 1975, Article 7 states: ""For each accommodation, at least one bathroom must be equipped with the following sanitary facilities: toilet, bidet, bath or shower, washbasin"". When my old aunts over eighty years old, who have ever travelled the world, read about you who have hoarded toilet paper, they laughed first and were disgusted later."
2020-04-01 19:22:39,"Of course! In the kitchen, no one considers doing the dishes with a towel only and no washing. Why should the toilet be any different?"
2020-04-01 19:29:15,"This article is what the Pulitzer Prize exists for.

Come on, America! People haven't had to wipe themselves since the Renaissance. There are no good reasons to avoid a washlet of some source. From smart toilets to hand-held bottles with strategically designed nozzles, you have options to be cleaner and better. The trees will prosper, and your underwear will smell better. Why cling to old habits, such as clinging?"
2020-04-01 20:12:52,"For the life of me, I can't understand why these aren't commonplace in all new builds/remodels in America. We'll spend oodles of money on perfumes, fancy soaps, health foods, household cleaners, etc all in attempt to be healthy, smell healthy and look healthy, but we're still latched on to the same way we've been using the toilet for centuries?
My boyfriend and I are about to purchase our first home and you can guarantee that all toilets are going to be converted to bidets. A clean butt, is a happy butt!"
2020-04-01 20:18:00,"We have had an aftermarket seat for close to four years.  I miss it when I travel.  There is one basic understanding that everyone should come to terms with...you will need to get involved, not just sit there passively.

Unless you drop fibrous little goat scat or rabbit turds, you will need to get in there, the same way one does when in the shower or tub. It certainly encourages you to wash your hands more consistently, always a plus.  Anyone who thinks that nothing gets on their hands while using gobs of toilet paper is fooling themselves.

When people ask me about this, I ask them, ""If you were to trip and land hand first into a pile of dog poop, would your first instinct be to run in the house and find the flimsiest paper you can find and wipe your hand off in a darkened room?""

Because that's what you do regularly with toilet paper on a very important part of you.  Its time we grow up."
2020-04-01 20:15:17,"Most people defecate in the morning, usually after a cup or two of coffee, nature's laxative. You can avoid using paper if you step straight from the toilet into the shower. Wash your anus with soap and water. It's pretty darned simple. It's even easier if you have a shower hose."
2020-04-01 21:01:06,"While bidet sprays water on you, that water (& possibly poop) splashes back on the nozzle. Then nozzle sprays next person. Gross even if there was no poop. Does the nozzle get cleaned and SANITIZED after each use. Do you dry off with TP or does it blow you dry afterwards?"
2020-04-01 20:12:46,"I grew up with one, and have one installed on my commode--- easy self install $45, bought online years ago.  I am not going to enumerate here the number of reasons that bidets are so helpful...women just know this... it is right up our alley in a matter of speaking, and for men too."
2020-04-01 21:23:35,"I see some women commenters endorsing but does a woman have to use the bidet in a certain manner or direction in order for the feces not to wash down into the genito-urinary tract and potentially cause a UTI? Also, in countries where there’s a spray nozzle next to the toilet the toilet seat itself is wet. Do those drops of water contain fecal matter?"
2020-04-01 20:26:35,"I bought and installed 20$ low budget bidet, aka butt-hose and am using far less TP."
2020-04-01 20:57:20,"Hey guys.  I put in a bidet last month needing no plumber or electrician. Mother Earth 1, Charmin’ 0.  Recommend it highly.  It will pay for itself in a few years and you won’t smell like a camel’s backside."
2020-04-01 19:53:23,"So will I have to worry about still wiping my derriere, or will I have to worry about water dripping down my leg?
You know when you wipe and move on sometime the scent sticks to you, do you still have to worry about that with the Bidet?

How's maintenance? Is this sanitary over time? Is the water cold? Will my water bill increase?"
2020-04-01 21:27:37,"In Canada, and especially in winter, any bidet has to have a way to heat the water. Cold water in many Canadian cites arrives at the tap just a few degrees above freezing for months (less than 45F for about 5 months), and is pretty chilly the rest of the year.  And this has to be 'instant', since no one wants to be sprayed with ice cold water while waiting for the hot water to arrive from the hot water tank.  This makes bidet attachments that use the cold water supply from the toilet useless."
2020-04-01 21:28:00,"Once I tried a bidet, there was no going back. I started with the kind that didn't need electricity and moved up to the heated seat and water. Honestly, I don't know why it isn't more popular."
2020-04-01 20:14:24,"I was in Japan in '02. The hotel had the Toto Washlet seats. It was with some trepidation that I approached this device. Suffice it to say that upon my return I purchased and installed a Toto S300 in our home. Clean! Let me say again. Clean! So many laugh at the idea of them, but they are simply so sensible. When we moved West in '11 that seat was the only thing I took out of the house. 18 years later it continues to be as reliable and wonderful. We are on a septic system and TP is hardly used. I am in the industry and have spoken with the folks at Toto US and Japan. It is men who most use and need these marvelous products. Also, it is not the alarm clock that gets you up in the morning. It is planting your derrière on the cold seat that does it. Granted, they are not inexpensive but I should be about break even after 18 yrs, and considering how full of it I am, it could have been much sooner!"

2020-04-01 21:24:11,"Wife and I were spoiled by bidet toilets when visiting Japan, so much so we had 2 (Toto Washlets) installed just last year. Nothing like it. Upon use, it provides you with a certain confidence throughout the day...Be bold, ask your boss for that raise, ride that bike or horse while going ""commando"" in your white trousers. Bluebirds will flit about as you pull your pants up, hopefully following you through the rest of your day...because you will need that confidence when your selfish bottom tries to return the excess toilet paper you have hoarded during the past weeks!"
2020-04-01 21:24:49,Yes! The American habit of walking around with an unwashed butt is downright disgusting. I didn't understand this until I traveled. Even primitive toilets in Asia have a spray hose that can do the job. A Canadian friend calls the device a 'Bum Gun'. Time for the US to join the civilized world.
2020-04-01 20:34:19,"I'm convinced! I'll get a bidet or attachment installed as soon as possible. This is undoubtedly a total win-win, not only for users, but for the environment. Too bad for the toilet paper manufacturers. Like they say: all  dark clouds have a silver lining!  For sure, something good was going to result from this crisis. This should be one of them."
2020-04-01 20:06:26,Italians use BOTH toilet (first) and bidet (after). Then they wash their hands: soap and nailbrush.

2020-04-01 20:10:38,"Visiting Finland, we were very impressed with the fact that within reach of every toilet we saw, connected to a nearby lavatory so that you could adjust the temperature, was a handheld water wand to spritz and clean your privates. Super simple, convenient, and effective."
2020-04-01 20:12:33,"You don’t need toilet paper. If you know there’s a Number 2 on its way, strip off, do your stuff, jump in the shower and clean your bum, wash your hands. Easy."
2020-04-01 19:55:32,"How dumb, lazy and selfish can some people be?  Until such time if/when Americans get bidets, throw any paper towels, baby wipes etc. in the garbage.  Not in the toilet.  It ain't all that hard folks.  Unless the idea of no working toilets at all, is more appealing to you??"

2020-04-01 19:56:31,"Finally got my bidet seat and it’s a dream. Especially since toilet paper is still hard to come by in my area. I wish I could work from the toilet now, but that would be awkward for my colleagues. Otherwise, if you need me, I’ll be on the pot."
2020-04-01 20:27:56,Yes! So ready. Using just toilet paper and even wipes is so gross.
2020-04-01 20:26:09,Very useful when suffering from diarrhea.
2020-04-01 21:11:52,"Please writers, and people.  Stop using the term ""bidet""  A bidet is a separate appliance needing separate space and plumbing connections not available in existing bathrooms that washes your behind.  What we are talking about here is a ""washlet"" toilet seat.  These fit right on your existing toilet (replacing the existing seat) and connect into your existing water supply.  They wash you with a stream of warm water, then dry you off with warm air.  The seat is also heated. Good ones aren't cheap -- they run around $250, but that's way less than a bidet or a Toto type toilet (which is actually the same basic thing anyway). All you need that you might not already have is an electric outlet near the toilet (to run the water heater, pump, and dryer that are integral to the unit).  Why the US hasn't converted to these things already is beyond me.  They are way better than TP.  Once you've tried one you will never go back."

2020-04-01 20:27:20,"One of the bright moments of the past couple of weeks was the arrival of the hand-held bidet. It attached to the bathroom faucet and has a diverter, so required no plumbing or electrical interventions, and you can set the water temperature to your taste. $40. It took about five minutes to set up. Works quite well, thank you very much.

What is all the grimacing and eye-rolling about using a bidet (usually by men)? You wash your backside in the shower, don't you? (At least I hope so.)"
2020-04-01 19:36:26,"Well traveled in India and the Arab world where toilet paper is considered unsightly and unsanitary.  The left hand, soap and water is used, then you wash your hands well which we should be doing anyway.  For those with hair, toilet paper rarely does nearly as good a job and leaves us at the mercy of spouses intolerant of our “skid marks.”  I compromise by using two squares of paper to get the main stuff off, then heading for the sink.  Works like a charm and haven’t gotten into trouble with the boss for years."

Luckily, it appears that the toilet-paper hoarders are forcing many other Americans to discover this joy for themselves."
2020-04-01 21:32:26,"There must be a good reason that TP became such a widely used product but, I now wonder why.  In any case, TP will continue to be my go-to product, for whatever reason."
2020-04-01 20:30:38,"There's a big difference between a real bidet and a Japanese ""washlet"".   A real one is a little wash tub with a sink like faucet.
You use your hand with soap and water as you would in a shower.
No toilet paper needed.  A washlet only sprays water so wet wipes and or toilet paper are needed.  Big difference."
2020-04-01 21:34:10,"Bidets use water. In areas of the country faced with chronic climate-change related drought, bidets would only make the water crisis worse. Should the upper middle class (which would be the main sector to buy bidets) ratchet up the competition for water? Maybe large numbers of bidets installed in CA, NV, AZ would mean that farm workers would be severely rationed in water supply? These states already have more people than the water supply can support. Increasing per person use won't exactly improve matters.

The sweeping prescription of bidets for everyone doesn't take regional environment into consideration."

2020-04-01 20:40:57,"I strongly support using a Bidet where water can clean you in between the legs. Using  toilet paper is not only a wasteful  way but also harms the environment. On top of that it is really, really painful  to use toilet paper to reach your target spot  if you have back pain and arthritis."
2020-04-01 20:43:49,"Reminds me of a story I heard years ago of an American couple going to Europe for the first time using the Bidet as a drinking fountain.  Hope it is an urban legend, but........"
2020-04-01 20:09:28,"I bought a bidet about 3 weeks before the coronavirus blew up in North America.  I bought it because I was tired of a sore bum after doing my business.

I bought the Luxe Bidet with the two settings, one for behind and one for the girlie bits.  It installs right on your existing toilet and this gal installed it herself in less than 1/2 hour.

Once you go to water cleaning, you will never go back.  The world will breath easier as less trees will be needed for toilet paper.  I use probably 1/10th the amount of TP as I used to.  I use a cloth for patting dry after number one, so don't use any paper in that circumstance.  

I know some will say, TMI, but you know what.  The bidet should be a household fixture in every bathroom. I know it gets a lot of laughs and jokes, and it does surprise you the first couple times you use it.  But you get used to it, and after you've converted to the bidet, you will never go back to scratch and wipe."
2020-04-01 21:02:18,"If one uses a wipe it isn't necessary to flush it.  You can put it in the trash.  Just because the package says ""flushable"" that doesn't mean in large numbers.  I thought this was common knowledge.  My question about bidets is: are many of them fitted with warm water?  Who wants to rinse with cold water? And then, what is used for drying? Toilet paper?"
2020-04-01 21:17:48,"Yes it is time. If you have ever lived in a country that has a habit of using bidets you will see immediately that it is a much more sensible way to manage toilet hygiene without wasting the water required to flush paper down the toilet.The use of toilet paper is by no means ""cleaner"" than use of a bidet. The waste products go the same place and the municipal water system doesn't have to deal with clogged pipes. Three cheers for bidets!"

You don't need a fancy bidet, or a Japanese toilet that plays music. A ten dollar spray hose from Home Depot, which even the completely lamest of us could install, would do the trick.  if I could attach a picture I would.

With a bidet you must physically move your body )with pants still down_ before washing then standing up. The bum washer/sprayer works better."

Mine only has one input.  In a single family home, that is a problem in the winter, super cold water.  So I installed a small inline, 2  KW instant water heater.  Another way to do it is to install a small tank type, under counter water heater.  

The fancy ones with internal heaters cost a fortune.  If you live in a high rise, the water should not be as cold in the winter."

A bidet is a separate fixture next to the toilet which does involve plumbing and labor to install. A washlet replaces the toilet seat and has a built-in sprayer and sometimes other features such as different spray settings, a dryer, and/or a heated seat. Washlets, which the author is mostly referring to, take much less effort to install and the simpler models can be installed in minutes by anyone."

My fancy parents returned from France in the 80s and wanted to keep feeling fancy, so they had a separate, dedicated bidet installed in our bathroom. My friends thought it was the funniest thing.  When I was living in Brooklyn, a bidet seat couldn't be attached to the supply line for the toilet because the toilet used a flushometer, so I just connected it to the sink's supply line.  Then when I bought my own house, we put bidet seats on all of the toilets.  All less than 50$ each.  They connect to the toilet's water supply and are super easy to install and use.  Bidets are the best.  They reduce toilet paper, and eliminate the need for sanitary wipes which are terrible on drains."

They are units that are designed to be fitted to an existing toilet making it both a bidet and a toilet. I have no idea where he got them, why he thought of giving two of them to me or what prompted him to focus his attention on this particular subject at this particular time. At the time i thought his generosity was more eccentric than practical and wasn’t too likely to install them, especially since they require an electrical outlet nearby—which is generally not the case with toilets. However, I am fairly handy and can install electrical outlets without a lot of trouble. 
Moreover, I am at home sheltering in place with nothing else to do except bing on things like “Tiger King.” So, after a little reflection I had just decided to install them. Then this article appeared. Go figure."

You go wash your hands!  Toilet paper is out of stock every where in Atlanta, but our inventory will last quite a while because of our toilet.  All of our friends are now asking what brand/version we bought.   We are sitting pretty, and clean,  and smug!"

2020-04-02 00:39:21,I recently installed a Tibbers Home Bidet on our toilet. Within a few days of using it I'm convinced its one of the smartest purchases I've ever made.

2020-04-02 02:21:03,"In the old days worn out clothes became mops, dish rags, wash cloth, and cloth for cleaning around the house. I have been relentless in pushing (somewhat successfully) this minimal level of conservation dictum.
To me the most outlandish product profusion on the market is the wipes this and wipes that after use so often ends up in the sewer plug-up that won't go way without the plumber's pound of flesh. It boggles my mind the power of advertising because their success is due only to advertising. Using them doesn't save any effort over picking up a rag dipped in soap water or a cleanser while products like Swiffer in my opinion are even more labor intensive and yet it is a very popular product.
While bidet use may be widespread in Europe Great Britten is long way behind. A research paper coming out from Britain exposed extensive is the fecal matter in Britain. It is virtually on everything a human hand touches and how unhealthy that is. Why is it that almost every home built in America is built around the toilet paper why can't the building code require every bathroom with a bidet? It only costs around $300. It serves adjustable heated seat and water, variable pressure and dual use (for women). With American Healthcare being so expensive one would think good hygiene is important and would save a lot of money in  preventing infections hence indispensable for good hygiene and for a bonus saves cost of toilet paper and the trees."

A bidet could similarly create a bioaerosol that could infect the next user. Prior SARS outbreak was related to sewage in an apartment complex and nearby complex downwind in Hong Kong. So lesson is to put your lid down then flush. Secondly may not want to promote bidet until we understand this better.

2020-04-02 00:16:58,"I keep a 16-ounce squirt bottle of half witch hazel ($2/pint), half water next to the toilet, for that last cleansing swipe of paper. When away from home, a zip-sealed baggie with portions  of prepped paper or, pocket or purse permitting, a tiny bottle of the witch water, is a good extension. And though your results may vary, you might also try witch hazel as a deodorant, dabbing with cotton or paper towel.

2020-04-01 22:47:39,"My former home had a bidet, which I used all the time.  In Europe, bidets are multifunctional.  Cleaning your privates is the primary use.  You can do a more thorough cleaning than in the shower.  You just need a supply of small clean towels. 
Unlike a watering can, I keep a large 32 ounce plastic cup nearby and some soft paper towels for drying.
Bidets can be used to soak your feet, wash a few hand washables, etc.  They are extremely easy to clean. In my next house, I will look for a bathroom that will accomodate a bidet."
2020-04-02 00:14:41,"Best experience ever! Never got tired of my bidet as an undergrad living in France.  

Traveling in Japan with my family two years ago, we noticed that even public bathrooms in Japan all have bidets, one of the cleanest civilizations on the planet. 
 Here in the states we are currently fight over tp.  As soon as that check comes from the government I'm going to order a bidet toilet seat and enjoy clean living."
2020-04-01 22:01:57,"All over South Asia and the Middle East,  and parts of North Africa, these were 'water cultures' until recent 'modernization' and foreign-returned people made TP use more common.  

There's a reason why Hindu, Islamic, and Jewish cultures have rules for: left hand for personal hygiene and right hand for eating. Wash with left hand and clean hands with lots of soap and water.  Eat with right hand only. 

For people saying: how do you dry off, and how do you pull up your pants - you wash your hands and then pull up your pants. Any  residual dampness goes away by itself, not a problem in either a hot climate, or anywhere with air conditioning and / or central heating.  

It's the same logic as showering, people.  If you know how to shower and dress, you can wash after toileting.  

And, I endorse the author's watering can style technology - you have temperature and directional control. No need to install bidets even.  

TP is still sold out in my area, but that's one of the things stressing me out."
2020-04-01 22:16:04,"When I came back from a month in Brazil in 2012, I had what I call a”poor man’s bidet” installed on each of my commodes. It consists of adding a kitchen sink sprayer (with hose) to the cold water feed below the commode. Not fancy, but it does the job. An upscale hotel across from Copacabana Beach had them. I’ll try to post pics on my Linked In page tomorrow. 

I had a plumber do it, but it looks pretty simple. When you depress the sprayer (as you would at the kitchen sink) you have water at full pressure that you can direct where you need it. The sprayer is mounted with a holder on the wall. It’s cold, but you get used to it. I love it!"

I doubt those guys are chuckling now."
2020-04-01 23:55:51,"In Vietnam, almost every toilet I encountered had a hose with a spring levered spray nozzle at the end hanging from a hook on the wall or tank.

Easy to use. Toilet paper was for drying after. 

I asked Vietnamese friends about it. They said, if you were working in the garden and got some sticky, wet mud on your arm, would you reach for a dry piece of soft paper to wipe it off or would you reach for the garden hose? See? Easy."
2020-04-02 00:03:35,"Hold on - you don't need to buy a new appliance for this, especially if your shower head is removable as is often the case in tub/shower combos or where people have installed a removable shower head to make washing their dog easier.

When I built my house, it was very difficult to find a brand which designs matching loo and bidet. I just sold my house and within 24 hours the bidet was gone. In France everybody giggles and blush about bidets because they associate bidet to prostitutes washing between clients, the only contraception for a long time...Bidet are fantastic for women hygiene, especially during periods (you can wash without stripping naked or struggling with a washcloth ) and for people with hemorrhoids (only people who never had any are stil giggling) but every male who dares to squat and try it is quickly converted. Now, because I have no room for a bidet, all my toilets are equipped with a little shower connected to the water tank, they sell on the net under the name ""islamic shower"".

When I lived in NYC in 1979 I was hired to build a box to hide a bidet because at that time they were against NYC building code. I was also supposed to bribe the inspector $200, but I forgot! (I wasn't a very competent New Yorker, I even gave the cash back to my client)."

I find the handheld shower (bidet shower?) that's attached to the wall next to the bowl very useful. Can easily maneuver it to clean the front (extremely useful for the women) and the back.  And you'd need like maybe a square, or perhaps two, to dry yourself. Minimal usage of water and TP. 

As kids growing up in India we had a towel to dry ourselves (after thorough cleaning of course). We never got around to asking the adults what they did to dry off (It's been 30 plus years; how did this topic never come up??). It used to annoy me to no end to find only TP in the fancy schmancy hotels and establishments here (à la the West, like seriously?), and only water but no TP in the not so fancy places. And these are places where there are loos available, because the dismal state of our public loo system, or lack thereof, is no secret to the world.  So imagine my joy when i recently saw that the Taj (one of the best hotel chains here) had hand showers + TP in their loos. 

You certainly won't eliminate TP but you will considerably reduce usage. And for the love of all that's holy, please do not flush wipes down the drain."

Truly a terrifying question and thought.

First off, thank you Marc Tracy for writing this article.  I for one had never heard of ""Stat"" but beginning immediately, I will be a loyal subscriber despite the hefty monthly subscription fee.

I am impressed with the various individuals who make up the stellar team of reporters and researchers.  I find great relief in knowing that a group of intelligent and science based professionals are reporting what they read and review from various sources of information throughout the world.

I recall a conversation I had with our family physician when my mother was diagnosed with cancer.  I explained to him that I didn't need nor want a sugar-coated prognosis.  I needed to know the truth.  I could deal with the truth.  He then proceeded to tell me she had only months to live.  I could now prepare for what was to come.  He was correct in his prognosis within a two-week window.

Thank you again for this sober, somber article.  It's the kind of intel that is necessary.  At least it is in my world."
2020-03-31 18:35:06,I've been following Ed Silverman's work for years now. He's an excellent writer.
2020-03-31 19:17:35,"The statistical models that are the basis of predictions around this pandemic or other pandemics are pretty straightforward - well covered ground. The details may be new, e.g., when does a person become infectious with this particular virus, how rapidly does it spread in different populations. But the underlying statistics are not new - and the predictions based on a few very reasonable assumptions related to human behaviour would have made it abundantly clear that to epidemiologists that what we are seeing was going to happen. 

Water under the bridge.  The question for me is: what are these same people saying about the next 6 or 12 months - when people start to resume more usual patterns of social interaction.  If we didn't listen to the epidemiologists back then, have we reflected upon the possibility that there is something they are telling us today that we aren't listening to.  E.g., if in 6 months we are not relying on social isolation and instead are employing contact tracing and testing - do we have testing capacity - even if we have enough to manage the current pandemic (which I do not think is the case).

Managing this outbreak - and the next infection after COVID-19 -- via a combination of ignoring the results of robust statistical models based on realistic assumptions, followed by acts of desperation - not a good way to manage outbreaks.  

So again- the past has passed. What are we ignoring today? And who should be listening - and are they?"
2020-03-31 19:47:04,"Thank you John Henry & Rick Berke for founding Stat and your stellar group of professionals. There is always someone ahead of the curve.  Even so, the mantra of ""it can't happen to me"" is too prevalent in our society. Perhaps this devastating virus will be a wake-up call."
2020-03-31 19:55:40,"Thru a combination of reading NYT articles and following the material linked in those articles, I was able predict what happened with excellent accuracy.  I'm quite satisfied with the coverage, but this began as a potentially big story worthy of the Times' interest and that's not always the case, so I agree with Mr. Henry the there's a need for a publication like Stat.  I have an interest in science in general, and so I subscribe to Science, which is also pretty expensive and doesn't cover ""stories"" as such very much, but reading it regularly enables me to more easily understand ""stories"" like Covid-19."

2020-03-31 21:12:17,"Glad to hear Mr Henry puts his money to wise public benefit. I followed some of these reporters in their prior professional homes. It is very good to know they landed in a well funded health sciences’ news organization. And there are some innocent reasons to not widely publish some aspects of the pandemic. The public overall is not well equipped to understand the science and to  react to facts with emotional distance. Avoidance of public panic is a high priority which requires measuring the audience’s tolerance for frightening facts. Next topic to be researched is how best to deal with mass mourning. Within the next ~2-18 weeks many to most American and global households will be grieving the suffering and deaths of family, friends, neighbors, colleagues, commuter companions, and familiar faces in shops, services, and local jaunts. What is the preparation for nations, states, provinces, districts, cities, towns, villages, and neighborhoods in mourning? Professional consideration must be given on how to approach this collective grief. It needs accessible public valves to release and express the emotion at the finality of loss, the fear of the future. There will likely be anger, anxiety, and hostility blended into the emotional global stew. We will all need help as survivors as certainly as those who succumb need breath."
2020-03-31 21:45:45,"It's impressive that Stat saw the coronavirus pandemic coming months ago.  But it's irrelevant.  The unfortunate fact remains that many if not most people are not willing to take drastic steps, like staying home and not going to work, to prevent the spread of a virus, unless death hits close to home first.  Of course the government, months ago, should have taken the preventive measures it is only now taking.  But let's not kid ourselves.  There would have been huge howls of protest and the government would have been forced to back off no matter what the experts warned.  That's just the way we are."

2020-03-31 22:16:58,"This article reinforces my notion that in the aftermath of this pandemic mess, we will determine that the whole COVID-19 calamity is the result of ""a lack of curiosity"" and therefore our  inability to act smartly and aggressively to avert crisis. 

(Remember the 9/11 commission bottom line was ""a lack of imagination""?) 

Both circumstances are a result of a government that is focused inward  and not paying attention to the sign posts around it. It really is a regrettable state of affairs."
2020-03-31 22:35:45,STAT has been fantastic.  Very impressive is that they have been tough - but fair - in exposing the failure of the biomedical community in Boston to take action soon enough.

Are there even 1/10th that number among Trump's political appointees?"
2020-04-01 00:30:10,"I fear that Helen Branswell is one of the last of the Mohicans — a seasoned journalist leveraging decades of experience to do difficult, shoe-leather research on important stories and then writing her fingers to the bone to get these stories out quickly and accurately to serve the public. What will we do when they are all gone?"
2020-04-01 00:07:21,"This is a nice story, and Stat's work sounds admirable. But it is troubling that so many obvious lines of inquiry weren’t followed. 

When did the Boston Globe first run a Stat story about the coronavirus? How often did they? Where was the story...buried inside or prominent? Is Stat's work syndicated? How often and how hard did Stat work to get its stories into wider distribution, or to get its reporters on cable news outlets? Did Stat post anything on Twitter or elsewhere to counteract the disinformation coming out of Washington and many states? 

It seems strange that with a resource like Stat, owned by someone with immense influence and reach, and cousin to a major newspaper, more of its reporting was not more widely distributed when it could have done some real good."

2020-03-31 22:53:22,"Could Ms Branswell be persuaded to share her favorite authors? It sounds like she's smart enough to be on to some good reading, which, currently, I could use."
2020-03-31 22:51:56,"It seems as though the only entity, of those that should matter, that did not take heed  of Stat was the White House - but then Trump is an expert at everything, can't read or digest figures, lies, denies science and makes stuff up. And he has a malignant Sharpie too.

Anyone who intelligently reads the NYT and has even a tasing knowledge of science (especially medicine and biology) knew that this plague was coming from the early statistical information.

Trump - NOT. His advisors would never consider trying to educate him because HE knows everything - more than the best scientists, generals, economists, pornographers, xenophobes and racists. If they tried to tell him, he fired them. With no adults in the room, only chaos reigns.

And this ""thing"" YOU call a president?"
2020-03-31 16:30:35,"Putin only wants to deliver good news?  Like: it’s a hoax, we’ll be open on Easter? 

Trump and Putin really do work from the same playbook!"
2020-03-31 16:37:38,"Now it sounds like Putin is copying Trump's playbook; it will all be the fault of Pence, Fauci, etc."
2020-03-31 17:05:25,No doubt the next dictator that will take credit for containing his Coronavirus problems by eliminating the reports of it.
2020-03-31 16:45:40,"Putin will do fine. The Russian people are like red state republicans. Their loyalty to the exalted leader goes beyond the rational. It is the reason that Russia remains weak and has been shrinking in influence, with the exception of their Psy-ops work on the internet.

We shall join them in perpetual stagnation of world political and economic influence because while the citizens of the US are not all red state republicans most do not live in the real world and are incapable of electing capable leaders. Republican or democrat the thing that unites Americans is their gullibility at election time. Always choosing those who speak of hope or making us great again, rather than detailed oriented, fact based, politicians. Heck, even Bernie needs to appeal to emotion in order to get the attention of the great mass of dullards known as US citizens. So, look at Russia, that is what we are going to be, a shrinking authoritarian oligarchy where to succeed even in small measure one will have to pledge loyalty to the fearless leader, be it Trump or the next charlatan."
2020-03-31 16:44:21,"Wow, doesn’t this sound similar to Trump pushing everything off on the governors? Operating out of the same playbook!"
2020-03-31 16:41:08,"You can bet conditions are much worse in Russia than Putin would ever allow the world to know.

Putin can be expected to continue to shelter-in-place away from the suffering and death spreading all over Russia.

This is an actual political threat to Putin's control over Russia.

He'd better be careful or the people might pull another 1917 on him."
2020-03-31 16:42:49,"The very first paragraph of this article, sadly and eerily reminded me of Fox news and Hannity types. That's what America has become. Ailes and The Murdochs have a lot to answer for."

Potemkin village, indeed."
2020-03-31 17:19:59,Donald.  Go join your hero and mentor.
2020-03-31 17:44:20,How soon will his good buddy Trump join him?
2020-03-31 17:31:48,"""The Russian leader hates to deliver bad news ...  So he is leaving it to his minions to announce harsh measures.""

Putin wants everybody to think he is such a big tough guy, who like to ride horses without his shirt.  But when times get tough ... 

But we have our own ""dear leader"" who seems to read from the same playbook ... never actually fires anyone face-to-face (only by tweet, or by letter), has no willingness to level with the American public, and never takes the blame for anything.

We The People need to fire our incompetent reality tv apprentice POTUS on November 3, 2020.

The Russians ""fired"" the Tsar way back in 1917.  They seem to have a new Tsar.  I wonder if, or when, they will fire him.

Dictators rarely end their days well."

He is renting a place in DC now."
2020-03-31 17:41:38,"Just as the Chinese withheld crucial information regarding the severity of the crisis, so too does Putin and his propaganda machine. 

Unfortunately, while this may serve his personal need for affirmation of his greatness, it is deeply harming the citizens he claims to be protecting who cannot prepare for or deal with a crisis they don't know exists.

Sound familiar?"
2020-03-31 17:22:22,"Putin is who Trump desperately wishes to be.  And given the opportunity, will be if we let him."
