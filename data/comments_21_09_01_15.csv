2021-09-14 07:46:38,"This article totally neglected to mention the Modi governments irresponsible actions in holding huge election rallies in a few states in 2021.  The government was also complicit in allowing the huge Hindu religious gathering (Kumbh mela) when more than 5 million people gathered in April 2021 with no social distancing measures or masks. These events had the tragic consequences of fueling the creation of the Delta variant which has now paralyzed the world all over again.

To add insult to injury, the death toll in India was tragically understated and conservative estimates by India's own scientists put the total deaths at several folds magnitude above the government released figures of 440K.

I believe that India did achieve herd immunity, albeit at a horrific cost..."
2021-09-14 07:38:20,"Like many others in India, I lived through the second wave and was incredibly lucky to not have been impacted by covid.  Many others weren’t.  

It was a humanitarian crisis in April and May of 2021 and scores ended up dead or grieving for their loved ones.  But like many countries the world over including the US, no accountability anywhere in the government.  Modi remains as popular as ever and Trump came within a whisker to get re-elected."
2021-09-14 07:49:00,"Facts fixed to fit the policy. Hmmm, when have I heard that dodgy statement before? I'm pretty sure it will come back to me (and everyone else.)"
2021-09-14 08:35:11,"Despite being the second most populated country in the world with the highest economic disparity and nuclear neighbors to the North, China and Pakistan, India has survived the COVID wave no better or worse than the USA. In a multi-party democracy like India, politics is all about projections and propaganda. As long as India is unable to project a suitable alternative to prime minister Modi there is no chance that any criticism against Modi is going to stick. The Biden administration is very much glued to Modi. Yesterday I heard John Carey praise Modi government for India's role in meeting climate goals and the state Department needs India to have a stable quad. With terrorism threat rising for India, exponentially after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, India is in a precarious state,  more than any country in the world. It was heartbreaking to see a young Muslim police office in Srinagar Kashmir gunned down by a terrorist in broad day light while leaving a hospital. Is this the beginning of the pandemic of terrorism after a relative calm due to the COVID pandemic? 

Projecting optimism is key to avoiding panic and no sensible person would buy any such projections without proper evidence but ultimately how much does it matter in a country riddled with far greater problems?"
2021-09-14 08:14:05,"The most valuable lesson of this pandemic is that science is not a real-time activity.  Most good science on this pandemic is yet to come, and most of what we (think we) ""know"" about this pandemic will have turned out to be something between an urban myth and an old wives' tale.  

The second-most valuable lesson is that there are approximately zero scientists anywhere who do not do some amount of tailoring of results to fit their biases.  And exactly zero who will admit to it.  


We have also learned that the more confident an ""expert"" is about their prediction, the less one should believe them.  Good scientists are humble, because they know that there is a LOT that they do not know.  

Mr. Modi's Government is known to be vengeful to those who seek to thwart his agenda.  That said, by all measures, India looked to be free of the virus last Fall, thanks to serological data that seemed to suggest high levels of resistance to the virus.  As we now know - given the virulence of the second wave that swept India - that data was probably junk - that is now obvious in hindsight (which is always 20-20).


It should also be noted that among those who accepted that serological study data as valid was the NY Times, which used it as the basis for estimating the death toll in India as being up to 7 times the official estimate.  Now that the data has been proven to be junk, will the Times retract that estimate too?"
2021-09-14 09:44:59,"Even though Trump is gone from office, his legacy remains around the world, emboldening other leaders to be like him and take over a country's nonpartisan institutions for political gains. Modi learned a lot from Trump, I think, and India has suffered greatly. Scientists like Rick Bright in America stood up in America to Trump's cronies and paid a professional price. Unfortunately many scientists and doctors in India have not followed suit."
2021-09-14 09:05:55,"Till Modi is in charge, science or other experts will always be slaves to his ego. Mr. Modi is exhibiting all the traits of a megalomaniac. I suggest readers look up ""Grandiose Narcissism"" on Google. I appeal to all supporters of Modi to start thinking of India first and then Modi - because after all want to improve the welfare of the citizens of that and other nations. Modi ignored the advice of the Reserve Bank of India to not go ahead with demonetization but yet he did - hurting the poorest. He called the national lockdown giving only 4 hours' notice without consulting the state governments. Ignoring experts advice or attention-grabbing-acts (4 hour notices) are traits of a megalomania. Much as Modi will like for people to be polarized, it is important for people to realize that this man, because of his disorder, will continue to hurt the country. It is not about BJP or Congress. It is about Modi - because even others in BJP, who may think differently will need people's voice to stand up to this man."
2021-09-14 10:32:10,"This flexing of facts by politicians to bolster their image or  keep it intact is part of life.  Whatever it takes to convince populace in a democracy will be the order of the day.  I don’t think western media in democratic countries have apologized or has had serious retractions in propagating agendas, a recent example being, the drum beat for the 2003 Iraq invasion.  Media drum beats have become so bad that even when an article seems unbiased and well written there is always a lingering doubt as to the  factual content summarized for the unfamiliar.  Unfortunately, the law of unintended consequence seem to be playing havoc with all (with dealing with the virus in India and elsewhere) and is not being recognized as such."
2021-09-14 10:51:31,I think the decision by CDC to not require masks in June for vaccinated folks was pure politics - it was unsupported by science given the looming risks of Delta.

2021-09-14 09:46:09,Modi is the worst leader the Indians could have elected. His politics is all about vilification of minorities and glorification of BJP. He doesn't believe he can do anything wrong and woe betide anyone who shows him up to be imperfect. I fear for India's future.
2021-09-14 10:04:13,"Modi is a disaster—a religious bigot and a totally self-serving politician. He DID do well at the beginning of the pandemic, but very quickly grew complacent. His attempts at “vaccine diplomacy” hurt the country and then his “need” for political rallies and large religious gatherings like the Kumbh Mela had tragic consequences.

He needs to be voted out."
2021-09-14 11:54:36,Why is there no mention of the second wave in India disappearing so fast? What occurred that allowed for the low rates of infection now? India has one billion people. It might give us in the US an idea of when our wave will diminish.
2021-09-14 12:41:32,"It is a sad story of journalism - science is always disagreements, specially in the field of mathematical modeling. I spend my life working on mathematical modeling using probability. Without validation exercise, field study or detail simulation, models are nothing but speculation. So do not be a judge and jury on modeling results and play Monday morning quarterback. All scientific institutions like FDA, ICMR have to make a call about models to recommend public policies and this decisions are mostly subjective without any verification. Error is inevitable and assessment of the judgement should be based on global impact of the policy, not anecdotal statements from scientists. I appreciate this article, though biased, but I will be happy, if NYT publish similar review article for US and other countries."
2021-09-14 11:29:11,"At some point of time, Indian political leaders thought that if we can't beat China, let's become like China. The level of propaganda, institutional capture, misinformation, polarization, and personality cult present in India today has no precedence in living memory.

Covid in India is close to levels seen in Japan overall. And their recent number is also low, with fewer vaccinations. Are they just not testing? Because death rates from covid overall are also low."
2021-09-14 12:29:44,"Trump persuaded many people here not to believe the science. This is not so different from corrupting the scientists themselves. And it yields the same result. 

At least in India people recognize that Modi was wrong. Here, because denying science is a matter of belief, Trump can’t be proven wrong.  Scientists can be wrong and corrected. Trump can be neither wrong nor corrected. 

Heaven help us all if this would be tyrant runs again and wins."
2021-09-14 11:47:07,"For me, this is less a story about India than one about state control of health policy, in which actual scientists must censor themselves for fear of saying what is not acceptable to political leaders and the agencies that work for them. Is this not happening here? Take the alleged ""scientific consensus"" on masks that the article refers to. How many brave, prominent epidemiologists, like Mike Osterholm, have to tell stories of colleagues who say one thing to him in private and the opposite in public, for fear of retaliation by the federal agencies funding their institutions or simply to avoid being attacked? I for one would love the Times to investigate this dynamic here in the US, rather than just in India. Just poll several hundred academic and private scientist (non-governmental) off the record and see how they describe their ability to say what they really think on any issue related to the pandemic."
2021-09-14 12:40:53,"Does anyone in there [the academy] care enough about any of this to make a real political enemy?

I've heard it all again and again: They ""suggest"" things, are ""saddened"" by things, say ""unfortunately"" a lot, but in the end never really do anything. Their padded chairs are now tools of the powerful, and they justify their cowardice by thinking themselves ""unbiased"". The politicians make them rewrite just enough to reshape the message, but not quite enough to get them to challenge the idea that they're ""independent"" thinkers."

2021-09-14 12:10:48,Had Modi got anything right? All his foolhardy policies have been disasters and yet his mass following continues to worship him -- all in the name of Hindu might. This has become so ingrained that I don't see the BJP going anywhere for decades to come. Sad for India.
2021-09-14 11:55:39,"We should judge Modi by the overall results. The Infections and deaths per 100,000 people are far lower than developed countries and they have successfully contained the disease. The vaccine uptake is very good. This considering the fact that India is a 1 billion plus population that is easily swayed by rumours. 

USA should perhaps take a lesson from the governance of India. Fox News and Anti-Vaxers, for example, are allowed to peddle falsehood and hate, There again, we should judge by the overall results of rising deaths and infections, almost as high as their highest levels ever."
2021-09-14 12:56:04,"optimism is always good but but boosting it with false scientific data is always wrong. it is also dangerous if scientific data is tailored with an eye to promote any political leader. scientists should be above all religions, politics, favoritism (who funds the research), any polarization, etc."
2021-09-14 13:33:14,"I'm glad Dr. Agarwal was able to leave India and find an opportunity in the US. For decades, Indian policies and politicians created a toxic YES culture in the country's top scientific agencies, which resulted in its scientists and engineers leaving. Even though India is supposed to be a free speech protecting, secular, democratic republic, those values are rarely upheld by the courts in the country. This is a great article talking about the pressure, scientists often face to publish truth, but another side of this coin is, honest judges are often pressured into similar situations. Any refusals to cater to these politicians' needs would result in judges sacrificing their careers when it comes to being moved to higher courts. I hope the world notices this when India calls itself the largest democracy on the planet, while really it's moving towards a more authoritarian system with little protection left for people that don't agree with it's politicians, both regional and national."
2021-09-14 13:44:23,"Missing in this analysis is the fact that Modi was skewered initially by the opposition for having made the initial lockdown. This initial lockdown kept the numbers extremely low in the first wave.  The opposition bears significant responsibility in mocking and denigrating the original lockdown, because this left him nowhere to go when the second wave came.  Moreover, I seem to recall no objection from the opposition when restrictions were lifted, with opposition politicians gladly engaged in political activities with no social distancing, and no mask. Why didn’t they advocate for more stringent social distancing and masks if they knew better? Certainly the rest of the world was engaging in social distancing and mask wearing. Unfortunately there was a general belief on both sides that somehow the original lockdown might not of been perfect, and perhaps there was some native immunity due to (other) infection exposure in India. Common type of thinking in India generally regardless of political view.  Unfortunately wrong. Hindsight is 2020, but blame certainly is there on both sides."
2021-09-14 13:49:31,"The delta variant took us by surprise and I doubt whether any of the mentioned studies predicted it. We learnt our lesson unlike some governers in the US.

Another significant fact in our favour is that we do not have science deniers and anti-vaxxers"
2021-09-14 13:36:29,"My parents live in India.

From the beginning of this pandemic and especially after October-November 2020 I knew based on what I was seeing in the US that India was going to have an unbelievably bad wave of Covid and that they simply would not have the medical resources to deal with it.

So I constantly nagged my parents to not go out, not even open the front door of their apartment without first wearing a mask. Throughout the last months of 2020 and the first months of 2021 the wedding season was in full swing. I convinced my parents to not attend a single wedding. 

I am not a doctor or scientist but it was so glaringly obvious to me that despite Mr Modi's tireless efforts to lie to the world that India was the exception in this pandemic, India was not really an exception. I forced my parents to get the Indian vaccine as soon as it was out in March. And then I told them to continue staying home and behaving as if they were not vaccinated.

It gave me no comfort when as I had expected the massive covid tsunami washed across India in April/May/June 2021.
It felt terrible that the Indian government chose not to use the time it had to prepare for the inevitable second wave and focus instead on some dumb myth about Indian exceptionalism. And 2-3 million Indians paid the price for the government's overconfidence and lack of vision/planning.

My only comfort was that my own parents were safe and that they now completely trust me on this issue."

That’s what needs to be changed in India."
2021-09-14 13:36:47,"Modi and his extremist religious views based party has taken a wrecking ball to the institutions that upheld India's democratic, scientific and secular traditions.  Independent studies show India's death rate to be in the millions.  I don't know of a single family in India not touched by death from Covid (we  have family in India).  And this did not need to happen.  India's will eventually overcome because of the indomitable spirit of its people but Modi has been undermining India at every turn so that he can consolidate his power at the best of the crony capitalists who support him.  He should be treated in international arenas as a pariah.   Modi's conduct has not been peddling falsehoods - his conduct and that of his government have resulted in dire consequences and deaths for millions of Indians."
2021-09-14 13:44:21,"Enough wincing vax photos already!! Is it possible for photojournalists to quit photographing people in the exact moment when they briefly wince from the needle? How about a photo of the alcohol prep pad part, or the bandaid being applied. Photographing people in a transitory moment of pain may seem like a triumph of timing for the photographer, but it helps build vaccine hesitancy. People looking at a photo like that may just decide they don’t want the needle stick. Please think about that and not your photo school training that tells you to pick the moment of pain, the peak of the explosion, or the moment when the bullet enters the head in pursuit of your Pulitzer and think about the broader effect of your photo. Photos are an attempt to tell a story, and the story of the vaccination is not ouch or pain. It is relief and freedom at being spared a risk of death or long term organ damage from a deadly disease. Photograph the smile when people greet the physician share a friendly word with the medic. That’s what I remember from my own vax, was the helpful volunteers and techs who spent all day serving their community."

2021-09-14 14:53:43,"Thank you Karan Deep Singh for your outstanding reporting.

This so resonates with me as I migrated from New Delhi myself years ago, when my India provided zero opportunities under the iron grip of Indira Gandhi.  About 90 percent of my engineering mates did so too (yes, they were all male back in the day when women had much less to choose from professionally).

Dr. Naman Shah, the physician cited who worked on studies that portended a second wave in India and was reprimanded for his courage, said it best - in fact mirrored what has occurred here in the US under the machinations of Trump’s cabal:

“This is a government which clearly has a philosophy and history of trying to assert power by capturing every institution and making it an arena for political struggle.”

In the 1970s, Nixon was warned by Dean that “there is a cancer on the presidency”, one that led to his premature ouster.  For 4 long years, starting in 2021, our new cancer was Trump himself. He made sure his sickness rapidly metastasized into every institution at the federal, state and local level, and into society itself. 

When covid struck we had no chance. Biden is trying mightily to heal our society, our institutions. Yet, with the former mobster’s contrails still infecting us as a whole, it feels like a tenuous slog, with every corner presenting fresh challenges (as with recall efforts in CA)."
2021-09-14 14:58:05,"When I read articles like this, I wish the NYTimes were more like Fox News - Fair and Balanced. Ok, I'm just kidding :)

But this report is so one sided that it is hard to know where begin countering it. Could we, perhaps, have a view that differs from Dr. Agarwal's opinion, in the spirit of fairness?

Also, fewer photos of burning funeral pyres and more data perhaps, since this isn't an opinion piece? How do death rates (corrected for undercounting) stack up against other nations? How is India's vaccination program going? (India is vaccinating 10 million+ people every day, by the way)

A bit more balance, please?"

Don't you see and find political agenda in other countries, but just want to use India as a punching bag and to please your foreign bosses.
Governments like US/ Canada are still feeding on the fear psychoses of vulnerable population, but nobody dares to comment on that. Try managing 1.3 billion souls and all these countries with less than 1/4th the population of India will fail."

However, the Indian government under Modi took the advice of astrologers who indicated that the confluence of planets in April 2021 was very auspicious and so they decided to have the Kumbh Mela a whole year early.

Not one scientist was consulted in this process. People from all over India and Nepal attended the Kumbh Mela on the banks of the Ganges, caught the virus and took it back to their states. The King of Nepal and his wife and their entourage caught the virus and took it with them to Nepal.

When astrologers are listened to more than scientists are, many hundreds of thousands of people have to die. The combination of politics and religion is always lethal."
2021-09-14 16:13:56,"I am a supporter of Mr. Modi's policies which is different than being his supporter. Most of his policies are good for India and he is a Dynamic Leader who does not care about what others say.
But, there in lies the problem. He is basically running the country as a one man show no matter how well intentioned he is. He does NOT know every thing and if he would make up his mind and then tailor his methods and approaches to the problem to suit his own thesis; then disaster will strike once in a while or even more frequently.
This is what precisely happened here in the Corona fiasco. Mr. Modi needs to realize that India is a very complex country with equally more complex problems that no one man can understand, leave aside having solutitons for them or solving them. Sooner he realizes that, the better Leader he will be."
2021-09-14 17:03:25,"In September 2020, not only had the Modi government coerced scientists into downplaying the prospect of a new outbreak, after recovering from the first wave of the pandemic earlier that year,   it had also ordered social media sites - Twitter, Facebook and Instagram - to block posts that criticised its failure to deal with a record-breaking surge of Covid infections and deaths in April, with people dying in front of packed hospitals, and their bodies piling up for mass cremation.   
Modi put his party’s interests before science, unwilling to impose restrictions to stop the spread of the virus. 
Millions of largely unmasked people attended religious festivals and political rallies that he, and leaders of the ruling BJP held.  
Invoking Hindu nationalism in combating Covid-19, he claimed India would win the war against the pandemic in 21 days, just  as the epic Mahabharata war was won in 18 days.
As an example for superstition trumping science, Modi urged Indians to bang plates together. Two weeks later, he instructed them to light lamps at a specific moment. He also ignored the WHO advice, which  recommended a containment strategy that required testing, contact tracing, isolation, and treatment.
While the Modi government had failed disastrously, a handful of states, like Kerala (which recorded India’s first Covid-19 case in January 2020),  implemented such measures successfully."

Second wave was really bad; everyone knows someone who was tragically affected.  Not a single person put the blame on Modi; Modi's Sanyasatva- the monk status has been accepted.  It seems that the second wave achieved the so-called herd immunity that was suggested as the only proper route for India, though tragically and inadvertently.

I know only 30 odd percent of Indians voted for him but that was more than enough to make Modi and aides to become stubborn and overconfident.

Even after making historic blunder people go gaga over his decision then god bless that country.

Postponing these elections would be as bad as if Trump asking 2020 elections to be postponed. Opposition will be up in arms against Modi.

In this system, referred to as democracy, politics should always 'override' science.  If a scientist wants to run the country, then let him/her stand for election.

FYI, Mr. Singh...I'll trust the data and numbers compiled by Johns Hopkins and that information shows that the Indian government and its policies were FAR more successful than almost every European country and certainly the US.

The two sides are playing different games and it will take a crisis to get them onto the same field. Maybe the pandemic is that crisis."
2021-09-12 22:03:27,The argument is that the Constitution doesn't allow the President to mandate vaccinations; that power is reserved to the States.  There is no logical inconsistency in the fact that some governors are objecting to Biden's mandate while simultaneously mandating other vaccinations themselves.

Their aim is not to do anything for the public good, but only to spark outrage and anger in the Trumpist base who see vaccination and mask wearing as some kind of political act, rather than a public health necessity, It is shameful. The nation needs to be fully vaccinated or hundreds of thousands more citizens will die needlessly. These Republican governors are not statespeople.

As a person trained in public health what really should have happened at the very beginning was to declare a national emergency and put in place mitigation methods and when a vaccine was available to require everyone to get vaccinated ASAP. If the COVID virus was more virulent than it is, and the death rate was much higher, I would like to know who in their right mind would not consent to vaccination. As Biden stated: This is not about freedom. Most within the GOP have a twisted definition of freedom. You are not free to become infected and potentially kill your fellow Americans. That's not ""freedom""; that's tyranny."

The level of misinformation that has been spreading on TV and radio is criminal and those people should be treated as killers and should be prosecuted. A TV host doesn't have a medical license and should have zero opinion on the safety of vaccines. I support president Biden's decision and I hope we can see an end to this unbelievable timeline.

2021-09-12 22:33:25,"I absolutely agree that the vaccine for COVID-19 should be mandated, as well as many other vaccines that have proven effective. Since President Biden has realized the need for the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, it would be even better if his administration would adopt a vaccine mandate for Interstate and international travel. A similar mandate to the one for employers should be adopted for Medicare and Medicaid patients. Finally, the federal government needs to require a ""vaccine passport"" that would be accepted for travel and going into public places."

Likewise Abbot has done a lousy jobs in protecting Texans even more excess deaths there than California.

These are the same people trying to grab enough power to overturn the last election, the same people passing laws to empower them to overturn the next one.

This is good reporting on Republican ""inconsistency"".  But neither the Times nor any other major media outlet is reporting meaningfully on what it means that Republicans have declared themselves unbound by logic, fact, or consistency.

It's quite possible that would include any treatment for COVID-19."

I do believe it boils down to this observation. A segment of our citizens are determined to resist anything that benefits society in America. Republicans don't seem to realize that these are not people who believe in a political party, a personality, or a cause. These are people who vote for chaos because chaos is their aim. 

So long as Republican leadership caters to the lunacy our President will be obliged to use every tool in the POTUS arsenal to protect and defend every citizen of the United States -- from COVID, sure, but more importantly from this very unstable minority."
2021-09-12 22:36:27,"I agree with Biden's moves, but I bristle at the opinion-y tone of this article, now the straight news lead story on the homepage.  Its main point is to accuse Republicans of vaccine hypocrisy. It's a decent point, but, even if I agreed with it 100%, I think it stretches the boundary between analysis and persuasive argument. And I don't agree with it 100%. Playing devil's advocate, it seems that there are obvious relevant differences between childhood vaccination requirements to attend school and adult vaccination requirements to go to work. The state has always taken a legitimate interest in protecting children who are not entrusted, as adults generally are as matter of individual rights and personal autonomy, to make their own health-related decisions. It doesn't I think weaken the argument for Biden's policy to acknowledge that it's a new step."

It is astounding that citizens would claim that they have both the right to go to work unvaccinated and the right to refuse to be tested for infection.

This defies common sense. Consequently, it's no great surprise that there is no basis for it in conservative or liberal political philosophy. The position appears to be based on a belief not just that a citizen has no obligations to a democratically elected government, but no obligations to other citizens. Not even a philosophical anarchist would accept that."

Every bit of their energy is focused on making their base angry about something irrespective of the logic of the position. All they have left to sell is rage however they can create it. They have normalized it to the extent that their followers are often accused and arrested for their public attacks on mask wearers or vaccination centers.

And I would not have any issues with that — except that they insist on dragging the other 70 percent of us down with them. And the media is helping by constantly reporting on their every tantrum, every time these men feel a perceived slight or think that they aren’t getting their way. 

But why do we continue to give outsized influence, media coverage and power to a minority of malignant humans? It’s akin to bringing a toddler to the situation room then letting him throw a 10-hour temper tantrum and asking every branch of the military and government to focus on trying to please the child just to get him to shut up.

Mandating Vaccines is for the greater good.  We have not had this choice with other diseases because they have not overburdened our systems like covid does.  Covid will be endemic and nearly everyone will get the disease at some point just like the flu.  Taking the Vaccine reduces the risk when the inevitable happens."

2021-09-12 23:01:10,"Don’t expect scientific knowledge, logic, or consistency from Republicans. All they care about is political power, and they have proven that they are willing to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of American lives to gain it. No foreign terrorist have ever even come remotely close to the carnage wrought by the Republican Party. And now they are playing Russian Roulette with the lives of America’s school children."
2021-09-12 23:04:15,"It was a foregone conclusion that Republicans would oppose everything Biden has done, including his “mandate.” It’s pure political gamesmanship on their part. Look, they are fine with all sorts of laws and restrictions from drinking ages to insurance requirements. Are Republicans against traffic laws because it restricts their “freedom?” Were they against restrictions at airports after 9/11? No. They were all for them for fear of the next big terrorist attack. Sure, 9/11 was bad. More than 3,000 people died in one shot. Yet Republicans are fine with 1,500 people dying of COVID every single day of the week. Why aren’t they more concerned with that? Why aren’t they fighting to stop it? Because it serves their political purposes not to."
2021-09-12 23:04:56,"This weekend I unfortunately heard about 3 minutes of hate radio (not in one sitting) to try and understand how anti-vaxxers perceive the issue.  The first was just a rant about how the vaccine has killed more than one million people, how Biden is a totalitarian, destroying democracy and freedom, thank god for the GOP governors and state's rights, and how everyone should move to Texas and Florida. The second was actually a station that markets itself as ""faith radio"" and that Biden was ignoring the law, that publicly funded schools and universities must offer a religious exemption, and not mentioning that testing and remote learning are options. 

It is the double whammy of deceitful media and lying leadership that is threatening this country. 

It really feels like a battle between good and evil."

This is not a criticism of Biden--I think he's doing the best anyone can do--but I think the US is beyond help. It's really time to discuss breaking up into 4-5 separate countries. It's over. Let them do everything on their own and we can do things our way and prosper. And we can send the  conservative countries aid like we do for other developing nations and open our borders to refugees from Texas, Florida, etc."
2021-09-12 22:52:50,"I am non-partisan.  I care about what is being done, not what party's politicians are doing it.  I will leave it to the many Democrat ultra-partisan readers to use the behavior of opposition to vaccine requirements as a partisan tool to condemn Republicans.

I condemn these politicians for their behavior of opposition to vaccine requirements.

I think every person should have the right to refuse vaccination for Covid.  But they must not have the right to impose the health hazard their unvaccinated selves are to other people.  

Therefore, I think Covid vaccination should be a requirement for every job in which the employee interacts in person in-doors with any other employee or any member of the public.  I think vaccination should be required for every passenger on a plane, train, bus, or subway.

There should be no exceptions to the vaccination requirement regardless whether the person bases their vaccine objection on religion, medical condition, fear, ignorance, or stupidity.  The reason for no exceptions is simple....the purpose of the vaccine requirement is to protect others from the unvaccinated person.  The hazard to others is the same regardless of the legitimacy of the reason claimed for exemption.

The ideological belief in the right to one's job is insane when in the midst of an epidemic of a highly contagious severe disease."
2021-09-12 23:06:37,"“I’m trying to overcome resistance, but the president’s actions in a mandate hardens the resistance,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas, said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” School mandates, he said, “have always come at the state level, never at the national level. And so this is an unprecedented assumption of federal mandate authority that really disrupts and divides the country.”

If a vaccine mandate truly infringes on personal liberty, how is it any more acceptable coming from a state or local government?"
2021-09-12 22:48:41,"Bravo, Mr. President.  It was time that the silent outrage of the vaccinated majority was addressed."
2021-09-12 22:50:24,"'Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas called the president’s move “a power grab.”'

Exactly what ""power"" is the President grabbing away from Abbott?  The ""power"" of Abbot to cause death?

And what is it called when a Governor mandates that school districts cannot mandate masks, or that a cruise industry cannot request proof of vaccinations?  It is certainly not the Governor's business,  or school district, so what right does he have to interfere with it's day to day operations.

Just hard to understand how these Governors can be so outraged at what they call ""power"" grabs, when they do exactly the same thing.  Difference is that the Governor's power grabs kill people.

Biden is attempting to save people."
2021-09-12 22:58:30,"The President of the United States has the right and obligation to protect American lives, reduce hospital overcapacity that is dangerous and expensive for all Americans, and stop the immense economic destruction of this pandemic.

While Republican governors are busy disenfranchising voters, there are babies and children in their states that cannot be vaccinated but are vulnerable to the much more contagious and lethal delta variant, representing 99% of COVID cases.

Over 600,000 Americans have died from this pandemic, making this more deadly and expensive than a major war.

Adding up the cost of lives lost, disease spreading, virus mutation, hospital overcapacity, and the economic impact of such, emergency powers must be exercised.

President Biden will be criticized for doing the right, or for doing nothing.

When Trump's attorneys went to court to argue that the President had the right to shoot a person on 5th Avenue and could not be prosecuted, none of the Republican governors complaining now said a peep. 

Thankfully the nation has a real American President with courage, wisdom, and ethics."
2021-09-12 22:47:34,"This article seems to willfully distort the issue. State governments have long had vaccine mandates because that is the proper location of ordinary police power and public safety governance in our federal republic. The issue isn’t that there is a vaccine mandate - the issue is that the federal government possesses no similar power. If it does, then why did the federal government never mandate smallpox, polio, or measles vaccination? Was it negligent? Or did it simply understand that some powers are reserved to the states? I strongly support most state and local vaccine mandates but I still see that Biden is claiming a power which he simply does not have. He knows this too - it is just red meat for the less informed portions of his voter base and as such it will probably serve him well even when a federal court inevitably thwarts his command."

That's precisely what this is.  The GOP should hang its head in shame.  History will rightfully embarrass and indict them.

Getting vaccinated is every American's patriotic duty.  Right now in our country you can walk into almost any drug store and and get the vaccine for FREE, without an appointment.  Where else in the WORLD can you do that right now?

You save yourself, your family and your fellow citizen from the worst outcomes and help stop the spread and mitigate opportunity for more mutations that could even possibly overcome the vaccines we have.  That we have any that are so effective is this generation's Moon Landing.  How it is not recognized as such is infuriating!  These people are completely ignorant of living with maladies such as Polio or Tuberculosis, where the arrival of a vaccine understandably made people weep with forgiveness and relief.

Laggards are putting their fellow citizens at risk and ACTIVELY harming our economy, economic and social security.  The enemy among us.  No hyperbole."

is for  everyone, really everyone,  who believes that what has been done to their sense of a safe civic space is an utter moral  disgrace to make  every effort to register to vote and then votes for anyone who does not have a ""republican"" party R next to the name. There needs to be a tsunami of 
electoral pushback at these raving ideologues who parade around detached from any sense of moral and ethical responsibility. 

That said, this  can hardly be guaranteed. The democratic party seems to be as divided and badly split as at anytime I can think of. It appears capable of blowing a phenomenal

2021-09-12 23:23:57,"Let's be honest here. This is Kabuki theater on the part of the Republicans. Except for a tiny minority of real nut jobs, most the Republican politicians really, really don't care about opposing vaccination. They're only doing this because they created it as a wedge issue with their base, and they are miming anger on the topic in order to keep that base fired up.

The politicians who are loudest about it, like Marjorie Taylor Green, are vaccinated themselves. When confronted on that topic, she waffled and deflected. If she was truly personally opposed to vaccination, she would have just answered ""no"" and moved on.

The way they see it, a thousand or so deaths a day among their supporters is a small price to pay for keeping them good and angry at the Democrats."

Point is what is the reach of the executive branch with states. At some point Republicans will regain the WH and control of at least one part of Congress.

On the other hand, they refuse to put the miraculous Covid vaccine in the same category as the measles, mumps, rubella, polio and the many other life-saving vaccines that they require of their citizens in many circumstances.

Quite simply, this is cowardice to the point of negligent manslaughter in the cases of DeSantis, Abbott and others who are fighting the ability of schools and companies to establish mask and vaccine mandates.

There is a risk/benefit in all medical treatments. We must weigh the risk/benefit with our doctors, based on our own health issues, not with Joe Biden, who doesn't know our individual health issues. 

Why are people who have been vaccinated so concerned about those who haven't? Because the vaccines don't work all that well, perhaps? If they worked, why would we need masks? We'd be protected by the vaccine. 

And it's proven that vaccinated people spread Covid, so all of us ""vaxxed"" people are super-spreaders. This is not the smallpox vaccine by any stretch. Most of the Covid vaccines are experimental. The Pfizer version was just approved, but not Moderna or J&J. 

The death rate last week in each state for Covid was below that of the flu death rate, per 100,000. Look it up yourself on Beckers hospital review coronavirus deaths by state and compare to the CDC page on flu death rates per 100,000, which are about 1.8. Most states had Covid death rates last week far less than 1.8 per 100,000.

Thus, what we have are moral and legal dilemmas with arguments supporting both personal choice and mandatory vaccination. Personal choice  respects the interests and integrity of the individual. Mandates support public health. There’s a crisis and a decision must be made and be made quickly. 

I think that our president has made the right choice and that public health outweighs constitutional rights. There are ample precedents (mandatory driver's insurance, seat belt requirements, helmet laws, vaccination for admission to public schools, and more) that are based on public health and safety.

I think that the Supreme Court will agree. COVID-19 has killed well over 600000 Americans and the numbers are climbing. The unvaccinated are the primary vectors of infection. That illness strains the resources of hospitals and staff needed to treat it and other emergencies. President Biden has made the correct decision. I am proud to have voted for him."
2021-09-13 00:16:37,"Both sides of the issue could tone down the rhetoric, hopefully paving the way for greater agreement and compliance. From President Biden's corner, a simple shift of wording from ""mandate"" to ""requirement"" would put the decision more in line with other long-accepted vaccine requirements. Then, respectfully, rather than rhetorically, addressing concerns of some, in regard to how much valid data is now available to support the finding that the vaccines are largely effective, at least in reducing likelihood of contracting covid, and severity of the illness, would help calm real people's fears. These are honest concerns voiced by people who, lacking better data, decide it is in fact, a freedom issue. Also from President Biden's corner, could come a softening in referring to freedom. Our Supreme Court has long weighed constitutional questions where we as Americans have to balance unabashed freedoms with the common good. Theologically, one could argue that the truest freedom is ""wanting to do what we need to do."" Hence, emotional maturity when we choose to do what we need to do, because it will help others and is a ""public good rule."" From the ""No Mandated vax"" corner could come recognition of the dangers, of the mounting catastrophic death toll, of families losing loved ones to a horrible death; and also, of the tragic loss of life such as when a 40-something US veteran in Texas died because there were no ICU beds for him to be treated for a critical, but curable medical problem."
2021-09-12 23:36:24,"Here’s what’s  terrifying.  Despite my getting a vaccine that prevents/reduces the effects of a deadly disease there are people in my community who refuse to consider their actions (or lack thereof) can kill me, my family, their family or themselves.
And they don’t seem to care."
2021-09-13 00:02:37,The only power base Republicans have left is that built on chaos.  It’s also exactly what the Russian government had hoped to create in the USA.  Mission Accomplished.  Meanwhile that power base k is dying off or becoming disabled.  I don’t see gore that type of “freedom” can be a winning strategy.  And then we get elitist Democratic demagogues like Gavin Newsom and my whole common sense will prevail theory goes out the window.
2021-09-12 23:40:59,"Say what you will about Tate Reeves of Mississippi who felt Biden's vaccine mandate ""terrifying.""

But if he truly finds that terrifying, he clearly has led an exceedingly charmed, cloistered life.  Or else he has had life-long luck beyond what even a two-time winner of the national lottery might claim.

(He needs to read a Stephen King novel or a movie based on one.)"
2021-09-12 23:48:22,"This is nothing about vaccines or the right thing to do. This reminds me exactly of when Obama was President and the GOP opposed on a gut-level reactionary basis anything and everything that Obama did. Even if they liked the thing before Obama did it. We've already seen 8 years of this under Obama.

It is time to push to make DC and Puerto Rico states. Push to increase the number of members on the Supreme Court. 

Do it now because this is our last chance. We are circling the drain."
2021-09-12 23:46:41,"Well, that action certainly gives the lie to the idea that either religion, morality, or simple self-preservation supports the GOP position.  It's politics and power, and it always was.  And if people die uselessly, well that's just the price to be paid (by somebody else) for hanging on to power.  Ironically and sadly, those most at risk are those who vote for such politicians.

The hypocrisy is breathtaking--not surprising, but breathtaking.  Wouldn't we like to know how many of the politicians railing against the Covid vaccine have in fact been vaccinated?  Odds on it's a pretty high percentage."
2021-09-12 23:48:51,"“What the president does is he creates political cover for Republican leaders, who will scream loudly because it’s politically expedient,” he said. “But I think many of them are actually feeling relieved, because now they don’t have to do the hard work of convincing their constituents.”

Mad Magazine had (or has?) a feature called ""Scenes We'd Like to See.""  I'd like to see one or more of those Republican leaders act like an adult and say, ""You know, Biden is right.  And it's the right thing to do to get this vaccine."""
2021-09-13 00:01:48,"Simple solutions to make everyone accountable for their actions.

Biden should sign an executive order that if  you opt not to get a vaccine and if you contract  Covid19  hospitals have the right to refuse treatment. Problem solved. 

If you have the power to choose not to get vaccinated you should live with the consequences. 

Or if that's to drastic a step then health insurance companies should be exempt from having to cover medical coverage for those that don't get the Covid-19 vaccine and end up contracting  Covid19.  Also any cost incurred are exempt from bankruptcy protection."
2021-09-13 00:01:20,"I have been fully vaccinated since the moment I could get the vaccine, and I am far from being liberal. However, this virus is not polio. It is not even rubella. I have complete confidence in the vaccines' ability to prevent me, a non overweight person of a certain age,, from going to the hospital if I somehow get a rare breakthrough infection. A person doesn't want to get vaccinated, that's their problem. Let the rest of us get back to our lives and get our economy back to what it was before this virus triggered all the shutdowns."
2021-09-13 00:12:53,Lets get real about all of this. It has nothing to do with the vaccine. If Biden had of  mandated No Vaccine the Right would have sued to get everyone Vaccinated. The election of Obama gave The Right license to oppose anything that The Left proposed. Trump threw gasoline on the political and racial divide. Now it is a Bridge Too Far to ever think  to ever think we could ever agree on anything  that would benefit the country as a whole. People would rather die than get vaccinated because  they think The Left wants them vaccinated. These same people will eat a burger at a fast food and not think twice what is in the beef. The way out of the hole that we keep digging is for one side to have overwhelming numbers. The full court press should be on to run the table in 2022 and 2024. Bipartisanship is a thing of the past and will not be coming back anytime soon. The battle lines were drawn in 2008 with the election of Obama. The problem is no one knows how to stop a war that was caused by the election of a person of color.
2021-09-13 00:16:59,Biden told us we could take off our masks if we got the vaccine. Look where we are. I think we would have been better off if a mask mandate had been in place the entirety of this pandemic. Australia and New Zealand understood this.
2021-09-13 00:04:51,"Did anyone notice that the experimental, mostly-non-FDA approved Covid vaccines, for which we have no long-term health data, have NOT been mandated for members of Congress and those who work for members of Congress? The vaccine also is not mandated for anyone who works for the federal court system. Why? If the vaccine is so safe and effective, why wouldn't Biden mandate that Congressional and federal court employees get it? Also, all of us vaxxed folk are super-spreaders. That's how good these vaccines are. The people who are safest are those who recovered from Covid and now have antibodies. I wonder if they spread Covid as much as the vaccinated? Masks are safe and effective and work. No one knows the long-term health effects of these vaccines. This is not a Democrat-Republican issue. It's a critical thinking issue."
2021-09-13 00:00:47,"I am no longer astonished at the fact that reporters and writers do not point out that this is really about politics. The entire US effort to begin a search for a Covid vaccine was begun by Donald Trump in his last year of his first term. Warp Speed was the original name for this vaccine development, as Trump would come to designate it. Democrats and many doctors ridiculed and demeaned  the President for thinking a new vaccine could be created in a year. In fact, this is what happened. 
The vaccine now being rejected as "" filled with transmitters and people magnetizers"", was the original  Trump administration product,(made from a Sars 2 vaccine), but now, one hears nothing about Warp Speed.
The rejection of the vaccines now available thus appears to be not anti vaccine as much as it is  anti-Biden. Many GOP members see this as a possible way to stump the Democrats and Biden by allowing a large portion of the nation to infect the other or, at least, to pollute and arrest  his entire effort. It is reminiscent of nothing so much as the beginning of the Civil War in 1860-61."
2021-09-13 00:12:54,Biden is brilliant to use osha to mandate vaccinations. It gives cover for private companies to enforce what they may be afraid to do alone. No company wants unvaccinated people and it’s not because private companies are for the public good; rather unvaccinated people are a legal and financial liability

2021-09-13 00:17:54,There is a difference between state mandates and what biden is trying to do. States mandate vaccinations for kids who want to attend state schools. Biden is asking third party private entities to require vaccination from it's employees.
2021-09-12 23:57:54,"Most of the complaining about Pres Biden's ""mandate"" seems to overlook some important facts:

The mandate states that Federal employees must be vaccinated.  Sorry, but you can't complain that that's ""dictatorial overreach,"" because employers have the right to impose mandates on their employees if the objective is to protect the safety of their other employees.

The mandate states that healthcare workers that work at facilities that receive federal funding must follow the vaccination mandate.  Again, this is not overreach, beause public agencies at municipal, state, and federal levels often impose stipulations upon entities that receive public monies.  If FL and TX can mandate that school districts that impose a mask rule forfeit their state funding, the federal government can mandate that healthcare facilities who employ unvaccinated healthcare workers forfeit their federal funding.  Pres Biden is doing precisely the same thing that Abbott and DeSantis are doing; they have no right to complain.

For non-federal workers, vaccination isn't totally mandated; a worker can opt to provide a weekly negative covid test result instead of being vaccinated because of a religious or health exemption.  Furthermore, this applies only to companies that have 100+ employees; 98% of companies have fewer than 100 employees.

On top of all this, the federal government has the right to monitor and impose mandates about workplace safety via OSHA.

Sorry, your complaints are baseless."
2021-09-13 00:05:42,"I have no problem with my personal choice of being vaccinated as early as I could be. I believe in choice whenever possible in a democracy. 

Resistance to ""mandates"" in general exist around Europe too where there is no GOP and mostly for the same reasons. It is the ""authoritarian"", no questions must be asked approach that is resisted most, by many, even those who have been vaccinated."
2021-09-12 23:42:47,"As per usual, the GOP has no solutions to offer, just friction against Democratic policy which is a serious effort to pull the nation out of the pandemic and restore our economy.  It's mind boggling to think the Republican Rx for the country is to let the pandemic rage, hospitals fill, and people die, and there are voters who support this approach.  My fervent hope is that they are so far off the rails that they get trounced, badly, in 2022."
2021-09-12 23:45:14,"Pres. Biden must continue to do what is best for the people!

We will never get out of the Covid crisis  unless  vaccine mandates are enforced. One successful  new variant will follow another. Mutations are inevitable to  get a foothold  as long our overall vaccine % are low."

2021-09-13 00:34:01,"Vaccines are the best thing we have from protecting you from getting a severe form of Covid-19, and/ or dying. Vaccines don’t stop you from getting Covid-19 - no. And that’s precisely why everyone needs to be vaccinated because guess who will suffer most from catching Covid-19: unvaccinated people. vaccines protect yourself as well as others.

Given it is a airborne disease, masks can help to prevent the spread. I’m sick of people saying that masks are useless. Whether they offer 1% protection or 99% protection, that’s better than nothing. Are you going to be one of those ones on the dying bed with regret?

Your healthcare bills will be astronomical thanks to the GOP refusing to do healthcare reform, it's your loss!' People would inevitably be mad at the healthcare costs when they fall sick, not Biden for saving them despite themselves. Why give the GOP ammunition? Keep reminding everyone that the ones hospitalized are the ones that didn't get the vaccine. ""Only the unvaxxed are dying from covid"" is a far better argument than ""I'm going to force you to do something because it's good for you,"" even if it is, actually, good for you."

It is being used by these phonies to deflect their incompetence and place it on their detractors.

I think that realizing how gullible people were led them to see that they could learn even more about the extent of their influence by letting Covid rage un-checked.

I would respectully direct the governor’s attention to a quality dictionary. 
President Biden is not acting the role of tyrant. And compelling citizens to play a responsible role in fighting a deadly viral epidemic does not meet the definition of tyranny.
This is NOT tyranny. It is reasonable, loyal citizenship.

And, Governor Reeves, with regard to your support of those persons defying all reason to avoid being vaccinated.
Tate, while you have your dictionary out, take a look at the meaning of “negligent homicide.”
That is what the unvaccinated who infect and kill other citizens are guilty of."

In Denmark, 75% of the population is fully vaccinated and they just dropped all Covid restrictions. We were well ahead of the world in vaccination efforts until we hit the GOP “freedom-caucus.” 

The anti-vaxers are also now responsible for the steep downturn in hiring and perhaps another recession.  Because of the surge restaurants are starting to limit indoor dining again. The hospitality and travel-related businesses are having a difficult time recruiting people. The same goes for workers in education, healthcare and retail.

Like its Afghanistan debacle, its record here is not the astounding success.
Trump and Biden have followed policies of vaccine nationalism. Ethicists, by contrast, look at morally relevant factors. Yet, the NYT Editorial Board claims, ""As the virus continues to spread widely, it can and will evolve in ways that put everyone at risk."" But, when we examine the evidence, it shows the danger of vaccine nationalism, that Biden's more coercive approach would worsen.
The Mu variant was detected in Colombia, while the Delta in India, the Lambda variant in Peru and the C.1.2 variant in South Africa.
Business Standard reports, ""many scientists say [uneven vaccine distribution] will likely prolong the global health crisis"".
In addition to its failure to follow ethics, its immense failure in fighting a pandemic, the government generates intense hyper-partisanship or sectarianism that we can see in the comments.

We just can't afford to play Russian roulette with the nation's health any longer, after over 600,000 deaths in a year and a half.  At this point, I think law-enforcement at various levels has to start taking appropriate action to make public indoor spaces, schools, clinics and hospitals and all other workplaces safe to work in and safe to be in.

As both major parties are usually pretty much equal in the votes, it’s easy to see how the GOP saw an opportunity here. They go consistently for that minority group, who can he fooled all of the time. 
So, they mock policy debate. It seems they don’t care. Probably they think more reasoned policy will follow if they are elected. The issue of abortion, taxes, education etc, can all be used as ammunition in this crazy advertising game to inflame silly peoples anger and rage.

Thais line up for hours for vaccinations. I'm appalled 80 million adult Americans don't seem to care a whit about their fellow Americans.

She says the hospitals are full sure -- but a huge percentage of the patients are vaccinated people. Well more than half of patients are vaccinated people and they are many seriously sick and dying vaccinated people too !

I find it very interesting that there is no solid factual data on how many vaccinated patients are being admitted to hospital and also how many are dying. I can alot of money that the percentages of vaccinated hospital patients are MUCH higher than people think.

The vaccinated can still be infected according to all the professionals and probably infect others too. But the only case for vaccinations it's alleged that the vaccinated will handle the infection better than the un-vaccinated and lower the chance of serious illness. If this is true whether vaccinated or not,  one can transmit the virus to others and therefore the vaccinated are dangerous too (yes,  to the vaccinated and non-vaccinated)."
2021-09-13 01:36:40,"Vaccine mandates have been part of public health in the United States for over decades. There are millions of Americans that still bear the mark from our vaccination for measles. At the beginning of every school year, new children seeking to enroll in a public school have to provide medical proof they have been vaccinated against common communicable childhood diseases. 

The vaccine mandates have been proven necessary because cases of new infections, hospitalizations, and deaths have skyrocketed in many areas, particularly those areas where vaccinations have lagged behind national averages. 
Local hospitals are reporting their ICU and emergency departments and staffs are being stained to the breaking point with new cases and 99.9% of the new cases are unvaccinated individuals.

The Constitution of the United States explicitly states the primary responsibilities of the Republic's federal government. One of these enumerated duties is to ""provide for the common defense.""  

The SARs-CoV-2 virus has infected over 35 million Americans and killed over 620,000 there has been no greater deadly threat to the lives, prosperity, safety, and peace of this nation than this virus from ANY nation, sect, or individual in its history. In response to the threat of war, Selective Service was initiated and millions of males reaching their 18 birthday were mandated to register and in time of War REQUIRED TO SERVE."

They don’t acknowledge the data that sex ed results in fewer teenage pregnancies. 

The science is that it’s much safer to get the vaccine than it is to get COVID. 

Also, since the GOP claims to be pro-business, here’s a news flash: the economy won’t return to normal until we get the pandemic under control. Also, lots of people dying and being sick is bad for the economy. 

So, vaccines are a win-win on all levels. Let’s mandate them and get back to normal life."

When this became clear, there was no other responsible reaction than changing course and enforcing mandates."

They wrap themselves in Christianity while supporting a president/former president who was married three times. committed adulytry and lied over 25,000 times while in office and was a party to over 2,500 lawsuits before receiving their votes.

That these despicable creatures who would dare call themselves leaders would actually encourage their constituents in dangerous behavior for political gain is mind boggling.

Of course, for the Republican voters, Covid isn’t even real to them until someone close to them dies or they, personally, wind up on a ventilator.  And even then, some persist in irrational denial.  And they will continue to ignore the fact that hospitals are overwhelmed with unvaccinated Covid patients until they, personally, are turned away at the door.

They believe that, as more people die and the pandemic persists, they will gain support from their constituency, not lose it.   They are probably correct.   They can then blame Biden.   They have a vested interest in the failure of Biden and his plan for ending the pandemic.   It matters not that more people will die.   Cynical but apparently true."

In relation to the  legal qiestion of personal freedoms,  I sure see the point there is no difference  between  a State mandate or a Federal mandate. But I don't think that's the issue here.

The reason why people don't want to take this particular Covid vaccine is because they don't trust this vaccine being that it's so, so new and we don't enough about this new technology being used in the Moderna  & Pfizer recipes. And the politicians pushing the vaccine doesn't encourage people to take the vaccine.

I happen to live in very close quarters to many minorities and they seem to be the most pessimistic about the vaccines. And I see many  Black neighbors who are not vaccinated... this is interesting to the politics of the vaccine campaign and the mid-term elections."

It prevents a serious illness in the person who is vaccinated. It does not prevent infecting others. It is only socially beneficial because it limits pressure on hospitals, as fewer vaccinated people, even if they are infected, require treatment or hospitalization. This is not a minor benefit. Treatments are expensive, and COVID patients who clog ER force hospitals to delay elective surgeries and other procedures. So if GOP governors object to the mandate, they can simply ask hospitals to charge unvaccinated people more. This is an equitable and free-market solution.

The United States had fewer than nine months between first lockdown and first vaccine deployed. It was only another nine months before the FDA granted full approval. The nature of the objections to this vaccine are different in nature than objections to MMR.

My neighborhood is a good example. In April, we were placed on a special list due to low vaccination. The result of a lot of work by people with local influence is that we are now at 84% full vaccination.

However, people have had seven months to get onboard, and I think that it's time to use pressure. Right now, there are 40 countries ahead of the U.S. on full vaccination. Our northern neighbor, which leads the G7 on vaccination, is taking active steps, including use of mandates, to increase vaccination, especially among the active 18-39 year old group. It is also implementing vaccination passes covering 78% of the population. As recently reported in this paper, it believes that if it fails to take these actions there will be a dramatic increase in cases as people head indoors for the fall.

The Fire Fighters risked their lives--and many of those Fire Fighters lost their lives--while trying to give others a chance to live. No one is asking that of ordinary people: Just the minimal consideration of wearing a mask to protect others (and themselves) from a deadly virus. And if their fear of a vaccine is so intense, then to test themselves frequently, and keep a safe social distance from others. Trying to develop the consideration that everyone's life is as important as one's own would be a good goal for every citizen to aim our energies toward."

The Covid vaccination has been rushed. The impact it has on children is similar to the flu, for which there is no requirement for vaccination. This is why there is resistance and hesitance. And it's not just in the south."
2021-09-13 03:26:30,It's one thing to mandate vaccines for children -- they have no co-morbidities. It's a different decision to mandate -- under threat of losing a job -- a vaccine for adults. And it is another thing again to mandate a vaccine for those who have survived co-vid and who now have natural immunity which -- whether it is reported here or not -- is an accepted equivalent to the current vaccines in countries all over the world. Several well designed studies have found natural immunity to be equal to if not better than the current vaccines. People who have not had any exposure to co-vid should be vaccinated if possible.

No one could answer me when I asked all the participants why their rights not to have the vaccine mandated was different to the “no jab, no play” policies we have here is Australia for kids, which means the kids cant go to kindergarten without being vaccinated? My point was that the adults in the room didn't bat an eyelid at a mandate for children to be vaccinated, yet it was a topic of lively discussion when adults were involved and it was somehow different when the policy involved adults and the workplace.

The Republicans are willing to overlook 45,000 needless and easily preventable deaths a month now just to keep a few angry voters in the tent.

It's interesting that the Republicans will fight tooth and nail for the the unborn's ""right to life"", yet they are willing to immediately set that right aside once that child is born if it interferes with someone else's belief that it's their right not to wear a mask during a global pandemic.

In effect, they have sided with the rights of anti-mask/anti-vaxxers over the rights of innocent children not to be needlessly and senselessly exposed to a deadly virus by those same individuals.

The idea that federal employees have a right to refuse both vaccination and testing doesn't pass the paper bag test. I don't believe that any reputable lawyer will even make that argument.

This kind of pernicious doublespeak is almost as bad as GOP governors opposing mask and vaccine mandates. The only sense in which ""Republicans care about getting beyond this pandemic as much as Democrats do"" is that they, too, wish it were over. Maybe. But they value political power higher than public health. So it is weaselly nonsense to say they care about ending the pandemic as much as Democrats do. Saying so only confuses the issue and voters, who must understand in no uncertain terms that America has a political party that would rather see them sicken and die than miss a political opportunity, harvesting the disinformation they have helped sow. 

The only sensible response is not to pretend Republicans are caring people too but to turn the GOP, wholesale, out of office. With few exceptions, they are either science-denying death-dealers or, by their silence or weak voices, the collaborators of science-denying death-dealers.

President Biden certainly knew this when he instituted the mandate, and did it anyway, on the basis that driving up vaccination was the only way to defeat the pandemic, and that was his primary consideration.  He knew it could defeat him and his party and he still went with protecting public health.  If this doesn't make someone qualified to be president I don't know what does.

Another thing:  the press should stop framing the mandate as a ""vaccine mandate"", because it isn't.  It's a ""vaccine/testing mandate"", which maintains that sacrosanct ""personal choice""."

       As of late, with recent mandates regarding the requirement to be vaccinated in much more situations these days, many people have declared the recent implementations to be tyrannical. I remember rather fondly just over 2-3 years ago when it was assumed the idea of vaccine hesitancy was foolish misinformation. But, unfortunately, with the mainstreaming of this narrative in political discourse, it seems there are fragments of the republican party that have firmly situated themselves on the ""vaccine mandates = fascism"" side of things. Now, I don't actually believe that all these reasonably well-educated Republican politicians really believe there is a problem with the vaccine. What I do believe, however, is that many of these politicians have observed an easy way to secure an unwavering voter base. Or some of these politicians may fear that if they don't badmouth vaccine efforts, they could lose many voters in their high vaccine hesitancy rate states. So now I am curious if the problems regarding vaccine hesitancy that Trump certainly promoted will still exist in time for the 2024 election cycle. Either way, I hope that more vaccination mandates are introduced to stop coronavirus's rapid spread in America eventually."

Brilliant scientists have managed to come up with life saving vaccines and we appreciate and embrace their efforts on behalf of us all. Showing courage and real leadership in the face of ignorance and cynicism is the job of being president.  There are some who will knowingly lie, cheat and exploit the fears of their own constituents in their thirst for grabbing or keeping political power.  People like this are always with us; they will not listen to reason and will do anything to achieve their ends.  The majority of American voters understand what they’re really trying to do and always will.  Pay them no mind Mr. President; keep pushing for the policies we elected you to put into effect and into law.  Thank you very much for your service."

They want their constituents to believe it is a slippery slope towards socialism and communism.  In reality it is the GOP who is over reaching.  Mask mandates and vaccines resistance is devolving into a movement to take federal education mandates away. By eliminating what can and can be taught in schools will give them more control by limiting the knowledge of science, sex education, and the ability to gaslight about the realities of racism in this country.  This is all about the ability of local GOP groups to wield power over the people."
2021-09-13 05:58:58,"The way I understand it, the vaccine is a harmless substance yet resembles a key molecular feature of the covid virus. Your immune system recognizes the threat and develops antibodies to fight that specific threat, but the specifics of how that works vary from person to person. After awhile the vaccine substance itself flushes completely out of your body, and all that remains are the antibodies that your own immune system produced.
Then, if and when actual virus enters your body, the antibodies that your own immune system produced will have a head-start on fighting the infection, before it overpowers your body and kills you.
I feel like there's a million words written about why you should or shouldn't take vaccines yet nobody mentions exactly how they work in a simple way that ordinary people can understand.
I feel like, once you understand how it works, of course you'd choose to have the vaccine. Anybody would!"

Too many of them believe conspiratorial nonsense, which is an ever rolling cascade of new fears and outrages all of it impervious to science, facts, and simple observation (e.g., millions have been vaccinated and are walking around just fine - and not getting very sick & dying). Meanwhile this resistance is harming both the resistant and the rest of us. Enough!"

There is no inconsistency here.  Childhood immunizations and documentation thereof, along with the regular pediatrician visits that go along with them, require regular access to health care, a barrier that disproportionately impacts marginalized communities that can be conveniently used to deny and exclude children of lower-income communities of color from admission to and/or registration at schools that have traditionally served more affluent suburban communities in those states.  In contrast, any sort of vaccine mandate would disproportionately impact more affluent white and traditionally Republican-voting workers, who are statistically less likely to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.

Biden's and Democrats' mistake all along was in making COVID-19 vaccines freely available to all, depriving more affluent, Republican-leaning demographics any sense of exclusivity or superiority in scoring vaccine doses.  Had the government charged $10 or $20 for every dose of the vaccine (which does not even begin to cover the $150 to $200 that the Federal Government pays Pfizer and Moderna for every vaccine dose) and launched a campaign that made vaccine cards a coveted status symbol, Republicans would have jumped at the opportunity to embrace a breakthrough vaccine that gave them immunity and significantly increased their freedom of activity (while at the same time the government could have waived the fee for anyone who could not afford it)"

Even if successful, the Republican rebellion continues with massive nation-wide voter suppression and gerrymandering with the Democrats seeming stymied on what to do.  We're in a war of rebellion where opposition to vaccine mandates are creating thousands of innocent casualties by ruthless Republicans, the ""children of a sour spirit"" as President George W.

All the other vaccines could be likened to a fire suppression system for your home. It won’t prevent your home from catching on fire but it will certainly reduce the damages if it does.

The vaccine does not prevent infection. It does greatly reduce the effects of getting infected such as hospitalization and death.  We’re talking orders of magnitude less likely to become seriously ill for those vaxxed, not just a little. 

If you feel you may have contracted COVID-19, get tested ASAP. If you test positive talk to your doctor about getting monoclonal antibodies treatment ASAP.   Seriously. Even if you are fully vaccinated and especially if you are not.

We all live with a certain amount of public responsibility that we may or may not like:  seat belts, speed limits, dress codes, and yes vaccines.  Most adults were vaccinated as kids to go to school, too.  And, I don’t know about you but I take vaccines for shingles, flu, pneumonia, tetanus, at my doctor’s advice because I couldn’t afford to get these illnesses, pay the medical costs, risk the impact to my health and that of my family, etc. if I got sick.

Of course, the UK is 81% fully vaccinated, while the US is stuck at 54%.  By now, we should be talking about vaccinating the globe, not arguing over getting Americans vaccinated. 

To my fellow US citizens: you could have been enjoying the summer of return to life as we are here in the UK. Instead, the antivaxxers and their Republican enablers have not only denied you the summer, they're setting you up for at best another wave in the fall and at worst a new more lethal variant.

Although, it must also be noted that this outbreak struck during the misrule of the least qualified, most shameful and most harmful presidency ever, which gained power and was firmly and consistently supported there by a large majority of the GOP leadership.

The increasingly dysfunctional and destructive two party duopoly has been wrecking America for too long, but that does not mean both of the two dominant political parties have been playing similarly counterproductive roles, or are equally to blame.

I, personally, would prefer not to and would enjoy returning to traveling, attending cultural and sporting events, going out for a meal without wondering is it really safe or not.  I live in Ireland and have not seen my family in Florida in 2 years but with another Republican Governor who is just whining about how awful President Biden is and his mandates instead of doing the right thing for the sake of his citizens, how can I plan a trip there.

Florida no longer provides data on nursing home vaccination rates, but these centers are still reporting to Medicare twice a month. Here is the data from August 28, two days before my aunt tested positive. It showed that there were 23 active covid cases at her nursing home. I assume the numbers are higher now.

If businesses want to stay in business they will ramp up the vaccination mandate (which they can do!) for employees and customers. 

Biden is walking the gauntlet on the political implementation and doing as good a job as can be expected (although I think he has been too accommodating) when dealing with the uncooperative who are clueless and who continue to fall for the dangerous and evil republican rhetoric.  republicans stand for nothing, they  have no policies, or solutions . . . they are obstructionists of the most destructive type."

Washington has had mask mandates and other mitigation measures in place throughout the pandemic to lower our infection and death rates, while Idaho has had none. 

Why should our state, our doctors and our nurses suffer burnout, and our citizens be forced to forgo healthcare, to treat the irresponsible citizens of Idaho?

This is a national problem. We desperately need minimum mitigation measures like vaccine mandates so that irresponsible states like Idaho can’t dump their unvaccinated Covid patients on responsible states like Washington."

During intermission, the usher asked both sets of people (unrelated to one another) to please mask up. By that point, I was standing opposite the three ladies, seething, wondering if I should leave. I was so appreciative of the usher but dismayed when I saw the one closest to me smirk and pull her mask under her nose. I stared her down, she returned my stare with a brazen expression any that is when I snapped.

“Excuse me. I can see you think it’s funny but I have blood cancer. If I get Covid, my doctor already told me I am going straight into the hospital as I have no antibodies. When you ladies take off your masks, I have a heart attack. I only came out because I thought everyone would be masked up.” I was so angry, I stopped speaking without eye contact.

These vaccines have been researched for 30 years, were proved safe and effective against Ebola in human trials, have been through the same clinical trial process, albeit accelerated as ever other approved vaccine and just went through the largest phase three clinical trial in human history.

The “technology” is novel.  It is not new.

The smallpox vaccine technology was new as was the polio vaccine technology.  And you know what?  We mandated everyone get one to engage in the public sphere.

It’s all a political smoke screen by the GQP to try to use anything to make Biden look bad and play for votes to try to win in 2022 and 2024 even if thousand more Americans die each day because of it."

Texas fetal tissue now has a legal vigilante aspect?  That's not good policy. Folks who don't want to vaxx, can opt for testing to keep us all safer. I think the non-vaxxers need to pay for the tests and should stay in the privacy of their own homes when infected with covid 19, too.  

The vaccine base has been years in the making and by an international effort. The specifics of Covid 19  were added to this base, tested and deployed with excellent results . All the nonsense of rushing it to the market are plain ignorance and the larger goals of public health are being shucked by the vocal resistance of the few who are being egged on by governors and news shills, all of whom are vaccinated. These high dollar fools have top notch medical plans for their families, and are displaying how little care for anything larger in front of them. Right to choose? Ha."

2021-09-13 02:13:55,"Republicans feel the government doesn't have a right to force people to wear a mask during a pandemic. But it does have the right to force a woman who's been raped to carry that child to term and care for it for 18 years without any assistance.

Over 1,500 people a day, many of them children, are dying agonizing and painful deaths because Republicans feel it's a violation of people's rights to force them to wear a piece of cloth over their mouths in order to prevent it. I guess, for them, the ""right to life"" of all those children doesn't rate the same level of attention or consideration.

I'm now convinced that the GOP would continue to defend their constituents right to engage in a ""personal freedom"" which is the moral and ethical equivalent of negligent homicide on a global scale because it just might result in the incubation and spreading of a corona virus variant that could kill every human being on the planet.

Which, if you look at it, is completely consistent with a Republican view of society in which they are entitled to ""Do whatever we want!"", irrespective of the harm it causes, while everyone else is required to ""Do whatever we say!"", even if it doesn't affect them in any way.

For the record, all these put-out Republicans going on and on about people's personal rights are the same one who have no problem what-so-ever requiring all school children to be vaccinated for half a dozen other diseases, without religious exception.

2021-09-13 04:26:47,The average GOP leader and voters give us a real time insight into Darwin's survival of fittest theory. For humans survival of the fittest basically is how we adapt to external changes. Covid and Climate change are these real time existential changes. Conservatives can not see a future that is different from the past. A different future scares them no matter how many guns they have. This fixation on the past makes them especially vulnerable to major changes. If they keep this up there will be less and less GOP voters in 2024.....the cause... Covid.

Terrorism is defined as the unlawful use of violence or threats to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or government, with the goal of furthering political, social, or ideological objectives. What the GOP and its adherents are doing meets all of the criteria: trying to intimidate or coerce the American population furthering the Party’s wing-nut agenda. Those who refuse pose an existential threat to the nation, her people, especially her children and health care and other front line workers and to the economy. Their acts are not selfish; they are destructive and now is the time to call them to account. We mourn the 3,000 who died on 911 twenty years ago but we ignore the nearly 600,000 Americans who have died in the last 20 months. It is unconscionable and it’s time for the majority of Americans, who are vaccinated and who can’t be to apply some Texas and Missouri logic to the problem: enact laws that mirror the Texas abortion law, allow any American to bring a civil suit against anyone not vaccinated by choice due to some weird and misguided conviction pay the the court costs and have to offer up $10,000 to anyone who is proven correct that the accused isn’t vaccinated. Gloves off people. Fight these murderers, these domestic terrorists with the same insane, diabolical but brilliant tools they have deployed against the country."

We have raised a generation incapable of thought or understanding beyond their own immediate needs, and given them the power to elect the government that rules us all.

They willfully follow some anti-vax hogwash that is keeping this country from building a herd immunity response. And guess what. All this goofing around with this virus, instead of attacking it head-on, is allowing it to mutate into something big that maybe vaccines can't stop. That's what viruses do. A man died recently because he had a heart attack and they couldn't find a hospital that had an available bed. They were all filled with covid patients. They tried 43 hospitals with no luck. They finally found one about 200 miles away but it was too late. So yeah be selfish while the virus spreads and kiss off all the people who are dying when they shouldn't have to."

dead quiet about the insurrection? They put Donald Trump on a pedestal but criticize Dr. Fauci?

What is wrong with these Republicans? There seems to be no respect anymore! It’s just ‘how can I get re-elected using Trumps playbook?’

At least the paper could preface these displays of operatic emotiion by calling them typical or predictable or laughable if it feels the need to report them all.

It's exactly what we've come to expect from Republicans. But this time they've planted their flag on the wrong hill, and I think even some of their own are beginning to realize it and are desperately waving off. If they really want to run as the party defending their own bizarre and dangerous definition of the word ""freedom"" against masks and vaccinations during a pandemic, while Biden and the Democrats run as the party defending the country against a deadly disease through encouraging masks and vaccinations, I have no problem with that--in fact, I encourage it. I bet most people will see it just that way and vote accordingly.

Yes, they are often involved in newsworthy events, but there has been WAY, WAY too much space in the media as a whole that is dedicated to reporting their every fit. Less time needs to be spent on their nonsense, and more time needs to be spent discussing how we the country can move on IN SPITE of them. The ODD party cannot and/or will not change, so how about we stop wasting time thinking that they can and start talking about what regular, sane Americans can do to resist the incipient fascist takeover that the ""Republican"" party has in store for us."

Maybe if we urge people to get their 
“Trumpination”, a la ObamaCare, the national vaccination percentage would rise significantly?

Where are the controlled borders, extensive testing, intensive contact tracing, and quarantining that was at least temporarily successful in island nations like Australia?

First we have commenters who claim that other vaccines that are mandated all went through years of trial before approval. Five minutes on the internet shows that an obscure figure named Jonas Salk started trials for his polio vaccine on April 25, 1954 and that the vaccine was approved on April 12, 1955.

Then there are the commenters who say that other vaccine mandates only apply to kids, not adults. The Supreme Court's 1905 decision in Jacobson involved a prosecution against an adult. Also, see the Indiana University case, which was decided by a Trump appointee and that Amy Coney Barrett, also a Trump appointee, denied an appeal from just a few weeks ago.

Then there are the commenters that effectively say that people have a right to go to work and refuse both vaccination and testing. This is right out of La-La Land."

COVID from the start has been the latest go-to for the right and even centrist pro-Wall Street crowd to grab the billions of dollars in the public education system for their personal enrichment. Vouchers, for-profit charter schools, corporate online education companies (including the one heavily-invested in by that moderate Republican, Jeb Bush) and other entrenched methods of destroying public education are reaping a fortune from anti-vaxers and anti-maskers who have been riled up by the lies of FOX, Trump, and GOP governors to take over local boards of education.

Really, enough is enough."

He is overstepping here and the only reason why you are ok with this is because you agree with the issue.  Step back from the issue and imagine a Republican doing this exact thing but on something you disagree with.  You'd be screaming fascism.  But apparently, you are so short sighted that you don't care that this sort of power is going to backfire.  Remember, what's good for one president is good for another.  So when this happens again (and it will if you are ok with this particular issue), just remember that next time, you may be crying rather than cheering because now presidents are going to be trying every loophole they can find to push their agenda and it won't always be your precious Democrats doing this.  This is not the role of the government as Psaki has previously stated.  Stop being ok with giving the government more power only when it suits you.  This sets a very dangerous precedent."

Forgive me, but Pres. Biden DIDN'T bring politics into the COVID vaccinations or medical advice on how to combat this disease, they did!

We do not live in a black and white world. People are capable of forming thoughts and opinions all by their onesies, without the direction of any political party or major newspaper. My son’s employer of 700 — already experiencing a shortage of workers — is attempting to encourage voluntary compliance with the vaccine mandate. Last week it brought in what was supposed to be a doctor to meet with employees and discuss their vaccine concerns. Only she wasn’t a doctor, or nurse. She used to work at a vaccine clinic. And her only talking point was the vaccine won’t inject a microchip into them. The employees were incredulous. They had come to the meeting armed with actual facts and information and research, and they peppered her with real questions. She could not answer a single one of their concerns. They left frustrated, but it gave me a glimmer of hope for the younger generations. These kids can think. They have access to data. Underestimate them at your own peril."

But if you vote for Republicans today, you also have to accept the baggage that comes with that:
- You support the Big Lie, that the 2020 election was stolen;
- You support the Insurrection of January Sixth;
- You believe the COVID vaccine contains tracking microchips, and magnetizes you;

This is not your father's Oldsmobile.

As far I can tell, the purpose of today's Republican Party is to:
1) cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires (who already pay minimal effective taxes, or nothing);
2) eliminate all regulations (to the point of anarchy);
3) outlaw abortion, and tell women what to do (like the Taliban);
4) promote the proliferation of guns everywhere (because guns are ""freedom"");
5) ""own the libs"" -- like a sports rivalry (just because).

I happen to be a Democrat. I have voted for some thoughtful, honest conservatives in the past. Never again. Today's Republican Party has gone off the rails. 

The current Republican Party needs to go the Way of the Whigs. Into the dustbin of history.

Vote every Republican out of office. From president to state senator to school board member to dog catcher. Every last one of them.

That is the only thing they will understand. Complete and utter destruction at the polls.

""common good"" means is not universally understood in the same way. 

How this happened is a long story that goes back at least to 
the electoral triumph of reagan and the apotheosis of fx ""news"" as the go to channel for  peddling  destructive and socially manipulative disinformation by all sorts of hidden agenda pushers.  

The surface narratives never changed from owning liberals, browbeating minorities, and sticking up 
for the white working class' biases and hassles in dealing
with government institutions who no longer were seen as acting to protect their privileges and social authority.

The current disaster is a completely natural consequence of the triumph of fx propaganda as a vehicle for inciting  and exploiting  grievance to mobilize voters. 

It is not something  the society, such as it is at present,  can hope to overcome except by a national expression of overwhelming revulsion and rejection of the trumpican political class that has chosen to act in the interests of a vocally loud but numerical minority. 

This requires an effective opposition that is able to articulate
effectively a coherent, principled  message of constructive rejection of all this lunacy without internal vitiating divisions that are led by self-appointed and self-righteous personalities and which can  will lead only to political suicide and social collapse.

It remains to be seen in the next few weeks if we have such an opposition."

The issue is compulsion. The federal government is one of limited powers. All other powers are reserved to the states. Public health, in particular, is a power that has always resided in the states.

This is no secret. Joe Biden knows this. Once again he is simply doing what he has no power to do and daring the courts to stop him.

I believe in requiring vaccination against extremely contagious and deadly diseases — once they have been thoroughly vetted by professional peer review, over time and with substantial valid and reliable data, and then receive the full approval of the FDA, and preferably by at least one allied but non-American equivalent of the FDA.  In other words, not necessarily for younger children, whose bodies are not even yet fully developed and such development could be, for all Pharma knows, adversely impacted by a new vaccine ingredient.  In those circumstances, parents and guardians, in consult with the child’s pediatricians, should have some discretion, and the child be granted effective accommodations (for example, full-day distance or full-day in-person outdoor school, not just family-sink-or-swim independent study."

I would be the first in line to support individual freedoms, but at the same time, I recognize that those freedoms come with the reality that I live in a society where others have rights as well. My rights exist along side the rights of society, not above them. When it comes to a matter of health risk, a pandemic, the rights of society are, I believe, paramount!"

While one shot has some efficacy, to be considered fully vaccinated two shots are required. The percentage of Americans who have received two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine sits at a dismal 54 percent. Let's not forget that the vaccine has been available since December of 2020.  Anyway you look at it Biden and his administration have failed at getting people vaccinated.  Now Joe wants to strong-arm businesses and people to get it or else.

I won't buy a first model year car, and a 6-9 month initial quality study is no substitute for a 2 year or 3 year study.  Things happen.  The unforeseen occurs.  Batteries catch on fire...components fail...cars crash. 

I also know many healthy people (and not all of them are conservatives) that want their human immune system to do its job, and believe that long term they will have better immune responses to what could be numerous variants over years.  Some have had COVID-19 and recovered.  Why isn't there an accommodation for the human immune system, especially since we don't know who will be better protected one year from now?  Two years from now?  Are we really going to fire people for not getting a booster shot later this year?  Are we going to fire people for not getting an annual booster?     

Some say that not getting vaccinated puts others at risk, not just themselves, but aren't those at risk making their own decisions as well?"

This is disingenuous reporting.

The people who are objecting to the vaccine mandate are mostly objecting to the mandate - not the vaccine. Everyone I’ve spoken with who objects is fully vaccinated and would like to see more people get vaccinated.

Biden just wiped his shoes on the Constitution. 

The constitutional smallpox vaccine mandate was a result of state legislatures, not a federal executive through a federal agency (whose members, unlike a legislature, are not elected by the people and therefore do not answer to them). Last I checked, we are not ruled by an authoritarian dictator. That is not the role of the president, and we weaken our country every time we allow our leaders to act outside their roles as defined in the Constitution, regardless of which party they belong to.

Additionally, the smallpox vaccine pretty much wiped out smallpox. In the case of COVID-19, it will never be wiped out. It is here to stay and we will likely need to get at least one shot every year.

And our current vaccine does NOT stop transmission of COVID-19-Delta - it helps keep people out of the ICU. In fact, vaccinated people are more likely to unwittingly pass on the virus than the unvaccinated. Which defeats the purpose of this workplace mandate, if you think about it.

The thought that we, the people, are allowing our leaders to slowly erode the Constitution in the name of short-sighted political victories and vendettas is truly sickening."
2021-09-13 19:07:54,"Republicans are angry because they don’t want the economy and people’s lives to get better while there are Democrats in control.  

Just as is said about abortion (“If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament.”), If it were a Republican POTUS or governor mandating the Covid19 vaccine, they’d treat such mandates as being close to the word of The Almighty, as a guiding light to recovery both human and fiscal. 

Speaking of abortion, state Republicans are, true their cruelty of recent years, also the same people who want government mandates requiring half the population (female) to undergo even the most physically and psychologically dangerous pregnancies and childbirth, should such citizens be impregnated unintentionally or even against their will."

April 15, 2020, Section A, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline ""Experts Reject Trump Claim"":
“When somebody’s the president of the United States, the authority is total,” Mr. Trump asserted. “And that’s the way it’s got to be.”
""But neither the Constitution nor any federal law bestows that power upon Mr. Trump, a range of legal scholars and government officials said.""
“We don’t have a king in this country,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Tuesday, adding, “There are laws and facts — even in this wild political environment.” He rebutted Mr. Trump’s claim by citing a line from Alexander Hamilton, observing that presidential encroachment on powers that the Constitution reserved to the states would be “repugnant to every rule of political calculation.”
""The Constitution bestows specific powers on the federal government while reserving the rest to sovereign state governments. None of the enumerated powers given to the federal government directly address control over public health measures, although the Constitution does let Congress regulate interstate commerce.""

Now ""Experts in public health law agree that Mr. Biden is on solid legal footing..."" when the president asserts his authority over the states."

If the latter were true, SC would have a rate of vaccination similar to Vermont, Massachusetts and Connecticut, not one of the lower rates in the country.  Our hospitals are full of Covid patients, almost all of whom are unvaccinated.  Elective surgery is being postponed.  Schools have had to close shortly after opening because it is against the law to mandate masks in SC.  

I can't imagine a more inept, incompetent response to a deadly virus than what we see from Republicans.  Yet I'm not surprised, because they no longer have a platform or planks in that platform beyond ""seize power and keep it.""

2021-09-13 18:15:11,"Hopefully this experience will yield some reflection on moral standards.  The fundamental basis of modern ethics is the harm principle, perhaps best articulated in 1789:   ""Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law.""  But the concept really extends at least as far back as the Biblical Golden Rule:  ""thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.""

For some reason, Republicans seem to have forgotten these fundamental precepts.  Masks are deemed an infringement of liberty, as are vaccines and (of course) any restriction on gun ownership.  All these things can reduce the harm to others.

I understand that conservatives say the issue is using a mandate.  But that is what government is for:  to protect the well-being of its citizens.  When, as now, you have a large group who refuse to take simple steps that will avoid harm to others, then a mandate is entirely defensible.  But, for the record, Biden did not actually even issue a vaccine mandate.  You can opt out with testing.  And, of course, there is the vague and increasingly abused religious belief exemption.

It is absolutely time the government stepped up to protect society from those who adhere to a perverted meaning of liberty."

- This is not a ""vaccine mandate"" for the private sector. There is an out (weekly tests), for the objectors.

2. How can anyone argue with healthcare workers (at hospitals that receive federal money) being required to be vaccinated?
- I don't want to see any doctor or nurse or lab tech who is unvaccinated. Do you?
- Do these people even believe in science?
- For those who argue ""natural immunity"", that antibodies from prior COVID infections are equivalent to vaccines, show me the science. The evidence I have seen says that a vaccine at a minimum supplements your protection from natural antibodies, with no harm to you.

3. Members of the military have been vaccinated for decades. This is a matter of national security.

The data does not support any of the above. This President was expected to follow science and unite people, but what we see is a man in desperate search to blame something or someone for resurgent virus.

That means that our scientific community has confidence that the vaccine helps protect the person vaccinated, but not the people around them. Therefore, logic dictates that the person receiving the shot is doing so to protect themselves - not others.

Everyone, including the vaccinated, is able to spread the Delta variant (which is the most common variant in the US).

In an era of massive air travel, it is almost impossible to effectively quarantine against a virus that spreads this easily and quickly. Human beings are going to interact with other human beings. Any pandemic-mitigation approach that depends upon human beings minimizing their contact with other human beings is one that cannot work for very long.

Only someone trying to undermine the health of Americans and damage the American economy could possibly raise any objection to this. Sabotaging America and deliberately harming Americans is something enemies do, not loyal Americans.

The vaccine is safer than Tylenol, it has undergone the most rigorous review of any vaccine in history, and the vaccines have been given to billions of people worldwide with no significant risk at all.

We locked down. We wore and still wear masks where needed. 

It’s been disruptive, but what is really disruptive is getting Covid and winding up on a ventilator. If you survive your medical bills would be catastrophic.  

Of course, dying is totally disruptive.

I would much prefer we be given all the rational ""scientific"" facts about the actual dangers and to whom ... Why are citizens not being given enough information to make decisions based on their situation? Refusing to be more transparent and complete about what science knows stokes the fires of all kinds of unscientific & exaggerated theories among the pro and anti vaccine proponents.

When someone chooses to not vaccinate, they are putting not just themselves, but others at risk. While some may argue philosophy about personal freedoms, COVID-19 is a real and logistical problem that has already killed 600K Americans. This isn't a discussion about choosing to get vaccinated, it's about actually getting vaccinated in order to save lives.

With every step and turn he has made since he took the oath of office, President Biden has demonstrated great courage, restraint, calmness and understanding.  He finally had enough, especially since the F.D.A. fully approved the Pfizer vaccine, and has taken off the gloves.

Those that put up a fight are the extremists and will matter less as when the numbers reflect fewer cases and a lowering impact on health services, more will concede the obvious.  Those that, due to medical reasons, cannot tolerate getting vaccinated will always be a problem; but, they are the very few.  Those that resist on religious grounds, hopefully, will concede when the numbers illustrate the logic and their priests and shamans tell them to do it.  They are the sheep and will follow.  Wave a few snakes and mumble incoherently and get jabbed.  

Regardless of the resistance of the obtuse and political gamesters, Biden's taking a stand will result in the numbers dropping and, unfortunately, the Republicans screaming treason and the like.

The current administration got off to a bad start on COVID-19 when candidate Harris said she would not take a vaccine developed by Trump.  Through Operation Warp Speed, we got not 1, but 3 highly effective vaccines.  Let’s put them to good use!

If President Biden would like to have at least 80% of eligible persons in the USA vaccinated, put Messrs. Donald Trump and Kanye West in charge of the operation and it is a ""done deal.""  Remember over 74 million people voted for Trump, and he still holds a lot sway among those voters.

That means that our scientific community has confidence that the vaccine helps protect the person vaccinated, but not the people around them. Therefore, logic dictates that the person receiving the shot is doing so to protect themselves - not others.

Everyone, including the vaccinated, is able to spread the Delta variant (which is the most common variant in the US).

If people are choosing not to get the shot, they are risking their own lives, which is their decision.

It' also sets a dangerous legal president for individual privacy and the right to control your own body.  Gone is the ""my body my choice"" argument for pro-choice.

We've been through this sort of nonsense with smoking, with wearing seatbelts so it shouldn't be any surprise that personal freedom is used again as a red herring for fighting a mandate to get vaccinated.  I agree it's a personal choice but not when your choice to remain unvaccinated, perhaps not wear a mask (for the same reason), can lead to another person's death or severe illness.  

We have the tools to fight this off.  This is not the Black Plague that devastated Europe.  If it were far more of us would be dead by now.  Biden is attempting to do what Trump and the GOP didn't:  protect as many Americans as possible from COVID-19 and variants.

Its impossible for OSHA to enforce it. 
Its not legal."
2021-09-10 19:35:10,"I think that Pres. Biden is being very canny with this mandate.  For years, and certainly within the past couple of election cycles, the Republicans have used manufactured outrage as their prime tool of persuasion and voter mobilization.  For those who are impressed with such tactics, the endless red-faced bluster has been very effective.

Most Democrats have striven to maintain a tone of moderation in the face of this continual pose of outrage, but since the opposition is so invested in a strategy of ""never compromise, win at all costs,"" calm words and assertions of scientific findings have led to inaction and an appearance of weakness.

Pres. Biden's use of pre-existing OSHA law and regulations seems, to my untutored eye, well-founded and directly aimed at confronting the hotheaded bullies on the other side of the aisle.  Since it's pointless to try to avoid ""shredding the social fabric further,"" as some commenters have complained, when the other side is using that tactic as their main selling point, Pres. Biden has chosen an approach that should win in the courts, and will demonstrate to the people who voted for him that he is willing to use the legal power given him to protect the entire country."
2021-09-10 19:44:39,"Unfortunately all this has been politicized, so no reasonable arguments are to be expected.

Almost all school districts in the nation require kids to have certain vaccines - for the good of the community. I still don't understand why COVID would be any different for kids 12+ and all school personnel.

Employers have always been able to require vaccines - some just did not want to issue COVID directives on their own until some precedent would be set by the Feds. This provides them with air cover for the anticipated yelling and screaming to come.

Many work places have required COVID vaccines due to cramped conditions - look at the military; remember the outbreaks we had on battle ships?

All this is political mumbo jumbo - Cruz and DeSantis cry ""Freedom!"" while some of their constituents are dying and hospitals, again, are getting flooded and overwhelmed.

Unless we reach critical mass with vaccinations, I think 90% or more, our economy will not be recovering. 

We will see well off knowledge workers making more money from home, and many of the fast food, restaurant, and service workers permanently teetering on the brink of poverty. Basically two societies, living side by side, with ever increasing income disparities."
2021-09-10 20:03:53,"President Biden reminds me of someone with a very, very long fuse.  He will wait and wait and hope that what needs to be done will happen, that folks will understand and get it.  

However, if progress isn't made his patience eventually runs thin and then we see ""Boxer Biden"" enter the ring and take command and control of the situation.

President Biden is NOT abusing his power like his predecessor did on a daily basis, but rather extending his power to keep ALL Americans safe and healthy and out of harm's way as much as possible.

It takes a great deal of courage and strength to go the distance he continues to go.  And yes, I DO and have felt I was always in ""grave danger"" every time I entered a place in which I know vaccines were NOT mandated.

Thank you President Biden.  I can finally take a deep sigh of HUGE relief from this decision and action."
2021-09-10 20:05:52,"A mandate to be vaccinated cannot be the only method of bringing the virus under control. It will create more social unrest than public health safety. Partner the order with the guarantee that every one homeless (a large number of people after the recent climate disasters) has a safe place to live. Reinstate rent subsidies, so no one else becomes newly homeless. Extend unemployment payments so that families won't go hungry. Implement Medicare for All immediately to address the costs of COVID and long haulers disease. 

Most importantly, respond quickly and effectively where children are dying of COVID.  These measures will definitively bring about a quicker end of the impact of the virus. In addition, if the government mandating vaccines addresses people's needs, people would be more likely to comply, and it may even restore some modicum of faith in their government. 

Our government overwhelmingly chooses to enrich corporations and mostly refuses to fund basic human needs while people suffer and die. If you add an aggressive mandate to vaccinate to the mix, the order will create deeper divides without social support. Generously providing people with the resources they need will counteract the backlash."
2021-09-10 20:01:43,"I wouldn't generally support a mandate, however it's become clear that the unvaccinated people who catch covid, particularly the delta variant, are becoming a strain on the health care system.

In Houston, hospitals are having difficulties treating people who are suffering from accidents or chronic conditions because the unvaccinated folks who caught covid are hogging up the resources. The survival rate is high and I'm sure they pat themselves on the back for taking a stand, but it comes at the expense of everyone else.

I have no doubt that my health insurance rates will also be going up this year, much thanks to the unvaccinated receiving health care instead of taking an hour out of their day to get a shot that has proven itself easily with the rates of hospitalization for those vaccinated.

If somebody wants to quit their job in the name of ""liberty and freedom"", go right ahead. I could care less. They can protest as righteously as they want while normal society goes back to normal. It's sad to see so many adults behave as stubborn children."
2021-09-10 20:40:04,"I'm pro-vaccine and a Biden voter, but this is wrong - everyone should have control over their own medical decisions. Once upon a time that was a liberal position.

Everyone is saying this is different because the unvaccinated are harming the vaccinated. But how true is that? Studies I found (possibly outdated) say vaccines are 90% effective at preventing illness and 60% effective at preventing you from carrying the virus. So being vaccinated myself, I'm already 90% protected. I don't feel the need to abridge people's rights to get up to 96%. (That math is probably oversimplified, but this is the kind of conversation we should be having.)

Since the unvaccinated are using more hospital resources, they should pay higher insurance premiums. That is a less coercive solution than making vaccination a condition of employment."
2021-09-10 20:44:21,"A good friend of mine needs surgery to replace his pacemaker. It's scheduled, then the hospital fills with COVID patients and needs to be rescheduled. This has been going on for three months and he may not survive to his October appointment. Tens of thousands of people have died because their routine health care has been disrupted."

Just get the shot people.  Get vaccinated and get it done.  It's easy and it's the right thing to do.  I have been fully vaccinated since May 2021 and the days I got my shots were empowering and made me proud to be an American and New York Tough. 

Getting the shot is OUR only SHOT to getting back to some version of NORMAL.   I want NORMAL and have totally lost patience with the anti-vaxxers, the evangelicals, QAnon and all the other idiots (including members of my own family) who see that getting vaccinated violates their 'personal freedom.""

It's about 1/3rd of the US soldiers killed in Afghanistan in 20 years! Make no mistake, the vast majority of these deaths were absolutely preventable!!! The faction that fights against science, health and a return to life is causing American deaths on a grand scale. They are doing it in the name of a rhetorical freedom which in actuality is an argument for a right to kill and maim however they want on a scale far beyond the reach of any active shooter. They are acting  against our country. The are acting in an anti-American, anti-social, psychotic manner.

2021-09-10 20:34:13,"Sure, thousand of children may suffer painful and needlessly agonizing deaths as a direct result of Republicans exercising their ""personal freedom"" - but it's a price they're more than willing to pay.

I'd like to see a bunch of photos of these Republicans denouncing this mandate, next to photos of kids on ventilators in hospital beds all over the country, with the caption, ""Sometimes the tree of liberty must be needlessly refreshed from time to time with the blood of innocent children!"".

Because that blood is on their hands. And the responsibility for 98% of all current Covid deaths is on their heads. Theirs and everyone else out there who could have gotten a vaccination, but didn't.

Every once in a while those torches of theirs touch a home, and the home catches fire with COVID. Enough.

And, Hey! My sincere ""thoughts and prayers"" go to medical insurance companies and the attorneys for hospitals; start passing the basket in a VERY big way, charging anti-vaxxers thousands of dollars more per year if they refuse to get the shot(s) based on their pathetic disregard for science."
2021-09-10 19:31:23,What's amazing is the GOP has become so dysfunctionally reliant on misinformation and anti-science that they don't even know how to save themselves from a pandemic when demonstrably effective vaccines are sitting right in front of them.  That's not a political party; that's a cult.
2021-09-10 21:07:43,"There was great opposition to masks and social distancing, and no vaccines, during the Spanish flu epidemic, too. The outcomes proved that those who opposed it suffered more deaths. But at that time, nobody knew much about the flu.

History will record its astonishment and disdain for how so many have undermined and ruined the US during Trump and his aftermath all in the name of lies, fakery and grabs for power and dollars. Biden waited until he couldn't wait any longer before these strong measures were taken. The pandemic has been extended for months if not years thanks to DeSantos and his minions. DeSantos plans to be the next president. He will if he succeeds in letting the pandemic extinguish enough millions. These deaths are his doing, and no one else's."
2021-09-10 20:27:41,"I don’t see how Republicans and the fearmongers at Fox can honestly protest this after getting all those abortion restrictions passed. It’s the same move. Deny the right to bodily autonomy in the interest of “saving lives”, and make the person seeking (or in this case not seeking) a procedure have to jump through hoops with extra tests, money, mandates and overall effort. The end result for both is the same; cornering people into a desired behavior or outcome that can’t be directly achieved through legislation. 

Seems like when it comes to women’s bodies, it’s the will of god, but it when it comes to everyone’s bodies (meaning men too) then god forbid? 

Well done Biden for flipping that script!"

2021-09-10 20:18:34,"Just to correct some lies:

Death toll from COVID in the US was at 600k before vaccines were widely available.  Now it's slightly higher.

Vaccine mandates should be viewed in light of death rate today, which is very low.  In fact, deaths are almost exclusively from non-vaccinated.

So saying mandates protect vaccinated from non-vaccinated is dishonest.  Unless someone wants to admit that the vaccines just don't work.

Regardless, Democrats of 2021 are now the Republicans of 2001, intent upon the construction of a super-state with infinitely safe systems.

Same mistake, different party this time."
2021-09-10 20:20:36,"In addition, how about the 1904 ruling by the Supreme Court; Jacobson v Massachusetts, 197 U.S, 11, in which the Court upheld that the state has the authority to compel compulsory vaccinations.

This was upheld in Zucht v King (1922) which held that a school system can refuse admission to a student who refuses to be vaccinated.

These precedents, which have not been overturned have been relied on to uphold government required face mask and stay-at-home orders.

This is the unrefuted law.  Why are we wasting time with all these spurious lawsuits filed by DeSantis and others?  The issue has been decided.  Let’s move on with protecting public health."
2021-09-10 20:55:45,"Whether you are pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine, you should be wary of a power grab such as this. Those who may get the illusion of safety from this, may find that the power is used later in ways they abhor. But the precedent will have been established. The Patriot Act made Americans feel safer for a brief time, but it also had negative repercussions that are being felt today. To those who want the president to be able to issue these mandates, I say be careful what you wish for because you might just get it — in unanticipated future consequences."
2021-09-10 20:58:51,"The current politicization of the battle against Covid has many Republicans on the wrong side.  It's
understandable where they are coming from; only one vaccine has full FDA approval; mRNA vaccines are novel, and they have only been widely used for under a year.  Sometimes, side effects take a while to manifest themselves, and sometimes medical science, even opinions held by the large majority, get it wrong.

That said, the pandemic is a dangerous enemy, which threatens all our lives and the fabric of society itself. The only effective tool is herd immunity, likely through vaccination with periodic boosters.

It is wrong to be self righteous, and foolish to display certainty in an uncertain situation. But vaccine mandates are the way to go, perhaps with the alternative of frequent testing and a strongly enforced mask mandate. The governors mouthing off about individual rights are inappropriate; we all have the right to avoid unnecessary exposure to a dangerous pathogen.

There is one thing that shouldn't be forgotten. The politicization of our response to the pandemic did not begin with the right, it began on the left. During the early months of the pandemic progressive media applauded widespread protests against racism. 1200 self-designated public health experts circulated a notorious but widely publicized petition endorsing mass protests, with yelling and close contacts.

Like some right leaning governors today, many on the left disregarded the reality of the pandemic."

If any country's citizens have shown in the last few years that they can't be trusted to make intelligent decisions on their own it is the U.S.  But relying on a law designed to protect employees from ""grave dangers"" at the workplace as the legal basis for these mandatory vaccines is dubious.  Obviously, the statute was designed only to protect persons from dangers that arise from and are attributable to the workplace, like rules to prevent workers working near a blast furnace from getting hurt.  It was not designed to protect workers from conditions that are just as dangerous outside the work place as they are in the work place.   That's why there are no OSHA rules on smoking in the workplace."

Local measures such as quarantine, safety policies, and public health advisories have their places in established law, and do not pertain to this Presidential action.

If this is allowed to stand, the precedent set has many ominous implications. Will a forced vaccination be next? How would that be enforced? Military authority? 

I bring up these questions as a vaccinated individual, yet feel that this mandate brings up a number of issues legally, and ethically that need to be discussed and pondered by the American public before the consequences are realized."

I am 71.5 years old, fully vaccinated (as well in full possession of all my mental faculties for those who would seek to demean me) & proactively keeping track of the time until I can get the booster. 

Never, in my lifetime, (especially in the late 1950s/early 60s when I stood in line with classmates to get yearly polio vaccines) have I witnessed such opposition to actions that are solely in the public interest -(that's vaccinations against dread disease for those who are too dense, too trump, too oppositional defiant to see the handwriting on the wall.)  I no longer have any sympathy, any concern at all for those who continue to  invite the pandemic pestilence into our lives, our homes, our schools. My only concern is to prevent them from sickening (literally, as they have already done so figuratively) me and those whom I care about."
2021-09-10 20:48:58,"I am vaxed and from a scientific perspective, believe this rule would save lives, etc. However, from a legal and ethical perspective I have serious qualms about the rule. If the Feds can force you get vaxed  for Covid, what other medical decisions can they force on you if it may help prevent others from being harmed? Should you be forced to get a flu vaccination every year? Should you be forced to undergo mental health evaluations since those with mental health issues often harm others? The question is what defines ""grave danger"". It seems to me that if Biden wants to expand a law this dramatically he should go to Congress and have them pass a law."

The water kept rising and the man had to go to the second floor of his house. As he looked out the window, he saw a man in a motor boat come by. The man in the boat invited him to get in because he had come to rescue him. The man in the house said, ""No, thanks, I'm waiting for God to rescue me.""

The waters kept on rising. Soon the man was forced to climb up onto his roof. A helicopter flew by, and a man inside lowered a rope and shouted down for the stranded man to climb up the rope.

But the man still wouldn't get in. He just said, ""No, thanks, I'm waiting for God to rescue me.""

Eventually, the flood waters rose above the house rooftop, and the man drowned. When he got to Heaven, he asked God why He didn't rescue him from drowning when he had had perfect faith.

Our vaccinated senior citizens are at high risk from the unvaccinated.  
Our children cannot be vaccinated. 

George Washington mandated vaccinations
George Bush also mandated vaccinations 
Joe Biden is absolutely doing the right thing."
2021-09-10 21:33:39,"I don't know why this is even debatable. Pandemic requires a unity of action and should override everything, while pandemic is in effect, not forever. A handful in a million have dubious negative reaction of the vaccines but that should be a small percentage we can deal with.  Really they say we only need 80-90% participation. The current 50% is gonna keep this virus alive forever, is that what we want? Am tired of wearing this mask and avoid crowdy places, 'cuz the writing is on wall, is up to all of us whether this ends early or drags on forever. Biden is right, enough already."
2021-09-10 21:20:43,"It’s not a vaccine mandate.  It’s a mandated choice between getting a vaccination or getting tested every week. Or quitting your job.  Lots of choices; no jack-booted government thugs coming in the dark of night to haul us from our beds.  The Republicans’ hysterical nonsense about robbing us of freedom and liberty was as predictable as flies on a cow.  And if a majority of voting Americans are vaccinated and impatient with the vaccine “hesitant,” then the Republicans are once again inflaming a minority of voters in another effort to stall or halt sound public policy.  It won’t work for them."
2021-09-10 21:37:57,"President Biden is right. And it's very clear that this kind of mandate was not used before, simply because a pandemic like this din't happen before. OSHA is a great institution. Long live President Biden!"
2021-09-10 21:55:56,"I wonder how many preventable deaths the Republicans feel this ""personal freedom"" of theirs is worth? 100,000? 200,000? 500,000? 1,000,000? 330,000,000? 7.9 billion?

It seems to me that the Republicans are so entrenched on this issue that they would be willing to let every human being on the planet die before they would give up on this.

Little wonder, considering that they were willing to trade ""campaign contributions"" in exchange for a livable planet."
2021-09-10 22:08:22,One should have the choice of either being vaccinated or wearing an n95 while indoors at work. Vaccines are not harmless. Masks are. We should be able to choose.
2021-09-10 21:43:32,"Laws protect us from one another, from stupidity,  and from dangers.  This mandate for vaccinations is no different.  We have many protections by several federal agencies and by state laws:

1) Wear prescribed color reflective vests when hunting, working in a high traffic or a construction zone,

2) Wear helmets or hard hats in construction zones, while riding motorcycles, when bicycling under the age of 14,

3) Prohibition against child labor,

4) Outdoor work stoppage when the heat index rises above a certain point for a time frame....in many places after one hour of 100 degrees,

5) Accessible restrooms, entrances for disabled in public buildings, transportation, and marketplaces,

6) Interpretive services, live or captioned, for governmental information output,

7) Wear seat belts and don't use communications devices while driving,

8) Smallpox, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and tetanus vaccinations.....oh, yes, and covid, also.  Tuberculosis testing. Did I miss anything?

Stay safe, stay healthy!"
2021-09-10 21:55:38,"IF using OSHA to force Covid-19 vaccinations somehow magically stands up in court it pushes the financial obligations for treatment of adverse reactions to the vaccine onto employers through workman's comp. 

The elitist snobs in this country need to realize that 63% of workers live paycheck to paycheck. Over 33 million Americans also do not get paid sick leave. Others may have been forced to use all their paid sick leave earlier in the year.

Like many people I have anecdotal evidence from friends and families experiences that some of them were wiped out for 1 or more days after getting the vaccine and couldn't work. Other people had different reactions. I was lucky enough to not have any significant reactions.

How are struggling working class Americans supposed to make ends meet if they have an adverse reaction? 

Who is going to pay those bills when the freedom of choice is taken away?"
2021-09-10 21:20:18,"Let's be clear - regardless of political leanings, the only reason we are still having a conversation about COVID in the U.S. is because of the anti-vax and anti-mask population (and all of the associated misinformation) as the vaccine is safe and widely available. The unvaccinated population is overwhelmingly the population that is (1) spreading COVID, (2) filling up hospitals, and (3) dying of COVID. It's perplexing that the anti-vaxers and anti-maskers are the same people that complain about lockdowns and mask mandates when THEY are the reason for the lockdowns and mandates -- 100% absurdity."
2021-09-10 21:42:33,"Can some of the people commenting here get some legal things straight? This isn't a matter of constitutional law. It's a matter of whether the president, as the chief executive officer empowered to enforce federal law, has the authority that he asserts he has under the OSHA statutes and regulations.￼  That is not a matter of constitutional law; it's a matter of statutory interpretation.￼"
2021-09-10 22:05:32,"Commenters who claim that Biden's mandate is illegal are effectively saying that they not only have a right to go to work unvaccinated, they have a right to refuse to be tested for coronavirus.

The extraordinary thing is that these commenters believe that the Federal judiciary is going to support this position in a situation where 656,000 people have already died, and the number of deaths is increasing daily. The judiciary is as likely to support their position as it did the claims that the November election was fraudulent.

Some of these commenters also appear to believe that the U.S. is at an acceptable level of full vaccination, despite the fact that U.S. vaccination is currently behind 41 other countries.

Then there are the ones who claim that the rates of new cases, hospitalizations and deaths are acceptable, apparently oblivious to the much lower rates in Canada and several major countries in Europe.

2021-09-10 22:10:57,"Someone please explain to me how in God’s name can the polls show Biden losing ground on his defense of the virus. How can Republicans not be blamed for the rise?  It’s mostly Republicans in the hospitals.  Republicans dying.  Republicans shunning vaccines and masks. It is  Republican politicians, mostly governors in the south ( South Dakota) who are causing the spread by not instigating the basic scientific evidence that we know limits the spread. This problem is the result of the unvaccinated.  And 90% of the unvaccinated ARE REPUBLICANS!"

2021-09-10 21:22:59,"98% of all Covid deaths that have occurred since vaccines were made widely available are the result of some Republican exercising their ""personal freedom"".

Who can justify the deaths of over 150,000 people as being a reasonable cost of personal expression?

Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis (Gov. Florida), Greg Abbott (Gov. Texas), Brian Kemp (Gov. Georgia), Asa Hutchinson (Gov. Arkansas), Laura Kelly (Gov. Kansas), Kim Reynolds (Gov. Iowa), Mark Gordon (Gov. Wyoming), Greg Gianforte (Gov. Montana), Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Kevin Cramer, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson, and every other Republican who opposes mask and vaccine mandates, that's who.

And if these people feel that 150,000 deaths isn't too high a price to pay in exchange for the ""freedom"" to not wear a mask or get a vaccine, then why would 330,000,000? Or 7.9 billion for that matter. For them, your ""right"" to not get a vaccine is more important than the lives of every human being on the planet."
2021-09-10 21:32:33,"It is all about wanting Biden to fail. If people get vaccinated and the economy recovers, Biden is a respected President. The Republicans don't want to see that so they're not promoting getting vaccinated and can say what a 'bad job"" Biden is doing managing the pandemic. Sad thing is that voters who are believing that the Republicans care about them - they don't realize they're pawns.  So horrible."
2021-09-10 22:20:36,Biden's action is so obviously necessary and I salute his courage.  It is a given these days that the reactionary GOP will object but I wonder if SCOTUS will also cast common sense aside.  Nothing would surprise me. I am so ready to rein in these pseudo philosopher kings.

The Supreme Court met “virtually” last year to hear oral arguments and this year when their sessions begin the first Monday in October it will be for lawyers and staff only.The public is not invited-vaccinated or not! The Supreme Court takes their own protection from Covid very seriously-are you so sure, Republicans, that they will say no one else deserves the same protection they have and will rule for “freedom” from masks and “freedom” from mandates?They would look pretty foolish sitting there masked and protected from the public and making a judgment that no one else has a right to be protected!"
2021-09-10 22:07:16,"Evidently there are no lawyers among Republicans, because the right of the government to have vaccine mandates is well-settled constitutional law.

In Jacobsen v. Massachusetts the Supreme Court by 7-2 upheld a smallpox vaccine mandate:

""[I]n every well ordered society charged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand. ...
 ""Real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own [liberty], whether in respect of his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be done to others.""

The Supreme Court reaffirmed its smallpox vaccine decision 1922 when it held that a school could refuse to admit an unvaccinated child, and in numerous other cases upheld the principle in the original case as a proper exercise of the police power. 

There is no doubt that with over half a million dead, hospitals overwhelmed, and cases rising that the federal government has the police power to issue vaccine mandates, and has had it for over one hundred years."

2021-09-10 22:35:59,Most Covid deaths so far have been among those beyond working age.  Could there be a means of denying social security benefits to those who refuse to be vaccinated?
2021-09-10 22:13:26,It's interesting that Biden only issues a mandate for employed people but not for unemployed and welfare recipients. He controls those benefits but chooses not to. Why?

Inoculation may have been done in China, ca 1500s.  In modern times, Utilitarian ethics certainly were the spirit of development of the smallpox vaccine. 
In the mid 1800s, infant vaccination was compulsory in England, although out of favor by the early 1900s.

I am all for everyone who is eligible getting vaccinated.  I think they should.  I think businesses should be able to require their employees to be vaccinated, if the business pays for it, or get tested weekly.  

But, this is beyond the Pale and across the Rubicon for me.  The government is demanding that the citizenry undergo a medical procedure.  So, what other medical procedure could  be mandated by the needs of the economy?  How about birth control or mandatory psycho-actives to keep women in the workforce (50% of all American pregnancies are unintended) and the depressed and anxious on task?  How about we all have to get RFIDS so the boss can track our movements for maximum economic efficiency?  

If this stands, we might as well rename it the ""Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Realm,"" which we all remember by its shorter sobriquet:  the Enabling Act of 1933."

Also it was never required or rather forced on anyone to inject something they did not want into their bodies. I wish people would knock it off with the Republicans say and the GOP does and the right is whatever This is not a political decision so plenty of democrats have also voiced concern for not wanting the shot.

Why on Earth do Republican governors and other ‘conservative politicians’ encourage their own constituents to do things that will make them seriously ill or kill them — including ingesting toxic substances they claim to be ‘miracle cures’ — when a few very simple, painless and virtually risk-free measures can save their lives?

I think they don't love freedom or life, they just hate liberals, and being anti-liberal no matter the reason is what they are for.

2021-09-10 23:16:50,"Denial of Federal funding to require all health care facilities to require vaccination for all workers allowed inside is a good idea and definitely the right thing to do. It should however not have been needed. The other motivation for health care providers is that allowing unvaccinated workers in the door is now a violation of the usual standard of care. Therefore ANY nosocomial infection stemming from an unvaccinated person employed inside a health care facility is malpractice on its face. In fact all health care facilities should already be requiring proof of vaccination to enter, except for emergency patients,  in addition to requiring an N95 mask or equivalent (providing one if needed), not the cloth bandanas some people use to show compliance without actually wearing an effective mask. Zones inside facilities where immune-compromised patients are treated should have already been doing this."

80 plus deaths today in SC - the highest number since the pandemic began - including people less than 64 years old; a few children this week as well.

I wonder what McMaster and the others of his ilk think the “gates of hell” look like.  Certainly he won’t be knocking on death’s door - just his and the other’s constituents.  What is wrong with these so-called leaders?"

2021-09-10 22:39:38,"It is outrageous that President Biden would have to resort to OSHA regulations to combat an obvious threat to national security.
I am saddened that so many Americans, including governors, fail to see how urgent it is to limit this pandemic and take the battle to the virus.
I’m a Baby Boomer, born nearly ten years after WW2, so I did not live through that national crisis. However, my perception of the nation’s response to a national emergency that took over 400,000 American lives over the course of four years, is totally different from what I see now in a national emergency that has taken 650,000 (and counting) American lives over fewer than 2 years.
Back then, we came together as a nation to defeat an  obvious threat to the nation. Americans did whatever was needed to help the war effort & take the battle to the enemy. People didn’t resist rationing because they considered it an infringement on their personal freedom. Even conscientious objectors served noncombat and civilian roles to help protect their fellow citizens.  Those whose objections were so strong that they would not assist the war effort in any way were willing to go to prison over their beliefs.
Not so, now.
Today, the nation is unable to come together against an enemy that has killed more Americans than WW II, Korea, Vietnam , Iraq, and Afghanistan combined. 
Politics and egos mist be put aside so we can defeat this foe.

It would be a lot more effective."
2021-09-10 22:37:34,This winter is shaping up to be an awful one in the pandemic. Casualties now at the end of summer are 1500 per day. Everything that can be done to get US citizens vaccinated must be done. The first crisp days of autumn are what the virus thrives on. There just is not time for philosophical debate. Winter is coming.
2021-09-10 23:20:59,"Currently some 24 states have vaccination mandates, primarily for employees in healthcare and long-term care settings.  With the federal mandates, I have to wonder how soon it will be before other states adopt them and are legally challenged in doing so. Although the federal government can mandate vaccines for federal workers and contractors and many corporations through OSHA (with the required exemptions) as is pointed out in the column, it has no legal authority to do so for general state populations. That authority is enshrined for the states themselves.

And while the legitimacy of compulsory vaccination by a state is considered ""settled law,"" largely because of two US Supreme Court precedents and lower court rulings over more than a century, there is some concern that this SCOTUS is a ""wild card"" when it comes to the doctrine of stare decisis or, the obligation to be guided by precedent, despite Justice Coney Barrett refusing to block Indiana University's vaccine mandate last month."
2021-09-10 22:43:34,Ignore those governors. They are extremely partisan and they have no chance of winning in a true court of law. They are only interested in pleasing their non thinking constituents and hurting the economy and the Biden Administration. Those governors should not be governing.
2021-09-10 23:19:28,"OK, here's a reasonable compromise:

Treat unvaccinated people just like smokers, i.e. the risk of them spreading the virus is analogous to the risks posed by second-hand smoke.  

Thus, any state and federal regulations that impose restrictions about where people are allowed to smoke should apply to unvaccinated people (as long as they're exhaling).  In other words, if you're not allowed to smoke in a restaurant, on a subway, in an office building, in a shopping mall, on an airplane, in movie theaters, etc., then you're not allowed to go into those places unless you're vaccinated.  (Well, just like smokers, you're allowed to go into them as long as you don't exhale; you'll have to step outside for an exhalation break to do that.)

If your state allows public places to have a separate smoking section, then they can also set up a separate section for unvaccinated people (as long as it's downwind to protect the vaccinated customers).  You're allowed to use public transportation for as long as you can go without the need to exhale.

You're free to kill yourself by smoking if you wish; but we have regulations that protect other people from being killed because of your desire to smoke.  We can do the same for people who choose to be unvaccinated."
2021-09-10 23:02:02,"As Commander-in-Chief, President Biden has the responsibility to protect the country from foreign invasion.  The virus qualifies.

2021-09-10 23:40:50,"If it's not about personal freedom, then I suspect the same argument could be used to enforce virtually any kind of mandate related to climate change. Perhaps personal freedom as we once knew it is a thing of the past. Even in the West."
2021-09-10 23:40:47,"I like the health insurance angle discussed earlier.  Smokers pay increased premiums for insurance, because they end up more likely with cancer, emphysema, etc.   Other behaviors can increase your risks, and are candidates for increased rates. Why not unvaccinated?  For one, they are more likely to be hospitalized, more likely to end up  intubated, in ICU. etc.  Impose this and see what it does to vaccination rates."

2021-09-10 22:52:27,"The seminal case in public health law is Jacobson v Massachusetts, in which the Supreme Court ruled in a 7-2 decision that Massachusetts had the power to mandate vaccination. The ruling relates to state, not federal, authority, but the rationale is something that completely escapes those who assert that vaccination is a purely ‘personal’ decision and mandatory vaccination an unwarranted violation of liberty. 

Jacobson was decided in 1905. It is neither new nor the product of the ‘activist’ Warren Court or of the era of ‘big government’’. The rationale was simple: the interest in personal liberty overridden by mandatory vaccination is outweighed by the public’s interest in stopping the spread of a serious infectious disease. In the Court’s words, “Under the principle of self-defense, of paramount necessity, a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.” 

The personal decision view would be correct if vaccination protected only the vaccinated individual. As Jacobson states, that is plainly not the case. 

I understand that whether President Biden has the authority under OSHA to issue a federal mandate is a separate issue. Still, the concern about abuse of Presidential power is ironic for a party that turned a blind eye to countless expansions of Presidential authority by his predecessor, who claimed more than once that “Article II allows me to do whatever I want.”"

Which was untrue, it would be hard if not impossible to find a situation where he acted against a court order.

Biden seems to have no regard for the law. The Supreme Court clearly indicates something is illegal, legal scholars nearly unanimously agree and Biden agrees with them yet moves forward anyway espousing a logic that ehh well it’ll take some time for the law to catch up to my decision…the CDC dealing with landlords getting rent and now OSHA deciding what nearly every business in the country MUST do. Is there no limits to his power? Vaccines are readily available. Not everyone will take them. Some will die. That is life. Based on Biden’s own words yesterday vaccinated people are safe; he said this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Cigarettes kill, drinking kills, yet we leave those decisions to the individual. This is ridiculous. No one every assumed every person would choose to get vaccinated. 75% needs to be enough."
2021-09-11 00:02:24,"In our state, our governor imposed a vaccine mandate for all state employees, and the time is rapidly approaching for all of us to be vaccinated or lose their jobs. I am appalled at the number of state employees, even in departments whose mission is caring for the vulnerable, willing to lose their jobs instead of getting a vaccine. They had to be vaccinated when they were young, before they could even go to school. They have other requirements to live in a society and protect those around them--no smoking in indoor places, wearing seat belts, stopping at stop signs. Not sorry, I have no sympathy for those willing to put the lives of others at risk."
2021-09-11 00:03:10,"The President is doing the right thing. 

I live in a county where the overall vaccination rate is 42%. The adjacent county has an overall vaccination rate of over 60%. The number of deaths in our county is 33 while the number of deaths in the adjacent county is 92, and yet that county is at least 10 times larger, population-wise. 

Vaccinations and mask wearing are the bottom line here. One county makes fun of both while the other one is generally on board with both."
2021-09-10 23:50:27,"Had this attitude of Republican governors prevailed in the earlier part of the 20th century – diseases like smallpox, and later typhoid, the measles, and polio would have continued to decimate US populations.

President Biden has acted in both a compassionate and rational manner responding to the international crisis at hand– the Covid 19 pandemic– with determinative action anchored in science. President Biden is placing the public health above partisan politics and by doing so is unquestionably fulfilling his ethical obligation as president to act in defense of the United States and her people.

The GOP governors on the other hand are acting with gross negligence. Their anti-vaxx stance has nothing to do with freedom or states rights, and everything to do with willfull ignorance, partisan politics, and self-aggrandizement. These governors are placing their state's economies and their citizen's lives at risk. Further they are placing the populations of neighboring states at risk too because the Covid19 virus doesn't care about state boundaries or party politics. Such reprehensible and morally bankrupt behavior by these GOP governors should be called out for what it is: criminally negligent, defined as conduct by a person who ignores obvious risk and disregards the life and safety of those around him. They want to sue Biden over a vaccine  mandate. People in those states like Texas should sue their governors for criminal negligence."
2021-09-10 23:41:30,"I thought that the eviction moratorium was clearly overstepping authority granted to the Federal government. This is very different and skillfully deployed. At the least it provides political cover to employers who've really wanted to have a workforce vaccine mandate but been afraid of the right wing blowback. And in the best case it'll survive constitutional muster and anyone in a job interacting with others will be vaccinated. With 75% of adults already vaccinated it's obvious where the majority is on this. And the minority doesn't have the right to make workplaces demonstrably less safe for the immunocompromised to exercise their ""bodily autonomy"" while trying to take that very right away from all women including rape and incest victims."

2021-09-10 23:52:17,"I am hard pressed to see how this is not fully within the government's power.  I think the matter was settled in 1905 in Jacobson v. Massachusetts, when the SCOTUS held that Massachusetts was well within its rights to mandate smallpox vaccines, and fine the recalcitrant $5 if they refused to get them.  It's not much of a leap from there to where we are today."
2021-09-10 23:57:47,"The data is clear that the vaccines work and that unvaccinated people continue to infect others.

I guess Senator Toomey doesn’t consider 650,000 dead a health emergency.

As for “dubious legality”, I invite  Senator to read the text of the OSHA legislation passed in 1970, with bipartisan support, that was signed into law by President Nixon.

There were thirteen major congressional objectives for this legislation, here’s number 7:

Senator, are you prepared to argue that COVID19 does not diminish health, functional capacity, or life expectancy?

Good luck with that argument.

Those who imagine there is always a drug that can control an infection seem unaware of bacterial and viral resistance to some drugs.
People can generally refuse specific medical treatments, but that does not create a right for them to endanger others, as can occur when vaccination for contagious disease is refused.  If you don't have a genuine medical reason for rejyecting the vaccine, but refuse it out of fear of micro chips being implanted or other such myths being spread by some people, then your refusal of the vaccine endangers not only yourself but everyone around you.  Similarly, refusal to wear a mask endangers others as well as yourself."

Because of vaccines, I didn't have to live in a world where I stood a good chance of going into an iron lung. I didn't have to suffer that threat because my parents were freaking adults who felt a basic sense of patriotic responsibility to their fellow patriot neighbors, and because society realized that it's either vaccines for everyone or lots of a good fraction of everyone gets crippled for life.

One need to look no further than each vaccine's documentation to see that there was NEVER a claim of disease transmission reduction and/or prevention. Confusion abounds wildly because of leaders conflating disease protection, disease transmission and so on within the singular topic of vaccination.

In the past, he has given everyone a chance to get on board and help, asking over and over.  Now, its time to help as many people as he can.  So, the Republicans can help or continue to sell their “freedom “ line and kill people.   They have chosen the later.  They quickly went out and lied that Biden mandated vaccines for everyone instead of discussing the fact that businesses over 100 employees can test their employees.  

We have forgotten what it means to pull together for any reason.

It would have been easier to facilitate vaccine access for everyone who wants it, including boosters every 4 months and vaccination of all children from 2 years up, but that would have required interfering with the dysfunctional FDA and CDC.

Let hospitals decide to prioritize vaccinated over unvaccinated patients.

I don't expect that Congress will get its mojo back anytime soon. Congressional leaders of both parties today are midgets compared to so many of their forebearers. Unfortunately, a good deal of the younger members elected in recent years have even less to offer.

But if you read one of the recent New York Times morning newsletters you will see that those who are vaccinated have roughly a one in 5000 chance of getting Covid on any given day, if they do get it then it is likely to be about as serious as a mild case of the flu, and the chances of being hospitalized are about the same as being hospitalized in a car accident. In other words Biden‘s mandate is not protecting you if you are vaccinated. It is primarily protecting those who are unvaccinated and for the most part don’t want to be protected. I wish that those who are unvaccinated would get vaccinated but I don’t like the imperial overreach that I see in Biden’s mandate because I don’t believe the science shows that this will significantly improve the health of those who have been vaccinated. I instead favor economic consequences for people who are not vaccinated such as forcing them to pay for the cost of their treatment and if necessary significantly increasing their insurance premiums to cover that cost.￼ Contrary to what you think, the science seems to indicate that unvaccinated people are not much of a threat to you except in a financial sense because of the tremendous financial burden they are placing on the healthcare system.￼"
2021-09-11 01:40:01,Totally supportive of this but one would have thought the administration would have given OSHA more than a week’s notice. Now we have to wait four weeks for them to draft rules. Seems like it would have been good to have prepared for this months ago. Though I do see the risk/inevitability of the policy leaking.
2021-09-11 00:52:41,"I am grateful that President Biden demonstrated his leadership and not deterred by his Republican adversaries.

It's ironic that Republican politicians choose to defend ""pro-choice"" for anti-vaxxers to impede vaccinated people's rights to return to normal. While when it's serving their political gains, they would just go ahead and impose their will to women and minorities. It's even more ridiculous that a party tried to overthrew a legal election's result is claiming that they want to defend the rule of law. Give me a break, this level of shamelessness and lie is simply too much to handle."
2021-09-11 03:19:08,"Did anyone beside me think it was odd when President Biden said, ""We are going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated co-workers.""

If people are vaccinated, vax'd, they can be infected by a person that is not vax'd, aka Covid Positive. If the vax'd person becomes Covid Positive, he can infect other vax'd or unvax'd people. That logically flows from the president's statement.

The second selling point for the vaccine is, your symptoms will be lessened because you are vax'd. Lessened? OK. Sure. I think that leaves a lot to interpretation. But, what if the symptoms are so slight, a person could be asymptomatic?

And that leads to the fallacy of vaccine passports. If you are vax'd to the max and can be subject to a ""break through"" infection, but are asymptomatic, what good is a vax-port?

There are more than 300,000,000(and more) in the US. Today's death count is about 670,000. Or, 0.22% 

I tested positive last January and was in bed for 3 days. In August I took a Covid antibody test. Now, I've yet to find someone to interpret the results, my ""score"" was 112. I had Covid antibodies 8 months after I had Covid."
2021-09-11 02:41:02,"The bottom line is that federal messaging was so uncoordinated, incoherent, and unconvincing that about a hundred million didn't listen.
instead of fixing their messaging problem and firing some incompetent staffers, Biden chose to issue federal mandates and condescending insult a hundred million Americans.
that's not Leadership, it's abject failure.
and FYI, I personally believe everyone should be vaccinated. I just don't believe coercion is a winning strategy."
2021-09-11 03:09:18,"He solemnly swore to ""preserve, protect, and defend....""
That includes ""Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."" 
(Which most doctors believe is a bit of challenge when you die of Covid.)

Way I see it, Joe's just doing his job.

The fact that it's being politicized is a national disgrace...
and that there are people who can't understand the science, is a national embarrassment."
2021-09-11 01:45:59,"So these people need guns to protect themselves, but are up in arms about being forced to take a vaccine, which is the most effective way of protecting oneself from covid. I'm shocked by the hypocrisy..."
2021-09-11 02:00:04,"Wonder why America is in a tight spot? To wit: He's too weak. No. He's too heavy handed. No. This is an assault on freedom. No. This is just what America needs. No. So where does this leave America. 

Republican governor: ""I've done all I know how to do""... But I'll fight you if you try to do something.  How ridiculous is that! 

No matter what any President does, someone will object.  That's par for the course. (Pun not intended). He's doesn't have to satisfy every single person or every single objection... he's the President.

He decides his course of action in his view of the best interest of the country.

That's what the president is supposed to do, and that's what he's doing."
2021-09-11 00:52:28,...and every way the prior so-called president used the power of the office was just fine?!? Please!!
2021-09-11 01:03:43,"Freedom is not using your ignorance, political affiliation or religious beliefs as an excuse to potentially kill others by spreading a deadly global pandemic. Freedom is something these willfully selfish people will never grasp. 

While much of the second and third world countries wait for vaccines our entitled citizens in their comfy homes with healthcare a car ride away sit in such luxury. 

Such entitlement sickens me. 

And people wonder why this country is hated. 

This is global people and it’s unfortunate through “ Freedom “ that our contribution is such a very spoiled  one. 

Interesting that the pro-life folks get so onboard for gun and vaccination freedom yet see zero irony in that."
2021-09-11 05:49:56,"It’s about as frustrating a situation as a President can  face. All that is needed to improve life for all is to stop the pandemic and the means are available but the people who refuse to be vaccinated are spreading the disease at pandemic rates. It’s happening because the people who refuse think that solidarity against the real foe, Democrats, is the only thing which is important. So Biden cannot appeal to them."

2021-09-11 01:38:40,"Well, Trump tested the limits of how much of a tax evader, draft dodger, Putin tool, philanderer, liar, preening narcissist, anarchist, and nepotist a President can be (what did I leave out?), so why shouldn't Biden be entitled to test the limits of something that he (and the majority of Americans, based on the current 53.4% vaccinated statistic) at least perceives to be a threat to the health and welfare of the United States?"
2021-09-11 12:54:04,"It's a good idea to require vaccination. It's past time for some forceful action and Congress should have included this in their last relief bill. Now that the Pfizer vaccine has been fully approved, mandates can and should be done. Whether this is the best way to do it, I'm not sure, as there are many employers that employ less than 100 workers. But, at least it's a step in the right direction. I got my vaccination as soon as eligible and have a hard time understanding why anyone sane wouldn't."
2021-09-11 05:37:36,"I think the media would be doing a great service to the public if they would just publish an article that lays out the facts - and all of the facts, not a select few - in detail, with links to reports.

The vaccine is giving you a much better chance of staying out of the ICU. That much we know for sure. 

But you can still spread the Delta virus to someone else even if you are vaccinated. 

Breakthrough cases in vaccinated people are more prevalent now than before the Delta variant came along. Breakthrough cases can either be 1) symptomatic, or 2) asymptomatic. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic, vaccinated patients have demonstrated a viral load in their nasal passages as high as the viral load of an unvaccinated, infected person.

The problem with the vaccinated/asymptomatic carriers is that, because they are asymptomatic, they won't know they are sick (so they won't get tested), but tests show they are just as likely to carry high loads of virus as the unvaccinated:

""'People who have a Delta virus and happen to have ‘breakthrough’ infections can carry these really high levels of virus, and can unwittingly spread the virus to others,' says David O’Connor, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.""

It would be FAR better for our government, in cooperation with the media, to educate the public and stress the importance of getting the vaccine, not issue such misleading, authoritarian, unconstitutional mandates."
2021-09-11 11:20:08,"When I read the headline this came to mind:
The armed forces used to force women who got pregnant to get an abortion if they wanted to keep their job.  SCOTUS heard Roe and refused to hear this case.  Sadly.
Different, and yet comparing them presents questions, for me at least, on what I want the government to be able to mandate."
2021-09-11 10:30:11,"The logic that Mr. Biden and many others are using appears flawed, and the path to use OSHA regulatory powers to force over 100 million workers to risk complete control over their current and future health by allowing the government to force-vaccinate them with an experimental vaccine is very troubling to many people. 
This is not a conservative or liberal issue at all. During the last 20-30 years more than 40% of Americans and many others in the EU have given up on the pharmaceutically driven medical system in favor of a broad pro-active personal healthcare system that uses many alternative practices with a combination of cutting edge science and old herbal remedies that are far more affordable. People have simply given up on a medical system that dispenses steroids, anti-biotics and other perpetual symptom addressing  prescriptions sold to our MDs and pediatricians by sales people from the pharmaceutical industry.

Most people have supported a sound approach to vaccinating themselves and their children during the last 100 years. However, many, many reasonable people have begun to wonder about the rationale behind flue vaccines with less than a 48% efficacy, bundled child-hood vaccines that overload our young children's immune systems and are full of preservatives like mercury and other adjuvants with risky side-effects.

The Covid family of viruses will mutate forever, it would seem prudent to use all possible, alternative approaches, respectfully and safely."
2021-09-11 12:57:18,"Necessary steps. I have an in law who was unvaccinated and she died last week, after a month in the ICU. Her oldest son also unvaccinated is in the ICU down the hall at death's door. She was a devotee of Trump and Fox News. Nothing could persuade her to get vaccinated. They lived in an alternate reality divorced from truth and science. Only mandates will work and more and stronger steps than Biden proposed will be required."
2021-09-11 01:41:28,"Some of us are skeptical, cynical & doubtful. Not for NO reasons. But cuz what we learn from media. Whenever Our Govt decides to Decide for us without even including our consent- for what is done with [or in] Our Own living Bodies, this territory is in high dispute.

Read Words carefully in article are clear- a lot of ""believe + assume""- implied hope  claim ""yes, men have reached top political positions/ Can determine what 'the rest of us' thought belonged to us. We are also blamed, shamed & rejected  on anything not conforming /obeying. 

Addicts overdosing are not being given vaccines nor ECT  without their consent = DUI drivers get DMV ticket /have their licenses suspended= are not injected for alcoholism or endangering others fatally -continue to do same dangerous-to-others driving, repeatedly.

The actions of a prez seems to be to get power & display winnings of any variety or size - 'fake it until ...'  legal courts deny them. They want to be re-elected & pass huge taxpayer-paid bills & act solely on whims of corporate cronies'...

From bribery to blaming to mean words uttered by top guy acting arrogantly & hating on 'The American People'= who don't obey. This prez is imitating his predecessor.  He had Not obtained enough votes to mandate anything or acting as if [he were life's-victim, empathetic, kind], but suddenly puts out spiteful anger spit, hissed at public. This is divisive,frustrating act of another dictator, tho he's claiming to be in our democracy."
2021-09-11 13:36:24,"When America is under attack, presidents have wartime powers to mandate defensive actions.

2021-09-11 13:37:31,"I guess Mr Biden’s Mission Accomplished speech on July 4 was just as hollow as Pres Bush’

I guess all the blather about Pres Trump’s “blowing up norms” was just that, as Mr Biden attempts “the ultimate work around” of the law

I guess him and Ms Harris and Mr Cuomo all decrying a “Trump vaccine” was a bad call

Bottom line: if you are vaccinated you are not at risk

If you fear Covid, CDC says masks protect you. So wear two or three, maybe a face mask.

Or stay home. But leave us out of your personal risk analysis,"

2021-09-10 02:12:10,This is the proper role of federal government when 1500 people a day are dying in a preventable way and billions in revenue are being lost due to the pandemic and billions in extra healthcare costs are being spent.

2021-09-10 02:15:05,"I have no problem mandating vaccines but I truly wish there was more openness about how prevalent breakthrough infections have become. I personally know of several people fully vaccinated who got infected and even actually became quite sick.  The vaccines absolutely help serious illness and it’s insane not to get the vaccine but masks should also be mandated until this virus is under control.  There are over 150,000 people infected each day and quite a few are breakthrough infections because people think the vaccines make them invulnerable to this virus."
2021-09-10 02:15:54,"GOOD. 

I do think that even when people disagree, they respect a strong stand. Conservatives, generally, do like rules and boundaries (as long as they make them). 

Being nice was getting us nowhere anyways. And Biden needs to defend the majority who agree with this approach, rather than enabling the minority who disagree."
2021-09-10 02:23:23,"I am so frustrated by the anti vaxers, no matter what their reasoning is.  My family is fully vaccinated (some of us have underlying health issues) and we remain vigilant when in indoor spaces (wearing masks, social distancing, etc.).  What will it take to convince them?  You make your choices.  We've made ours.  I believe that companies have the right to have higher insurance rates for unvaccinated employees.  And businesses have the right to require immunization as part of employment.  If you disagree, then find a company that agrees with you.  Or move to a state that supports your rights, such as Florida or Texas."
2021-09-10 02:23:43,"I am all for mandates to get us back to normal, but we need to be sure the HRSA program for vaccine related injuries is fully funded.  

If anything was learnt in this pandemic it's that vaccines work but side effects are not zero risk.  The FDA is right to insist on additional enrollment in children's clinical trials and delay approval until the data is in."
2021-09-10 02:31:11,"The history of vaccination is one of scientific progress and bubbling enthusiasm for highly effective measures that prevent the most dire of diseases that is also closely accompanied by equally vehement obstruction and refusal. This is the reality of what occurs in highly individualistic societies: there will always be those who value their own beliefs and freedoms above the interests of their neighbors, society and even a rational calculation of personal risk and benefit. 

The solution has always been to require participation. This is one of the essential trade-offs to living in a stable society run by a functional government: there are some issues that are of such public importance that the individual must give up some simple freedoms. 

That said, I'm sure there's an island of wealthy Libertarians out there somewhere for the people who want to spend their money on escaping this essential element of civic participation."
2021-09-10 02:34:38,"What exactly are the consequences of those companies and employees who are not in compliance with this mandate?  Efforts to sway anti vaxxers to get vaccinated whether in schools or private businesses have been fruitless. What's to say that the outcome of this mandate will be any different? If anything it will stir up more animosity among those who are so vehently opposed to vaccines as violations of their personal or religious freedoms, disbelief in medical science or distrust of government intrusion in their lives."
2021-09-10 02:13:49,On day 1 of vaccine availability it should have been made mandatory. The right wing and other science deniers are proving every day that Mike Judge’s “Idiocracy” was a documentary. It’s pathetic.

Adding the speculation about how this policy connects to the President’s emotions adds a bit of sizzle but diminishes your credibility. Dial down the drama please.
2021-09-10 02:29:26,Why didn’t he do it before? Why didn’t any Democratic governors or leaders insist on or implement vaccine mandate in their states for last one and half years when thousands were dying or during elections?That time they argued against it as undemocratic way of forcing people. One probable reason behind Biden’s acting tough now is to divert attention from his weakness on Afghanistan and the fact that his administration is at the mercy of Taliban during evacuation.

2021-09-10 02:31:31,Biden has no right to take away peoples job in order to force them to get vaccinated. It should be the establishments decision weather or not their employees are required to be vaccinated. Not only is this ridiculous in principle but COVID 19 isn't nearly dangerous enough to issue a mandate for the vaccine. America will do anything to stay in control. We are on the slow but sure road to communism.

2021-09-10 02:18:40,Natural immunity is a lot better since you get exposed to more molecular patterns. The vaccine only targets a tiny subunit of the spike protein.

2021-09-10 02:32:38,"Mr. Biden said, “if those governors won’t help us beat the pandemic, I’ll use my power as president to get them out of the way.”

Good. And I hope the voters get them out the way for good. Especially Ron DeSantis.

Remember, DeSantis only won his 2018 governor's race by less than 33,000 votes (0.4%). He can be defeated in 2022."
2021-09-10 02:27:17,"Good for Pres. Biden.  The colossal selfishness of anti-vaxxers and people who refuse to wear masks makes me furious.  The vulnerability of so many sectors of our population puts them at the mercy of the ignoramuses who have followed Trump's lead.  There are some people who cannot or should not receive the vaccine for health reasons, but by far the largest group who refuse to be vaccinated are aggressive--I'll just say it--anti-fellow Americans."
2021-09-10 02:26:03,"The move will certainly raise cries of government overreach and crazy conspiracy theories from the far right, but it's the right move for public health, and the right move for the economy. And frankly, if Biden were to let the anti-vax movement and their self-serving politicians continue to stall progress on Covid, Republicans would capitalize on the economic fallout in the '22 and '24 elections."

     And our children contract Delta Covid at exponential increases, while our F.D.A. ponders on further delays to vaccinate, while children die in agony each hour.

2021-09-10 02:34:41,"Finally, Biden is using his power to issue vaccine mandates to protect “ we, the people” from the “ me, the person” selfish Republicans and anti-vaxxers who are unwilling to protect themselves, their children and everyone they come in contact with. But, why not a vaccine mandate for all interstate travel by air, bus, or rail?"

If it hadn't been developed until the last 4 months or so, the anti-vaxxers (vast majority of whom voted for Trump) would refuse to accept the polio vaccine because it occurred on Biden's watch.

Leaders make hard decisions even though they may be unpopular in some circles, when they  are for the benefit the large majority and necessary for public health. This is a public health crisis that is being fed by misinformation.  As a result of a small but significant part of the population who acts in ways detrimental to the rest of us,  including to our health, the  economy and the Nation's psyche, you had no choice; your hand was forced.

I imagine that I will go almost two and a half years without seeing my family because the unvaccinated, mask-averse masses have made air travel too risky (for me, anyway). The unvaccinated have ruined other people's lives in many ways, and this is just one small but painful example. The worst may be the trauma and stress needlessly inflicted on critical care providers over the past 17 months. I hope they see a glimmer of hope with this news."

The incompetence of the Federal and State governments in the United States has led to over 40 million cases and 654,000 deaths. People like Sherri Tenpenny are given an audience before the Ohio State Legislature to spout complete fruit loop, anti-vax conspiracy theories about vaccines causing the vaccinated to become magnetized with spoons sticking to their faces. Much of this country is being led by pathological morons and people are paying for that with their lives. Enough already."

2021-09-10 02:45:44,"We are all at the mercy of the unvaccinated, which is absurd.  Thank goodness Biden took a stand at last.  I hope public school board officials, heads of private schools, governors and others in leadership positions step up, too, and lead.  People are dying preventable deaths every day across this country and so many leaders are afraid to do the right thing.  Thank you President Biden."

2021-09-10 02:50:49,"When the patchwork, piecemeal and problematic legislation known as Obamacare passed, it polled poorly. One of the reasons for that was, although 60%+ disapproved, 30% disapproved because it wasn’t liberal enough. Instead of listening to those voices, the administration, indeed the Democratic party crawled into a corner somewhere and left the airwaves to the conservative narrative that nobody wanted government covered healthcare, that Obama was a Socialist and the “Death Panels” we’re coming for grandma. I hope, after having lived through that, President Biden learned the lesson that sometimes taking a strong position is risky, but it’s always better than the fetal."
2021-09-10 02:52:17,Great job Joe.  Enough time has been spent trying to convince the unvaccinated to do the right thing.  It is time for mandates and the force of the government.  Enough is enough

If HC workers are forced to get vaccinated it... 

“may result in exacerbating the severe work force shortage problems that currently exist.”

Well, just triage the unvaxed covid patients to the back of the line until all the surgeries and other standard medical care has been delivered. Fixed it!"

2021-09-10 02:54:12,"Yes! Finally. I have totally lost patience with people choosing to remain unvaccinated. As a person with multiple genetic underlying conditions that make me vulnerable to both acute Covid and long Covid, my safety and freedom requires herd immunity. I’ve been mostly housebound for one and a half years now, except for doctor’s appointments. During the pandemic, I have racked up one diagnosis after another, and they are all genetic. I can’t imagine living for three or more decades like this. I didn’t get to choose my genes. I have lived a healthy lifestyle, but even eating well and exercising cannot cure genetic conditions. There are many disabled/chronically ill people who are in my position, and we all want our lives back. We deserve freedom too."
2021-09-10 02:54:38,"A vital move to try to protect the nation and it's people from a deadly pandemic.  A laudable, gutsy decision by Biden! 

Look at the Times' graph of covid worldwide: the USA is the the red zone of highest contagion!  Along with poorest nations with worst health systems in the world.

And yet the Right defends the ""freedom"" to not get vaccinated and thus help spread the pandemic?  Talk about so- called Death Panels!"
2021-09-10 02:54:47,"Good. The draft in WW2 wasn’t left up to personal choice. Polio vaccinations weren’t up to personal choice.

2021-09-10 02:58:59,"Threatening a person's livelihood in order to protect them from getting sick and / or spreading a virus is about as heavy-handed as it gets.  I fear the divisiveness in this country will only grow deeper and angrier.

In reviewing dozens of books written over the past 20 years about 9 / 11, Washington nonfiction columnist Carlos Lozada recently wrote: 

""The problem with responding only to calamity is that underestimation is usually replaced by overreaction. And we tell ourselves it is the right thing, maybe the only thing, to do.""

Lozada was referring to US failures to take terrorists' threats seriously and then badly overreacting with the Patriot Act plus incursions into Afghanistan and Iraq.

From May 2021 through mid-July, Walensky and Biden did not recognize the threat posed by the Delta variant. They should have. Walensky issued her infamous ""masks-off"" guidance and Biden announced a ""freedom from the virus"" on July 4th. 

Today we are witnessing the overreaction.  The 20 year debacle  in Afghanistan -- as so clearly documented in the past few weeks -- were not warning enough for Biden to hold his fire.  Instead he has doubled down with onerous mandates b/c to him it is the ""right thing to do.""

Biden's willingness to circumvent union contracts as well as impose new conditions on government suppliers and contractors is a soft form of martial law.  

These mandates will surely be causes for court battles and SCOTUS is not likely to be Biden’s friend."

I work with a guy who seems to be convinced that the virus is/was a plot to ruin Trump’s re-election. He thinks that the CDC, NIH, WHO, and all their virologists are in on the conspiracy. When I tell him that 700,000 Americans have died from Covid, he says they actually died from old age or heart disease and that their deaths were wrongly attributed to Covid….and anyway, more people die from auto accidents. He seems think he knows more about immunology than the experts, rattling off all kinds of pseudoscience and anecdotal evidence he’s heard from quacks on right-wing radio. 

He fights wearing a mask and he won’t get vaccinated out of some misguided spite. He’s sixty years old and he’s over weight. I actually kinda like the guy, but if he dies from it (he travels a lot for work), I will have no sympathy. 

It’s bizarre! It’s infuriating. If Trump had simply said this virus is real and we all need to wear a mask and get vaccinated, millions of lives could be saved, our economy could roar back, and we could get back to normal life. 

I’m beginning to think it’s a conspiracy among Trump supporters to hurt Biden’s poll numbers."

The unvaccinated are a direct threat to the health and safety of everyone.  It allows Covid to circulate, infect and mutate, perhaps into more contagious and more serious and deadlier variations than Delta.  The more people that are vaccinated, the less opportunity exists for Covid to infect and mutate further.

If people won’t accept the “carrot” of getting vaccinated because it offers protection against serious illness and death, then the “stick” should be used to the greatest extent possible to get people vaccinated.  And that is a good thing for all of us."

On the other hand she refuses to get the vaccine out of safety concerns and is getting more and more angry at being shamed for not getting it.  When I called her last week she now refers to herself jokingly as “public enemy number one”.  She doesn’t go out much and masks up when she does and by the way knows more about living with day to day horrors of death than most people here, having grown up during the Second World War in England living in Coventry and then being sent to the country.

It’s because they see it as a way to grab voters. That’s just disgusting. I’m tired of not being able to do what I want because of cruel spirited people who only care about power. Grow up and win on your ideas.
2021-09-10 03:04:50,"""Our patience is wearing thin."" On the pandemic, yes. But not just the pandemic.

Biden was of the old school of US Senators, like John McCain, where reaching across the aisle was the way to create lasting bipartisan laws. Biden sold himself in the 2020 election as eager to work with Republicans to create bipartisanship and teamwork for the American people.

He ran headlong into ingrained partisanship, Republican governors ""who have blocked attempts to mandate masks or require vaccines."" And in addition they have unconstitutionally blocked standing law legalizing abortions and begun to refuse to cooperate in federal gun laws that take precedence over state laws.

Yes, the Biden Administration's patience is wearing thin. Today Merrick Garland announced a lawsuit against the state of Texas for its blatantly unconstitutional anti-abortion law. Ironic in that Garland had his SCOTUS seat stolen and now has an opportunity to challenge the Republican, Catholic, packed Trump court.

I trust there will be more. Biden and many of the rest of us are tired of the GQP obstructionism and nihilism and their expectation of some sort of bipartisanship as long as they get  everything that they want and they block Biden at every turn.

But Biden has an advantage over Trump. Biden hired brilliant members of his cabinet and his attacks against the obstruction is clever, well thought out and legal -- like using OSHA rules to require vaccines. Trump hired people for loyalty, only."

I’m also wondering about litigation for people who suffer severe side effects.

But I just do not see how the Federal Government can order someone  to make his  employees get VAXXED. And if the workers  refuse, are they to be fired?

The virus spreads among the vaccinated as well (see Provincetown as an example). Yes, the symptoms are milder in the vaccinated, but is there any data that supports the claim that the virus only ""mutates"" in the unvaccinated? 

Why can't it mutate among the vaccinated as well?

If there is data to support the claim that the virus only mutates in unvaccinated individuals...then the NYTimes should provide such data and the accompanying study/studies that the data is derived from.

2021-09-10 03:22:23,"Long overdue! I applaud President Biden’s courage to apply this correct move. To those Republican governors who always claim freedom, while always indifferent to their constituents health, let’s be clear: you don’t have a damn ounce of freedom to impede vaccinated people from returning to normalcy in a safe way. If you believe more people should die for your political gains, I am sure you will all be judged harshly by history."
2021-09-10 03:22:33,"Once my kids can get vaccinated, it’s wheels up on these anti-vaxxers. The Trumpers can then wrestle all they want to with the coming variants like early hominids trying to understand fire - I can no longer help them."
2021-09-10 03:22:59,"Time for us vaxxed people to have more freedom of movement and privilege than the unvaxxed.

There needs to be stiff fines for obtaining fake vaccine cards. 

We cannot continue down this road that just leads back to where we were before.. or worse. 

Like Tina Turner sings.. you can do it nice and easy.. or you can do it rough. 

Nice and easy ain't working."
2021-09-10 03:23:52,Are some of the unvaccinated choosing not to be vaccinated immediately if they had Covid?
2021-09-10 03:24:22,"President Biden: “We asked you nicely, we encouraged you, but you didn’t listen. No more Mr. Nice Guy. Do not mistake a soft tone of voice for a soft position. You anti-vaxxers no longer have the option to make the rest of the country sick.” Indeed! Thank you, Mr. President."
2021-09-10 03:24:53,"The GOP is whining a lot about Biden's actions. They haven't seen what leadership loos like for over 5 years. Well, this is it.
I have felt for a while that the GOP wants a health care crisis or even a disaster in the hope that the Democrats will be blamed for it."

2021-09-10 03:26:22,"I have to laugh, in retrospect, at Bret Stephens’ article this week declaring the Biden presidency a failure. With the vaccine mandate Biden is doing what Democrats, both in and out of the government, have been pressuring him to do for months. He also got us out of Afghanistan, and every day shows more and more his management of that disastrous situation. He’s pushing a badly needed infrastructure bill that has a good chance of passing, increased the safety net and reduced child poverty, and continues to drain the swamp of Trump appointees. Thank you Me. President!"
2021-09-10 03:27:37,"The president has more patience than me. I say good for him. My son-in-law's mother, who refuses to get vaccinated, said every time she goes near a vaccinated person she gets sick. She said it happened six times. Sorry, but I could just slap that woman. (my covid rage)"
2021-09-10 03:27:40,This is what actual leadership looks like.
2021-09-10 03:28:09,"This is beyond overdue...  

The people who refuse the vaccines and then scream and threaten school board members over masks are the very same people that make them necessary...  For all of us!

Enough is Enough!"

However, I have no compassion for individuals with no inherent mental handicaps that display purely willful ignorance in the face of obvious facts. Individuals who deny the obvious benefits of vaccination are literally being willfully stupid and deserve no sympathy whatsoever for what may result as a consequence of their ignorance. I’d rather not share the planet with these idiots."
2021-09-10 03:30:17,"I support President Biden 100 percent. I also want mandates barring those who will not be vaccinated from planes, public transportation, restaurant dining, sporting events and hotels. This has gone on long enough, fanned by Trump and other callow politicians like Ron DeSantis. I have pre-existing condition, and don't want to die because the willfully stupid won't get a safe, free shot."
2021-09-10 03:29:14,"In Oregon, Governor Kate Brown's vaccine mandate has an exemption that allows anyone with a ""deeply sincere religious belief"" to opt out. Doesn't say what the criteria are for this so called ""deeply sincere"" religious belief. Almost half the workers at my mother's assisted living care facility which is a Medicaid contracted facility, opt out under this exemption and then walk their virus into the facility, shutting it down over and over. There needs to be no exemptions for these types of workers. You have ""deeply sincere religious beliefs?"" Work somewhere else where you can't kill my mother! Wondering if President Biden's mandate will have a similar black hole in it?"
2021-09-10 03:29:24,"Mandates are SUCH a welcome and needed change. 
Thank you!, President Biden."
2021-09-10 03:29:27,"Yes!!  Today America found its spine and stood up for the principles the whole world expects it to uphold, the principles that have always defined it in our collective psyche. 

With Biden defending science and the cause of the common good over irrational,  hysterical individualism, with the budget fight for a long overdue  expansion of social benefits and  the Justice Department suing Texas over its outrageous assault on women's constitutional rights, we can finally see glimmers of a future we had almost abandoned. 

This is the leadership we need to navigate the challenges ahead, from climate change to an increasingly dysfunctional economic system - moral conviction followed by decisive action is the only way through. You don't defend civil society by engaging the barbarian hordes with tea and crumpets.

Let's take an equally strong approach to upholding voting rights in this country, inspire every disillusioned citizen to hope that they can still help shape a fair and inhabitable future for all of us - and maybe Democracy gets to write another chapter in the book of civilization."

2021-09-10 03:33:15,"Kudos President Biden!

This nation is blessed to have a free FDA approved vaccine to help stop this global pandemic.

It is untenable for the Governors of Texas and Florida to persist in harming and killing their citizens through the active obstruction of measures to protect health.

In just Florida and Texas alone, 40 times more Americans died there from COVID than the number of Americans who died during the 20-year war in Afghanistan.

Thank you, President Biden, for having the wisdom and courage to end this scourge and protect the nation and the world."
2021-09-10 03:34:10,"So, this is where we're at. This is a gutsy move by our president. I hope it works.It looks like we are going to vaccinate our way out of this...no other mitigation measures needed ? the economy will always be number one...profits over peoples lives
it's complicated.."
2021-09-10 03:35:21,"It would be simpler for the federal government to use Medicare and Medicaid as the axe.  No vaccine, (a) no federal payment for Covid-related health treatment, and (b) no federal payment to medical facilities that don't give preferential treatment to vaccinated patients, including bumping unvaccinated patients out of beds to make room for vaccinated patients."
2021-09-10 03:34:54,"I've never understood how not wearing a mask and not getting vaccinated is touted as a person freedom.  None of us has the freedom to not contract the virus and none of us has the freedom to choose whether or not we spread it to others.  There is no freedom in the equation.  Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is a civic duty and that is what Biden's mandate underscores.  Simple as that.  

To those that argue that you can still contract the virus even if vaccinated...of course you can.  The vaccine was never put forward or promoted as a miracle cure.  It's a vaccine that, like all vaccines, teaches our bodies how to combat a virus.  It doesn't mean that you won't get sick, but likely you'll survive, and the more we survive the more our bodies learn about how to beat back this thing.  Vaccines are not new technology and they are not political.  Get over it...be a patriot, get the shot, join the team and help those of us that truly care about this nation get past this."

2021-09-10 03:36:05,"No amount of pleading,begging,cajoling gets through to those who just want to remain ignorant.  They laugh at masked, feel righteous until they are lying in the hospital not having enough breath in their lungs. They are overcrowding the hospitals,putting our loved ones in danger, and exhausting the medical staffs. Enough you have no rights when you endanger others lives simply out of spite,unscientific lies, stupidity. Don’t go to the hospital you may be taking a bed a child may need."
2021-09-10 03:36:26,"I have two friends who say they would get vaccinated for Covid if the President requires it. Though I’m sure such a mandate would rile Republicans, I don’t see that Biden has much to lose. The Republicans are gonna be riled no matter what. But low-income people like my two friends might focus and get the durned shot."
2021-09-10 03:38:58,"This is the only way forward.  Thank God for a president with the backbone to do what is necessary because of a huge segment of our population who have politicized masks and the vaccine.  I was feeling so hopeless about this country and the pandemic.  Of course, there's reason for me to still feel somewhat hopeless given who is the governor of my state."
2021-09-10 03:39:03,"I know it's top-down command-and-control (the French have a word for this, ""dirigiste""). But I favor it.

I don't want to have to wear a mask at a shopping center or NFL hockey game because some people decline to be vaccinated, any more than I used to like putting up with offices, restaurants, and planes filled with noxious, poisonous cigarette smoke.

Limit the access of the unvaccinated to public accommodations and workplaces when to allow it is an inconvenience to everyone else.

It's their choice; no one should force them to do anything. But neither should their more conscientious, less muleheaded and fantasy-addled fellow citizens have to keep accommodating them, which we now do."
2021-09-10 03:39:08,"At last!! We've been fooling around with this disease for too long. Outstanding decision Mr. President.  I hate to admit that governors in numerous states, foremost among them, Texas and Florida, have put their own political ambitions in front of the health and safety of their constituents.  This is precisely where we need leadership and you, President Biden, have provided it."
2021-09-10 03:39:23,"Hear, hear!  Besides being the right thing to do for public health, this is a brilliant political move in that it awakens and unifies the sensible and responsible but silent majority who have been vaccinated.   For too long, the mouthy boisterous know nothings have dominated the conversation."
2021-09-10 03:40:13,"The government should make life difficult for people who chose to stay unvaccinated. Allow insurance to decline any covid related health charges for the unvaccinated. Let federal payouts through food stamps, mediaid, medicare, social security etc be contingent on proof of vaccine. If money is involved Americans will fall in line."
2021-09-10 03:40:38,Vaccine mandate at this time is political theatre. Why didn’t the democrats insist on it or implement it in their states till now. Biden wants to portray himself as a tough leader especially after their helplessness against Taliban and countries like Pakistan who are extorting concessions and legitimacy from Biden and his administration. this is just part of the effort to divert attention and control damage.
2021-09-10 03:41:40,"Thank you, Joe! Thank you for trusting in the science; I think we as a country have entertained these anti-vaxxers long enough. They keep finding conspiracies or find other reasons to not get the vaccine, but enough is enough! These selfish individuals are putting other people’s lives at risk, taking up medical resources from others, and slowing down our recovery."
2021-09-10 03:41:47,"I'm 20 years older and watching history repeat itself.

After the attacks in 2001 our President had the support of the world.  He leveraged and eventually squandered that support to build the US into a surveillance state and start a war in Iraq.

Did the surveillance state save lives?  Sure.  But how do you measure the price of the trust that was lost in government?  

Today we're seeing the same impatience in this President.  He could have stood firm in Afghanistan and kept our airbase to protect our country.  But that was the hard road.

He could appeal to Americans and their suspicion of his government with respect and understanding and we'd likely have many more vaccinations.

But instead he mandates.  And like his other mandates this mandate will likely be turned back by courts and not enforced.  People will quit their jobs in resistance. 

Biden was elected to unite the country.  He has already failed.

And 20 years ago I was a Democrat fighting against that surveillance state and unlimited government power.  Today I'm a Republican fighting the same thing.  Only the old Left is now the Right and the new freedom fries is ""get vaxed and shut up."""

Calling out the complete nonsense of anti-vax anti-mask Republican antics, their deadly obstruction to controlling Covid.

Is this the second coming of Harry Truman?"
2021-09-10 03:50:03,"This is SO right. Today my 95-yr old mother had a Dr. appointment. Before going to the Dr's office she had to have a rapid covid test (she is vaccinated). I carried her to the county health department where she could get a free rapid test. As the nurse was preparing to test her, my mom asked the nurse if he was vaccinated. He said no. She let him have it only as a 95-yr old could. My question was why was the health department allowing unvaccinated nurses give these tests? It is time that we stopped coddling these unvaccinated people. Either they get vaccinated, or they have to pay - testing frequently, paying more for insurance, being isolated in their jobs where they can't harm us vaccinated folks, etc! People are dying because of their foolishness."

The diehard Trump supporters and all raging ultra-righwingers, with their anti-science, conspiracies-laden views, don't want to be called studpid or ignorant, much less to be proven so by facts.  So, by way of evidence, there is absolutely NOTHING anyone can show them that will make them change their views.  With the strong actions President Biden is finally willing to take -- which are all long overdue -- I am afraid that he may be may be taking too big a risk."
2021-09-10 03:50:47,"It’s about time that wisdom wins the day.

2021-09-10 03:51:40,"I've seen two comments that state previous COVID infection protects as well as the virus. That is not true. From the CDC: ""In today’s MMWR, a study of COVID-19 infections in Kentucky among people who were previously infected with SAR-CoV-2 shows that unvaccinated individuals are more than twice as likely to be reinfected with COVID-19 than those who were fully vaccinated after initially contracting the virus. These data further indicate that COVID-19 vaccines offer better protection than natural immunity alone and that vaccines, even after prior infection, help prevent reinfections."""
2021-09-10 03:54:03,"President Biden's criticism of those who are still unvaccinated against Covid, and his requirement that they get inoculated soon, is at once praiseworthy for its correctness and presidential for its boldness.

Which leads me to recall the recent numbers of detractors -- including a conservative New York Times opinion writer -- who call Mr. Biden a ""failure"" because he didn't act ""faster"" against Covid's Delta variant.

Given that Mr. Biden's first 100 days' achievements are extraordinary in variety and number, to those Biden bashers I say:

""Easy for you to mock a man whose job description compels him to multitask tenfold as often as you must on a typical workday.

Later, we learned it wasn't hamburger and I (8 yrs old) started in with a fuss. Mom said people shouldn't laugh when a child starts in as if they know everything when their still a young child. It's no way to go through life; with a closed mind & a know-it-all attitude. When those same individuals get up in years, it's not at all surprising that they stopped learning anything of significant value at an early age. People are no longer laughing along WITH them because it's clearly not a joking matter.... to go through life as if no one loved you enough to teach you ""Right from Wrong"" while you were still young enough to learn that ""Decisions do have Consequences""."

That’s leadership. I’m going to wait to see what he does about the border which is a lower priority for me than public health and foreign policy, but he just about has my vote locked in for his next election.

With all this education at our fingertips it is astonishing that there can be so much ignorance in the world. Simply astonishing.

Rather than abusing people’s freedoms and embracing authoritarianism, the President ought to consider why so many are choosing to not do what he wants them to do, and whether that is really the cause of whatever ills he foresees due to their choices.

People are not foolish, on average. If they have chosen to not do something in these kinds of numbers there is a good reason you have lost your audience. I suggest trying a different tactic: perhaps encouraging people by focusing on the most important intervention instead of things like masking all children at school, an intervention the CDC data several weeks ago had no impact on spread."

2021-09-10 04:37:10,I have taken the vaccine. However this precedent worries me. Will we all be as excited in 2024 when President Trump is requiring us to take medications?
2021-09-10 04:38:35,"Ah, the adult in the room. Had to happen, needed to happen, and now the what next?  Whatever.  Opinions always loses to biology."
2021-09-10 04:39:51,"As someone who is vaccinated himself, I find the bloodlust in these letters from those in my tribe absolutely terrifying and horrifying. There's no other way of saying it.  It's become a license for rage, whether merited or not, and I can no longer stand it.  At the very same moment when the weaknesses of the vaccines are becoming more evident daily--breakthrough cases, vaxxed people transmitting to others in large numbers, waning antibodies--it's absurd for people to get on their high horse and pretend that if only everyone were vaxxed, this whole thing would be over. It's not science, it's just anger."
2021-09-10 04:31:52,"The president is doing the right thing.

Today I saw a long queue of cars with people waiting for Covid testing.

I asked the intake employee why dozens of cars were lined up.

He said it's like this every day, seven days a week.

I asked, Is it the Delta variant?

Partly, he said. But he sees a number of these people once a week. They are willing to sit in a long, slow-moving line of cars for however long it takes to be Covid-tested.

Their employers are requiring either vaccination or weekly testing. The vaccine refuseniks sit in line for their test.

The employee said he couldn't understand it: so much time sitting in a car, every week, when the vaccines are free, safe, and effective.

Perhaps some of these people already had Covid and are relying on natural immunity.

I have a friend in that situation. He referred me to a study concluding that the previously infected have long-term immunity because of dormant B and T cells that will reemerge to combat any new Covid infection.

But the scholarly article he pointed me to said that despite the benefits of natural immunity, those enjoying it still do much better to be vaccinated."
2021-09-10 04:44:08,"Maybe time for a smug comment from Canada as we’re so much more enlightened than your country is.

Oh wait, we have our own far right political party now whose major platform at the moment seems to be anti- pandemic mitigation measures ( vaccines/vax passports/masking,etc.)
Recently,one family seemed quite proud to have their seven year old daughter hurl F bombs at PM Trudeau at a campaign event.

And just last week the equine deworming medication ivermectin had to be removed from the shelves of veterinary supply shops in Calgary, Alberta. Seems it was becoming popular with types that wouldn’t know a fetlock from a withers.

Just to let you know your country doesn’t have a lock on people who wallow in stupidity, selfishness and ignorance.

I don’t know if this fact will cheer you up or depress you."
2021-09-10 04:45:22,"It’s like we’re fighting a zombie apocalypse of unvaccinated zombies, but we’re hamstrung when it comes to fighting them because we try to be nice. Which just keeps letting them destroy our health, our medical system and ultimately our country."
2021-09-10 04:47:44,"Devil’s in the details. 
How will the mandate be enforced for non - government businesses with over 100 employees?   And how will the mandate to provide paid time off for employees (and for employees to assist their families!) to get the vaccine be enforced? Who will investigate and decide these things?"
2021-09-10 04:49:43,"Whether President Biden's plans will work remains to be seen and not surprisingly some will argue that he has gone too far, some not far enough. If the governors of Texas, Florida, and other states are willing to jeopardize the lives of children for political gain, there isn't anything he could say or do that will convince them to change course. They are a lost cause. 

But if nothing else, today's speech is a welcome reminder of what it is like to have a grown up in the White House. 

How refreshing to have someone using the office to do what presidents are supposed to do: lead in the hope that eventually the nation can be healed, as difficult and impossible as that may seem, rather than to lie, self-promote, and divide."
2021-09-10 04:48:08,"This is long overdue.

If the Trumplicans want to spurn the vaccine as a way of owning the libs, I would be happy to let them do so from the other side of the grave."
2021-09-10 04:48:32,"Dear Governor DeSantis,
You know what the COVID numbers are - most likely higher than you are allowing to become publicly available.
But I'm not worried about you, because a larger proportion of those dying are Republican voters, which should reduce your (and you fellow Republican's) chances of obtaining future political election victories.  So, keep it up !  
But, you can take some consolation that you and Trump will likely be the all-time American Darwin-Award winners for causing needless deaths in the 21st century. 
Congratulations !"
2021-09-10 03:41:15,"Finally.

It’s about time we stop being held hostage by the ignorant and lunatics."
2021-09-10 04:50:43,"Anti vaxxers are not all naturally selfish and stupid. Many were made so by vaccinated cynics at Fox or unvaccinated right wing talk radio gasbags (increasingly deceased) looking for a simple incendiary new front in the culture war to distract their base from the success of Biden’s policies.
 Good for Joe on calling them out and rolling out the vaccine at Warp speed."
2021-09-10 05:01:13,Rename Delta variant to Republican variant- it's their baby.
2021-09-10 05:07:08,"When will children get access Mr President?

Every day we roll the dice on that one.  

It’s time."
2021-09-10 05:00:02,So - are anti-vaxxers on Team Plague?
2021-09-10 05:23:15,"True leadership ... I respect Pres. Biden.  He has the fortitude and courage to do what is needed, to do what is right.  Such a fresh transformation from the era of lying, spineless Trump and current parade of republican lap dogs."
2021-09-10 04:52:45,Here's what else we need:  those who are vaccinated get priority treatment at hospitals and the ICU if they're sick with COVID.  Those who failed to vaccinated go to the back of the line!
2021-09-10 05:08:21,"Thank you, President Biden!  How refreshing to see presidential behaviour in the Whitehouse.
You are being far, far more polite than I would have been. The human cost to the anti-vaxxing anti-masking crowd has been obscene."
2021-09-10 05:17:54,Hooray! Keep swinging for the fences Joe!
2021-09-10 04:58:18,"If you are unvaccinated and get Covid, you should not be able to get healthcare at a US hospital that receives federal money.  Why are Americans who are meeting all mandates and want their families and friends to live, supposed to pay taxes for the treatment of those who want to see us perish?  These miscreants are destroying our healthcare system with their malfeasance.  Let them enjoy their fate with their ""freedoms"" intact, but not on the government dime."
2021-09-10 04:59:49,"Go Joe go…
On the right track.
What kind of people 
refuse a vaccination knowing
that an illness they spread 
has the potential to make
children sick? Do everything 
possible to require people
to be vaccinated."
2021-09-10 05:16:29,"Wow. What a righteous and angry bunch of comments.

I get it. I'm mad, too, and I'm WAY past the point where I've tried to understand the ""vaccine hesitant.""

But it doesn't matter whether ""they"" get vaccines or not. The virus is just another flashpoint. The nation is riven. However well intended, every use of the Unitary Executive theory will just make the chasm worse."
2021-09-10 05:17:28,"The tendency of the religious far-right to associate any collective action led by the government for the common good with the mark of the beast is paranoid and insane. In my lifetime I've seen it associated with social security numbers, Medicare, direct deposit into bank accounts, ATM cards, the Worldwide Web, anything to do with computers, and that old chestnut, fluoridation of drinking water."
2021-09-10 05:19:33,"President Biden should go one step further and require vaccinations of individuals to receive services from the federal government as he has with corporations.  For instance, Medicare and Medicaid won’t pay or even authorize care unless your vaccinated.  Sorry but the first document to be verified in your firearm background check, is a valid vaccination card.  Oh, did you need that new Employer Identification Number for that business your are starting…. Let’s see that vax card.  A negative test isn’t going to cut it and the only excuse is a valid medical one.  There is no valid religious excuse, none so don’t bother asking.

People will quickly see how many thing they get from the federal government."
2021-09-10 05:23:29,"Why should vaccinated people care whether others are unvaccinated?  Vaccines work, right?

Why should people who’ve recovered from Covid and have developed natural immunity be forced to take vaccines?

Why are postal workers exempt?"
2021-09-10 05:25:03,Good!  Why did he wait so long?
2021-09-10 04:59:24,I really have to wonder just who is paying for all these hospitalizations of the unvaccinated. Insurance companies ought to stop paying the way for the unvaccinated. Let them pay full boat if they have to go to the ER and if that bankrupts them then so be it. They wouldn't be the first people to go bankrupt over medical bills.
2021-09-10 05:13:36,"A needed effort to combat this terrible virus. Thank you President Biden and health professionals at work in US. Here in New Zealand, the almost-daily Covid count is negligible by US or UK standards  -- we had months of being Covid-free in the community -- but now we are shut down this month against this contagious variant. The numbers are plummeting. Only our largest city, Auckland, has cases now. We hope you will have good results. Not perfect, but hopeful. New patterns of migration: a talented American obstetrician and an epidemiologist have come to NZ with their families. Both are women. An Atlanta friend's 4 grandchildren have come to New Zealand, their father's original home. It's safer. I feel safer with 2 doses of Pfizer; my Scottish sister in law has had 3 as part of the Oxford AZ study! Listen to your doctors: like my daughter in law's Dad, a GP in Australia: get the vaccine, because then (it's likely) you won't go to hospital and you won't die from Covid. Sensible advice."
2021-09-10 05:14:05,"Do Republicans have a death wish? Sure seems like it. Who wants to fill up ICU's and mortuaries? Seriously, what is wrong with these people."
2021-09-10 05:12:32,"I commend President Biden for his firm stand and action on vaccination and wearing masks. Rather than continue to complain, one wonders what alternative Republicans might propose that would help keep people from getting Covid, save lives, give our health care workers a respite, keep our schools and public spaces safe, and get our economy back to a more normal footing. Instead they keep advocating a form of anarchy they call “liberty” where social and community responsibility are optional activities and people can do whatever they want. Their objections to simple rules for wearing masks and getting vaccinated suggest they’d be okay living In a chaotic world where things like wearing seat belts in a car, stopping at red lights, slowing down in school zones, and not smoking in classrooms, theaters and restaurants that help keep us safe are mere suggestions. Looking at the havoc Covid has wreaked in states like Arkansas, Florida, and Mississippi, that’s a world I hope never to live in."
2021-09-10 05:22:40,"What President Biden is doing is not a mandate; instead, the President is requiring that people who wish to work for the government, or large companies, be vaccinated to reduce the threat that they pose to others in the early days of a Covid infection when they would be free of symptoms.
No one will be forced to get vaccinated.

I add that the Times statistics clearly indicate that states that have low vaccination rates  have high hospitalization rates (e.g., AL, TN), and states with high vaccination rates have low hospitalization rates (e.g., VT, NH)."
2021-09-10 04:51:15,"Why are there religious exemptions from vaccination mandates?
Are there religious exemptions from wearing a seatbelt?
Can someone point out a religious doctrine of any religion that advises its followers from getting vaccinated?
It’s just an excuse people use as far as I’m concerned."
2021-09-10 05:03:05,"Make them pay for their own weekly tests. Out of pocket, whatever the clinic wants to charge, no subsidies."
2021-09-10 05:03:25,"""Our patience is wearing thin.'  Is that a threat against the American public?  Someone has an agenda..."
2021-09-10 04:51:12,Go Joe!  Thank you for inducing the vaccine latecomers to get vaccinated.  This will help protect our whole country.
2021-09-10 05:05:07,Jack up their premiums. Stupid is a pre-existing condition.
2021-09-10 05:31:57,Great!  Thank you Mr. President.
2021-09-10 05:37:21,No more Mr. Nice Guy.  Nice guys finish last.
2021-09-10 05:39:12,"I don’t get it.  Children are at risk.  Do you really want to see a child in an ICU?  People that are not vaccinated kill and hurt others.  The only way out may be to make Texas a Covid state, kind of like a leper colony.  You can go in but you can’t come out.  And we’ll let you have a gun."
2021-09-10 05:43:26,"Finally Joe--you are using your precious power as President to do what's right!  YES, keep those mandates coming in order to get many more millions of Americans vaccinated.  The irresponsible, delusional portion of our country and the politicians who feed them lies, will ONLY listen to a 'mandate'!  Thumbs up!  Hope you continue to exert your authority as President to ensure that the draconian laws offered by RED states don't get to see the light of day."
2021-09-10 05:30:41,"Should have been done in June, or maybe earlier.  My employer forbade us from asking if our co-workers were vaccinated.  And then they run ads touting their safety efforts.
I made it very simple, if you give me Covid, and I unknowingly bring ot home to my immune compromised child, you had better disappear."
2021-09-10 05:41:12,"Diehard anti-vaxxers are never going to get vaccinated no matter what, short of holding them at gunpoint. Not sure that would even work. Stop arguing with them. It doesn't work. Ignore them instead. I predict these people will become more threatening and more violent as more mandates are put in place. Meanwhile, the needless deaths will continue, mostly of the unvaccinated, but some of our loved ones will also die like those with compromised immune systems or those who are too young to get the vaccine. And, because so many are unvaccinated the coronavirus could mutate into a more deadly variant that the vaccines won't work against. That is our new reality. I'm vaccinated, I wear a mask. I feel like the only thing I can do is to go out and live my life and that is what I am doing."
2021-09-10 05:42:45,"As an American living and working overseas I applaud President Biden’s initiatives to keep non-vaxer’s from undermining  efforts to defeat COVID-19. Many of these same folks protested at state capitols during lockdowns and in Michigan plotted to kidnap the governor if businesses and schools weren’t opened. Now that businesses and schools are struggling to remain open, they resist the public health measures that will keep them open. These folks are not only unpatriotic, they are depleting America’s financial, medical and educational resources.  Thank you President Biden for saying out loud what most Americans are feeling; our patience is wearing thin."
2021-09-10 05:47:23,"In May, when Delta was ravaging India, Biden told us to take off our masks.

What impact do you think that had on:
a) the spread of Delta
b) the reluctance of the unvaccinated to trust him

He alone owns that."
2021-09-10 05:44:17,"Trump didn’t want the political liability a health crisis would bring, so he denied it and lied about it from the beginning. All that followed flowed from that, the denial, the ant-vaxxers, and the Republican political bandwagon that has prolonged the pandemic. What Biden has done may be unpopular in some quarters but it took courage to finally take a stand."
2021-09-10 05:50:01,"The mandate requires either getting vaccinated *or* be tested weekly for COVID-19. What we really need is a mandate with no alternative like weekly testing. 

It surprises me that this mandate wasn't already in effect. 

Frankly, while this is a step in the right direction, vaccine mandates will be needed to really combat the virus and move on. 

As long as a significant percentage of the population remains unvaccinated, hospitals will remain strained, and the pandemic will reign on."
2021-09-10 06:00:57,I was vaccinated in April and still caught CoVid at my workplace.  I'm honestly disgusted by people.  We could have had this thing under control months ago if it wasn't for these far right loonies and idiots.
2021-09-10 06:02:23,Thank you Mr. President ... this IS leadership.
2021-09-10 06:01:42,President Biden knew he had no other choice if there is to be any hope of ending the vicious cycle of this constantly mutating virus – health providers are at the breaking point and the situation could not be allowed to continue. This was his finest hour.
2021-09-10 06:06:40,"The article mentioned that roughly 80 million Americans are eligible for shots but haven't gotten them, and also that (according to the President) the actions would cover 100 million. So if even only 50% complied, that would make a huge dent in the problem. Seems like that would get us pretty close to herd immunity."

2021-09-10 06:23:22,"I support this strong stand and the mandate. However, it would be good to know if the unvaccinated are, for the most part, really those working for larger businesses and federal agencies, or if they are in areas where the economic units are smaller, e.g. smaller towns and rural areas."
2021-09-10 06:25:06,"I support these efforts, but have two comments. First, there should be no testing option for private sector employees; the OSHA rule should mandate vaccination. Second, vaccination should be required for access to facilities over which the federal government has control -- e.g., commercial airlines."
2021-09-10 06:25:36,It’s about time. I do think Biden needs to emphasize that this is the way to a stronger economy and that Governors and others who are in the way are actively undermining job growth and economic progress and preventing a return to normal.
2021-09-10 06:28:23,"Full disclosure: I was vaccinated in February. I personally have never had a problem with vaccines, but I do with iffy official statement and broad brush mandates. 

I keep wondering why those who have had Covid are not counted with the vaccinated ... when the latest science says they are immune for at least 8 months. I also wonder why officials imply everyone of all ages and health conditions are equally endangered by the virus when many publications point to preconditions that may or may not have caused death from those causes, not Covid alone. 

Full disclosure, transparency and respect for individual rights will always convince more by creating confidence where manipulation and browbeating without taking any questions, any time do not."
2021-09-10 06:33:52,"Very good move - I wish that European government would muster the courage to do the same.

Unfortunately, Swiss and German government are confused about the need for vaccine mandates and how to enforce it. Not too long ago there was (and still might be) a mandate to vaccinate all children against Polio, TB, diphtheria, and a few other infections - enforced without exceptions (unless children were, say, immunocompromised). 
The politicians in charge need to ignore the loudmouths and just set a vaccine mandate in motion - let non-vaccinated ICU patients pay there own hospital stay and hand out stiff fines. No excuses, no lamenting, just do it. It is also completely unacceptable that cancer patients and those awaiting surgeries need to postpone their treatment because of some anti-vaxers."
2021-09-10 08:24:55,"The medical center where I work laid down the law - staff have until a specific date to get their first vaccine injection or the following day they will not have a job. They will not qualify for unemployment and there will be no religious exemptions granted. The only medical exemptions being allowed are real counterindications to the vaccine (such as a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component, not things like stress or anxiety or a fear of needles. Enough is enough. We're all tired of living under the vaccine restrictions. I'm tired of wearing a mask every time I take public transportation or sitting in my office. We need to start getting past this disease and the only way we're going to is if every adult gets vaccinated. If it has to be by a certain degree of arm twisting and coercion, then so be in. My sympathy for the unvaccinated is at an end."
2021-09-10 09:31:07,I think the mandate should include every healthcare provider that accepts Medicare and Medicaid. It should not be only limited to institutions that accept Medicare and Medicaid. It sounds like small medical practices are not included in the mandate.
2021-09-10 09:40:37,"Those who are unvaccinated and then become infected will of course rely on their health insurance, if the have it, to pay at least part of their medical bills. 

But this puts an extra burden on others covered by the same insurer who are vaccinated, because this will cause rates to go up for everyone in that insurance group.

For that reason it should be fair if insurance groups put a surcharge on the insurance rates of those who refuse to be vaccinated without a good medical reason why they refuse.

Why should my insurance rates go up because other people in my group refuse to get vaccinated."
2021-09-10 10:30:09,"You have to get people where it hurts the most - their pocketbooks. If workers choose to get tested instead of getting the free vaccine, then they should pay for the testing- not the company mandating vaccine. 
Also good idea for employees losing their job for not getting vaccinated to not be eligible for unemployment insurance."
2021-09-10 09:12:43,"Seriously, this mandate has no downside to it. The virus does not pick sides, nor does it care who it infects.  It will infect, replicate and mutate into whatever unvaccinated host it can find. 
Our health, our healthcare facilities, our economy, our children’s education, our peace of mind, our country depends on eradicating this scourge.  Freedom be damned. Thank you President Biden for speaking the truth."
2021-09-10 11:36:00,"Remarkable. We seem to believe that we are separate from others and that what we claim to be a personal freedom ranks above all else. Do we really think that all of society is laboring to provide us with a personal freedom that puts that society at risk? United we stand, but divided we fall."
2021-09-10 11:53:16,"As a subspecialty physician in Neuroradiology, I have seen the ugly side of Covid-19 on numerous MRI studies.   That said, with a history of some focal heart damage likely from focal viral myocarditis related to several bad cases of the flu in my 20's or 30's before flu shots were the norm  -- (for the docs out there, still swim competitively in my 60's so my cath looked like a 15 yo last year) --   you can imagine that my ears perked up when there were reports of rare myocarditis in young males after m-RNA vaccination.  Initially vaccinated late December of '20 and late Jan '21, but don't think for a second that I didn't weigh the risks and benefits very carefully.

Now - complete vaccine avoidance on ideological grounds alone is another thing entirely - but one size does not fit all, and every person has to rigorously evaluate their personal risk / benefit profile.   After consulting with multiple colleagues, in my particular case, even the slightly greater risk from a possible booster in a month or 2 is almost certainly less than the uncertainty of a breakthrough infection with my age and history.

The main point is this - not all hesitancy to be vaccinated is based on simple obstinance.   Some is very well founded in science and / or uncertainty surrounding risk vs benefit."
2021-09-10 11:09:10,"Why was this speech given as 9/11 commemorations have begun

Why does Mr Biden “otherwise” people who, like himself and Ms Harris said in 2020, do not trust a rushed vaccine

Why is he pushing policies that will have a disparate impact on Black, Hispanic, undocumented people and young people, all members of his coalition?

The mask on Mr Empathy was removed and we are reminded who Mr Biden really is."
2021-09-10 10:15:38,"Will the 630,000 postal employees be exempt from this mandate?  And if so, why?"
2021-09-10 07:54:53,"'some regions with relatively low jab rates have recently recorded record high infection rates'- bbc

These regions should be heavily punished and pressured by policies that require them to vaccinate the unvaccinated living in the regions. The same regions  also reside in authoritarian red states passing extremist abortion and voting laws that target black,brown and poor people."
2021-09-10 09:28:31,"Most Americans are vaccinated and comply with mask mandates. However, too many other Americans refuse to use masks or to get a vaccine, and the virus spreads and kills ourselves, our children and our most vulnerable beloved.
I am vaccinated and masked when needed, and I am sick and tired of being threatened, together with my children, by the diffused ignorance (or worse) fueled by anti-scientific and delusional campaigns of disinformation.
So, I welcome Mr. Biden's decision: It was about time!"
2021-09-10 06:21:37,I like it!  Either get vaccinated or get a test every week to go to work.
2021-09-10 08:35:00,"It’s time. I understand rightists would rather rant about their entitlement than work, but we really need to get our economy back on track."
2021-09-10 08:53:24,"Smart move to mandate vaccines for federal employees, contractors and healthcare providers accepting Medicare and Medicaid. 

Damgerous move to mandate private sector employers of 100 or more people to require vaccines. Red state employers will privately appreciate the cover, but the only thing we will hear is the outrage of the red state masses. I hope this doesn't strengthen the resistance."
2021-09-10 08:21:58,"Please tell me that part of this is to deputize private citizens to take vaccine shirkers to court and win $10,000 in the process.  So sweet!"
2021-09-10 06:15:39,The same statement could be made about any vaccine.  There will always be those that refuse.
2021-09-10 09:49:21,"Bad things happen. There is no government that can save its citizens from fate.

The US overreacted to 9/11 - doing huge damage to its own democracy and many other countries.

And now it is similarly overreacting to Covid. Again it will pay a huge price if Biden gets his way."
2021-09-10 06:26:47,"Honestly, with all the scientific discoveries in the last 100 years people refuse to get vaccinated. I think people need to look at history .... leprosy colonies, TB, smallpox, polio, the plague. The more recent Ebola outbreaks in the news. Talk about re-inventing the wheel. Vaccines work, the randomised controlled trials show this over and over again. Vaccines give freedom to live, to be well, to have healthcare treatment for the myriad of conditions humans suffer because hospitals aren't over run by COVID patients. 

115 000 health care professionals in the world are dead today because of COVID and 'freedom'. They turned up to do a job despite the risk. We owe them and their families the respect and action to prevent more deaths. They are not easily replaced. It isn't that they are more important that anyone else but their skills are and their skills take years to learn."
2021-09-10 08:56:19,"We have stroke and heart attack patients in Washington state who cannot get admission to the first or second hospital they are taken to because there are no beds left and no staff to see them.  Patients for whom every extra minute costs tissue and function and could make the difference between life and death, or lifelong disability. I have heard ER doctors across the country worry that if they have a car collision scenario to deal with they would have nowhere to accommodate these trauma patients.

That is the next political hurdle we'll have to jump - keeping a significant percentage of hospital beds open for non-Covid patients before our healthcare systems completely implode. It is happening worldwide, and unless hospitals are allowed (under federal protection) to implement a triage system where they reserve only a limited number of beds for unvaccinated, ""you did it to yourself"" Covid cases, we will be once again punishing the innocent for the sins of a sociopathic minority. 

Choices have consequences. Those who reject both science and the mutual obligations holding a society together should be the ones facing the chaos of the systemic collapse they are responsible for - not our kids, not our parents, not our most vulnerable ones."
2021-09-10 09:53:55,"Just yesterday I read of two separate families that left a total of five kids orphaned because the parents didn’t take the virus seriously. One was a single mother of four and the other involved BOTH parents of an only child, a 16-year-old girl. Meanwhile in Wisconsin we have an anti-vaccine state legislator who has been on a ventilator going on a month while his wife is left to deal with their six young children. He is morbidly obese and likely won’t come out of this unscathed if indeed he makes it.  

I have my own principles, but I am also pragmatic and more than anything I love my family. I cannot imagine taking such a risk simply to make a point about whatever these people are up in arms about. Maybe this mandate will finally force people to do what (for most of us) is the right thing for ourselves and each other."
2021-09-10 10:31:59,"The shift in attitude that this announcement captures is welcome. It is not my responsibility (as a vaccinated person) to cater to the whims of an ignorant movement with its foundations in politics & not science.

As others have well pointed out on this thread, my insurance premium is put under pressure by the non-vaccinated, my child’s school is put at (greater) risk of snap closures as the virus has a greater chance of spreading, my elderly parents are at significantly higher risk of a serious breakthrough condition etc etc.

Enough is enough - there need to be real consequences for “your freedoms” impacting “our freedom”."

Red states are sending the unvaccinated to ICUs in blue states, impacting people in those states. 20 died in contra costa county in CA last week because of unvaccinated people who have not taken the vaccine. Abbot and Desantis and the like have been utterly irresponsible. Something has to be done about it. Absolutely.  Individuals and companies refusing to get themselves and all their employees vaccinated should not receive federal funds and should be denied federal contracts. Enough of tolerating this

It had been a long time since the world has seen an American President who is willing to put his political life on the line to lead not only the USA but the world.  Vaccines must be a mandate to get this pandemic under control. And it needs to be a global effort.
2021-09-10 09:57:56,"Thank god.

It isn't enough, though.

There is no reason why small businesses should be excluded from this mandate.

There is no reason the unvaccinated should still be allowed to board plane and trains, endangering everyone on board.

We need stronger enforcement of mask requirements -- I regularly see selfish people ignoring them.

We need the FDA to stop dragging its feet on booster shots and shots for young children. It's time for a new administrator.

And there is no reason why the vaccination schedule cannot be sped up so that people receive vaccinations.

Otherwise, we will still be doing too little, too late."

Such fines will not have any expiry date and the Tax office should be charged to collect. Any tax credit is to be used to pay off the debt and not refunded to the taxpayer. Those on benefit will have to pay off the fine via deducting an amount with every payment.  A caveat can be put on properties and businesses and no sales will be finalized until the fine is paid. A garnisher on salaries will cover the rest. Draconian? Of course, but desperate measures for desperate times."

Here in France, vaccinated people take fewer precautions than unvaccinated people, they don't use masks and they never get tested. They think that with the vaccine, they can do whatever they want.

By the way, I love reading the American press, it is much better than the one we have here."

I don't know how the public campaign to get people vaccinate has been in other states but here in SC it's lacking the math. what? yes, the math: most of us hate math but someone very smart can help to show numbers to the population that are easy to understand. They should have designed by now Covid Vaccine adds showings numbers why getting a vaccine is important, why populations with high vaccinations rate have very low cases and hospitals aren't overwhelmed. I compare the numbers of Westchester NY with my county here in SC and the difference is startling. Billboards would be helpfull, social media pops ups, phone alerts with hospitalized people with Covid and number of ICU available beds like we get with weather alerts. And to the Pro-life population  something to remind them that  children hospitals are filling up with children and they need to be protected too."

Then we get to go through the last eighteen months all over again."
2021-09-10 07:07:56,"Thank you so much President Biden for having the courage, backbone and wisdom to do what all sane and rational human beings would mandate.  To know and understand what is required to save thousands of lives, what is required to shut down this pandemic to get our economy fully running, what is required to ensure our children are in a safe learning environment, what is required to ease the burden on our healthcare workers and the healthcare system.  
In other words, what is best for the USA and what the majority of Americans demand.

I don't get it. Where is the common sense? The logic? Biden is acting according to his own mandate, to protect human lives."
2021-09-10 10:43:54,Insurance companies can deny payment for any COVID-related health care if clients refuse the vaccine. That will solve this problem as most of the unvaccinated will run to get the shot if their money is on the line.

2021-09-10 08:20:47,"I hope that the unvaccinated realize that all Americans want our lives, economy, safety, peace back.   I can only speak for my family which has had to essentially remain in lockdown because of at risk small children and immuno compromised individuals.   Everyone needs to pull their weight or the economy will never fully recover and businesses will be damaged further.   We need our health care systems to operate for business other than COVID or the deaths will just grow.

They prefer to die of ""The Plague"" rather than accept the scientific and medical validity of vaccination.The total ignorance of anti-vaxxers combined with the politicization of essential preventive health care by Trump and his Republican lackeys has led to countless innocent deaths and a major prolongation of the pandemic. 

The anti-vaxxer movement, which is a fact-free, quasi-religious cult, has been around for years. However, the politicization of vaccination in the face of a lethal infection is unprecedented. It is indeed a true indicator of the complete shamelessness of the Republican leadership and the depths of amorality into which the GOP has fallen. 

We cannot change the minds of the mindless. We must, however, insist on national legislation to eliminate access of the un-vaccinated to all public spaces. It is a matter of public safety first and foremost, and that is a primary governmental obligation to the American people."

Fighting Words Doctrine, words not protected by First Amendment.

Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942)
‘fighting’ words” cannot claim constitutional protection. Murphy argued that fighting words “by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.”

City of Houston v. Hill (1987)
“Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea. That is why freedom of speech, though not absolute, is nevertheless protected against censorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest.”

Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989)
If words did result in an invitation to exchange fisticuffs or a physical altercation… these are not protected by free speech, thus could be consider to be a crime.

Virginia v. Black (2003), the Supreme Court defined true threats as “those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.” The Court clarified that the speaker “need not actually intend to carry out the threat.”

The loss of life suffered at Pearl Harbor is matched every 48 hours with deaths to Covid in our nation's hospitals, clinics & Intensive Care Units. Over a thousand Americans disappeared without leaving any identifiable remains on September 11, 2001. On the average, Covid has taken from us an equivalent number of sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, brothers or sisters; every day since February 1st, 2020. The death toll proven by post mortem testing for each case provides direct proof that 650,000 Americans have succumbed to the pandemic. A statistical analysis of all deaths from January 1st, 2020 shows an excess death count exceeding 1 million Americans during the pandemic. But still, this unprecedented death toll fails to persuade 100 million ""patriotic"" Americans to recognize their obligation to share in our nation's defense effort. We are not demanding they sacrifice their lives. On the contrary, we are pleading that they take the simple painless, inexpensive & very low risk steps most likely to ensure their comfort & survival, along with those same steps that will protect their family members & our mutual prosperity.

2021-09-10 12:36:21,Why did Joe Biden exempt the postal workers?  How can he mandate private businesses get vaccinated but not the federal workers like postal workers?  Why do the school teachers influence the CDC guidelines?  Why is Joe Biden exempting his large voting blocks? All the commenters say this is not political but his actions show differently. No reporters will ask Joe Biden even though they should do their job. The press is complicit in protecting Joe Biden from his bad decisions. No reporting on how many US citizens trapped in Afghanistan. Very sad. Do your job and ask Joe Biden the tough questions and hold him accountable.
2021-09-10 12:46:35,"I’m vaccinated and believe in vaccines but citizens, and companies, need to aggressively rebel against any government mandate of vaccines.

Government is free to make laws but they have to draw the line when it comes to peoples bodies, they are not in control and do not have a say in what goes in or out of a private citizens body, end of story, bottom line, full stop.

The government, specifically visit instruction, will take that inch and make it a mile, intruding into our private lives more and more in the name of safety, or whatever silly notion they come up with.￼￼￼"

I am so sick and tired of these people who only think about themselves and could care less about others. I am so sick and tired of these people screaming about tyranny, communism or whatever else they want to call it. They have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. They haven't got a clue about what tyranny is. They fail to realize that THEY are the tyrants, subjecting everyone around them to the possibility of getting infected, simply because they refuse to be responsible and do what's best for the good of all. They know absolutely nothing about doing whatever is necessary for the common good of everyone. These people would have NEVER survived one day during the WWII years, when REAL sacrifices were made on a daily basis. I'm certainly no fan nor supporter of President Biden, but at least he's doing whatever he can to help defeat Covid-19 and the Delta Variant."

1500 deaths per day equals 
four jumbo jets crashing every day,
or over three 9/11's every week.

However, they are not random, predominantly unvaccinated and they are more or less spread around the country, not concentrated in a city or associated with a particular airport.  

Another way to think about it.  This current rate equals over half a million in a year - ten times the 15 year American soldier toll in Vietnam."
2021-09-10 12:42:10,"Let's put aside for a moment the issue of whether a vaccine is an appropriate choice for a given individual.  A significant question all Americans need to be asking themselves today is whether it is appropriate under the Constitution for one man occupying the Office of President -- and let us not forget we will have many in the future, both Republican and Democrat -- to impose medical decisions upon individuals under threat of losing one's livelihood?  For all the talk of ""authoritarianism"" by the last occupant of that Office, this strikes me as a particularly apt example of that charge.  We ought to be very concerned about the political path upon which we are treading.  Matters like these should be left to legislatures who have the Constitutional authority to pass laws and who remain directly responsible to their constituents."

However Biden’s mandate on private employers through OSHA is a gross overreach, probably in violation of the law and maybe unconstitutional as well. And yet another abuse of Executive authority instead of working with Congress, divided though it may be, which division is the essence of Separation of Powers as specified in the Constitution. Around the world we have seen Covid used as an excuse by ostensible democracies to move in the direction of autocratic rule, with little if any legislative or popular resistance (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, France, UK, etc.) This is the slippery slope about which the anti-Federalists have warned since the Founding - centralized government will be loath to give up its new power when Covid is gone or becomes just background noise in less than a year. The vaccines are a great thing. Governmental overreach is dangerous and will only further divide the country."

Washington vaccinated the Continental Army against smallpox.  Dogs have to show proof of shots to use kennels. 
 Nearly every American is already vaccinated against a battery of beaten diseases and maladies to participate in daily life.  Frankly it's remarkable we haven't needed to add to the protections against Polio, Measles, Rubella and more for as many decades as we have.

Thats why we've partnered with the former President Trump, governors and leaders in the black community to help folks understand this medicine and how it can benefit them""

That's what a leader and someone who wants to persuade people and get results would say.  A would be tyrant would say
""our patience is wearing thin"" and ""we will get governors (elected officials) out of the way""
Wasn't this guy supposed to be Mr Empathy?  Besides being tyrannical, threats persuade no one.   He has to know this, so what's going on?

to quote AJBOWN on this comment thread:
""There is a lot of misunderstanding about what vaccines are and what they do. The vaccine works. It is not a guarantee that you won't still get COVID, but it protects you if you do. My mom's assisted living place just had an outbreak. Everyone was vaccinated. The difference is that symptoms were mild and no one, not even the very elderly, died it needed to be hospitalized. Without the vaccine, it would have been catastrophic. There is no such thing as zero COVID..  The goal is manageability so we can all get back to a semblance of normal. But we won't get there at all if people refuse to get the vaccine. No disease is ever completely wiped out. For example, TB and the measles are coming back because people refuse to be vaccinated. There needs to be clearer messaging, but people also need to educate themselves. Saying the vaccine doesn't work is simply not true."""

2021-09-10 13:48:10,"Couple of thoughts.
       1. While transmission is a top of page issue, more should be said about the mutability of the virus. One nightmare scenario due to childhood ineligibility for the vaccine is the possibility that the virus, finding a final home in children, will mutate to become more dangerous for children than it is at present.
       2. We have OSHA to ensure that employees have a safe place to work. We need a similar federal law that will ensure that our children have safe places to learn. States like Florida should not be able to mandate under their truancy laws that children must attend school, and yet have no legal obligation to ensure that the schools are safe.   
     3. On the employment and health care fronts, change the narrative to: If you don't want to get vaccinated, then you are too ignorant to work here. No, there is no good, rational answer that will excuse your ignorance, and you are free to go to work elsewhere. Give the requirement some teeth by allowing health care insurers to raise the premiums of the unvaccinated in employer-based plans."
2021-09-10 13:58:14,"I am so happy to hear these mandates have been issued. It has been a long time coming and should have been instituted long ago. I also think it needs to go further by mandating that all who can be vaccinated must be vaccinated. 
This is not a, “my body, my choice,” issue and never should have been. This is not a disease that would only harm you and you alone. When you millions of people walk around unmasked and unvaccinated you are putting the lives of every single other person you come in contact with in danger if you’re infected, whether you know it or show no symptoms.
When you people infect others it is no different whatsoever than attempted murder, and murder if they die. 
I stated long ago that those who refused to wear masks, when that was the only protection we had, and refused the vaccine when it was available, should have been arrested and charged with attempted murder or murder if they infected someone and they were hospitalized or died. 
Since so many are too stupid to realize that ending this nightmare requires being vaccinated, and wearing a mask until all are protected, then being forced is the only option to protect everyone else. 
I find it sickening that those who refuse vaccination don’t care about infecting and possibly killing their fellow human beings, their spouses, their children, their entire family and friends. What kind of selfish person does that? You must be mentally ill not to care.
So thank you, President Biden. I am grateful for your mandate."
2021-09-10 14:49:36,"Republican governors and Congress members will object and scream democratic overreach, of course. And the conservative press will rail against Biden and the entire Democratic party. This is their game.... to make the Democrats look bad. The right doesn't care one whit if everyone in the country get sick with Covid. All they care about is making the left appear to not be doing a good job (everyone getting sick with covid will indicate that) so that they'll have a better shot at regaining the White House and Congress in 2024."
2021-09-10 13:44:56,"Let me state from the start that I am vaccinated, everyone in my family is vaccinated, almost everyone I know is vaccinated. I urge any and everyone to get vaccinated. But ...

Biden was not ""hesitant"" to impose mandates, he categorically opposed mandates through the election and even as recently as a few months ago. He said, over and over that he couldn't and wouldn't do it.

This is wrong on many levels and has been hashed out so many times that everyone on both sides should be familiar with the fact that people own themselves, not the government.

But this is also a *huge* mistake. If you think this country is divided now, give it another month or two under this regime. Jan 6th was a horrible riot. This action could turn things into a real insurrection."
2021-09-10 14:44:34,"It is within the right of government to protect its people from a virulent and potentially lethal spreading disease.  It is perfectly reasonable to require those that who choose to be present in public spaces show proof of vaccination. This is fundamentally no different than requiring drivers to obtain a license before being allowed behind the wheel. No one is legally required to be vaccinated nor to get a drivers license, but to failure to do  so limits their public mobility under the law. 

It is a matter of personal choice.  Choosing to be among others during a rampant plague simply demands that all reasonable steps be taken to protect the vast majority of citizens from infection.

Why would any person with a shred of social decency willfully choose to put others at risk, when that same risk can be enormously reduced by proven scientific methods?"

We're only being asked to comply with a needle prick in our arm to keep our friends, family and neighbors safe. No one is being asked to turn over their phone records or online history,  which by the way,  you all have already done as of 20 years ago.  Think about that. Perspective is key."

2021-09-10 15:26:05,"For those who are having trouble with the difference of freedom to choose to vaccinate vs. women's rights that Texas is blatantly thwarting:

Biden supports women's right to choose what to do with their body and their health. Sometimes that does lead to abortion, though not typically. However, vaccines are a PUBLIC health emergency. Body autonomy is a right protected by the constitution as decided in Griswold vs. Connecticut (1965), McFall vs. Shimp (1978) and Roe vs. Wade (1973). Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. The Court's decision articulated the view that individual liberty is not absolute and is subject to the police power of the state. 

When someone's right to be ignorant and selfish (not wear a mask, especially when they are sick or not getting vaccinated prevents HERD IMMUNITY), then they are part of the public heath crisis and hurting EVERYONE."

Clear protocols and chains of command to manage potential pandemic threats were totally and willfully destroyed by Trump. Furthermore, under Trump the GOP turned over the management of of a growing international health crisis to unprepared state and local governments. 

Americans need to know how many lives could have been spared if Trump had not disbanded the CDC Pandemic Response Team in 2018 and slashed operational funding of the CDC experts; if Trump had listened to the early warnings of intelligence agencies and the CDC about a pandemic arriving from China; if Trump had not said the pandemic was a left wing media hoax and then advised people to drink bleach and lysol.. Americans need to know how many lives could have been saved if at the start of this crisis, Trump would have done everything possible to lessen the spread of COVID including stressing the importance wearing a mask. 

It is one issue to be unprepared for a pandemic, it is another matter to deliberately undo preparations that have been made for such a disaster and then to pretend there is nothing to worry about ----hundreds of thousands of Americans have died because Donald Trump was in the White House. 

The Republican Party leadership is continuing this lethal strategy. A loyal Republican must reject vaccination and be willing to infect innocent family members and neighbors.  That is the hard line GOP policy."

But the drafters of those laws assumed, mistakenly it seems, that they would only be used reasonably.

If the OSHA rule ever makes it to the Supreme Court, it is likely to suffer the same fate as the eviction rule.

Congress really needs to act to create these mandates.  It should have started acting back in April 2020.  Too bad Congress was more interested in a fool's errand of impeaching Trump."

Joe wisely said enough.  Mandates will begin.  Many people will be saved and hopefully they will help to end the spread of covid and its variants.

disclaimer I've been vaccinated fully. Also, I write a lot...

the problem that no one seems to admit is that no matter how right this speech feels, our casualties have already surfaced from coronavirus.

we've lost too many precious souls and lives from this virus. we've also become more class divided in the United States than ever before.

I think my unpopular viewpoint right now is that we've lost the true war of ourselves. we have become so belligerent with each other that it's almost impossible to speak to one another. 

So although I respect Biden and his tenacity to do what he feels is right to keep us safe, I feel this will only add fuel to the fire.  people who disapprove will use this as a rallying cry and more stones shall be cast. we need a new way to reach people - a new strategy to salvage our American culture! This is the true war.

so in relation to President Biden's speach, I'd have rather seen a humble Biden... I know it feels good to see the passion and strength of his message tonight. but I think humble is what America needs even though it's not necessarily what America wants. We need action, but we need to act together for a change."

2021-09-10 16:35:30,"I'm reminded of a NYT piece by David Brooks -

""If you don’t breathe the spirit of the nation, if you don’t have a fierce sense of belonging to each other, you’re not going to sacrifice for the common good. We’re confronted with a succession of wicked problems and it turns out we’re not even capable of putting on a friggin’ mask.""

We have a very large group people who consider themselves experts on everything and who talk a lot about their “rights.” But they really don’t understand their responsibilities as citizens to act for the common good.

We have a free, effective, safe and widely available vaccine that will prevent this disease and every responsible politician and infectious disease expert has made this abundantly clear. I guess that president Biden was waiting for people to act in the best interest of the country. Clearly he underestimated the amount of patriotism and good will in our country in 2021.

People have spoken of the WWII generation as the greatest generation in terms of their sacrifice, patriotism and selfless service to the country on the war fronts and at home. We are clearly living through one of the worst generations in our history since so many balk at the simple and relatively painless measures of using a mask and getting vaccinated.

MMR, polio, smallpox, hepatitis.  These were true vaccines.

What therapies are you offering people?  What nutritional and health advice are you offering people?   Probably at least 50% of people who have died  received suboptimal care.

Vaccines will not cure this pandemic.  This polemic just creates a more divided America.  It's more binary thinking.  It's my way or the highway.  You are creating a new class of untouchables.  Your next scapegoat.  Us and Them.  

The Israeli studies,  UC San Diego studies,  Martha's Vineyard study, all demonstrate this vaccine is fully protective.  If it is so preventive, why do you need a booster?  Why are you still wearing masks?

Id pay for an antibody test, why is this not an option? If my antibodies are low Ill get vaccinated. I would. But if my antibodies are fine I dont want one. Im going to just get a religious exemption if this doesnt become an option. Thank God I dont live in California where evidently even that is not possible. Im also glad I dont work for a company with over 100 employees, and now I never will. Seems like like the President is allowed to use corporations to enforce decisions he makes alone (authoritarian much?) in this nation now. Dems wont be in power forever. I wonder what a Republican will do with these new dictatorial powers? I really dont want to find out."
2021-09-10 16:24:34,"A lot of the problems with this pandemic come down to a lack of critical thinking skills. It's the same lack of critical thinking skills that motivated the American public to vote for literally the most unqualified person be president, who then dismantled governmental agencies that could have prevented the full impact of this illness.

 And all of that comes down to poor public education. The only way that we get to have a good functioning democracy is if we have a well-educated citizenry. And quiet as it's kept, or not really that quiet actually, we do not have a well-educated citizenry. We have a bunch of folks that are trained to do tasks including the task of doing what they're told and listening to the loudest voice in the room. 

So we've had two major disasters back-to-back in this country. The first was the Trump presidency, and now it's this pandemic. We need to put our whole backs into protecting public education, and that includes making sure that we are all teaching the reality of the history of our country, we are teaching actual science, and that our funding of schools is based upon the actual outcome that we want to have when a child graduates. And not on ridiculous things like property taxes.

It's the ability today to commit to a long-term plan. We need to be the old man planting trees in whose shade we may will never recline."

In substance, republicans have violated their oath of office and decided the time was right for a takeover of our democracy. Fortunately, it appears Biden recognizes the threat and has given up on trying to reason with the criminal republicans. Garland's speech on the Texas imposition of Sharia law was refreshing.

After all is said and done, we are a nation of laws and when those laws are willfully broken, prosecution is the only choice. Lock 'em up, President Biden. Those of us who served are 100% behind you."

How powerful is the President of the United States when he can force companies to force medical procedures on citizens, with apparantly no input at all coming from the Legislative Branch of government? Democrats wont be in power forever, I hope they understand the precedents they are setting here on executive power. Also brilliant timing. Look at the graph of the 1918 Spanish Flu, everything has lined up perfectly between Covid and that event. It was smart to mandate vaccines right when the disease will begin to naturally disappear so they can take all the credit for it. Brilliant to wait for the top of the last wave to make the decree."
2021-09-10 16:47:06,"Why has Biden so far refused to mandate vaccination for air travel?  He can do this with a stroke of the pen.

It is time for Biden to walk the talk and implement a “No Vax - No Fly” rule, and now."
2021-09-10 18:03:19,I support President Biden 100 percent and only wish it had been done sooner! Of course vaccines should be mandated in a pandemic. I’m also thankful for him getting help out to all areas of the country during disasters and not just throwing paper towels.
2021-09-10 17:23:01,"Biden came into office at a time when we knew far more about COVID than much of last year (including the extreme danger in nursing homes), when there were plenty of masks, ventilators, etc., and with three vaccines already deployed (and no shortage of toilet paper). Yet, if current trends continue, there could well be as many COVID deaths under ""Biden's watch""--in his first year or less--as under Trump's.

Democrats and Biden promised us that they could handle the pandemic better than Trump did. Yes, there's vaccine hesitancy and the delta variant, but in 2020 there was NO vaccine to be hesitant about and tens of thousands died of COVID 1.0 before scientists knew much about it.

As an independent voter (who never voted for Trump), I keep wondering if either party--or presidents from either party--will ever take responsibility for ANYTHING. I don't know, but I highly suspect that this mandate is just more politicizing of a cruel pandemic, an attempt to keep ""Biden's numbers"" below ""Trump's numbers"" (i.e., COVID deaths).

In the meantime, it's become very clear that the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News should all run disclaimers: ""For entertainment purposes only."" And it's also pretty clear at this point that 2022 will be a disaster for Democrats."
2021-09-10 16:14:21,"Political parties/elected persons aren't football teams that you root for no matter what.  The role of elected persons is to act in the good of the country.  I believe Trump lost due to his unwillingness to act when COVID began.  I believe that Biden was elected to act on COVID.  And he has.   I believe that the majority of Americans support vaccine mandates for our lives, our economy and the good of the country."
2021-09-10 17:56:49,No shoes. No shirt. No vaccine. No service.
2021-09-10 17:27:33,"It is really too bad that getting this pandemic under control has come to this but I am all for these mandates.  I would go even further and tell the unvaccinated that their hospital bills will NOT be covered by the taxpayers.  Insurance companies need to tell people they will NOT be covered if they are not vaccinated. I am sick to death of hearing about the civil rights of the unvaccinated.  We are in the midst of a pandemic!  A massive public health crisis and if some peoples ""civil rights"" get a bit bruised so be it.  Healthy people eligible for vaccination need to get with the program or lose their jobs!  Businesses need to step up and tell employees to get vaccinated or look for another job. And finally to borrow a strategy from DeSantis, no more federal money to states where the governors refuse to help get people vaccinated and to allow mask mandates."
2021-09-10 16:15:46,"If you don't meet the requirements of your employer, you lose your employment. Your employer likely has a dress code of some variety, rules about attendance, all sorts of requirements that are conditions of employment.

Your rights are not being violated if a vaccine mandate is added, because it is being mandated universally. If vaccine mandates targeted a group or groups in a discriminatory manner, that would be different - the protected categories are race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, or gender identity), national origin, age (40 or older), disability and genetic information (including family medical history). There are only two religions that actively discourage vaccination (Christian Scientists and the Dutch Reformed Church - <a href=""https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/blog/religion-vaccination-confusion"" target=""_blank"">https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/blog/religion-vaccination-confusion</a>), and there are states that have banned religious exemptions in the name of the greater good (list of laws/exemptions: <a href=""https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx</a>).

Legitimate medical exemptions are rare, and anyone who qualifies for one should be able to get plenty of documentation from the appropriate physician.

The bottom line is that if you don't want to get vaccinated, no one can make you - but don't claim discrimination because you don't like the outcome of your choice. Also remember, like smoking in public, your choice affects those around you - and you have a responsibility to society too."
2021-09-10 19:11:48,"At last the President develops a spine.  He should add to this not authorizing federal aid to any state that prevents vaccination requirements.  As Chief Executive, he can delay the release of funds to states that are preventing vaccination mandates without Congressional approval. However, at this stage, I believe there are cross-over Republicans who will not challenge the mandates."
2021-09-10 18:38:33,"""Follow the science?""  Doesn't that include natural immunity from previous infection?  Suspicious that there is absolutely no official mention of this when there are numerous studies out that show natural immunity exists and seems to be more durable than the vaccines.  So everyone should just get the vaccine without question when they aren't addressing a third of the equation?  

Whatever happened to ""question everything?""  Oh yeah, liberal herd think: Just do what you're told and question nothing.

I have been advocating with the state and the day program to mandate vaccines, to no avail.   Today, I found out that they are mandating vaccines for all employees; I can sleep a little better now.   Now, if any state refuses to go along, the President should refuse to send aid of any kind to said state.  Thank you again, Mr. President, I knew you  had a spine."
2021-09-10 19:33:46,"Indiana's Gov. Holcomb says the mandate is ""a bridge too far"".   While Covid hospitalization rates are increasing dramatically and Indiana continues to lag well behind the US in vaccination rates, Holcomb has essentially adopted a hands off approach in the last six months to the point of being invisible on the pandemic.  But he did take time to issue his statement on our freedom to endanger everyone else.  Thanks for all that, Gov.  I wonder how high the fatality rate has to go - five percent, ten percent, or more - before Holcomb would concede that getting a Covid vaccination might justify a mandate, just like with smallpox."
2021-09-10 20:13:48,"Are there truly people who think they have the right to remain un-vaccinated, circulate in public and condemn others to die as a result of their personal behavior?   The fact that a TV clown like  Trump could be elected in 2016 says that this is perfectly possible. Scary indeed!!"
2021-09-10 20:37:01,"One commenter said this of Biden:  ""At last the President develops a spine.""

Biden may not be the brightest bulb in the chandelier, but a spine he has without question.

In mid-spring he announced a goal of 70% of the country vaccinated by July 4th, and it turns out he only reached 67%, and the media and right wingers jumped all over him, calling him a failure, when the so-called president before him did not set ANY goals for vaccination.

Biden also got us out of Afghanistan when all the presidents before him lacked the spine to do it, including Obama.

Whatever shortcomings Biden has, and all presidents have shortcomings, lack of spine is NOT one of them."
2021-09-10 19:17:04,"I call on ALL to boycott businesses that don't require their workers to be vaccinated. I'd love to see a website (think Angie's list & BBB) which verifies the vaccine status of workers and promotes those businesses to the public. I would choose, given the choice, to spend my $$$ at businesses for which has a 100% vaccine compliance for their workers. Moving forward, as a Landlord/property owner, I will not rent to unvaccinated people 12+ years and older. Tenants who et sick/die of Covid, aren't able to pay the rent."
2021-09-10 21:05:55,A friend of mine says she knows of five people who have either quit or been fired due to the vaccine mandate.  The people she knows are autoimmune compromised.  Is there a medical exemption for people who have  medically verifiable proof they cannot get the shot?  What about those who are allergic to an ingredient in the COVID vaccine?
2021-09-10 21:23:02,"@Mike

Biden has been patient long enough. We have all been patient long enough. Now we see infants and toddlers on ventilators. Biden encouraged and pleaded and cajoled. That approach did not work. 

And as for his opponents using the mandates as a rallying cry—please. They would have found something else as a rallying cry, if not this. They always do. 

In the interest of public health, Biden has done the right thing. I wish he had done this even sooner."
2021-09-10 22:25:14,Biden has essentially mandated weekly testing for federal employees and contractors. He allowed exception for those that are vaccinated. This is similar to what the PGA tour put in place for players and caddies in April although they did provide access to rapid tests. It helps keep workers safe and healthy.
2021-09-10 22:05:21,"""our patience is wearing thin""?

that sounds very authoritarian."
2021-09-10 22:44:29,"There are many commenters here who do not understand the meaning of ""violation of individual rights."" Unvaccinated people are not necessarily violating your rights. Only people who are infected with COVID, know it, and choose to venture out in public spaces are violating your rights.

However, as we now know, VACCINATED people can also harbor and transmit viral loads equal to those from unvaccinated people. This may be rare (it's not certain at this point how rare). But since vaccinated people are more likely to be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, and since they are given a pass in public spaces, they are in a sense MORE of a threat than unvaccinated people.

So, if a vaccinated person tests positive for COVID and chooses to venture out in public, they are violating your rights just as much as a similar unvaccinated person.

All of this just underscores the need for readily available tests, and the FDA is the main culprit. At least four companies had fast, at home antigen tests ready to go--for an estimated $1-$5 each--within the first half of last year. Yet the FDA only approved the Quickvue and BinaxNOW tests (and a couple of others I think) in March of this year, over a year into the pandemic. These tests are now available over-the-counter at CVS for about $11 per test. But the slow approval by the FDA was a major failure.

(Yes, I know there are concerns about the accuracy of antigen tests; but they might have saved thousands or tens of thousands of lives.)"
2021-09-10 22:10:58,People should be free to refuse the vaccines as long as they live alone and refrain from breathing in public.
2021-09-10 23:01:41,"I am rooting for Mr Biden. He is trying to keep himself above pettiness and do the right thing. I feel upset by the pugilistic attitude taken by several politicians, newsmedia outlets and various individuals who really should be minding their own business when they have not a real clue. 

Anarchy enabled by social media and modern life which gives people the luxury to ponfitificate and preen because they are well fed and dont have to worry about basic survival anymore. Power in the hands of the poorly or ill-informed or the vengeful is wreaking havoc!

A deep weariness is seeping into my bones after months of trying to stay upbeat."

I don’t want to loose my life because of some unpatriotic selfish GOP refusing to get vaccinated.  The unvaccinated need to stay home . LOL
2021-09-11 00:26:41,Voted for a Biden but hey what choice did anyone have.   Vaccinated but this mandate kiss the House Senate and White House goodbye and deservedly so

2021-09-10 11:09:57,"The President will gain far more politically from a strong economy and an attenuated epidemic than he will lose.

If he is making a mistake here -- compassionate, economic, or political -- it is that the measures aren't a strong as they could be, or should.

Vaccine mandates for workers should not just cover the largest businesses.

Interstate travel should be banned for those who aren't vaccinated.

The time to vaccination should be as short as possible, given supply.

Booster shots should be authorized, as well as the vaccination of young children.

Vaccination should be required for medical staff of any establishment that accepts Medicaid and Medicare, and it should be a prerequisite for any kind of government aid.

Quite simply, we must get to near universal vaccination, and do so as quickly as possible."
2021-09-10 11:15:42,I can't see how the minuscule effect this will have on the vaccination rate will amount to any more than a rounding error on the infection rate? Are there a large number of unvaccinated Federal employees in West Virginia and Wyoming? Will arm twisting and divisive language serve as enticement or cement resistance? Those are the only two states with less than 60% of adults unvaccinated (one dose). The US is well on the path to full enough vaccination and at this point millions have contacted the virus and have developed natural immunity. Many have both contacted the virus and been vaccinated.
2021-09-10 11:15:49,"While many vaccine-hesitant/refusing will be angry at these mandates, they are not a violation of personal freedom. This country has angry history of mandating vaccines (eg polio, smallpox) and collective action (eg selective service) for what it feels is the common good."
2021-09-10 11:42:31,"I just renewed my grocery delivery service for another six months, not expecting to be entering many stores this winter. The virus is probably a boon for FreshDirect, Amazon Fresh and other delivery-based services but it's not so good for the local mom-and-pop shops that rely on foot traffic and impulse purchases. And though I'd much rather shop in local businesses, when mask wearing and social distancing are no longer enforced, it's simply not worth the stress."
2021-09-10 11:47:37,"I live the most vaccinated state in the our country.  But still, I don’t eat in at restaurants, I continue to curtail my indoor public activity to necessity only, and I where I mask when I do.  I was a frequent flier for work but have only been on a plane once in 2 years, and that’s not likely to change soon.  We have the Delta variant, the Mu variant and the virus continues to mutate.  I don’t trust my fellow Americans, especially tourists coming to Vermont, to do the right thing.  So we eat at home, shop on Amazon and don’t vacation.  That is the new normal.  A vaccine mandate won’t change that."
2021-09-10 11:21:09,Biden is right in his approach.  Until we reach herd immunity the virus will continue to wreck havoc in our lives.  It's that simple. The GOP prefers that this continues to happen so that they can win in the midterms and beyond.  Personally I'd like return to a somewhat normal life again in the next 6-12 months instead of playing hide and seek with Covid for the next 5-10 years.
2021-09-10 11:34:47,"The republican misinformation campaign that has politicized vaccinations must be countered.  Imagine these same republicans skittering around the kitchen floor complaining about all the vaccinations we, as school children, received in the 60s; we'd still be fighting polio.  The irony is, they're thinning their own ranks.  But they are also putting everyone who has a shred of decency at risk...the decency to get vaccinated, the decency to wear a mask, the decency to be thoughtful for your fellow human being.  Mandate!  Yes!"
2021-09-10 11:13:14,"For once I agree.  This is a fight for the economy, an economy free of heavy handed governmental control.  The vaccine mandate will cause major civil disobedience and create a division in this country that will last for years.  

The good news is that the Supreme Court will knock down this totally unconstitutional fiasco.  All they have to do is use VP Harris' own words, uttered the same day, 

“When people are able to make choices without government interference for themselves in terms of their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their family, in consultation with whomever they may choose, we’re a stronger society,” said Harris."
2021-09-10 11:38:05,"I think and hope President Biden's actions are but step one. Clearly he will have to go further, i.e., extending the mandate to all businesses, creating a vaccine passport to facilitate economic and travel participation for the vaccinated, banning interstate and international travel for anyone not vaccinated, and stabilizing the health insurance market by ending coverage for those who refuse vaccination absent legitimate, doctor-documented health reasons, or legitimate, clergy-documented religious reasons (and let's face it, there is no Christian sect that has legitimate doctrinal opposition to vaccination, the same for Judaism, Islam, and any other deist religion). Once we get to the point where there is really no place anyone who is deliberately and unjustifiably unvaccinated can go - not the grocery store, nor a restaurant or bar, nor any other store or mercantile outlet, etc. this madness will end, we will obtain sufficient vaccination rates to promote herd immunity for the vaccinated and the legitimately unvaccinated, America can start vaccinating the world, and this pandemic will recede in the rear view mirror."
2021-09-10 11:24:16,"And the same people that ignore the science and the vaccine , will be the first to complain that their workplaces aren’t open because the pandemic continues. That is, if they’re alive to do the complaining."

2021-09-10 11:05:00,"So now the claim is that people aren't accepting jobs because of fear of Covid.  This false premise will fall apart once the new jobs numbers come out for September and October.  Cut off from overly generous unemployment benefits, people will be forced off their couch and back into the working world.  Now that eviction moratoriums have been declared illegal (as a federal vaccine mandate will be), people will have an added incentive to actually pay their rent."
2021-09-10 11:34:05,"My body, my choice! Right?

If the vaccine I have taken protects me so well how am I at risk if others choose to do otherwise?"
2021-09-10 11:18:36,I'm glad that Biden is mandating vaccines. It is long overdue. He also needs to suppress media disinformation which endangers public health. As for those who still refuse -- quarantine is the only rational solution. Such a move is still voluntary as those quarantined can still opt to be vaccinated.
2021-09-10 11:29:16,"I am flummoxed as to why the President is being blamed for the obstinacy of citizens very reticent to get vaccinated.  Particularly when he has been all in on getting all Americans vaccinated since taking office.   The good part is that he is not giving up.  Health care workers are burning out faster than normal.  The drop out after getting certified in the first 2 years is around 40%.  Talk about being between a rock and hard place, this is it."
2021-09-10 11:33:04,"It was quite some time ago when I first heard about the Delta variant, and now, here we are.  The real danger is the emergence of other variants that will blunt the effectiveness of the vaccines, even as the necessity of boosters is being considered. 

The anti-vaxxers are infringing upon my personal freedom to get back to a normal life.  They are dragging us all down. We'll all have ""personal freedom"" when we can finally put this behind us.  

This entire pandemic has been marked by willful irrational ignorance, when fear of possible side effects to a vaccine seems to somehow be more important than the side effects of death and economic hardship.  

Sorry, but your personal freedom ends when you endanger my welfare.  If not, then there would be no consequences for driving drunk, without a seatbelt, driver license, or insurance. 

Enough already.  Bring on the mandates."
2021-09-10 11:12:00,The only way to stop the development of more deadly virus variants is to have as many vaccinated as possible. Each of us has a duty to each other as well as our selves. Maybe this is finally something that can unite us. Sad that it must be a pandemic but tragedy is often the way people find common ground. We must get this under control. Flu season is already here and a double whammy would be devastating.
2021-09-10 11:22:53,"The Republicans in pushing back on this are playing a grim game with the lives of their supporters.  

They want Biden to fail, so that they can assume leadership of the country and continue their cuts to taxes and services to the American people.  But in raging that the Biden mandates are taking away their so-called freedoms, they are taking their supporters down with them.  

Wouldn't a wiser strategy be to work hard to keep your constituents alive and well?  As Mr. Fernández-Villaverde says, dead people may not receive much welfare, which I'm assuming is a good thing according to Republicans, but they are also not out voting for the GOP.  Where's the political logic in that?"
2021-09-10 11:10:24,"Accentuate the positive. Biden is taking action to save lives. That is what the title of this analysis should say.

2021-09-10 11:54:48,Of course it is! Just as the Republicans are willing to watch their unmasked and unvaccinated supporters die in order to score political points. This is where we are at folks.

The man is not a psychiatrist, which is what these people really need.  I am experiencing severe bouts of satisfaction these days when I read about non-vaccinated nurses being fired and maskless high school students being yanked out of classrooms and segregated.

Biden has been more than patient.  It is time to start cracking down on these public health menaces so the rest of us can live, and try to regain a semblance of normalcy after more than a year and a half of disruption and death."

2021-09-10 11:57:44,"Well finally, finally, President Biden has done something right. About time he quit caving to the freedom-to-infect-others crowd. Still re-listening to my audio book “Truman”, he too lost patience with the railroad strike after WWII; and threatened to draft the strikers. 

Patience, persuasion, bargaining, only go so far. And if these few recalcitrant governors persist in punishing responsible masking, vaccinations, the president may not be able to draft them, but maybe look into that CDC ability to quarantine - that the latest Supreme Court decision mentioned. Can we, quarantine states? 

Like so many others, I cannot believe an entire political party stands behind allowing this virus to spread, mutate, kill. And now it’s starting to kill our children. And they actually think this will win at the polls??"

 But then they must be (a) isolated from the rest of use, who don't want to die; and (b)denied any kind of hospital or emergency room care.  Instead, the vaccination refusers need to be quarantined and allowed to freely endure covid-19 safely away from the rest of us.
    
In short, they mustn't be allowed the freedom to spread a deadly disease among the rest of us in the name of 'freedom'.  That's as every bit as much murder as biological warfare or as as a mass shooting."

This Summer as Delta surged I informed my 12 person company that we would require 100% vaccination for continued employment. Failure to be vaccinated by Labor Day would result in lay-off until proof of vaccination was presented and would be permanent for anyone absolutely refusing to be vaccinated. I simply will not put my highly skilled, highly valued employees at risk, my company can't afford to lose anybody and we can't afford another broad economic shut down, voluntary or mandated, even with programs like PPP.  Today we are 100% vaccinated, my three, 'I'll-never-let-them- put-that-stuff-in-my-arm' holdouts are vaccinated. Persuasion, backed up by consequences works. And as Summer ends and we find ourselves indoors with windows closed and air circulation more limited, a strict mask mandate, even for our vaccinated staff, we be back in place.

       While it is true that many folks that are vaccine-hesitant will potentially be outraged at these mandates, it is not a deviation of freedom typically experienced by Americans. For example, many vaccine mandates, similar to this one, have been passed in the interest of slowing the spread of polio and smallpox. All in all, I find myself relieved by this news, considering I feared Joe Biden would decide to go light-handed with mandating vaccination status, to perhaps have an easier election in 2024. Let us all hope that with a larger community being protected, we can kick corona to the curb with a larger community being protected."
2021-09-10 11:33:34,"The delta variant and it’s impact is not specific to President Biden and the US. I am just returning to the US from France. As the Delta variant spiked in a France, they stiffened Covid-related requirements. One can not go to a restaurant or store here without proof of vaccination. Masks required. Some protests from the hesitant? Sure. Fine, but the rules are still the rules. 
While the infection rate spiked here in mid-summer, it is now less than half the infection rate in the US. And one-eighth the rate of Texas  or Florida. 
I can imagine that the ecomomy and hospitals here will therefore recover faster."

This President is not the first in History to do this and he will not be the last. The unvaccinated crowd is putting the lives of those who did the right thing in jeopardy. If Governors of the States have overreached their power to threaten and bully the school Superintendents to withhold their salaries, the President is using his Federal power to make sure these minor conspiracy theorists Governors do not come in the way of public health and safety."

This just reinforces the myth of Republicans being good at business and economics in general.

Which begs the question: what is Republican ideology actually good for?

We've seen a lot of polls lately about President Biden's approval ratings, but when it comes to the Republican Party?  Crickets.  My guess is that its approval closely matches the percentage of the unvaccinated.

Coincidence?  I think not."

Neither the pediatrician, the urgent care physician or the allergist knew what was wrong with him.  After two months they finally ordered blood work and then the CDC called.

2021-09-10 11:58:51,"So, the motivation of people being paid as much by the government -- that is. we taxpayers -- to not work as they were making to work is that they are afraid of contracting COVID? 

Here is a more plausible theory; They are not working because it would be foolish to do a boring or taxing job when someone is giving you a check not to do it, and freeing you up to make a little more through a side hustle, or just to chill out."
2021-09-10 12:00:04,"It is unlikely that much will come of this.  Why?  First, it has been estimated that between a few hundred thousand and five hundred thousand federal government workers are not vaccinated.  Is Joe really going to fire thousands - tens of thousands of federal government workers who still refuse to become vaccinated?  

Second, our fight with some of these southern governors is not over vaccinations but over masking.  Yet, Joe politically spit in their face accusing these folks of being openingly anti-vaccination.  These misleading statements from Joe will only harden the political divide.

I had dinner with a senior regional medical executive recently and it was clear that between vaccinations in our region (nearly 70% fully vaccinated) and those who already have had Covid that our area is or very near ""herd immunity"".  Yet, Joe did not mention the ""herd immunity"" target.  In fact, it seems to have disappeared from public discourse.  Why?  It was the number one target only six months ago.  Herd immunity was the pathway back to pre-pandemic normality.  So, no mention of this once vital target seems to cheapen the necessity of vaccination efforts.  People remember what they were forcefully told six months ago.  Not hearing about this all important goal since has help compromise the urgency for vaccination and masking for some.

So, Joe's six points make sense but I have little confidence that they will have meaningful impact."

2021-09-10 12:08:48,"The last time Americans were subject to stringent restraints and mandates was WWII.

We couldn't buy certain products. Families had ration coupons. Prices were under federal control and blackout rules were in effect.

But we were at war and were gripped with fear of an invasion. That fear turned out to be unfounded. But fear and misinformation driven by government resulted in the mass internment of over 120,000 Japanese Americans.

Throughout this pandemic or epidemic I have been struck by the scientific reports that seemed to shift like blowing sand.

Masks, no, then yes, then two, then one. Touching surfaces, no, then yes. Social distancing maybe, then yes, then it couldn't hurt.

I accept that our understanding of the science is evolving. But how do we develop a consensus under those circumstances and when do we translate such uncertain science into very certain policy?

The president has made many claims but I see very little scientific evidence and even less scientific debate.

Instead, we have frightening media censorship. It you don't follow the narrative you are the enemy.

But one very large collection of scientific data stands out. It's Sweden. They have managed the virus without the measures Biden calls for.

They have left their economy open, educated their kids and did well with the exception of protecting their elder care homes.

Their case fatalities are lower than the UK, Germany, France and the US.

How did their leaders manage this? And why can't ours?"
2021-09-10 12:09:14,"If “the business of America is business,” then the U.S. and the wealthier nations have to step up in a huge way to vaccinate the poorer countries as a matter of self-interest because moral considerations have not been much of an inducement.

As of yesterday, 1.9% of the poor countries have received at least one dose.  11 billion doses are needed to fully vaccinate 70% of the world’s population.  As of yesterday 5.6 billion does have been given.  The total needed won’t be achieved until some time in 2023 which gives the coronavirus a big window of opportunity to potentially mutate into something more serious than the delta variant.  While Biden’s larger pledge is a movement in the right direction it is still not enough to achieve self-interest."

For that matter I see no reason not to go to any store and shop.  If you are careful and go early and mask up and are fully vaccinated you are fine.  I think people are a little freaked out because of the news media hype about the variant.  Of course the Delta variant is scary but if you are careful, wear  a mask, are vaccinated you should be fine."

I told my stylist that Covid was very high here, and he shrugged and said it was high everywhere.  I’ve been in Northern California the last few months, and the contrast is glaring.

You cannot break through this denialism that has normalized a deadly epidemic and fetishized masks and vaccines.  No reason, data, or deaths will change minds.  Only an immediate economic consequence or perhaps having Covid in your family will change things.  Increased insurance, boycotts by customers or workers, fines, or mandates.

Where I work, there is realism.  85% of the students and 95% of the faculty are vaccinated so far.  There are weekly test requirements for those not vaccinated.  Like vaccinations, tests are easily available on campus.  There are mandatory daily health checks, mandatory masking and other acknowledgments in terms of teaching.  Classes are taught on campus but students may attend by Zoom if they wish.

My stylist asked leading questions.  He heard there was a vaccine mandate.  Was that true?  Yes, I said but no big deal with the great majority already vaccinated and easy access.  Was our enrollment suffering?  Not for me since I’m teaching an overload with a waiting list.  He wanted to hear negatives but didn’t get them.

Others supply the strategic strings to make those of his ilk dance. There are always simple folk who gather round the huckster’s wagon to purchase his tin pots and home-brewed elixirs. 

I believe/fear the Covid vaccine mandates will provide them with the excuse they’ve awaited to initiate their armed insurrection. Progressives have not been the ones stockpiling armaments and organizing militias, which may have been a huge miscalculation on our parts.

On CNN with Wolf Blitzer CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said  “Our vaccines are working exceptionally well,” “They continue to work well for Delta, with regard to severe illness and death – they prevent it. But what they can't do anymore is prevent transmission."" 
 
So, what the vaccines can't do anymore is prevent transmission. 
 
Viral carriage and transmission by vaccinated people is demonstrated by the recent outbreak in Barnstable County, MA. Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 Infections, Including COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Infections, Associated with Large Public Gatherings — Barnstable County, Massachusetts, July 2021 | MMWR (cdc.gov). There, 74% of those infected in the outbreak were fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and, and even more alarming, the vaccinated had as much amount of virus in their nose than the unvaccinated that were infected. 

Is the case that a person should get vaccinated to reduce their own symptoms and possibility of death should they become infected, thus not taking a hospital bed? Does natural immunity (had Covid and recovered) and co-morbidities come into the decision making?"

Private schools were the work around for the religious and affluent anti-vaccination parents.  All of a sudden it became much harder to send your child to any school without being vaccinated.  Our local private school lost 20 percent of their pupils, and had to restructure to survive.

There was no big backlash, because the majority of New Yorkers understood that to prevent their children from getting measles, a dangerous disease, all children needed to be vaccinated.

I personally do not have much patience for those who whine about this being a Biden mistake, that in the middle of a pandemic America can’t have basic public health safety rules to protect EVERYONE.  To those folks I say grow up.  You are doing nothing less than killing our country for the sake of your “personal freedoms” .   This mandate in times of crisis is what we hire a leader to do, and it is outrageous to suggest that this gives a future leader a nefarious precedent.

The Refusal of the vaccination is not because of the Presidents inability to persuade.   It is because of Republican leaders shamefully  using COVID/vaccination for their on political power gains.    Remember, the Trump hosted non masked events at the White House and all across the country and current republican office holders, congresspersons, senators, attended validating lies and misinformation about the vaccine.

2021-09-10 12:23:43,"Better late than never but why did it take our President almost 8 months to begin? In short why is the pandemic much worse now than when he assumed the presidency? Why did he provide an off-ramp for non-federal workers by allowing them to be tested, not vaccinated? Testing does not prevent covid, vaccines do and workers can game testing. Once fully vaccinated you are vaccinated. Boosters  are needed now. We all have heard of breakthrough infections. Why can't his vaccine experts find out when the CDC will approve them? Why limit the mandate, iffy as it is, to companies with over 100 employees. Small business is the heart of the country. Why not 10-20 employees? Why can't his FAA mandate vaccines to fly?The unvaccinated fly. Why is there no covid czar to avoid confusion and who has no political constituency?  I have this fear that we'll look back at this moment and regret we missed a chance to finally contain, if not eradicate, this damnable virus."
2021-09-10 12:47:55,"Joe Biden gave people months to do the right thing and get vaccinated. A substantial minority decided to stamp their feet and say you can't make me. Meanwhile, the new variants fly around and the governor of Florida makes book. I've been forcing myself to read some of the anti vaccine froth in the last few days and none of it makes any sense. What it comes down to is they don't care if people die, they don't care if health care workers burn out and they love Trump. True nihilism."
2021-09-10 12:50:50,"The burden of being responsible is always placed on the same people.  We pay higher insurance rates to cover the uninsured, we adopt pets that the selfish leave behind, we sit in traffic jams because someone wanted to get car length ahead, we pay higher municipal taxes to put other peoples kids through school… and on queue we get vaccinated, don’t travel and wear masks, to allow the few to do whatever they want.  This is what American individualism has become."
2021-09-10 12:56:45,"Trump’s biggest political miscalculation was that the economy and Covid were not  entwined.

From the beginning, President Biden has understood the need to get beyond Covid in order to bring the economy back to normal.

The vaccines are the ticket to normalcy.  Making the vaccines easily available and free should have been all that was needed to get sufficient numbers vaccinated in relatively short order.  

Unfortunately, extremist media, political, and religious leaders saw that there was an opportunity to promote themselves by fanning the flames of unwarranted mistrust.  So they have done whatever they could to undermine the push for vaccination, even to the point of promoting unproven horse worm medicine as a cure.

After weeks of cajoling and trying to persuade, President Biden has gone to the private industry toolbox of vaccine mandates.  

It would be a boon to this country if the extremists started putting country over party."
2021-09-10 12:38:04,"Policy makers and the media keep framing the narrative as being about the economy.  The economy is incidental; it is about returning to operable civilization.  The binary “your money or your life” positioning of the choices we have to make during the entire pandemic was a way to make it a moral dichotomy, when what we should have been — and should be — talking about is a multifaceted approach to living life in a way that can mitigate harm without expecting the elimination of risk."
2021-09-10 12:24:24,"Here is Switzerland most everybody is fully vaccinated and most are out eating in restaurants including me.
I was vaccinated in January and February -
My primary physician even checked my immunity  status- should be 50 or more whatever, She told me my score stands at 2000 
At the time I got Moderna.
I believe they did me right and in America is just as good.
Get vaccinated and live and enjoy your life.





y my doctor checked on my immunity and found it to be some 2000 -needed ois more than 50"
2021-09-10 12:36:27,"It really is astounding when you think about it: the republicans are literally willing to sacrifice the lives of thousands of their own constituents to Covid in order to ""win"" in politics, to ""own"" the dems and gain more power.

One of Noam Chomsky's observations about American imperialism is that eventually what the U.S. government has done to ""third world"" populations it will eventually bring home to practice on its own.  Not too astounding."
2021-09-10 13:00:59,"People should get vaccinated, no question about that.

But the idea of fighting for an economy that left so many living paycheck to paycheck and unhappy, why?! While obviously being unemployed is stressful (been there) I think many saw the light for the first time, that working 40+ hours a week just to make ends meet, isn't a fulfilling life. That mass consumption just to get a paycheck and keep the lights on isn't good for the world. 

Now is the time to push for something better than 'normal'."
2021-09-10 12:23:32,"Republicans have recognized all along that economic recovery is linked to recovery from the pandemic.  They also know that Americans vote on the economy.  Ergo, they're doing the logical thing - trying to spread the virus by undermining confidence in the vaccine and blocking mask mandates."
2021-09-10 13:10:22,"My two cents: The decrease in the sense of community and belonging, exacerbated by the rise in vapid social media and increasingly entrenched tribalism, has pushed our country off the rails, in terms of our feelings of allegiance to each other. Lack of care for our fellow citizens, I feel, is fueling the challenge to get more people vaccinated. It's truly dystopian."
2021-09-10 12:50:01,"I am glad this is being done! People who refuse to be vaccinated and don't wear masks are the 'deplorables'.

I also think that Dr. Rochelle Walensky should be dismissed from the CDC for her abrupt 'mission accomplished' masks-off decision in May. It was obvious that the unvaccinated don't wear masks. Public health officials who are tone deaf to the 'public' should not be practicing public health. The decision, widely disparaged at the time, caused thousands of additional deaths.

It is time to get serious and flood all communication channels with real information and education."
2021-09-10 12:38:55,"This item is right on point, and illustrates why Trump’s efforts to trivialize the Covid epidemic with lies and distortions failed our citizens along with our economy. Unfortunately, with mid term elections and another major one not far off, we can anticipate a full-blown GOP obstruction campaign against any measures that might actually address these national crises."
2021-09-10 13:08:52,"As a vaccinated, college educated Republican who sits to the immediate right of the center line, my primary belief is that people should not demand others do for them what they can do for themselves AND people SHOULD NOT engage in behaviors that create perpetual messes/work/hardships for others. I fully support vaccine mandates. We DO NOT HAVE unlimited piles of money to mop up the messes created by the unvaccinated population. Our healthcare staff are a valuable/irreplaceable part of our infrastructure. They have been working at a blistering pace for almost two years and they can not keep up this pace into perpetuity. They are not the cannon fodder for the people who refuse to take responsibility for themselves. Some people appear to believe that living in a free country means that they can do whatever they want while shoving the consequences of their bad decisions onto others. This is a false belief. When these people were children, I'm pretty sure their parents put limits on their behaviors for their safety and for the safety of others. The level of entitlement and immaturity on display is really unbelievable."
2021-09-10 13:33:22,"Biden's vaccine mandate is overdue, but I understand his desire to wait for FDA authorization of the vaccine.  I am also encouraged that business understands the anti-vaxxers are disrupting the workplace, pitting worker against worker.  Common sense tells us that vaccination is the best way to get this pandemic behind us, and to protect our kids who are too young to be vaccinated right now.  The job of the President is to ensure the security, safety and well-being of Americans, and use his executive power to do so."
2021-09-10 13:53:17,"I really am hoping Moderna gains approval ASAP. I received that in Feb/March.  That may encourage  more to get vaccinated. I believe fear is a large part of this and I can understand why (some) people are wary of that aspect, but if they're hospitalized w Covid those treatments aren't approved either.    I would also love to know what booster status is for Moderna recipients.  Fingers crossed and I wish everyone well...."
2021-09-10 13:58:04,"About time. The US is closing in on 700,000 dead by Thanksgiving and at the current uptake of vaccinations it is foreseeable that a million lives will be lost in the US alone.

In Portugal people feel reasonably safe:  the vaccination rate is 85%. Among the 65+ cohort the rate of full vaccination is 97%.  So almost everyone you come in connect is probably vaccinated, yet still everyone is wearing masks;  on weekends you have to show your vaccination status to go to a restaurant or bar.  You know all the tourists have recently tested negative.  And while there has been a recent surge the numbers are again coming down.  In fact, those who feel least safe are those who might be returning to the US, where for some reason people aren't likely to be vaccinated, aren't masking, and seem quite prepared to choose to die painfully while taking everyone they care about along with them.

The US now looks like an exporter of terrorism."
2021-09-10 14:13:00,"While I believe in this mandate, I believe if this is being done because of lack of workers and job creation, the Economists need to reevaluate the employable numbers.   

How many have left the job market for early retirement, how many parents of young children have chosen to have one parent stay at home realizing the cost of daycare, a second car, insurance, convenience food and restaurants, etc. does not necessarily balance the wages received or the time spent away from children parents chose to have -- especially if there is little in the way of paid time off for childhood illnesses, plus your own; school closures, quarantined classes, etc and no vaccine for children under 12.  I believe I read the magic wage people are looking for is between 58,000 - 68,000/person anything under that doesn't pay for both parents with two children to work. I believe, Covid-19 was an eye opener for families with young children as to the actual costs of both parents working outside the home."
2021-09-10 13:04:31,"So I got the below message from my Doctor sister this weekend, this from someone who has intubated plenty of COVID-19 patients. The last sentence is just beyond anything I could ever imagine I feel like we have reached peak stupid in this country. 

“It’s all so nutty, vaccine hesitancy at this point. Part of me thinks we should increase their insurance cost or make them pay if they get sick and decide to increase all of our  health care cost and put health care providers at risk. The icu cost is incredible for these patients. And that doesn’t include possible long term consequences and costs. I am starting to loose my patience, understanding and compassion at this point. I had two people this week say they didn’t want a blood transfusion because it might be blood from a vaccinated person. Luckily these nutty people aren’t too prevalent”"
2021-09-10 13:45:33,"I live in Northern Idaho, where we are now in ""crisis standards of care"" because our small town hospitals are overwhelmed with the unvaccinated. That means that if my 85 year old mom (vaccinated) needs a hospital bed, she might not get it; it means that my friend with stage 4 colon cancer might not get her surgery in a timely manner. In my humble opinion, the unvaccinated should be told that if they do not have a vaccine and get Covid19, they will not receive care at area hospitals. Insurance companies should say, sorry, preventable illness, we aren't paying your Covid bills. Perhaps that would convince them to get vaccinated. Forcing them? Good luck. I hear reports of individuals sick in the hospital with Covid that still refuse a vaccine. There is no cure for stupidity or willful ignorance."
2021-09-10 13:52:11,"I am no fan of the Biden administration, but I challenge those who wail the loudest about this infringement on their rights to lay out their alternative proposal of how to bring the pandemic to a swift & safe an end.

Truth is, most naysayers are fine with the status quo:  over 600K  Americans dead, with plenty more on the way; millions crippled by chronic vital organ damage; rising numbers of children infected & needing hospitalization, and who knows how many billions of dollars in hospital costs, which, by the way, we all pay for.

No war was ever won without sacrifice and sacrifice always means putting the common good ahead of personal liberty.  It's why we have a military draft:  even in time of dire need, many Americans - despite their lip service to high ideals - do not willingly sacrifice their liberty in the service of a higher collective imperative.

Maybe Melania Trump's ""I really don't care, do you"" jacket should become the resisters motto."
2021-09-10 12:22:38,Ironic that the same people who feel that donning masks and getting vaccinated are infringements on Americans’ rights and inhibiting business — are the same ones balking at these new mandates. Already businesses are pushing back against President Biden’s new regulations. Fine. Those unwilling to get vaccinated can just stay home. Don’t inflict your special sickness on others who have done the right thing.
2021-09-10 12:51:07,"It seems to me that republicans are willing to sacrifice a percentage of their voters in a grotesque attempt to hurt the economy and thus Biden’s and Democrats election chances in future elections.

I look forward to seeing a spike in vaccinations, beginning today, which should lead to a downward spike of infections and hospitalizations in the next few weeks."
2021-09-10 12:36:40,"This is why we elected Biden: to do hard stuff when all other reasonable options were exhausted. And yet, the Republican governors are up in arms about shots in people’s arms. Oh no! Are they afraid that people will lose their individual right to choose and die and cause others to sicken and die as a consequence? Are they afraid that a mandate for shots that could finally corral this deadly pandemic will lead to, of all things, an END to the pandemic and a loss of the political cudgels it provides them?"
2021-09-10 12:34:21,"The unvaccinated are unpatriotic and selfish and we are tired of slowing down for them.

They’ll and clog hospitals this winter, forcing doctors to make hard choices: who gets this ICU bed? This person with a heart attack or that person with Covid who didn’t bother to take a base level of responsibility and get a vaccine like 208 million of Americans have?"
2021-09-10 13:39:12,"Many of the comments here express surprise that republicans like Abbott, DeSantis, Noem, etc., are willing to let their own supporters die by stubbornly refusing to be vaccinated or wear a mask.

They do not care how many of their voters die.  They don't need them.

This is why they are implementing laws that allow them to render votes invalid.  If they lose, they simply deny the legitimacy of the election and declare themselves the winner.   

Who needs voters or something as inconvenient as democracy when cheating is codified into law."
2021-09-10 13:51:08,"I don't understand the people who are against vaccination.  It is not a matter of education, it's a matter of caring for one another.  My understanding is that the people who are against vaccination rather die, infect others including children with a deadly disease that has already killed more than 641 million Americans.  This does not include the many who have died because they couldn't get the healthcare they needed.  It is very simple, get vaccinated, where a mask and we can beat this thing.  If not, more people will die, put more strain on our medical system and our economy."
2021-09-10 13:18:34,"I find it wonderful how Biden is flipping the economic table on the do-nothing crowd regarding pandemic issues who wanted to keep the economy going by having;  no lockdowns, no masks, no vaccine mandates, no restrictions and impinging on personal “freedoms”.

The economy (and more importantly, people) are suffering now precisely because of that mindset.

Mandate away, please!”"

The President is going to have to use the power of the purse to pressure people and institutions who refuse masks and vaccinations. These folks all want tax breaks and Federal tax dollars. They need to step up to their responsibility to the American taxpayers who are subsidizing them. What good is the money spent on a world-class health care system otherwise? Also, let's stop funding the military industrial complex and funnel that money into getting the anti-mask/vaxxers some public health and civics education."
2021-09-10 13:23:10,"Having 80 million among us who’ve chosen not to be vaccinated is like absorbing an entire country the size of Germany – a large country within a country – in which the virus is free to spread like one of our western wildfires and mutate into more robust strains. What’s the solution to a problem like that if it’s not blunt, unforgiving social pressure?"
2021-09-10 13:46:55,"Masks work. IF all people would wear them. A lot of us made it through 2020-early 2021 before the vaccines were available without catching covid-19 just by washing hands, social distancing & mask wearing...and some of us were still working in public. Now, being vaccinated, you can mask up & work & still beat the odds by being as careful. We know so much more after one year of this experience than we did in the beginning.
If you're not going to be vaccinated, please at least wear the mask, keep your distance & wash your hands."
2021-09-10 13:12:22,So those who are vaccinated are afraid to participate in an in-person economy and those who refuse to be vaccinated are not. Have we all lost our minds?

2021-09-10 13:31:19,"I don’t agree with your premise that President Biden’s decision to require all federal federal employees to be vaccinated is driven by his concern about our country’s faltering economy. 

I truly believe President Biden cares about the well being of every American citizen, whether or not they like or despise him. That was apparent from the beginning of his Presidential campaign. 

Do you remember when his decision to work from his home was beginning to affect his popularity ratings?  His fellow Democrats had to urge him to leave his house and become more visible on the campaign trail?

In fact his new mandates might actually hurt the economy. This morning, my local radio station began playing parts of an interview with a security analyst. He believes the current labor shortage will actually get WORSE if the anti-vaxxers are not allowed to work alongside their vaccinated and masked co-workers."

There are still smokers but largely marginalized."
2021-09-10 14:34:59,"I for one am grateful to have a president who understands and believes in the science and Covid’s impact on lives and the economy. To me the real threat is Covid’s ability to mutate into something even more deadly and transmissible, worse than the Delta and Lamda variants.   While I don’t know of the virus’s ability to mutate in those who are vaccinated, my understanding is that Covid is rapidly circulating predominantly in the unvaccinated, and the more hosts the more likely Covid will evolve into something that could even evade vaccines. And obviously that scenario would cripple the already-strained economy and health care system. So Biden is right to move without haste to require vaccines. If this virus manifested itself like measles or smallpox, I bet more people (yet certainly not all) would get vaccinated."
2021-09-10 13:08:31,"Delta’s rise has been fueled in part by the inability of Mr. Biden and his administration to persuade millions of vaccine-refusing Americans to inoculate themselves against the virus….

Remember when you used to hear endless ads for concerts, shows, festivals, just things going on? Remember dropping by the mall randomly? Going to a restaurant just because? Yeah, a lot of that ended a year and a half ago and hasn’t come back. Every economic decision or anything spontaneous, really, has a Covid headwind unless you believe all this is a hoax. Never mind the soaring stock market and Bitcoin as a result of the Fed dumping money on the economy making things seem “ok”, but the pandemic in general and people’s learned cautious approach to doing things are making the economy grossly more inefficient than the experts are making Delta being the enemy of. Whether it’s Mu or any other future variant that continues to control our lives, it’s still going to take a lot longer than the end of the pandemic (whenever THAT is) for people to not have their everyday decisions marked by whether they want to chance getting sick."

This should not come as a surprise given that we know they were willing to watch their own Vice President hang in a desperate effort to cling to power.   President Biden is doing his best to try to lead in this environment, but it's nearly impossible to lead a nation where one of the political parties has embraced policies so extreme they're willing to murder their constituents and to sabotage our voting process.  
I think President Biden, Democrats in Congress and ordinary citizens are going to have to stand up to the Republicans nihilism head-on if we stand a chance of defeating this virus and restoring something resembling a democratic republic."

Wild conspiracy rumors right out of a comic book are not the sole reasons that perfectly ""normal"" Americans are refusing the shot. There are those who whine like children when told what to do. What about their rights? Don't they have the freedom to do anything as Americans? Yet these same folks stop for red lights, wear seatbelts, don’t yell fire in a crowded theater, pay taxes as the law requires, and don’t steal everything in sight just because they want it. They realize that they are part of a community but not when it comes to vaccination. Schools and the US military have historically insisted on numerous vaccinations before a student, teacher, or trooper can mix with the general population. Why is the perception of the Covid vaccine different? Is it politics, defiance, or ignorance? Some would put their faith in God and roll the dice on sinless lives and exemplary behavior. Faith is a wonderful thing but should that prevent seeing of the obvious. God provided man with intelligence. Intelligence developed science. Science created highly effective vaccines to combat a global pandemic. It's moraculous how swiftly science and technology created these approved vaccines. Millions of people have been saved. There’s a joke about an old man praying to win the lottery. God looks down and says, ""Buy a ticket."""

I resigned to the fact that some of the ""freedoms"" that we took for granted would change forever.

What followed were sensible, pragmatic requirements, while inconvenient on some levels, were necessary.  How we travel changed forever, security checkpoints became the new normal.  Long lines, extra documents at the DMV, passport renewals all became a more onerous process for the greater good.

We accepted those 'mandates' because we understood the importance. Almost 3,000 Americans perished on our soil.  As citizens, we needed to do our part, again, for the greater good.

At this point, I feel the same way with regards to vaccines/masks, etc. My goodness, in our increasingly polarized, inflamed, hostile political environment, would the requirements that were implemented following 9/11 be resisted, rejected and debated like some partisan reign on our freedoms?

We're better than this"
2021-09-10 14:13:08,"Decisive, right and perhaps overdue- President Biden deserves praise for again doing the right thing to protect lives. And again, the President eschews politics to protect the American people. He again has chosen not to triangulate or compromise on a basic human right- the right to live. 

And while economics may have been factored in his decision, I am confident saving lives was the chief and overriding factor. Children are increasing hospitalized for Covid 19 due to the failure of their adults to be vaccinated. What is a responsible leader supposed to do? Simply acquiesce to Right wing pundits and politicians and their foolish followers who stupidly confuse mask mandates with the sacrifice of personal freedom? Or self treat with drugs that are completely ineffective- let alone unable to control the spread of the disease?

The PUBLIC health requires governmental protection for ALL citizens and the right to mandate vaccination as needed.

People who work in grocery stores, restaurants or small shops have to put up with many more people who refuse to wear masks than airline staffs.  They’re just easier to get away from on the ground.  Biden did the right thing by making as many vaccine requirements as he could.  I would prefer no one come into my city unless they are vaccinated, and I live in an area tourists love to visit.  

People who refuse to get vaccinated for a variety of reasons, all specious, are exceedingly selfish.  When I hear reports of all the children who now are suffering because of their intransigence, I get really, really angry.

My solution is to make travel harder, from hotels to restaurants demanding proof of vaccination.  State and Federal parks should also demand that proof for admittance.  If a person is not vaccinated, they should just stay home.  Now, the rest of us have to be careful, not them, yet they are the danger to everyone and the economy, not the vaccinated."

New York and many highly vaccinated cities are returning to some normalcy; meanwhile hospitals in red states and rural areas are overwhelmed. How is that helping the people living there? The vaccine mandate will further fuel the culture war, because in a hyper-partisan country, doing the thing that will improve your life is actually less important than “sticking it” to the other side. They’d rather die in an ICU than take the free, effective and safe prevention that will get them back to work, school and life in a safe way.

We keep seeing unvaccinated people being admitted to a hospital following an infections and stating, while shedding crocodile tears, that they really should have gotten vaccinated.
The carrots dangled in front of people to get vaccinated only got us part of the way there.  Biden is now wielding the stick!

All insurance companies (including Medicare and Medicaid, and self-insuring businesses) should increase the premium costs (or decrease salaries or other benefits) to people that refuse vaccinations.  

My guess is that an additional $1000/month insurance cost for exercising sociopathic tendencies is not too much to ask ... actually, it's not too much to ask as becoming ill with COVID often costs a lot more than that when one's un-vaccinated.  

It's a mechanism (a tax) that may motivate more good, social behavior.  It would be better if we had citizens that cared about their neighbors but alas, that's not the country we now live in."

Yesterday, I posted Matthew 7:12 The Golden Rule “Do unit others as you would have them do unto you.”

The antivaxxers, most egregiously Dan Patrick in Texas, have claimed that lockdowns and mandates hurt the economy--even though that's obviously 180 degrees opposite of the truth.

If you ask: why would the voters blame Democrats for a problem Republicans have caused? The answer is: because they frequently have done so, in the past.  

Most often, whenever tens of millions of Americans have decided to cut off their noses to spite their faces, it's because Republican politicians have conned them. Which is not to absolve ordinary people of responsibility for their own foolishness--only to identify its origin.

Vaccines are mandated for schools - and that's why we don't have smallpox, polio, or measles everywhere anymore. 

It's pretty crazy that we need this, with all the solid proof that the vaccine works and that COVID kills and maims and spreads like wildfire. But we do, because some believe pool repairmen on Facebook rather than dedicated doctors and medical researchers and statistics.

If the GOP wants to own the label of pro-life, they need to protect and value all lives. 

They need to tell folks to get on board. Get vaccinated. Love your neighbor. Live the Gospel they pretend to embrace. Or stop calling themselves the pro-life party. 

I’m looking at 656,000 Americans who have died from COVID, my aunt among that number. Now, many of these were before vaccines, but the number of deaths that could have been prevented by a vaccine grows daily.

What is needed now are strict mandates that would effectively make it impossible for unvaccinated people to work at indoor jobs, to travel on planes, trains or buses, to attend any public event such as sports games or cultural events, etc. Make it very difficult for vaccine resistors to take part in society.

In addition, health insurance companies should substantially increase the premiums of people who are not vaccinated (except for medical reasons).

2021-09-10 14:12:48,"Arguments that could be used to support Biden’s actions:
1. It is constitutional, not unconstitutional. It is a fact. NYT, Maggie Astor, 9/9/21: “Legally speaking, the Supreme Court resolved the issue of mandatory vaccinations in 1905, ruling 7-2 in Jacobson v. Massachusetts that they were constitutional. The Constitution “does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint,” Justice John Marshall Harlan, known for defending civil liberties, wrote. “Real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own, whether in respect of his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be done to others.””
2. The financial cost of being hospitalized because of not being hospitalized is very high. “In June and July 2021, COVID-19 hospitalizations among unvaccinated adults cost the U.S. health system over $2 Billion…. Over 100,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations could have been prevented by vaccination in June and July 2021.” Petersen-KFF HealthSystem Tracker, 8/20/21. 
3. Burnout of the healthcare system staff is leading to staff vacancies. Overwhelmed healthcare systems cannot take care of patients needing hospitalization for other reasons, which will lead to more deaths unrelated directly to COVID."

Why does NYT allow Mr. Soave to use the NYT platform to spread his misinformation?  Mr. Soave claims Biden is forcing a vaccine mandate, while the plan is for workers to be either vaccinated or tested.  The testing option is given short shrift in Mr. Soave's piece.

It allows businesses to reopen. It allows people to gather again. It allows people to be free to live their lives again. It allows the country to get back to operating again.

That's right - blame Biden because people refuse to protect themselves.

I honestly believe the president had more faith in the Americans who refused to receive the vaccination, thinking they would come around and common sense would kick in.

Well, the Delta variant is steadily refusing to yield it's horrific effect on so many people and the president had no other choice but to kick matters into high gear resulting in more mandatory vaccinations across the board.

Now that the FDA fully approved the Pfizer vaccine, there is NO excuse to not get vaccinated.

Maybe, just maybe, this pandemic can finally make some headway and we will see this virus wane by the close of this year.

I feel badly for them but I feel worse for the vaccinated with acute needs who can’t access care because the health care system is clogged with vaccine deniers. And I feel worse for people who are experiencing economic hardship because the economy can’t fully recover because of refusers. I say - bring on the vaccine passports and deny entry to all public spaces to the unvaxxed. They have the freedom not to be vaccinated, let them also bear the consequences.

Biden had that entire time to lean heavy, with all legal instruments at his disposal, to bring the country up to speed, but for the most part he opted to play cheerleader instead, something easier to do and more likable.

Even now, he's holding back one of the strongest suits he's on firm ground to play, requiring proof of vaccination to pass through TSA. That implementation could bring 10 or even 20 million vaccine holdouts into compliance.

The new vaccine mandates are a lot better than nothing, but they only kick in after a grace period. If the President wants to forestall Delta spreading at high force all across the country with the quick ease of Thanksgiving air travel, he'll require a jab before you hope on a plane."

President Biden and his administration have bent over backwards to inform and educate the public about the vaccines. They've done an unprecedented job in making the vaccine widely and easily accessible- and free!- in the span of a few months. Thankfully, most Americans understand the gravity of the situation and have been vaccinated. As for the hold-outs and their stupid, childish ideas of ""freedom"", what about our freedom not to get sick?

And how will the mandate to provide employees paid time off to go get vaccinated work?  And for employees to facilitate their family members to get vaccinated? Paid time off to assist which family members? 
I agree with mandates for health care systems, and government systems especially  education.

I find that vaccinated people are far more reluctant to participate in group activities than I would ever have imagined. Break through infections happen but still not at a high rate. It would seem that the CDC could easily study if vaccinated people carry the virus at any level that would cause concern. Vaccinated adults who worry about infecting children either have valid reasons to be concerned or not. Why is this not known?
Right now we have large numbers of vaccinated people going off to CVS/Walgreens/Publix’s for boosters that…haven’t been authorized…have no idea of dose…& in less than the 8 months that was supposed to be the time margin. So the vaccinated are not “following the science”. Their fear of this virus has overcome logic & common sense.

Consequentially, the Congress itself is degrading into a sparring ring of personal insults, as if influenced by corporate overlords. 

DeSantis has been nettled by any reporters' questions on mask mandates, and his views on Covid19 vaccinations still seem nebulous. Turpitude? Hard to say.

You state twice in your piece that Biden is unable to stop the spread of the virus, yet not once do you mention the tsunami of misinformation about the vaccine and masking that many people are inundated with on a daily basis through right-wing websites, media, YouTube videos, etc.

The misinformation and outright lies that people are exposed to are the reason the virus keeps spreading. These folks have been preached to for decades to distrust government and vote against their own interests. So here we are.

Biden and his administration are doing all they can to encourage vaccines and mask-wearing, but they aren't miracle workers. Disinformation is killing us and our economy, not President Biden."
2021-09-10 16:30:30,"Had vaccines been mandated early on when they were available we would not be in the midst of hospitals slammed with infected, and mostly unvaccinated patients."
2021-09-10 16:41:27,"Of course vaccinations are essential to stopping Covid.   Much more emphasis needs to be put on curative drugs like Regeneron.   If they were cheaply available, the pandemic would be over in a meaningful sense.   There needs to be a huge effort in curing Covid not just preventing it.   Making Regeneron as cheap as a vaccine would be a great start."
2021-09-10 16:44:48,The anti vax/anti mask crowd need to be called by a more accurate name: pro-covid.
2021-09-10 16:44:09,"There is a speeding train of death and destruction called Delta headed straight for us. The northern states are right in the crosshairs and as soon as the weather gets cold and people head inside, we are going to get hit.

This is not the Covid of 2020. We cannot pretend that this round will be the same as last winter. Delta is so much more transmissible, the case numbers spike rapidly as it rips through the population, both vaccinated and unvaccinated. This will have ripple effects across our everyday lives, our jobs, the economy, access to hospitals etc. We know this because it's already happened across the pond. This is the reason why Biden is putting the pressure on. Sorry if your feelings are hurt or you refuse to comprehend the gravity of the upcoming situation, but the time is up for messing around. 

FOCUS. 

This vaccination effort is our chance to lessen the blow. We can do this! Everyone who wants the vaccine, but has been holding out on getting it must act NOW. Hopefully boosters will be coming soon too, and enough people will act so the worst will be avoided. Protect yourself and your loved ones and best of luck to us all."
2021-09-10 16:44:07,"The next variant down the line, if it surpasses vaccines all of us have gotten, we will be in worse shape than we are right now. Virus' are smart. They are learning how to adapt. Americans must do the same.

Talking about companies surviving is silly. We should be talking about humanity surviving. Is this virus what brings it all to a screeching halt? People really should be thinking about that scenario. It isn't that far fetched. 

Something eventually will take down humanity but I was hoping for a little more time. I was hoping for more time for my son and those children behind him. 

A company must say ""get a vaccine or a different job"". I am grateful to anyone who goes to work right now in the public sector. While they must pay their bills, if they are not at work then I cannot come into that grocery store or restaurant or drugstore. If they are not there then I cannot be there. They deserve patience & respect if they are vaccinated. Businesses ARE having a hard time hiring. I can be inconvenienced a bit if my latte takes longer than usual if someone is at work and vaccinated.

The President of the United States the most powerful country in the world held a news conference specifically to talk about people who are not vaccinated. Companies should listen up and read between the lines. Governments know the variants coming down the pipe really can upend the entire world in a much more devastating way. Get vaccinated. Wear a mask. It is not about freedom. It is about living."

2021-09-10 16:45:06,"In a public health crisis, the government has the right to act.  For over 100 years, school districts all over the US required vaccines and this practice has withstood legal challenges.  Washington required his troops to be vaccinated against Small pox.  There was no reluctance 60 years ago to the Polio vaccine.  President Biden’s actions are clearly legal. It is time for all Americans to roll up their sleeves to get the shot to protect themselves and their neighbors."

2021-09-10 13:49:48,"Long ago this country's ""marketing team"" -- yeah, I know there isn't one -- should have come up with a broad-base, multi-faceted campaign to pit EVERYONE against Covid, rather than each other. 

""Kick Covid"" and set up consistent (across the country) competitive games of chance using various approaches. Could be hundreds of manifestations.

Find a jab coupon in cereal and get 10 free boxes of cereal for your vaccination.

The US loves gambling, games of chance (OK, you don't, but many do) and those administering vaccines could have used incentives such as $100 bill to every 400th recipient, or promise of a trip to Disney stamped on hand of the 10,000th person in each state. Whatever. It would have turned ""losing"" into ""winning.""

Yes, there were some incentives but they did not tie into everyday life. Ten free orders of hash browns if you receive a random vaccine card by with your order and bring a vaccine certificate back.

I'm sure loads of businsses would have been eager to help because the future of the economy, their future, is on the line."
2021-09-10 14:18:06,"This approach effectively memorializes people’s ability to elect NOT to vaccinate, calling it “testing” and that isn’t’ the same. 
Biden needs to become more decisive, taking the more difficult road where warranted. He appears to be the product of his experience in the Congress, wanting to rely on them, the “process” and governmental entities to provide direction. There is no “process” here to be relied on; CDC has never embarked on level-setting the populace’s knowledge base. 
Consequently, we have millions of people making their own decisions based essentially on broadcast/social media/coffe shop hearsay. Some snippets are factual, most are not. In any case, they are organized only by broadcast journalists without STEM degrees, or loony tunes social media. It is not working. 
Requiring testing as an alternative to vaccination merely kicks the can down the road. Testing provides no population resistance, and allows any group to substantively elect to continue to avoid vaccination. As such they remain susceptible, and any epidemiologist will tell you, infection cycles are sustained by susceptible groups. Testing conveys zero resistance, and by the time anyone among his/er 101 fellow unvaccinated coworkers tests positive, the bug is already loose among you. 
There is no limitation here against collaborative refusal to vaccinate by any employee group, and in fact the anti vaxxers we are seeing are a de facto example of a collective, local decisions not to vaccinate."

2021-09-10 17:03:31,"America’s greatness has long been a function of, above all, its goodness. Ours was a country we ourselves, and many others, could and did admire, not for its wealth, but because it offered opportunities that other countries, more paralyzed by traditions, class distinctions, and entrenched economic inequality, did not. Americans were less hidebound, less stuck in our ways. 

Something has changed. For reasons I can’t explain, we are now very stuck in our ways. There’s even a school of thought, very influential, which argues that the views of a handful of demonstrably imperfect, very privileged white men who lived 200  years ago should be followed to the letter, regardless of whether their views even make complete sense. 

Our perpetual, counterproductive bickering and fighting among ourselves is related to a weird belief, held by many, that backwards is forwards—that to deal effectively with our present circumstances, we should try to reestablish, in the present, a previous time, which we imagine was better. 

Today, we see failure of imagination atop failure of imagination. It’s kind of ironic; for if there’s one thing that really stands out about the demonstrably imperfect, very privileged white men we call our country’s founding fathers, it’s that they had plenty of imagination—and the courage to exercise it, in starting afresh. Any current politician or Supreme Court justice who says he or she is following their example is merely blowing smoke."

I'm vaccinated, but will fight this measure along with many others."
2021-09-10 17:14:21,"I applaud the Biden administration for the courage to impose vaccine mandates. The mandates will be unpopular among the anti-vaxxers, but, thankfully, they’re in the minority. The mandates are well crafted and should survive a legal challenge on the grounds of unconstitutionality. The government can show a compelling state interest to protect public health. Furthermore, even with the mandates, people have a choice to be tested weekly or get a different job."
2021-09-10 17:07:04,"Biden is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't to Republicans in an uproar over the president's latest round of vaccination mandates.  He nicely pleaded with everyone to get vaccinated. Fewer than were projected to do so did, continuing to fuel the pandemic into another year. With his concern on  the health and safety of the citizenry and the economy, Biden has now toughened his stance. This proves he has taken the leadership of the country by the horns, so to speak,  and he needs the suport of everyone, espeically Republicans. After all, Biden is their president too; and he has not to my knowledge excluded them from his concern like his predecessor did to Democrates. I support Biden's actions fully."
2021-09-10 17:11:45,"Blaming Biden and his administration for failing ""to persuade millions of vaccine-refusing Americans to inoculate themselves against the virus"" is wrong-headed and divisive. Anti-vaxers are persuaded by myriad misinformation on social media about vaccine efficacy, alternative remedies and conspiracies. If you are going to blame government actors, go after the right-winged Republicans who are pushing their own personal, power-grabbing agenda at the expense of the American public. We don't need the Times to throw fuel on the polarization fire going on in our country. Realizing the paper aims to represent all political factions, I expect your coverage to, at least, be fair and constructive."

2021-09-10 17:14:05,This is an excellent opportunity for corporations to get rid of unvaccinated people who demonstrate poor judgement and hire new vaccinated people that are more likely to be good team players.
2021-09-10 17:15:35,"Given the reality of today’s politics and politicians, I totally support Biden’s mandates to help contain and eliminate this Pandemic. It’s time that President Biden has taken a firm stand. That’s why we elected him. As for the Republicans, the party is on the wrong path totally. Sad to see so many of the Republican governors put party over the nation’s health."
2021-09-10 17:26:03,"The way to get everyone vaccinated is to put everyone on notice that after 75 days (which should be enough time to get vaccinated) hospitals will treat unvaccinated ( unless for a very good reason, either health or religion ) with benign neglect."
2021-09-10 17:31:55,"Finally — a strong move by President Biden. It comes after his plan to pull out of Afghanistan fell apart, leaving many dead, including U.S. service members. 

It will also refuel the economy and is a powerful response to Republicans’ efforts to politicize a continuing medical emergency."

2021-09-10 17:24:16,"We're at war with a virus which has killed over 650,000 Americans so far. Due to the concerted efforts of scientists over the last half a century in genetics, virology and molecular biology we have the means to eliminate the majority of this threat.

It's not very comforting that a 100 million Americans are unwilling to act in the best interest of the country. No one is asking people to go die on foreign soil - just to get a jab and wear a darn mask.

I am aghast that so many of my fellow citizens are unwilling to make even these small sacrifices."
2021-09-10 17:46:05,"Today Fox News and all its guests are responding with outrage about Biden's new vaccine push. They say it is an attack on their liberty. They say it is unconstitutional. They say it is a regulatory quagmire. They are saying he's going against what he said before, that he wouldn't issue a mandate. They are saying he shouldn't be, even implicitly, attacking Republican governors. He should be talking with ""empathy"" to ""educate"" people about vaccines (even though that's exactly what Biden has been doing for eight long months straight before today.) They say they will sue Biden about it. They are issuing every anti-vaccine political talking point they can think of, so that Republicans like those who comment here will know what to think and say.

People dying of Covid? Hospitals without enough beds, resperators, or nurses? Exhaustion of healthcare workers? Covid patients needing hospitalization are 90% unvaccinated and 10 times more likely to die? Idaho has so many Covid patients they are not even treating them and letting them die? 

Fox News has does not report such news. It would support Biden's vaccine push, and it is irrelevant to Republican gains in 2022 and 2024."

That means that our scientific community has confidence that the vaccine helps protect the person vaccinated, but not the people around them. Therefore, logic dictates that the person receiving the shot is doing so to protect themselves - not others.

Everyone, including the vaccinated, is able to spread the Delta variant (which is the most common variant in the US).

If people are choosing not to get the shot, they are risking their own lives, which is their decision. Our government's role is not to force someone to save their own life, and definitely not by threatening their employment."
2021-09-10 17:26:52,"Biden has now ""bought"" responsibility for Covid. 

So has the Leftist press. Remember (can a leftist do that?) what they were saying from before the election until Biden was inagurated: ""With Biden in we have an adult running the show ... he'll follow the science and all will be well"".  He didn't really act at all. 

Now he has. 

I ask ... no, I demand ... and so do the people ... that he give us a quid for his quo. That is, he's saying ""vaccinate in 75 days"", implying ""vaccination works"". The Quid is simple: he must make a rule that in 90 days (75 + 14 plus one to make it a round number) all restrictions are off for all vaccinated people, permanently. That means completely off ... which means, no carrying around ""vaccine passports""., no restrictions by third parties (including I do say, no preventing people wearing masks if the so wish.)  If asked, just say ""I'm vaccinated"". 

If the vaccine works, that would be enough. 

I note that whole countries are stopping restrictions even more: Denmark and Sweden, even sooner."
2021-09-10 17:43:26,Let's just deputize private citizens to sue those who have not gotten vaccinated so that the mandate won't be challenged.
2021-09-10 17:32:13,"Very happy to hear President Biden’s remarks. We are at the stage of the virus now where political posturing and asinine statements have gone out the window. The decision whether or not to get the vaccine is now a life or death decision. I truly hope for the unvaccinated in America this will finally be their wake up call. And I truly hope for those under 12 in our country the situation does not get any worse, their vaccine will be approved and their parents will ok it. These viruses are not going away and with winter around the corner colds, flu and viruses will only get worse. America must do what it can to keep our country protected and ahead of the virus curves. And I certainly hope that in the next couple of months we do not see hordes of Americans on their deathbeds crying and wishing that they took the vaccine way back when."
2021-09-10 17:34:53,"The anti-vaxers are a vocal minority.  They reject science in favor of conspiracy theories.  They not only harm themselves,  but also other people, children and the economy. 
 It is long past time to stop pandering to them and their fragile feelings. 
The government has always had the right and the duty to impose necessary health measures, such as vaccines. 
If anything the mandates should be stronger."
2021-09-10 17:38:54,"I would like to point out that one’s private employer has the right to mandate vaccines (and mask wearing). Employment-at-will. Isn’t that what all the Republicans support? No one is forcing a vaccine on anyone. Quit your job if you don’t like what your employer is asking of you. You right-to-work people decimated unions, too, so it is just you negotiating with your employer. Good luck with that. 

As for the government, because this is a global pandemic, whatever they mandate will, in fact, pass judicial muster. There is a compelling state interest in protecting Americans from dying. So the government can actually infringe on any rights you might perceive yourself to have. No enumerated right in the Bill of Rights is absolute. Public health issues around a fatal disease does give government broad reach and power. Some of you may not like that, but that is the reality (if you care about the Constitution). 

Those on the right who don’t care for the Constitution and seem hell bent on supporting a dictatorship and are screaming about your ‘rights’ and ‘freedoms’ - well if you don’t care about upholding our Constitution I’m not sure what ‘rights’ and ‘freedoms’ you are belly aching about. You don’t have any."
2021-09-10 17:51:52,"I live in British Columbia and have just downloaded my provincially mandated proof of vaccines on my phone. The QR Code will be scanned before I go to any large indoor venue as well as restaurants until the end of January, 2022. This vaccine card goes in to effect on September 13th and for those without a mobile phone, the government will provide a print option. There is a grace period for those who have yet to receive their second dose, but soon only those with 2 jabs will have access to these venues.

Of course there is some pushback from those who refuse to be vaccinated and that is their right. However, the retail sector and their staff are supportive knowing their future patrons will be fully vaccinated thus reducing risk. Of course, there will be far less hesitation coming from customers who come through their doors be it a restaurant or a concert. The vaccine card is designed to keep the economy going and people safe.

For those refusing to get vaccinated I say this: This is the healthcare version of “no shirt, no shoes, no service”."

With what vaccine?  Two shots or one? Who is footing the bill for them?  Answer to the last question:  hard working middle class US citizens.
2021-09-10 18:48:12,"I remember very well the day we all lined up in the school cafeteria to get our oral polio vaccination. The same thing should be happening in schools across the country. Polio was wiped out in this country, and it wasn’t political, it was a public health emergency, just like Covid. It’s past due time to put an end the pandemic with jabs. Thank you President Biden for this major push to end Covid in the USA. Project Warp Speed was the single greatest accomplishment of Trump Administration. The Trump supporters should be lined for their shot in the arm."

2021-09-10 18:22:10,"COVID has done wonderful things for our rate of savings. Since most of the businesses in WY don’t require masks or vaccinations, there’s no way to tell who is willfully spreading virus — it’s a right, after all — so we keep ourselves and our disposable income to ourselves. There’s no indication that state government cares any more about local economies than they do about saving lives. May be why we have such wide open spaces."
2021-09-10 18:29:47,"The ""taking a knee"" gesture that originated with NFL players in 2016 was the subject of extreme resentment and confronational rhetoric on the part of many conservatives. It has been reported that much of this emotionally charged expression of social discord was stimulated by, and perhaps even originated from, Russian-based internet propagandists. The goal of this effort was to reduce American influence by promoting social discord and undermining our tradition of accountable, representative government.
It may be worthwhile to consider whether some of the current anti-vaxxing, anti-mask fanaticism also results from a contrived and intentional manipulation of public opinion, with the same goals."
2021-09-10 19:03:19,I don't understand why people think this will be a political liability for President Biden.  The majority of Americans are vaccinated meaning the majority of Americans are pro vaccine.  If the GOP want to paint themselves as the champions of the unvaccinated while Biden makes himself the champion of the vaccinated (who are tired of being dragged down by those are not vaccinated) then let them.  It won't be a political winner for them.
2021-09-10 19:22:55,When it comes to public health the “freedom crowd” apparently prefers carrots over sticks but in most other arenas the stick is their preferred means of persuasion.  Their mock outrage over vaccine and mask mandates would be an inconvenience if the well-being of the nation weren’t on the line.
2021-09-10 14:26:52,"Fools gold is always the most attractive. The data tells a story quite different from the conventional narrative.

The data from Scotland for the summer period shows that  there were 5,508 confirmed cases among the partly vaccinated population, and 16,810 cases among the fully vaccinated population – two populations who are least likely to be tested due to be being vaccinated.

This means that between 28th August and 3rd September there were 22,318 cases among the vaccinated population – almost 2,000 more than the unvaccinated population.

This shows that despite the unvaccinated being demonized and used as the scapegoat for the mandate, it is the vaccinated who face no restrictions that are infecting one another.

The job numbers are not lower than expected because of vaccines rates. There are many factors involved, including the normal fall off of summer jobs.

I don't know why Biden is pursuing a mandate but the data from the UK doesn't support such a policy. Neither does the data from Mexico, India or Israel, a country with one of the highest vaccination rates and also a surge in covid cases among the vaccinated.

The last thing we need is a rush to judgement based on behind the scenes calculations from incomplete reports.

The president will not get a buy in for this policy without full transparency. And based on Dr. Fauci's recent problems with being honest, it might be time for a new NIH director."
2021-09-10 19:54:41,"I work in healthcare and was one of the first people vaccinated. 
 I absolutely, 100% want everyone to get vaccinated, get their booster, and to socially distance and mask when prudent.

I was also an enthusiastic Biden voter. 

But this federal mandate is a matter of massive government overreach and I hope it goes down in flames.

This is not about saving lives - at least those of the vaccinated. 
Most vaccinated people have an tiny - nearly non-existent - chance of getting the virus, or getting seriously sick even if they do.  And that is *before* taking the other precautions described above.  

Other than kill those who refuse to get vaccinated (their choice), what the on-going pandemic does is continue to drag down the economy.  Clearly this is Biden's biggest concern.  

Imagine the uproar on these pages if Trump had just massively abused the power of the federal government in this manner.  We would see it for what it is: an attempt by president misuing his power to keep his presidency and party alive for the mid-terms."
2021-09-10 20:56:21,"Long overdue. Those of us who have done the right think and vaccinated ourselves against the pandemic deserve protection from the idiots who have not.

What a boost to our economy that would be!"
2021-09-10 23:24:13,This article should've been fact checked before publishing. You guys do realize that the vast majority of the people who are refusing to vaccinate are the ones who have been eating out and putting money into the economy throughout the pandemic right!? The mandate has absolutely zero to do with the economic recovery and everything to do with it the FAILURES of Biden as a president.
2021-09-11 00:27:25,Its not only about the economy. It's Common sense.
2021-09-11 00:24:25,"It appears to me that the stretching mutation of the Covid variants and its baffle to restore the pre-pandemic life has forced president, Mr.Biden to focus more on USA's internal and less in external affairs.
I could come across  the following category of citizens in my day today life.-  A chain smoker who replies that his  grand father was a chain smoker but lived ninety years without cancer. 
-An alcoholic who says that it is more of a medicine and energizer than an intoxicant.
President, Mr.Biden's effort to vaccinate all in a scientifically advanced America is indeed a noble mission to propel the flock of vaccine hesitant and anti vaccine toward the targeted herd immunity  As Early As Possible."
2021-09-03 15:11:59,"What's missing from the government's discussions about boosters is any reference to physicians' discretion and judgement.  The government is pretty good about making recommendations in situations where data is abundant, overwhelming, and clear-cut, but it's terrible at making recommendations when the data is conflicting, sparse, or difficult to interpret.  Making clinical decisions in the setting of limited information is exactly what doctors are trained to do, and where they add the most value.  In this case, we probably won't have ""perfect data"" on boosters for a long time.  Instead of having a top-down approach to boosters, the government should simply make them available and leave it up to individual doctors to decide what is best for their patients."
2021-09-03 15:13:51,"What is missing here is the reason for the turnaround. Are they concerned that a third Moderna would have no impact in extending or deepening reduced risk? Or do they think it could be detrimental. I am sure that the 1,000,000 people who have already obtained round three would like to know."
2021-09-03 15:24:48,"The friction between the administration and the scientific agencies is unfortunate, in that lives and the threat of hospitalization hang in the balance. Although one must certainly follow the science, what is at issue here is not really ""science"" per se, but predetermined protocols that the scientific agencies have imposed. Could it be that these are too cumbersome in the face of a rampaging Delta variant? 

Perhaps a more flexible policy, in which individuals in certain high-risk groups can decide for themselves whether to get a third shot in advance of the official recommendation, would be appropriate. Nothing I have seen suggests that the 3rd shot is actually dangerous. In fact, many pharmacies are already effectively offering this option, because one can register for a 3rd dose without any vetting from a medical professional."
2021-09-03 15:26:13,"The CDC and FDA have been ""slow"" from the beginning.  However, I live in a community where COVID/Delta is raging and there have been an ""uncomfortable"" number of breakthrough infections.  I do not want that to happen to me. I wear masks, but truthfully I cannot remain in my home for another year - I want a booster to continue to be safe.  Out business (many locals) cannot  hold on for another year of ""fear"".  I try to support the small ones, but cannot do that it if I feel unsafe.  It is bigger than just one person's safety. It is the safety of our overworked medical facilities, our schools trying to keep students back in person, our families and friends have ""normalcy"".  Boosters are needed for the average person.  We and our communities do not have the luxury of not."
2021-09-03 15:26:30,"What's also missing is a serious mention of the booster's impact (or lack thereof) on the Delta and other variants.  Serious changes in the variants, especially in the structure and proteins of the spike, may render current vaccines obsolete.  The ""booster"" may need to be a redesigned formula."
2021-09-03 15:26:49,I would encourage anyone reading about the drama involved here to read Dr. Janet Woodcock's history regarding opioids.  I'm not entirely certain what is wrong with the FDA leadership but I do believe it's real and it's a problem.  And we don't have time for drama and problems.  Hopefully a permanent leader of FDA can be chosen soon to alleviate the problems that it appears current leadership is creating.  My bottom line opinion is boosters will be needed and waiting for enough data may be a critically deadly posture for many people.
2021-09-03 15:27:13,"well, it sure doesn't help that these medical folks publicly endorsed the booster rollout strategy but then privately expressed reservations. Then the press reports both, and mass confusion ensues."
2021-09-03 15:29:15,"I am a scientist and I welcome this news.  Biden’s announcement of booster shots before his own government scientists weighed in and the resulting departures of the FDA officials was highly troubling.   We need to make decisions about booster shots based on scientific evidence, not fear or politics.   We also need to consider ethics in making this decision.   Vaccine doses are still in limited supply and many people around the world haven’t even had the opportunity to get a first dose.   In addition, new variants like the recently announced Mu variant will continue to develop and spread as long as vast swaths of the world remain unvaccinated."
2021-09-03 15:34:14,Perhaps the Doctors are only concerned about breakthrough cases that lead to hospitalization and severe illness but I don't want to risk any kind of breakthrough or long covid. The train has already left the station. I will get my booster whether authorized or not and I suspect millions of others already have or will do soon.
2021-09-03 15:35:45,"Right after Biden announced a vaccine for kids would be available by August or September the FDA countered by saying they needed to double the vaccine trial enrollment and delay vaccines til midwinter. At the time, I wondered if this was just a power struggle, and whether the FDA was just making a point of asserting their power. This article definitely doesn't assuage my concern."
2021-09-03 15:43:50,Incremental progress does not make compelling headlines.   Science is complicated.  Patience and deliberation is what the administration and the scientists should model and project.  We the public should acknowledge the rapid evolution of the pandemic and not rush to judge the competence of the parties involved as the recommendations evolve.  Clarity is hard to come by in the fog of war.
2021-09-03 15:11:07,I really hope we hear more about the J&J shot soon. We are in a much smaller group than recipients of the others but the news about J&J is almost nonexistent and confusing.
2021-09-03 15:17:06,"This is where the messaging goes completely haywire. Americans have seen/read/heard reports from Israel and EU nations about boosters, especially for senior citizens with convincing arguments of why this should be happening. Also, many world pandemic experts have expressed how boosters do not interfere with providing the world with vaccines. The conventional wisdom is that it's possible and the right thing to do both. Having these arguments among the US team play out in public perpetuates all the mistrust that is damaging and destroying public health efforts. Boosters will provide less opportunity for COVID to infect and spread the virus. There is no evidence to infer that is not true."
2021-09-03 15:26:44,"""Science"" versus leadership - what is it going to be.   Deep State versus the Executive.    Bureaucracy versus national emergency.    Lives are at stake.    How many people will die because the FDA drags their feet with a vaccine already given to over 170 million Americans.   It was safe enough for that, but boosters, well we don't know.    

Think about the ridiculousness of that.    

Then think that Biden has abrogated his responsibilities to make decisions and tradeoffs to a bunch of self-important cable news pundits advising the FDA who don't agree on anything.    Common sense and lives are the victims."
2021-09-03 15:31:02,Why were 1 million Americans permitted to receive a booster vaccination before it was approved by FDA and CDC?
2021-09-03 15:31:32,"So we are just waiting for significant numbers of  vaccinated people to die before deciding to give boosters. What a strategy! Meanwhile, the US has wasted 15M doses, including 7M in opened vials that are tossed."
2021-09-03 15:07:28,"A fading vaccine is still better than no vaccine, and a booster shot is better than not having one."
2021-09-03 15:16:44,"There is no sense of urgency in Janet Woodcock's FDA.

No sense of urgency on booster shots.

No sense of urgency on vaccines for children.

None.

Oh.  I forgot.  There is a vigorous sense of urgency to pursue bureaucratic infighting and prerogative.

We need to replace Ms. Woodcock with a permanent, competent head of the agency and get this agency under control and working for the American people instead of for itself."
2021-09-03 15:20:53,"""Israeli officials say their data shows that the potency of Pfizer’s vaccine wanes over time against severe disease and hospitalization, but that a third shot bolsters protection significantly. The F.D.A. wants to see the underlying data, to make sure it backs up summaries that the Israeli government has provided.""

This says it all. It isn't a question of safety, and it is probably not a question of effectiveness. Rather, it's a case of a bureaucracy protecting itself even as people are dying.

I got my third shot, and I recommend that anyone else who wants the full measure of protection find someone who will prescribe a third shot to them, or go to a vaccination site and lie.

The shots are extraordinarily safe and I will not endanger my health to satisfy some bureaucrat."
2021-09-03 15:24:47,"It's just this sort of ""Yes, do it,"" then followed by, ""No, dont' do it,"" lack of clarity that strengthens people's diminished trust in the government's guidance regarding all things Coronavirus and vaccinations.  It started way back over a year ago with, ""Don't wear masks,"" Then... ""Everyone should wear masks!""  The government needs to do better."
2021-09-03 15:31:00,"Considering the fact that most people who are vaccinated and ending up in the hospital anyway are overweight with no underlying health conditions, and the fact that 2/3rd of the country is overweight or obese (with a full 1/3 being obese), odds are if they are doing this right the majority of people should be receiving a third shot."
2021-09-03 15:31:27,"Once again the FDA and other agencies fiddle while Rome burns.  In light of the health and economic consequences of Covid, coupled with data that has been received via a few studies, one would hope that these guys would have learned to pivot and decide in a timely matter.  The fact that Israel, not a Third World country, has already begun administering boosters, is also somewhat reassuring.  

We already know that immunity begins to wane.  It would be prudent to give boosters to those who believe in the science rather than live in the hope that anti-science types can be convinced to take the plunge and receive a life-saving vaccine."
2021-09-03 15:35:54,"But they rushed to authorize Aduhelm, an unproven, dangerous Alzheimer’s drug that may have little or no efficacy and cost Medicare many billions. The F.D.A. needs a major overhaul."
2021-09-03 15:26:59,"This back and forth at some of the country's most esteemed institutions is appalling and frustrating. The FDA and the CDC  need to get their acts together.  Public trust is already shaky. Israel has been able to do scientific studies and act on those data while many in positions of power here are still dithering, or worse, walking away.  Yes we should focus on vaccinating the unvaccinated but if boosters are warranted, which Dr. Fauci has agreed with, then let's do both!"
2021-09-03 15:07:57,One failing during this pandemic has been the inability of federal health officials to express the degree of certainty or uncertainty about whatever mandate or recommendation they are making. I think it would help significantly if health officials took a page out of the intelligence community playbook and directly rate their level of certainty or confidence about any given public statement.
2021-09-03 15:15:11,"Here the trend line of antibody levels becomes important and not the lagging indicators of hospitalization and death among those vaccinated.  It is all but a foregone conclusion that antibody levels wane over time.  Antibody levels convey protection.  As long as the 3rd shot is safe and effective from data from places like Israel, we should be moving this process forward. 
 
If we wait until we definitely know that there are significantly more hospitalizations and deaths among those previously vaccinated, it is already too late to roll out a booster campaign.  If we wait that long, we may even initially cause more hospitalizations and deaths from indoor exposure of everyone with mutually weakened protection.  The best approach is not to wait until we all have weakened protection but to realize that it is coming and simply ensure the 3rd dose is safe and effective.   All this, ""I'm not sure we need a booster yet"" talk seems counter productive.  By the time you know you need it, it is too late."
2021-09-03 15:19:07,"Well, so much for the complaints that President Biden's public announcement of a tentative booster schedule had forced the FDA's hand.  (Biden was caught between a rock and a hard place--if he had failed to plan for boosters until they were recommended, there would have been scant time to plan for them.)  The FDA and CDC's slow decision-making is frustrating--but far from disarray, this shows an orderly (if perhaps overly cautious) following of the science, and the evidence is not there yet.  Maybe it will be after the raw data from the Israeli study is shared and analyzed--or maybe not."
2021-09-03 15:25:10,"My pharmacy contacted me offering a booster for anyone who had their jabs 28 or more days ago.  I have no idea where they got that figure from and I did not get my two shots at the pharmacy.  I think I will wait for an email from the Ph.D in Infectious Diseases who did jab me.  

I got through the first 16 months with nothing but a mask and my loner lifestyle.  I think 2 Moderna jabs on top of that should be good till flu shot season which would be 6 months after my second jab at the end of May."
2021-09-03 15:27:38,"For those who don't have the access to in-depth news and the time to understand the myriad state of vaccines in the country, things can be very confusing indeed.  Three different vaccines, each with different efficacy; emergency approval vs. formal FDA approval; approvals differing by age group and medical conditions; declining efficacy, but anecdotes about promising booster results.  Whew!  Unfortunately, the confusion only adds to the success of misinformation, conspiracy, quackery, political opportunism, and grifting.  Even those who are well informed become frustrated and hostile as their children become enmeshed in the politics of mask wearing while they wait for pre-teen vaccine approvals.  I don't envy the professionals at the FDA and CDC."
2021-09-03 15:30:19,I’m a physician. I took the booster.
2021-09-03 15:30:23,"A judgment here requires understanding the whole of the body's immunity response as well as the antibody response and that would be complex if only in an individual, no less than across some cross-sectional population study.    What a third dose does for immune suppressed individuals is one thing: a small and higher-risk population.    Otherwise the expense and consumption of resources is unclear and it might be better utilized to immunize others abroad (if that were even possible).  
Immunity is also about immune memory by T-cell response.   Barouch, Stephenson and Sadoff highlight the nature of immunity at this level in NEJM,, 385:10, 951-3, Sept 3,'21 in Correspondance for Ad26.COV2.S (J & J).   They show CD8 T- cell cytotoxic response to Interferon actually increases by 8th month.     This is a powerful response in a 1 x Adenovirus DNA immunization.   While it cannot reliably predict a mRNA immunization, it suggests ongoing immunity despite antibody levels dwindling.
I would hope a more clear and perhaps considered conclusion.  I do understand that whatever the CDC/FDA ultimately decide, some marked 'wind-up time' to bring forth the response needs consideration and to have a best understanding too late may also be a problem.  
The task here is not an easy one.   I am glad that I do not have to make the decision myself."
2021-09-03 15:30:39,"While the debate rages on, I intend to quietly go to my local pharmacy and get a Moderna booster shot one way or another. I wish bureaucracy, politics, and drama would stay out of the approval process. The uncertainty is only fueling the decisions of the unvaccinated to stay that way."
2021-09-03 15:37:36,"Enough drama and confusion from the government. I’m 76, have heart failure and received my first jab in late December. Decided on my own to get the 3’rd jab this August. Seems like we’re all on our own now, thanks not only to FDA and CDC waffling but mainly to those who refuse to be vaccinated, thus enhancing the Delta variant. Who knows what else is coming in this never-ending pandemic."
2021-09-03 15:16:13,"This delay seems misguided. I believe it’s been proven that vaccine efficacy wanes after 8 months. Other countries began moving ahead with boosters months ago. And the idea of  “instead focusing on the 25 percent of Americans not yet vaccinated” is a poor excuse. No carrots will convince that group to be vaccinated—- they will remain unvaccinated until enough jobs and establishments have the common sense to require it. 
Let’s focus on keeping those who want to be vaccinated healthy and alive by providing timely boosters."
2021-09-03 15:29:50,It sounds like there's serious power struggles going on in the FDA. It makes me feel like my kids' health and their access to a vaccine depends on the whims of adults behaving like toddlers fighting over who has the last say.
2021-09-03 15:35:08,"Thank you. There is no evidence that young healthy fully vaccinated individuals need a booster, period. There are virtually 0 patients recorded who have been fully vaccinated under 50 and otherwise not significantly ill who have been hospitalized and or died from covid-19 post fully vaccine; period."
2021-09-03 15:21:41,"Correct me if I misunderstand:

The experts at the FDA and CCC are saying they want to make certain enough fully vaccinated people get seriously ill before they approve the use of boosters to protect vaccinated people from getting seriously ill?

This is the just sort of ""logic"" we grown accustomed to expect from America's institutional experts."
2021-09-03 15:34:20,"It seems if and when booster shot is needed really depend on the pandemic situation. There are the knowns and unknowns. We know that Delta and some other variants are more difficult to control. We also know that efficacy of vaccines wane over time. We know the US population is far from having enough vaccinated to build a herd immunity. We don't know exactly how effective a booster dose will do. But overall, I think the White House made the right decision to get the country ready for booster shots."
2021-09-03 15:34:36,"I was so disillusioned with Biden's lack of judgement in pulling out of Afghanistan; was he listening to all his advisors? And now I wonder if his insistence on pushing booster shots is a continuation of tunnel vision. 

Using the FDA approval  as cover is not even logical. As an MD, I don't prescribe every drug the FDA approves. 

And I wonder if presidents can legally practice medicine at all.

That the head of the FDA's vaccine office and her deputy have both resigned, largely in opposition to Biden's policy on vaccine boosters, speaks volumes. And it raises questions as to the independence of the CDC, which I was so hoping would regain its former high reputation.

If Biden were truly listening to the science, he would think outside our borders. The Delta variant that is holding back our return to the ""before times,"" will likely not be the last mutant to emerge from overseas unvaccinated populations. The C 1.2 variant, also of overseas origin, is spreading as aggressively as Delta and is now in eight countries.

So I wonder if Biden is using the same mentality on the pandemic as with Afghanistan; don't waste resources overseas. But I would point out the very word ""pandemic"" means this is a global problem not to be confused with a circumscribed epidemic."
2021-09-03 15:38:50,Didn't CBS publish that for people over the age of 75 with 6+ months past the second shot the vaccine is only 80% effective against hospitalization? That speaks for a booster shot for the elderly.
2021-09-03 15:10:26,Israeli data shows value of booster dose we should start asap
2021-09-03 15:48:32,"It's time for our government to be clear, open and honest. I understand decisions need to be based on data, but I don't see a realistic explanation as to what the concern might be with administering boosters after 8 months. It makes little sense to argue that boosters are not necessary, when studies clearly show the vaccine efficacy wanes over time. If anything, getting a booster before vaccine efficacy completely wanes in the majority of people who got the shot seems prudent. It also makes little sense to argue that we should focus our efforts on convincing the 25% of Americans who do not want to get vaccinated -- they haven't done so in 9 months, I don't see what else can be done going forward to persuade them; also I haven't seen anyone mention shortages being a problem. So what is the real concern with getting a booster within 8 months of the vaccine as initially planned?"
2021-09-03 15:51:27,"Several areas of information are emerging about the vaccines, the Delta variant, serious consequences of Covid-19 infection and who is at greatest risk of infection, hospitalization and death. With an almost constant stream of data and analyses comes more debate and strategic modifications. It sounds very much like Bayes' theorem where best assessments are updated as more evidence or information becomes available.

I'm good with Bayes' theorem, far from perfect but our best way out of this pandemic nightmare."
2021-09-03 15:52:03,"Lots of talk of science and politics.  

Science involves a great deal of judgement, much the same as politics.    The fight against Covid-19 is the nexus of science and politics.  

This isn't easy, but keep in mind the Covid-19 threat presented by the Delta variant is very real and much greater than the Alpha variant, but many of us are in a much safer place than we were just 12 months ago."
2021-09-03 15:37:34,"Is the U.S. able to export it's vaccines, say, to developing countries like Thailand or Burma in desperate need of vaccines.?  How has the COVID money been spent overall to increase worldwide vaccine supply.  We read about COVID money not being spent, even diverted.  How easy is it to access these appropriations for increased vaccine supply and education, which is also crucial.?"
2021-09-03 15:25:03,Translation: the data from Israel seem to indicate that booster is beneficial for those vaccinated with Pfizer. This is essentially the only vaccine administered in Israel and the only one for which there is substantial data on the efficacy and safety of boosters.
2021-09-03 15:41:12,And people who don’t want an additional shot JNJ what will the fda and cdc recommend?
2021-09-03 15:40:39,"It sounds like the work with statistics to know where we are, should have been done by now, and hasn't.  It also sounds like some are just waiting for vaccinated people to get sick or die before giving booster shots.  Last, it sounds like ego, turf and petty politics between the White House, FDA and CDC - not science.

Am I missing something?"
2021-09-03 15:44:21,"Does FDA or CDC have any reason to doubt the Israeli studies?  Or are these agencies merely being bureaucratic and covering themselves?  Is there some other motivation for their ""caution"" such as concern by other countries about vaccine shortages that are really behind this review?   But for those who were vaccinated early in the year, delay for the wrong reasons may mean death or severe illness that could be avoided.   Sounds like there may be more digging needed to pursue this story further."
2021-09-03 15:45:59,"""...should instead concentrate on vaccinating the roughly 25 percent of Americans who are eligible for shots but remain unprotected.""

Seems pretty clear where the path of least resistance is here..."
2021-09-03 15:47:01,"Wow, only a handful of comments in and already there is one trashing scientists and another trashing doctors. Funny how attitudes change towards ""the experts"" when their actions and advice don't jibe with the crowd."
2021-09-03 15:45:15,"This was an unfortunate misstep by the Biden administration.  Conflicting and changing decisions creates doubts in all of the decisions made by administration, including masking. The resignations of senior FDA leaders and their comments confirm there was too much political pressure applied to FDA .  Further, the failure to name a head of FDA suggests Biden et al are more concerned with politics than advancing medicines, and simply aren’t up to the task of managing this pandemic coherently."
2021-09-03 15:48:06,"I hate this game. Our country has been behind the curve on every aspect of this pandemic. I consider myself a progressive who believes in science (I can’t believe I even have to say that) but the CDC’s abrupt recommendation to stop using masks in May really, really torpedoed my trust in their guidance. Now we are supposed to wait for more data, & observe the protocols of a bloated bureaucracy, while people are dying, businesses are going under, children are out there with no protection?? Children need vaccines now. I have an autoimmune disease & if my vaccine protection is waning, I want a booster now. Vaccines have been available for MONTHS- I’m tired of hearing that we need to focus on convincing the unvaccinated. We need bold, decisive, cohesive action & instead we get bumbling & infighting. This country has lost its way."
2021-09-03 15:57:23,"""There is no compelling reason to get a third dose"".  But what these articles never address is, is there a compelling medical reason not to?  Leaving aside supply and demand, both domestically and globally (and many in this country who have not received the vaccine have made a conscious choice not to), what is the medical downside to receiving a booster?  It seems like a logical question that constantly goes unanswered, so the only conclusion I can draw is that there isn't a downside.  The question then is, why not offer it to those of us who want one?  As the article makes clear, many individuals are finding a way to get a booster, and no adverse effects are being reported among that group."
2021-09-03 16:02:08,"There are a LOT of immune compromised people in this country whose health has been routinely ignored throughout this pandemic while the CDC continues making policies based on healthy individuals with robust immune responses.

Waiting for more data in a crisis, much of which our country isn’t even bothering to collect, is irresponsible at best."
2021-09-03 16:07:01,I agree with some of the other commentators that the FDA and CDC seem incredibly bureaucratic and sluggish and are not serving us well in a fast-moving pandemic.  Germany and France have already announced plans to give boosters to everyone over 60 ahead of robust data.  Data is nice but we don't always have the luxury to sit back and wait for it.
2021-09-03 16:08:29,"""Narrowing the booster plan could confuse the public and create a perception that federal vaccine policy is in some degree of disarray.""

Follow the science, not the optics and we will be fine."
2021-09-03 15:24:49,The FDA bureaucrats need to grasp that this is a four alarm emergency. I'm going with the Israelis.
2021-09-03 15:28:58,"I got my 3rd Moderna shot this week. I saw what Israel is doing and decided not to wait for Biden and company to decide if a booster is necessary. My life, my choice."
2021-09-03 15:33:21,"Here we go again...health officials and politicians on different pages deliver  differing messages... Then a media with zero restrain foaming at the bit to beat its competition to report anything to foment ""breaking news""... And you want to know why we don't yet have near enough people vaccinated! Go look in a mirror... Understanding the science behind the vaccine, I already have my booster! You WILL NEED IT..."
2021-09-03 15:46:45,Israel is vaccinating its population. That's good enough for me. I want the booster!!
2021-09-03 16:03:34,"As a matter of national policy, no American or human of any age should get a third dose until everyone in the third world has been vaccinated twice. This should be a United Nations Security Council resolution, too. And yes, I am in a group that is riskier for the virus than most. Come on, man. President Biden, you are the right person to call for  common humanity in this arena."
2021-09-03 16:08:39,"Another of Many reasons why, people hadn't gotten vaccinated in the first place, as they Can't Trust the Government, which Constantly Moves the proverbial Goalposts."
2021-09-03 16:08:13,"Who will ""the certain recipients of the Pfizer Vaccine"" 3rd jab be this month?  We're living in fear between the Pandemic and climate warming now.  We're thinking that Covid, climate change and political divisions will be our new normal now. The old status quo normalcy is a dead duck in America today."
2021-09-03 16:08:28,"The media jumped the gun on this.  Without legitimate scientific fact-finding, ""more vaccine doses"" is just as loony and nakedly political as ""no vaccine.""  Get ahold of yourselves.  This is exactly the difference between a scientist and a marketer/influencer/journalist/storyteller.  Obviously most people don't know the precise difference, but it is very important."
2021-09-03 15:51:19,"The public has turned its back on the ""experts"" who arrogantly claim a mantle of authority by referring to ""the science"" when time and again in this crisis they've had to make corrections to their advice as new information comes in.

Michelle Goldberg makes the excellent point that the scientists may be calling for more data because if there is a problem going ahead with shots they will get the blame, while if their caution leads to more illness and death that is somebody else's problem. In other words, like regular bureaucrats."
2021-09-03 15:54:32,Ok but I got my third Pfizer!
2021-09-03 15:57:35,"I see no compelling reason listed here not to get a 3rd Pfizer jab; my doctors have told me that now is the time before the FDA and CDC let their arrogance get the best of them and turn off the spigot officially. 

All of my ultra wealthy friends were told by their high earning physicians to go get #3 a month ago or better.

Millions of doses are spoiling daily, the powers that be won't let us vaccinate our children and schools are opening everywhere only in turn to fill pediatric wards.

The logistics makes it impossible to pick up and send shots that are already on the ground to other countries.

Supply is not short now, but if CDC and FDA wait for the winter wave to start, which may very well be the Mu variant by then, it will be very difficult to get a dose. As that variant also is potentially more likely to be evasive of the vaccine, especially with lower antibodies in your system, I would be inclined not to wait. Especially with the studies coming out of Israel that are showing potentially higher durability.

As many vaccine regimens are a 3 dose series, 2 close together and one significantly later, it makes a great deal of sense to consider your current options and perhaps get your #3 before they won't let you.
IMHO"
2021-09-03 16:06:18,"The CDC, who waited so long to tell us to mask up, who told us we could take them off too early - even when the WHO said it was a bad idea - and who now are refusing to issue another mandate, but instead saying to wear one if you're in a ""high risk area"" (aka the entire country if you look at COVID-19 infections) is not a body I have faith in to handle this pandemic anymore."
2021-09-03 16:10:04,I don’t see  anything wrong with Biden trying to get ahead of the game. Isn’t that what he was criticized for not doing in Afghanistan . I had the Booster shot and I can tell you there were plenty of vaccines  available at my pharmacy and many of them will probably get thrown away. I am over 65. They didn’t interrogate me. Would you rather have a mad frenzy for boosters when we are in the middle of another surge?  He will then be criticized for that too. You can’t win. I see very little difference between 6 or 8 months.
2021-09-03 16:05:59,"Retail pharmacists in my city tell me that they are still routinely throwing vaccine doses away every day because of limited demand. They open a vial for a walk-up customer and may have only one or two other customers the entire day. As a result, a half-full vial goes in the trash. So even if it's not strictly necessary for fully vaccinated people to get booster shots, why can't we give boosters to people who want them instead of throwing the vaccines in the trash can? I am assuming, of course, that the booster shot would not be harmful. Are booster shots harmfull or just not necessary?"
2021-09-03 15:49:12,"The remark, ""Protection against deaths may break down, and we want to have a booster plan"" is one of the most cogent statements I have seen."
2021-09-03 16:00:11,"Data from the Mayo Clinic study (and Israel) show that vaccinations by Moderna are 60% more durable than those from Pfizer-BioNTech.  Officials have been careful to lump the two together in these announcements, likely attempting to avoid a drastic public shift away from the Pfizer vaccine that would disrupt the supply chain and induce shortages of Moderna, not to mention adding uncertainty to those hesitant about vaccination.

The public can, and should, read the Mayo Clinic paper and decide for themselves, as government regulators concerned for their credibility will wait until individual catastrophe becomes what they consider to be statistically significant before making recommendations."
2021-09-03 15:49:42,"Yes, let's spend several more months collecting and analyzing data before Mother May I says yes, you may get a booster. Except that the ""data"" consists of vaccinated people getting sick, hospitalized and dying, running up thousands of dollars in bills since COVID subsidies and cost caps are expiring; we need to analyze what the percentages are before we decided if the cost of boosters is justified. Oh, and let's not forget global vaccine inequities, even though the millions of doses in US pharmacies are going unused and expiring, and will never help the unvaccinated in Africa. Has nothing to do with what's best for one's individual health and risk, when the highly contagious Delta variant can infect you despite taking all mask and social distancing precautions."
2021-09-03 15:51:02,"The FDA has been operating under diminished capacity virtually since the get-go (early 1900s!), when its ""godfather"", USDA chemist Dr. Harvey Wiley, was ganged-up on and pushed out because his food safety policies were costing US businesses too much money. Look up Dr. Wiley's incredible book, ""History of a Crime Against the Food Law: The Amazing Story of the National Food and Drugs Law Intended to Protect the Health of the People Perverted to Protect Adulteration of Food And Drugs"", which our own government tried to bury, back in the day.

The Bush 2 administration further dealt the beleaguered agency a near-fatal body blow by privatizing and shrinking it, closing vital labs required for food inspections (imported food goods are inspected by the FDA, not the USDA) and missing deadly contaminants like melamine, prohibited antibiotics, and even antifreeze. While writing about this in 2007, I learned that fewer than 1% of imports were inspected. Potentially dangerous drugs, like Ketek & Vioxx, were--before eventually being pulled due to liability--initially fast-tracked under the new public-private arrangement, and scientists who opposed their approval were silenced or forced out.

One can (and should) be fully supportive of scientists & doctors in general, and the vaccine effort in particular, while still being clear-eyed about--and critical of--the fact that the agency designed to regulate food and drugs in the US is in fact beholden to powers other than the public interest."
2021-09-03 16:02:11,"Its not clear what risks health officials are concerned about with a 3rd booster shot for people who tolerated the first two shots well.

If the FDA is inherently risk adverse, they should be more concerned about the risk of inaction on boosters, especially with growing vaccine breakthrough cases. 

WA State Department of Health has been tracking vaccine breakthrough cases since Jan 2021. Since the Delta variant became dominant, breakthrough cases in the State appear to be growing rapidly, from a cumulative 5,879 just 3 weeks ago to 21,757 now, with over 1,000 hospitalizations. 

With kids going back to school, we could see a lot of new cases in their households after Labor Day, especially in the northern states that have seen a quiet summer. This is what Scott Gottlieb, former FDA Chief is predicting. 

It is also puzzling to me that there has been so little notice paid to increasing vaccination rates. The NYT data shows that daily vaccinations hit a low of 500,000 in July and are now over 1,000,000 a day. Seems like a 100% increase would be worth noting, if only to encourage the ""hesitants"". 

I recognize that all of this is like building an airplane while flying it. Now we have to figure out how to land it."
2021-09-03 15:57:09,"Someone said, ""The vaccine's efficacy wanes after 8 months."" According to whom? I never read solid confirmation anywhere. We've run a terrible education campaign. No wonder we still have so many unvaccinated. I'm a vaccinated mask wearer and searched fruitlessly for concrete figures on mask effectiveness. Nothing, just vague statements that, ""Masks may help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others."" Now Biden is pushing boosters when 3/4 of the world hasn't been vaccinated. Let's start by vaccinating everyone once."
2021-09-03 15:53:09,"It seems to me that the FDA and CDC are engaging in a power struggle with the White House at the wrong time.   It is understandable to want to study the data before making decisions which will affect the public, however, it seems to me that the FDA and CDC are “dragging their feet”.   Why can’t they go over the data now, rather than three weeks from now?   Obviously the larger the sample size, the more accurate statistically they will be.  Are they going to have more data to review by then?  They, FDA and CDC, have not made that known.   If they are not going to have any more data, then the delay is unwarranted and furthers the problems with the pandemic."
2021-09-03 16:20:35,"Perhaps if the CDC had not stopped tracking breakthrough infections in May there would be enough data.  The CDC is only tracking hospitalization and deaths from breakthrough infections.  Instead of waiting until there are increases in hospitalizations and deaths from breakthrough (the ""more data"" Federal regulators want) before a 3rd shot is given, how about giving the 3rd shot now and then look for decreases in hospitalization and deaths — that is the data I would like to see."
2021-09-03 16:24:26,"While I think this is the right decision, I believe it was made for the wrong reasons. A schedule of necessary booster shots would have complicated the implementation of vaccine passports all over the country. Would I, a vaccinated person whose second shot was June 1, be granted access to a restaurant on January 31st but be barred on February 1? I think the administration saw that they could either have boosters or vaccine passports and chose the latter."
2021-09-03 16:30:23,"I will not get a booster until there is more conclusive data about the need and the value add as well as widespread consensus in the medical community. I am not going to get a booster based on a political decision. And as a J&J recipient, if I have to get a J&J booster, I will not get one at all."
2021-09-03 16:34:42,"Seems like a lot of ego and political problems at the FDA, just when we don't need it.  First the top two people resign and now the stand in throws a fit.

On the August 29th, the NY Post reported, ""Fauci said that the White House was moving ahead with plans to give out the boosters eight months after people received their second shot, but they 'were open to data' that suggests the dose should be available sooner.""

Today the FDA is suggesting that some people may never ""qualify"" to get a booster, even as data from other countries suggest that waning immunity make it necessary.

Going from Everyone in Eight Months or Before to Never is a big, consequential change, and its incumbent on the FDA to explain why.  

Not that I expect them too, but it would be nice."
2021-09-03 16:34:57,"I am so tired of this:  politicians jumping the gun on information, PR type statements from agencies instead of straightforward announcements that don't have to be taken back, and the rush to do something, anything no matter how costly, unproven, or dangerous it might be.  

Our health is not about poll numbers.  Neither is our safety or our need to be vaccinated once, twice, or receive a booster somewhere along the line.  Governing is not about winning a popularity contest.  It's about being competent, trying not to make disastrous mistakes, explaining the whys and hows to the country, and making hard decisions.  

We can wait until the evidence is in. And we can understand that we must continue to be cautious.  Wearing a mask, keeping our physical distance from each other, and washing our hands isn't a lot to ask, booster or not.  Nor is it a lot to expect our fellow citizens and residents to be vaccinated in order to keep all of us safe from this illness."
2021-09-03 15:54:19,FDA:  Formulating Discombobulating Advice.  Now I get it.
2021-09-03 15:57:37,"No mask, mask, no mask, mask CDC wants 'time to review more data'. If the 'data' is good enough for Israel, it should be good enough for us. Start boosters with the elderly, the immune compromised, and those living with the same. 'Data' shows the fully vaccinated can spread the virus."
2021-09-03 16:04:58,Oh for heaven's sake.  Just stick with the information. Stop saying how confused everybody is.  The more you say that the more confused they will be.  Stop attacking Biden. That fans the flames which makes for good headlines but not progress.    It's perfectly clear vaccines work.  Masks work.  We may need more time for the booster. That's all. I can deal with complexity.  Most can.
2021-09-03 16:10:24,"Another proof point that the FDA is out of touch with reality. While these fools are fiddling our country's health care system is burning.  In spite of overwhelming evidence that COVId is spread airborne they will still not recommend N95 masks for healthcare workers. Combine that with waning immunity and the ease that Delta spreads and you have a disaster in the making. My wife runs a busy ER and her staff is dropping like flies from Delta. Today she has 5 sick call from COVID and no amount of overtime will bring in her discouraged, burnt out nurses on their day off. This is a crisis. Without nurses healthcare stops. She is sick with worry that this staffing issue will result in patients deaths in the event of something like a multi-victim automobile accident. The same dynamic is playing out in ERs and ICUs across the country since even with a mild case a nurse is out of action for 10-14 days before they can come back to work."
2021-09-03 16:15:19,"Once again, it's politicians vs. the scientists."
2021-09-03 16:16:56,"Gee, too bad Joe was so Strategically Impatient in unilaterally deciding to withdraw from Afghanistan, as in lieu of a Wholesale Turnover that made the Taliban The most Heavily Armed Narco Terrorists, our beloved President and the esteemed Last Person Standing in the Room could have sold some of that estimated 3 Billon in Weapons, Ammunition, Aviation assets, supplies and equipment to Finance more boosters and Vaccines for Americans and Impoverished Citizens of the World's Underdeveloped nations. 

Almost sounds like good common sense, the uncommon virtue."
2021-09-03 16:18:32,"Let those of us who want a booster, get a booster.  This is my free will and liberty as others pose not to take it .

Allow me to take this risk!"
2021-09-03 16:23:30,"I would like my booster shot now.  Waiting for any reason will increase the chance of getting sick with Covid.  It has been proven in Israel that the booster shot is beneficial, no one has died from it yet there, we are lucky to see their data.  Why drag our feet to put us at unnecessary higher risk.  Are we behaving like a traffic sign has only been put up after several people have died at that spot?"
2021-09-03 16:20:16,As a physician over 70 who has been exposed to many unvaccinated patients the data from Israel is sufficient to booster every vulnerable patient after 8 months perhaps even 5. To wait and expose more people to the vagaries of illness is unconscionable and typical of an overly cautious and data obsessed health bureaucrat. Every life is valuable in a pandemic with ever more threatening and infectious variants and the aim should be to maximize the protection of all individuals. It would be very wise to start boosters on all patients promptly.
2021-09-03 16:22:54,My father is 76 and has cancer. He has his second vaccine in May.  No booster shot. I live overseas. No idea how safe it is for me to visit him and I cannot seem to get sound guidance?
2021-09-03 16:14:09,"Israel has shown that 3rd shots are helpful, and we don't have the luxury of waiting. In my grandparents' building in their retirement home, where everyone had their mRNA shots starting in January, there were just 12 new COVID cases. Even if Pfizer and Moderna have not completely met the FDA's benchmarks, these 3rd shots should still be approved for emergency use authorization. Peoples' lives are at stake now. We cannot afford to dawdle."
2021-09-03 16:14:11,This is the final straw to my confidence in the CDC and FDA. They seem not to have adjusted their usual slow procedures to a raging pandemic. This latest backtrack on the booster shot will reinforce the skepticism and resolve of the unvaccinated. These agencies have no clue how their indecisiveness and sluggishness have impacted public perception which ultimately matters more than the booster itself if nobody believes them anymore.
2021-09-03 16:21:47,"“...we are going to see hospitalizations and more serious disease... When that happens, she said, “we want to be ready.”  How about if we ""be ready""  BEFORE we ""see hospitalizations?""   Our whole strategy through two administrations now seems to be to use dead people  and ICU overloads as initiating factors."
2021-09-03 16:14:37,"I developed vaccines and medicines and worked with the FDA an even spent a day with Dr Woodcock so I understand why they can’t make policy on my limited experience and judgment that it seems obvious boosters will be a good idea and totally safe. They need data to support this supposition. Each company develops that data set under the guidance of the agency, taking time, up front, to agree the kind of data and statistics to validate the results (this takes time) and when it is delivered, the agency need time to evaluate the results (summary tables) and QC the case report forms that demonstrate the quality of the data. This is not overly bureaucratic, but it takes too much time in a time constrained environment. This is the source of the tension. Everyone is doing what they can as fast as possible but the Whitehouse communicated a timeframe that doesn’t match the plan possible. - Can you tell my role was to project manage these R&D projects? :)"
2021-09-03 16:11:54,"Now that is really funny.  (If people's lives didn't depend on an answer.)
Not enough data.
They have never had enough data, but that hasn't stopped them from making decisions.
Don't wear masks, they don't help.
Wear masks.
Now wear double masks even vaccinated people.
Two weeks later vaccinated people don't need to wear masks.
Now in same states everyone needs to wear masks again.
Everyone get a 3rd vaccine in 8 months, oh, no, make that 6 months, oh no make it 5 months.  Now there isn't enough evidence although there seems to be enough evidence in other countries.  
Only in the United States."
2021-09-03 15:49:52,I believe I recently read that 15 million vaccines were wasted recently. How about we stop dreaming and give the shots where they are wanted?

Israel boosted for all after five months. Pick your authority - I know the one I’m picking."
2021-09-03 16:19:56,"This is moronic—we have enough data to know that vaccine efficacy (for all of them) wanes over time. Additionally, we know—and this is for a fact—that the vaccines are nowhere near the efficacy touted originally. We need booster availability now and every public health official and MD/DO knows it. I personally know many vaccinated people who have contracted Covid with a bad enough case to get tested (as opposed to those of us who may have had it, but just soldier through and don't require medical care or get a test). Worse, many people I know are doubling or tripling up on the vaccines! So, availability is a moot point. And 'convincing' the 25% who won't get it? How? The same way you convince them about any other divisive/emotional 'political' issue? Come on, man...This is going to get people killed (by the thousands!). Public health officials and 'scientists' have bungled communication around this at every turn...The benefits to making the boosters available FAR outweigh the risks. 100 people will get a booster for every ONE anti-vaxxer you convince to get a TWO-SHOT vaccine!"

Forget waiting 8 months that's too long and Viruses thrive in colder weather!  It seems we have learned nothing about this Virus or are staying willfully ignorant!  With the Delta Variant being so much more contagious these ""regulators"" are being negligent and constitute a threat to Health and Public Safety!  Do we really need to see massive die offs of Americans for our government to take this Virus and Variant Seriously?  Also Children between the Ages of 5-11 desperately need to be Vaccinated how many children need to die before the FDA and or CDC and Biden get it?"
2021-09-03 16:35:21,I don’t particularly want to find out the hard way that I should have gotten a booster.
2021-09-03 16:25:24,"This is just another example of U.S. politicians and health officials managing coronavirus like they're playing pinball.

Most countries have not yet made a decision about boosters. Those that have are limiting them to people in high risk categories.

Israel differs in that it is taking a more expansive view of what circumstances qualify, and is now making booster shots available at a lower cut-off age (40). Israel also has a large population, in a low population country, that objects to vaccination, making the relevance of its decisions questionable. That said, its data will be useful.

I think that the U.S. should be copying the approach that is proving highly successful in Canada next door, which is a mix of vaccination and prophylactic measures. Quebec implemented a vaccination pass two days ago. British Columbia and Ontario are doing the same on September 13th and 22nd. This is likely to have a much greater impact than booster shots."
2021-09-03 16:27:41,People are already getting third shots in New York. How is this happening?  Are they just walking into vaccine sites and asking?  Is nobody paying attention to who is getting the shots? This is a muddle of confusion.
2021-09-03 16:29:20,"They are locking the barn door after the horse is gone.  At least where I am anybody who wants a booster can get one from any pharmacy that has been offering vaccines.  As others have mentioned,  the alternative is to throw the unused shots away."
2021-09-03 16:34:19,"At the end of this article the suggestion is to wait until vaccinated people start dying before actually doing something about wrt booster shots. Am I reading this right? Because this is the foolish mistake we have made this entire pandemic. When this all started and we did not have cases everywhere, we were told that COVID was serious, but don't worry, no cases have been detected in our region. We then waited until we had cases before taking any preventive measures. Of course, waiting until you detect cases in your state/county is too late. This entire pandemic has been like watching a train speeding toward an obviously broken bridge, but waiting until the train is on the bridge to do anything about it.

I'm all for listening to the science, but it sounds like here we have once again dropped the ball with respect to tracking and data. Why don't we have the data from Israel? We certainly give them enough support to warrant them giving us the data. Why aren't we doing a better job of testing, tracking, sequencing? Why are some states allowed to underreport, or not report detailed case information?

It seems the US is truly incapable these days of doing anything competently--just look at the bungled pull out in Afghanistan."
2021-09-03 16:25:20,Are other pharmaceuticals working on a different vaccine that can help with all these variants and the ones to come ?
2021-09-03 16:26:18,"The Coronavirus and it’s variants has proven time and time again that public health policies can not win by playing catch-up with the virus.  You have to be ahead of it in both tactics and strategy to even hope at break even.  

The first clues in the U.S. were the Redmond Washington nursing home and long time care deaths.  Unfortunately, those tragic deaths were repeated across the country except for the few facilities that acted aggressively.  

We need to be planning for the next pandemic and strategizing voluntary expanded vaccine availability as part of the process of collecting clinical trial data.  There were tens of thousands of medical workers and emergency personnel who were at risk in 2020 and could have been protected."
2021-09-03 16:33:22,"Scientific advisors continue to fail to see that these are also political decisions. The boosters should be made available alongside education about risks and uncertainties, knowing that the damage to our country in all spheres, political, economical, of community and education obligate us to attack the virus with all we have and that action must be taken without complete knowledge to gain an upper hand against the virus."

2021-09-03 16:16:11,"One problem is that our bodies have two immune systems: one in our eyes/nose/mouth (mucosal) and one in the rest of our body. The vaccines induce immunity in the body’s immune system, but not in the mucosal system. So, “breakthrough” infections are mostly in the mucosal system. These infections are quickly stopped from getting worse by the body’s immune system, which is why vaccinated people tend to have either mild or no symptoms, rarely are hospitalized, and almost never die. Boosters with the same vaccine will make little to no difference to this situation. The vaccines are still working great at what they were designed for, which was to prevent people from getting terribly sick and/or dying. The problem is that, in the absence of masking, distancing, etc., mucosal infections are prolonging the epidemic, which is killing our economy. They also allow the virus to continue mutating. The continuing epidemic is exposing variants of the virus to vaccinated/previously infected individuals, which imposes natural selection favoring the ability to overcome the body’s current immunity. We need to keep isolating and masking to stop the epidemic and to prevent that evolution from happening. These behaviors might also allow the economy to recover. It’s a win-win."
2021-09-03 16:39:00,"I'm 70 years old. Got my first shot of Moderna in Feb. Provider would not schedule second shot because they didn't know when they would get more. 
So started over by end of April got two shots from program run by my City. Total of three now. I can read the science as will as the FDA and CDC. Got a J&J shot three weeks ago. Why! because it takes a different approach to building immunity. With the Moderna shots had about 10 to 12 hours of misery then was just fine. With J&J almost 24 hours of misery then just fine. Just got my Flu shot. Pharmacist said wait at least 7 days to get covid booster after Flu shot. Its scheduled. Pharmacist said she was discarding vaccines because of low demand, she is heartbroken to toss it out. Hopefully Biden will not stop boosters because of CDC and FDA.

2021-09-03 16:42:13,"Bit of a tangent, but I love how people cite the preprints out of Israel to support a booster policy, but completely ignore their other studies that point to natural immunity being much better than vaccine immunity. Israel has always allowed recovered individuals to qualify for their Green Pass for a certain time period after infection, but now they allow all recovery with no time constraints."

Perhaps the Biden administration cornered the FDA but the solution to that is to pout and quit? Our national response to this challenge continues to sadden and anger me."

2021-09-03 16:46:22,"Can we just let the FDA do its job?  
The covid vaccine manufacturers need to show the FDA the data from their clinical trial volunteers who have received the vaccines and  booster so that the FDA can approve (or authorize under the EUA program) that:  
The booster is safe, effective, at what dose, in which age groups/patient conditions, and at what interval from the last vaccination -- AND, under those conditions and that patient subset -- the benefit outweighs the risks (of side effects).
People getting a booster without MD guidance and without being in the currently labeled immunosuppressed group are playing with fire.  How do they know that they are not unwittingly inciting TOLERANCE or autoimmunity by getting a booster?   Let the clinical trial participants who agreed to be studied be the ""guinea pigs"".  
Besides the booster indications, the FDA is also reviewing the pediatric covid vaccine indications.  And now 2 leaders in the vaccine division at FDA have quit under all of the political pressure and public criticism.  The physicians and scientists at the FDA working tirelessly on reviewing the covid vaccine dossiers are the heroes in this pandemic and do not deserve this."

2021-09-03 16:51:19,"Why is the CDC not outsourcing the testing of antibodies and collecting data to local university sites? If they can hand out a checklist manifesto and the required equipment, we can rapidly ascertain state by state what the antibody status of the general populace is. This was you can track the waning of the antibody with time and figure in age categories also. Surely in a pandemic we all need to cooperate ( excluding the anti vaccine Republicans), to work faster and more efficiently. 

Perhaps also keep the younger public updated about the second generation vaccines on the horizon. If the trials have similar side effects to the original Pfizer and Moderna, and address variants in a more effective manner, it stands to reason that booster shots should be delayed for the better vaccine. So many more exciting second generation vaccines, liken the one from Baylor collaborating with BioE in Hyderabad, India. I’m eager to try this new generation stuff, it might help us get out and explore the world in a more carefree manner."
2021-09-03 16:57:21,"There is a way to do this objectively. It is called the spike protein antibody test. The CDC and the FDA apparently are not using the data from this test but others have including myself in my private practice. Dr Lin and Paul Sax in their NYT article  8/29 recommending boosters for Jand J vaccinated  cited "" One recent study, which has not been peer-reviewed, found that 33 percent of Johnson & Johnson-vaccinated dialysis patients did not develop antibodies, compared with 4 percent for Pfizer and 2 percent for Moderna."" This data was  determined using antibody testing, that the CDC does not recommend ,but should be using to prioritize those in need of booster shots now. I have been testing all my patients and have data on over 550+ now. 9% of my patients had no antibodies and another 8% had levels less than 5 with maximum detectable being greater than 20--which  72% of my patients had on initial testing. This includes all 3 vaccines.  Those with levels less than 5 or undetectable should be the first to get booster shots with the mRNA vaccines. This would be the most objective and cost effective way to proceed. The patients with levels over 20 don't need them yet but likely will over the coming months and have time to wait versus the lower level responders who need boosters now. The type of vaccine given is irrelevant and should not be determinative in deciding who gets boosters 1st ."
2021-09-03 16:30:07,"Who really listens to the FDA (or the government for that matter) on whether to get a booster?  It's what your doctor says that matters. And my doctor, based on results in Israel, which is not as concerned about bureaucracy and C.Y.A. as government agencies and the Administration apparently are, has advised that I get the Moderna booster.  Which I did."
2021-09-03 16:49:20,"This is beyond my understanding. Is it a power grab by the FDA? Israeli statistics show that people over the age of 60 are 6 times more susceptible to severe illness and death before the third shot. Why is it difficult to obtain and analyze the statistics from Israel, France, and Germany. The unvaxxed should not be part of this decision. Their refusal has put the rest of us at higher risk. Giving third shots doesn't mean that none will be available for the unvaxxed."
2021-09-03 16:52:57,"This is for the NYTimes: how about the people that participated in the trials for the vaccines and got vaccinated last year, hundreds of thousands of human beings, already with a YEAR of last vaccination? Nobody is thinking about them? The CEO of Pfizer said, like 3 months ago, that the vaccine effectivity goes down 6% per month after the sixth month of last full vaccination. I got the second dose on September 29th of 2020. Have we received an e-mail saying ""You are not protected anymore""? NO, How can this be justified ? We are a danger to ourselves and to others. IMMORAL!!!"
2021-09-03 16:53:29,"Will somebody please think about the children?  Why are they not a bigger priority when they have zero protection? I got my Moderna shot early as an otherwise healthy essential healthcare worker. The efficacy of my shot could be waning, so you know what I'm doing? The same things I have done since early May and the abysmally stupid advice to drop masks. I go nowhere outside my home without a mask on if indoors around other people, I wash my hands for 20 seconds, I limit my travel to only necessary places, and I check my own symptoms to see if I need a test. This is not rocket science. I enforce masks on my patients when they have their visits, encourage the hesitant to get informed and inoculated, and follow sanitation guidelines for our clinic. If that means one less person in our desperately overworked hospitals, great. Get the shots to the last big threat we have no other options for- kids under 12! I can wait."
2021-09-03 16:55:03,"That 25% of Americans? It was 30% a while ago and they became friendly home base for the Delta variant that is attacking the rest of us. That 25% still holds an element of power over the rest of us, messing with our lives and the health of our children.

Many of the 25% are science ignorant and unreachable, others confident (hopeful) that their spiritual beliefs will shield them, some of them are politically convinced that conquering the pandemic would be a win for Biden.  Or all three.

Perhaps we need tell the 25-centers that we are donating their shots to poor countries. To third world countries. You don't want them? Poor people of color will be glad to take them for free. For free... Maybe that will motivate them..."
2021-09-03 16:58:08,"We need to be AHEAD of the need for boosters. I'm tired of waiting, at 69, for bureaucrats to decide they want the final say. FDA has not been in the front of sharing their data and now waiting to receive Israel's data. 8 months at end of Oct will mark the second Moderna shot for me. I want to be able to receive a booster by then. 1 million have already received boosters. HOW? (not that many immunio people)"
2021-09-03 17:01:24,"Israel has proceeded to give all their adults the 3rd dose with remarkable results:

1. Among people aged 60 and over, the protection against infection provided from 10 days after a third dose was four times higher than after two doses.

2. The third jab for over 60-year-olds offered five to six times greater protection after 10 days with regard to serious illness and hospitalization.

3. Less than a month into a COVID-19 vaccine booster drive, Israel has seen significant impact on the country's high infection and severe illness rates by the fast-spreading Delta variant.

The rate of disease spread among vaccinated people (known as the reproduction rate), began falling steadily around Aug. 13 and has dipped below 1, indicating that each infected person is transmitting the virus to fewer than one other person. A reproduction rate of less than 1 means an outbreak is subsiding"
2021-09-03 17:00:41,"""the trend of breakthrough infections has led health officials to believe at some point, “we are going to see hospitalizations and more serious disease” among fully vaccinated people. When that happens, she said, “we want to be ready” with the booster plan.""

Basically, what that means is that the FDA wants to wait until a large enough number of vaccinated people have contracted the virus and DIED, before it is convinced that boosters are needed.  

I have complete confidence in the wisdom of that approach and I am also secure in my knowledge that the FDA has a fully validated and approved plan to resurrect the dead once it has collected enough data to know that it should have approved booster shots 3 months sooner.

Anyone doubting the FDA should please sit down and be quiet!"

I was fine after my first 2 Moderna shots (no adverse reactions). The only difference with the 3rd shot was that my arm was sore for a couple of days. I'd like to add my data to whoever is collecting it. (:-)
2021-09-03 17:11:37,"Meanwhile, we got our booster shots - a week ago, Moderna, and feel fine - and most of the folks we know are getting theirs. Everyone is listening to and reading about the confusion and fighting at the CDC and FDA, then looking at the reports from Moderna, Pfizer and Israel and watching vaccinated friends get COVID - and  saying the heck with this political infighting and bureaucratic quibbling, just go get it. 

Trust me, people have read reports re the data and made up their minds - i.e., gotten those shots and will continue to do so. Virtually no one in our friend and family circle is waiting until 9/20 or whenever.  Health care providers are giving boosters to anyone 6 months out who signs an attestation. No one wants even 
 “a mild case of COVID.”"
2021-09-03 17:02:53,Got my third Pfizer shot 8 months after my second.  After seeing what Israel was doing and what Pfizer recommended.  Given the way the vaccines are being administered it is very easy to do.  Just FYI.

Notwithstanding the “goodness” of our plans. The timeliness of our efforts-for enough time(s).Realities which many of us choose not to consider. Even to deny.

2021-09-03 17:09:13,"This makes me mad. Those 25% are never going to get the vaccine unless they are ran down in the street and vaccinated like a misbehaving child. Anecdotally, my entire family and siblings' friends families all contracted covid through a single breakthrough case at a music fest, despite everyone being fully vaccinated almost none of these dozen+ actually got covid tests until one of them experienced a weird symptom and got tested. We could be potentially missing hundreds or thousands of asymptomatic or light breakthrough cases that aren't reported because people assume it's an allergy or can't be bothered to get a test.

The people administering vaccines in my area are already distrustful of the government, and our vaccination rate is absolutely atrocious within the county. When there's a smidgen of uncertainty at the CDC, it makes these workers at the local CVSs and Walmarts say ""I told you so"" and refuse to give you an extra dose if you tell the truth. My coworkers are high risk, anti vaxxer, and absolutely irreplaceable for my work. If they won't get the vaccine to safeguard our work, I'll be finding a way to get that third vaccine early."
2021-09-03 17:08:28,"This is a war against a wildfire-like virus that’s a moving target.  If booster shots are effective, Biden’s team can’t wait for full FDA approval to prepare and more importantly, prepare the public at large for roll-out.  As for the unvaccinated, economic pressure from employers must finish the job of convincing them to get their shots.  We’re now in an action environment well beyond jaw-boning & bureaucratic precision."
2021-09-03 17:07:45,"Seems to me the CDC is treating the population as at equal risk. High-risk people (elderly, diabetic, breathing impaired, e.g.) probably need a booster—and sooner rather than later. The CDC wants to wait and see if these folks start dying at a higher rate before offering boosters."
2021-09-03 17:06:15,"Both my husband and my self-**seniors** with health issues-- were able to get boosters of the Moderna and Physer vaxx here in Upstate NY in the past 3 weeks.  Virtually no questions asked.

What I **did** find disconcerting was when I was waiting after my shot two women walked into the CVS that was ADVERTISING and had SIGNS for walk in shots-- and they were TURNED AWAY.  Not for lack of any ID etc, but because despite the hype on JUST WALK IN--- You can't.  The vaxx spot has to have a **walk in vial** available, so you either need to call ahead or make an appointment.  (What had they drawn MY shot from?)

So will people who have waited THIS LONG now figure that we cannot be serious about this, if the hype and the ads and the signs promote one thing but the reality is.different?  Will they find another place, or just not get the vax at all??  (These were not looking for boosters but had never had any COVID vax)

No wonder people don't trust this."
2021-09-03 17:09:26,"Perhaps what we really, badly need is a rapid, inexpensive test for antibody titers! I hear nothing about that.

I'm an over 70 cancer survivor who must stay with a too-young-to-be-vaccinated, in-person school attending grandkid in 2 weeks. My 2nd shot was 6.5 mos ago. I have NO IDEA whether I have now or ever had sufficient protection. For myself or for her.

The confusion from medical establishment is very frustrating and possibly dangerous. Part of the problem is a propensity of public health people to tell us what they think will best steer mass behavior. To manipulate, rather than give straight info as fast as possible. (Pooh-poohing mask wearing early on, not because masks don't work, but because they wanted scarce PPE reserved for healthcare workers, e.g.)

These are not normal circumstances. We DO NOT KNOW what to do and CDC and FDA are mired in bureaucratic sluggishness. CYA and business as usual are intolerable now."

With the emerging of the Delta variant and the recognition that it was highly contagious, beginning to overtake all other variants in the United States—

Health experts pleaded with Biden (and his administration) weeks and weeks and months ago, to use the pulpit of his presidency to urge that universities and organizations and corporations REQUIRE vaccination. Not just tell people over and over that they should be vaccinated.

But political calculations reigned supreme. 

Now it’s catch-up and confusion.

2021-09-03 17:14:57,"A very useful article on Pfizer's efforts is :

<a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2021/08/30/inside-pfizer-labs-variant-hunters-race-to-stay-ahead-of-pandemic-2"" target=""_blank"">https://www.statnews.com/2021/08/30/inside-pfizer-labs-variant-hunters-race-to-stay-ahead-of-pandemic-2</a>/

Some think that the term ""booster"" should not be used as the third mRNA injection is really part of a series and the first two injections may have been spaced too close together for optimum effect.
Although science is learning more about the human immune system it is really a ""black box"" which is different for each individual based on their genetics and life history.  Thus they will react to the injections in different ways.
 Six months or eight months, just get it.  There was a saying when I was in the Army ""When in doubt run in circles, jump and shout but do something do  do anything"".  This is at odds with doctors credo of do no harm which sometimes paralyzes necessary action until all data is in. In business successful executives act on less than complete information based on experience."
2021-09-03 17:15:22,"It's not about the safety of boosters. It's about safety from the pandemic.

We can be boosted to high heaven within our borders but we will never be over this pandemic as long as under-vaccinated peoples world wide continue to be incubators of this virus which will continue to mutate, possibly into forms resistant to current vaccines. 

As long as two shots are working to keep break through infections mild, this is the window of opportunity to start eliminating the overseas incubators of more dangerous variants. For our own protection, any excess vaccines (refused by Americans), should go overseas to those begging for them. We can make more and encourage vaccine manufacturing overseas.

As for gauging immunity by levels of circulating antibodies to the spike protein, remember there is another, very essential arm to our immune defense, the cellular immunity. Testing for cellular immunity is not possible to do on a clinical scale; those tests are complex and done only in research labs. So we don't have a means of measuring or even estimating any changes in our immune response after vaccination through time. And yet we want, we demand more: three now, four later.

Currently, with two shots, I'm more worried about C 1,2, the new variant from overseas that's spreading like Delta and is already in eight countries. It's been found to be extremely volatile to mutations.  In truth, I fear another Delta hitting the globe. And I fear our ignorance of the larger threat."
2021-09-03 17:15:56,"Many of us who are at the highest risk of dying due to age or medical conditions have been doing the right things from the very beginning. Masking, distancing, passing up family gatherings and all the other things that give life meaning; getting the vaccine to protect ourselves and others, even though we may have had some concerns about it. 

It's not easy to maintain a positive attitude when you keep hearing that Covid isn't a big deal because it's ""only"" people like you who are dying. Vaccines gave us hope but that has been eroded by Delta and reports that vaccine protection is waning. It's hard to be patient when surrounded by the lunacy and selfishness of people who scream about freedom and refuse to do the right thing.

Watching the continued incompetence and lack of focus of government agencies is making it even worse. Fear is turning into impatience and slowly into rage. So far it's mostly silent rage from us but maybe we should start getting louder. It's time for  the selfish ones to choose - get vaccinated or lose access to the things they want or need to do - just as we've be forced to do."
2021-09-03 17:16:09,"This is terrible news for those above 55 years of age and have underlying conditions. UK, Germany, Israel, Chile and many other nations are proceeding with the 3rd dose of the Pfizer shot to reduce breakthrough infections and slow down the pandemic. CDC failed Americans by having no Covid-19 test for a month until German Covid-19 test was adopted by WHO for worldwide use. FDA failed to approve any University labs and private labs until a month after Covid-19 pandemic had arrived in the US. Both agencies are wrapped in red tape. So no surprise they want to debate this until the cows come home. The Pfizer shot is now approved. US law allows ""off-label"" use of any FDA approved medicine. My younger brother who works in a hospital already went and got his 3rd shot. Dealing with Covid019 patients he is unlikely to be sitting on FDA when all of Europe has already moved on. Many of my colleagues in the 60-65 group plan to take early retirement if the booster shot is not going to be made available. US work force  continues to shrink. FDA and CDC are letting Americans down again. That said, FDA has done no plant inspection in India pharma factories since March 2020. Expect recalls  in the near future."
2021-09-03 17:27:18,"I live in the Pacific Northwest where the Delta variant has been exploding, hospitals are stressed with largely unvaccinated patients, and pediatric cases are rising. There are more than a few breakthrough cases among people I know who mask, are vaccinated and do not frequent crowded indoor or outdoor spaces. Do I want a booster? Yes. My life and those of so many others have been disrupted in significant part due to the anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers who have allowed the virus to spread and mutate in selfish disregard of the fact that they live in a community."
2021-09-03 17:30:30,"This guidance has been confusing. The hospital I work at had extra doses and at the advice of management many of us got a booster shot this week. (We had our second dose back in early January). The effects of the vaccine were more pronounced to me and my immediate coworkers anecdotally than the first or second vaccine. We all experience fatigue and a headache sometime within 48 hours of the vaccine. 

I felt strongly about getting the booster when I initially heard about it, as I’ve been getting nervous with the Delta variant raging. I’m glad I may have slipped through the cracks here."
2021-09-03 17:31:31,"I got my 2nd Pfizer in February at VA and was told I would get booster around 8 months later which will be next month, October. I wear mask around people, even friends. I have 18 different masks. I treat them as part of my stylish wardrobe. No big deal."
2021-09-03 17:33:18,"Very glad to see the administration letting the FDA and CDC follow the science here. Just as was the case last fall, we need to let the FDA do its thing and be sure vaccines are safe and effective.
Once the FDA gives it's blessing, I will enthusiastically take the booster when my turn comes. Until then, and even after that, I'll protect myself and others by following CDC's recommendations, particularly wearing a mask in public."
2021-09-03 17:35:52,"This country is allegedly a ""world leader"" and the USA promotes itself as ""the leader of the free world"". Well, IMO, ""the leader of the free world"" should help the whole world and not just themselves. 

I say, turn the manufacturing of vaccine up to the MAX and ship it all over the world to those who remain unvaccinated. 

Anything else is short sighted and dim witted and will harm everyone in this world, including Americans. Let's free the world from coronavirus - if we can."
2021-09-03 17:21:13,"Interesting all this talk about “sharing data” and waiting “for the data.”

For 13 years, I lived with an statistician working in medical research.  Did a year or do working in medical research myself.  People shared analyses, research papers, later poster presentations.  Nobody ever shared the data.

Sharing data is not the norm in American medical research.  Never has been.  Given that American researchers don’t share their own data, even with each other, it’s unlikely they will get much response when they demand data from other countries.

Btw, unless you’re good with statistics, data really aren’t very useful in decision making.  It’s the analysis that matters.  We have some very credible analyses from Israel, Germany and the UK where they collect data from actual healthcare systems.  Maybe we shouldn’t be waiting for American doctors to reinvent the wheel."
2021-09-03 17:29:33,"What has happened to the CDC? An agency that thirty years ago could do no wrong now can't seem to do anything right -- and certainly has completely lost touch with normal people. Last week, while trying to convince a friend to get his Covid shot, I searched for one simple data point: How many people died in 2018, 2019, and 2020? I could find the unofficial total for 2020, but I had to search deep within multiple pieces of prose to find the other two stats. Also, almost every document started with the conclusion -- Covid is killing a lot of people -- rather than being smart about it and providing figures so that people can figure out the (obvious) truth. Now we have this mess. Put yourself in Biden's place. He doesn't want people to start getting sick and dying in another month. He's seen what happened in Israel. Meanwhile, the scientists appear to want to wait and see if my mom or I kick the bucket from Covid before Thanksgiving. This is not a way to build public trust or to encourage listening to scientists."
2021-09-03 17:18:37,"I have had Non-Hodgkin's Follicular Lymphoma since 2008.  This is an incurable cancer and even though there are periods of remission, it cannot be cured.  I RAN to get my booster shot as soon as it was available.  The fact that 40% of the American public is running around unvaccinated erased any doubt I might have had about a booster."
2021-09-03 17:20:42,I had two antibodies tests and both showed a very low concentration of antibodies after I got J&J in March. It’s clear that we need a third shot. What’s going on here?
2021-09-03 17:21:18,"Following the science is sometimes not so simple and the FDA is really dropping the ball here.  They need to be called out.  I, as a scientist, find it a ghastly horror that we are using pre-pandemic safety thresholds for vaccine approvals when thousands are dying every day.  It is very obvious, to anyone not cowed by the vaccine skeptics at least, that these approvals should weigh the risks with the benefits and that using pre-pandemic safety criteria is sheer negligence.  The risks of doing nothing are severe, and timidly biting one's nails about the chance of some vaccine side effects happening while Rome burns is inexcusable.  Every week that vaccines and vaccine boosters are delayed likely costs thousands and thousands of lives, which is not in the same universe as some cases of pericarditis or brain clots here and there.

As soon as the evidence suggests that a booster will likely slow Delta, it should be approved immediately.  Approving vaccines for all ages would increase population vaccine rates 10%+, practically overnight.  This could save the south, get kids back in school, contribute to herd immunity and should again be approved immediately.  As soon as Modena and Pfizer can show that a Delta-specific mRNA vaccine makes antibodies and likely impaired Delta's spread, it should be immediately approved.  Release them with higher caution, but release them.

Using peacetime criteria in the middle of a war is absurd.  That's what we're getting from the FDA right now."
2021-09-03 17:28:06,"Give me a break. Stall with debates until it’s too late…again? Do we need the data delivered on a silver platter with a side of diamonds? We have good data from countries much better organized than we are, and this is a pandemic in the fourth surge. The US is at the bottom of developed countries for results that are keeping people safe. If we want a booster, then let us have one."
2021-09-03 17:35:20,I received a booster shot on Tuesday because of my autoimmune disease and the medication I take which suppresses my immune system.  I hope this was not a mistake.  I was following the Federal guidelines as to whom is eligible and  accordingly scheduled and received the 3rd Pfizer shot.
2021-09-03 17:29:49,"What is strange to me: they don't have enough data. How come? According to reports already more than 1 million people got the 3rd shot.
If that's not enough, what is?
The problem seems to be that they do not have enough follow-up to make decisions. And it also seems that data created in other countries do not count either. With that pace we will not have a decision in months..."
2021-09-03 17:18:03,"The experts' call to ""concentrate on vaccinating the roughly 25 percent of Americans who are eligible for shots but remain unprotected"" seems very naïve, when one considers just how anti-vaccine many of these people are.

As long as the government is donating vaccines to countries in need, arranging for booster shots to protect Americans who need and want protection should not be this hard."
2021-09-03 17:26:03,"If the whole country was 90% fully-vaccinated already, we would be getting boosters right now.   Boosters are nixed for now on the oft-chance that some unvaccinated soul will use the need for boosters as an excuse to avoid vaccination altogether.

Public Health decisions aim for the greatest good and minimization of societal harm.  My individual outcome is an entirely different calculus.  The booster will not hurt me.  It has a good chance of helping me."
2021-09-03 17:30:32,"The CDC chose to only track breakthrough infections that led to hospitalization and death. They have very little idea about how common breakthrough infection is. Of course it's great that vaccines are mostly preventing hospitalization and death. But until we have good data showing that vaccines prevent long COVID when breakthrough infections occur, we don't know if people with a breakthrough infection are risking a long-term disability. That's terrifying. Long COVID is terrifying. Not to mention the ""mild"" cases that leave people bedridden for weeks. The idea that we all have the finances, support, and medical care to go through long COVID and only be inconvenienced is insane. 

I want to do anything I can to prevent any type of infection. If there's not a significant risk with a booster shot, I want a booster shot (unless I am taking one that could go to someone desperate and unvaccinated abroad.) I don't trust the CDC nearly as much as I used to. There's been a lack of transparency and some bad decision-making. I'm sure I can trace a lot of it back to our disastrous last president, but that doesn't change it."
2021-09-03 17:36:36,"I'm all for following the science.  At the same time, it's getting a bit confusing, even for someone who understands science fairly well.  But I'm glad that the Biden administration lets the scientists lead on Covid issues instead of suggesting bleach and other nonsense."

2021-09-03 17:38:57,"Americans are incredibly myopic when it comes to world crises. As long as the rest of the world isn't vaccinated, it doesn't matter how many boosters we get; the virus will never be controlled in the US or anywhere else."

2021-09-03 17:41:21,"Israel found that protection from the Pfizer vaccine waned considerably after 5-6 months, particularly in people over 60. So US scientists  think Israel is making this up? Are we going to do with boosters like we did with the Delta variant - even  though we saw how Delta spread like wildfire and breakthrough infections grew in the UK and Israel, we didn’t prepare and then acted all surprised when Delta took over in the US? Are we going to wait until a lot of fully vaccinated people die from Covid to then get the show on the road with boosters? Why are we always behind the curve instead of ahead of this virus?"
2021-09-03 17:55:12,"There are always two critical evaluations in the approval of any therapy: Is it safe, and does it work?  In the case of booster shots, the safety should not be an issue; there's enough data on people who have gotten two shots (which can be seen as a single shot and a booster) and enough data on boosters.  So, for elderly people like me, there's no question as to the value, and I worry about how much more serious illness the review process, involving many people with different schedules, will take."
2021-09-03 17:56:11,I will get a booster when it is available ; being surrounded by the many that are not vaccinated will keep the virus circulating within the population . I know someone that was vaccinated in the beginning and he got covid as soon as the span of six months was up . The CDC should weigh not only the data but also the fact that we are not at herd immunity and probably will not be as long as those  in the population refuse to get the vaccine .
2021-09-03 18:18:26,"So when we see breakthroughs greatly sickening and killing people, we’ll be “ready” with booster? For those “proving” the need, the barn door will close after the deadly horse is out."
2021-09-03 18:20:17,"So I have to wait for the militant unvaccinated to change their mind in order to get a booster shot???

""They have been arguing strenuously that the administration lacks the data to justify a broad rollout of extra shots and should instead concentrate on vaccinating the roughly 25 percent of Americans who are eligible for shots but remain unprotected."""
2021-09-03 18:28:51,"When I becomes available, I’m taking it."
2021-09-03 17:45:56,"Why would Israel deliver it's raw data to the F.D.A., which having failed to do its  own research, wants to see Israel's underlying data, to make sure the F.D.A. backs up summaries that the Israeli government has provided ?

That's a real slap in the face to Israel.  It's akin to a  C- student who has failed to do the work  asking the valedictorian for her paper, following which the C- student questions the valedictorians' conclusions,  & requests the valedictorian's underlying data, so the C- student can review the valedictorian's conclusions.

This is yet another blunder on the part of the F.D.A.

How many Americans  who would have been protected by a booster shot will be infected with Covid , &  require hospitalization,  end up with Post Covid syndrome, &/or die while the F.D.A. drags it's feet , unwilling to depend on the conclusions of the world leader in vaccinations ?

How many of the America's children under 12, who are not eligible for vaccination, will contract the virus  from the parents & other adults  who haven't had boosters ?

The virus is not going to wait for F.D.A. approval. By the time the F.D.A. approves booster shots, and vaccine for children under 12, the virus will  likely  mutate  into something more virulent, against which the current vaccines may not be effective.

I'm not waiting for the F.D.A.   I have way more faith in Israel than I do in the F.D.A.

I'm going to C.V.S. to have a booster shot as soon as I recover from a cold."
2021-09-03 18:03:42,I don't see the risk of booster shots and want one for myself.
2021-09-03 18:13:43,Well since there seem to be plenty of people who don't want their first or second shot I will gladly one of theirs for my booster.
2021-09-03 18:16:14,"It’s not right that the Israeli government compel its citizens to get the booster on penalties of loosing their green passport  on October 1- if they do not 
I’m immunity compromised and will not have the permission to take the third shot. Should I be punished because of the decision of others to not vaccinate at all ( say those who refuse anyway )?"
2021-09-03 18:17:05,"I intend to get a third shot by six months regardless of government policy. The data out of Israel is compelling. Immunity and protection both fade over time.  The Mayo Clinic also published their study showing the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine dropped to 42 percent at six months. 

I'm also greatly disturbed that people continue to soft pedal illness that doesn't require hospitalization. Long Covid affects 20%-30% of infected individuals. There have been studies that show even mildly and asymptomatic cases result in a decrease of grey matter in the brain and diminished cognitive ability. Others that show swollen and misshapen red blood cells. Even more that show damaged lung tissue. 

The FDA is dragging its feet on authorizing vaccines for children and it's going to do the same regarding booster. Walensky, at the CDC, should have been fired when she said masks were no longer necessary indoors for vaccinated individuals. The people are almost as incompetent as the Trump versions."
2021-09-03 18:01:14,"I think it’s time for Americans to start looking at reputable sources for vaccine and Covid data from other countries.

The FDA and CDC have made so many mistakes in talking to the public and setting guidelines that it’s just starting to feel like we can’t trust the information they’re putting out as reliable anymore.

I am not a “deep stater”, I don’t think they’re intentionally trying to hurt us, I just think they’re incredibly disorganized and unfortunately borderline inept.

Looking at Israel’s data these days feels far more reliable than then what the CDC or FDA is recommending."
2021-09-03 18:13:05,"I got both Phizers, wear 2 masks and a face shield at all times, and will get the 3rd and 4th boosters as soon as available."
2021-09-03 18:33:31,This White House is hacking up the booster shot messaging on nearly a daily basis. Not good when the most important issue we face today is in the balance. I'm losing confidence in the Biden administration. A lot is going on and they come across as totally overwhelmed. I thought this is the behavior we rejected in the last election but feels like a more civilized version of teh same confusion.
2021-09-03 18:11:38,"I am a Pfizer recipient. I have no clue whether a booster is necessary for me, because I have neither the expertise nor information to make such a determination.
But I am getting to the point where I simply am skeptical about the many confusing pronouncements that just continuously flow from the White House, the CDC, now the FDA, and a myriad of self or media appointed experts.
And my impression is that many people simply follow whatever advice comes from a source that they agree with. 
I will no longer rely on advice that comes from a politically based source, most notably the White House. (  felt the same way with Trump.) I can never tell whether the advice is motivated, at least in part by a political agenda.
For most of my life, I held the CDC in the highest regard.
Now, I think that many of the CDC's announcements are very poorly thought out,  poorly expressed and to many appear confusing and contradictory.
 They could have used the now famous Provincetown situation to promote the efficacy of vaccines. Of the hundreds infected only a few were hospitalized, and no one died ! What a positive message! But instead, they diluted this message by first focusing on masking, causing many to doubt the efficacy of the vaccine. Dr. Wolensky is a highly skilled professional, but a very communicator.
Regardless of whether her advice was  correct, she caused a controversy and confused people.
Our officials are doing a terrible job of messaging, and doing al of us a disservice."
2021-09-03 17:58:24,"Our government in NZ is using the Pfizer vaccine only. I had my first vaccine on 31st August and my body did not like this vaccine. I had all the horrible reactions to this vaccine that was expected and awful fatigue for three days after the day I had the vaccine. Apparently the second vaccine is worse.
It's a war and in years to come people will be talking about this pandemic like they have about past pandemics in the world. People didn't like going to war but it was the right thing to do to defend your nation; same with getting the vaccine.
USA will not run out of the vaccine as you produce the vaccine and own the patent on the vaccines. If people don't turn up for their vaccine appointments or won't get vaccinated that is not the governments fault; it is the publics fault. There is an old saying, you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink.
These vaccines are still better than no vaccinations and will mean the difference between being alive and dying. Dead is dead and you can't come back from the dead.
They're still doing scientific research around the world to upgrade vaccine to cover all types of viruses. So something better will come along in the future, in the meantime you take the vaccine that has been approved by your government for this virus.
I see your govt has approved 2.7 Billion dollars for scientific research to improve on the vaccines that are available at the moment. There is hope."
2021-09-03 18:19:07,"If you don't think that the interpretation of data is being driven by profit you are not paying attention. I am vaccinated. I received my doses as soon as I was eligible. If it is mandated I will most likely take a booster shot as the price of being a responsible citizen. The data coming out of Israel is not beyond reproach. The focus deserves to be holdouts(which are not a homogenous group but many, some with understandable barriers to vaccination)as well as countries outside the first world. I also find the refusal of consideration for molecules outside of patent to given due consideration disturbing."
2021-09-03 18:31:12,"An overabundance of citizen ""scientists"" here who really want booster shots when ironically this article is about how there is not sufficient scientific data to justify potential advantages and/or disadvantages of such boosters."
2021-09-03 17:57:11,"I am glad the FDA and CDC are acting with caution.  If you are fully vaccinated, you are still very unlikely to die or be hospitalized from COVID-19.  Though the vaccines are very safe, there is always some risk.  Carefully weighing the risks and benefits of a third dose is very important particularly for groups that are at relatively low risk for severe disease from COVID itself.  

Scientific agencies like the CDC and FDA need to operate independently from political pressure.  Remember when the Trump administration scrubbed away much of the information about climate change from the EPA’s website?  Let the scientists do their jobs and stop panicking.  Of course, if they do OK the booster, I will trip you to get my dose faster."
2021-09-03 18:06:08,"I had my antibodies tested seven months after my second Pfizer shot. My antibody count was low, perhaps  due to my age, or that I was on a  brief but relatively high dose of prednisone at the time of my second shot, I would be more than willing to get a third shot now.  I realize the immune system is about more than antibodies but I am willing to accept what the Israelis and others have been doing."
2021-09-03 18:08:43,"Bottom line, how many COVID related hospitalizations and deaths of fully vaccinated people need to occur before federal regulators have enough data to recommend boosters for recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines?  With the Delta  variant in the air and the waning potency of the vaccines, the situation is urgent."
2021-09-03 18:31:33,"Hmmmm... That new ""Mu"" (or ""My"") variant wouldn't have something to do with it? All of Columbia is now infected with it, and it is rumored to be at least partially resistant to vaccines.

So, instead of giving a ""Delta"" booster now it might make sense to wait for BioNTech/Pfizer to come up with a fine-tuned vaccine that will quash the Mu/My variant too.

People certainly wouldn't understand having to get a booster after just having gotten a booster, you know. And from the point of organization and distribution infrastructure it also makes a lot of sense."
2021-09-03 18:07:08,"It seems that the Sept. 20 date is fairly arbitrary. I know many older people in our area went through agonizing weeks just trying to get their first shots, arriving at huge drive-in events before dawn only to be turned away and so forth. I think they should be heading on out to the pharmacies now for a third shot before the crowds start again.

At this point, pharmacies are giving shots to customers who are immunocompromised. Apparently, the pharmacy could get into ""trouble"" if they give the third shot to someone who doesn't qualify so they encourage the customer to check the ""immunocompromised box"" if they haven't already. It also ensures that the pharmacy will get reimbursed by the feds for that dose. 

I'll be getting a third dose of something after my 2 Pfizers (Comirnaty) but have heard that Moderna (Spikevax) offers better protection against Delta. My physician says get either one as a booster, but I wonder whether only one dose of Spikevax will offer the improved protection seen by full Moderna vaccination. I know there is a clinical trial in progress to clarify this but I would really love to know the answer now! I'll worry about Mu after that."
2021-09-03 17:50:34,"The risks from imminization must be balanced against the risks of serious disease from the virus in immune competent vaccinated individuals
That data has not yet been published in a peer reviewed scintific journal.
I will wait until that data is available to decide if I need a booster shot.
I might be a cynic but I trust the FDA and CDC more than Pfizer."
2021-09-03 18:02:26,"The article characterizes this as a choice between booster shots and first-dose shots for those not yet vaccinated at all. I maintain that this is a false choice. We have enough of the vaccine to  dispense both boosters and first doses if it comes to that, but it won’t. Those who haven’t been vaccinated yet are not going to be unless they are somehow forced, and I don’t think it’s fair to the rest of us to be deprived of a booster on their account. If this really is the rationale for the health advisors in question, then they’re clearly wrong and should be ignored—or at least overruled."
2021-09-03 17:57:37,"Honestly, Is there one body or entity of the federal government that is working properly to protect American citizens and our economy - with respect to COVID or otherwise?

What has happened to us over the last twenty years or even twenty months?"
2021-09-03 17:55:15,I think that we might be confusing to some extent ‘science’ for ‘bureaucracy’...
2021-09-03 18:07:50,"This article show the faulty leadership of the two agencies and the weakness of the White House team in handling the Delta-variant and flare up in COVID-19 transmission by the previously vaccinated. 
The research supporting the present FDA and CDC position is a self-interested short study by officials from the NY Department of Public health. The departure of two vaccine experts from the FDA, certainly lowers confidence in the advice about this topic.
Any sensible person who has had the Pfizer shot would be foolish not to get a booster as soon as they can. Also, the CDC & FDA guidance that the booster should be of the same kind as the original is suspect. Certainly in the UK it has been recognized that the Moderna vaccine provide a superior booster."
2021-09-03 18:05:50,"The CDC needs new leadership who understand the power of marketing. The current team misses the forest for the trees as it swings wildly from “you don’t need masks” messages to “we don’t have enough data, so we’ll undermine the President’s leadership”. To be sure, the CDC needs a leadership approach which is driven by science, facts, and data, but one which also respects the need for a consistent and compelling narrative. The current team would market sushi as cold, dead fish."
2021-09-03 18:23:38,"A few days ago, an article here quoted an immunologist as saying that we are still in “the cave ages” in terms of understanding how viruses originate, propagate, and mutate. A huge risk right now is assuming that we know more about them and their effects on people than we actually do. I’m fully vaccinated, I trust the science, and I’m ready to take the booster when the science says it’s advisable — but not a moment before. Calls to fast-track the availability of boosters are irresponsible, IMO. Always beware the known unknowns."
2021-09-03 18:09:09,Sometimes it is said that the purpose of vaccines is to reduce hospitalizations and death and not mild cases. This point of view fails to mention long covid - cases that do not put people in the hospital but which control their lives for a long period of time and may cause permanent harm. I intend to get a booster. I don't trust people who only look at hospitalizations.
2021-09-03 17:40:39,"For people in the s science and policy world this back and forth is normal.  It is the way it works and works well.  However, for the general public this must look like a circus.  In matters of policy and science, the policy makers need to speak with one voice and always have a clear message.  Remember that science literacy is minimal and the Facebook researchers are sucking reason out of the debate.  In this case, if the FDA is still looking into booster shots, just say so. Keep it simple.  Do not create arbitrary deadlines and confusion."
2021-09-03 18:10:07,"Dear President Biden, Dear CDC, Dear NIH, 
Can you screw things up any more than you have already? Unless you have evidence that the booster shot has the potential to cause harm, you should stick with the announced plan.  You just give ammunition fo the anti-vaxers with this kind of waffling. More than a million doses have been tossed out - mostly in red states - because people refused to get a first shot. You can offer a free color TV and you still won't convince them. Give boosters to people who need and want them."
2021-09-03 18:23:02,"So, old Joe says trust the science except when it is in opposition to what he wants to do.  Trump was like that and caught hell for it.  Biden gets a pass.  Why?"
2021-09-03 18:37:01,"I am tired of not being able to understand what the CDC is telling us.

As a healthcare worker, I was vaccinated in by Groundhog's Day, and I am coming up on my 8 month anniversary. By the CDC's reckoning, the way to know if we need a booster is to see the number of people vaccinated early end up hospitalized because of waning efficacy - while we wait to study the data that Israel used to advocate boosters.

Folks, I have no desire to continue to see patients while hoping that I am not in effect a canary in a coal mine, dying to prove to others that the environment is unsafe. 

If we can demonstrate that a booster is **no more unsafe** than no booster, then for heaven's sake, offer it to people at most risk of waning efficacy while perusing the data looking for the golden nugget of perfect information that will tell us precisely what to do."
2021-09-03 18:46:43,"This Gentile says, ""When in doubt, trust ISRAEL!"""
2021-09-03 18:10:18,"We need to be specific as to which vaccine is driving this - otherwise you taint all vaccines.  

There are multiple studies that show Pfizer not being as effective as Moderna.    It wanes much faster and is less effective (1/2). Links below.     Based on this data - I went with Moderna.   How do you spend more time buying a dishwasher than taking a mRNA vaccine?

Just look at the Israel (100% Pfizer) vs UK (mix).   Both have large spikes in cases, but only Israel has the corresponding spike in deaths, UK has a small bump.   
We need to start vaccinating the elderly and at risk with Moderna, and stop protecting Pfizer.

2021-09-03 18:29:15,"Increased infections in vaccinated people may be because we need a different formulation of covid shots rather than a booster of the same thing. Israel says boosters increase protection, but for how long? We need data on break through infections for all 3 vaccines, including how long ago last shot was received, any underlying conditions or medications, age, etc. In the meantime, wear a mask inside and in crowds and physically distance yourself to decrease your viral load should you come in contact with an infected person.

2021-09-03 19:15:34,"Oh wow, people will be even more confused and the Republicans will use this to their advantage.  I wish Dr. Fauci would just be  honest with us and stop walking on eggs.  If he disagrees with CDC and FDA and has data to back up the disagreement, then tell us. If he doesn't know, then tell us.  President Biden needs to keep quiet. We need an strong, take charge, honest, non-sexual predator type with a clean past but with the communication skills of a Governor Cuomo, Angela Merkel, Golda Meir(?) . Government is way too large and cumbersome for it to work now.  We need to find a new model. Until then neighbor help neighbor and find trust in something or someone.  Good luck."
2021-09-03 18:40:08,"I can't help but think that the WHO's argument that we should not get a booster shot until the rest of the world gets theirs, is muddying the thinking of the Administration.  In other words, political considerations are interfering with full protection for the USA.  I find the excessive time taken by the FDA and CDC only gives fuel to the fire of those who complain about bureaucratic inertia.  I suggest that all of us who have gotten both Pfizer shots should get the third shot after the five month period that Israel has used.  This has controlled the surge in Israel and would help control the surge in the USA."

You can’t just trust the science and the scientific process when it aligns with your own fears. There’s no reason to believe that a booster shot won’t cause harm. The safety trials conducted by manufacturers tested a 2 shot regiment. What if the booster is actually dangerous? We don’t know. We also do not know if it’s effective and for how long. What if it only “boosts” for 1 month? Then what? welcome to your monthly (soon weekly, daily… ) booster for the rest of your life? The burden of proof here should be especially high considering growing “mandates”. They better not mandate a booster shot with no data on safety or efficacy. Let the science do it’s thing. We need more data."

Remember the ridiculous ""no mask"" recommendations and the reluctance to impose social distancing and closure rules? How about the ""controversary"" about whether the virus is airborne, which still remains in some quarters in one respect or another?

I, for one, intend to get that third booster and not from Moderna but from Pfizer because Moderna's vaccine caused considerable hair loss, which is a reaction I had in the past to two shots of the combined hep A and B vaccine. I will lie or beg, steal or borrow to get that booster because when it comes to Delta and my life I have very little faith in the sluggish leadership of the scientists in this country."
2021-09-03 19:20:05,"At the advice of my internist, I got a booster early this week.  Sad to say, I trust Israel’s experts much more than the experts in the US.  I have watched as two fully-vaccinated husbands of two friends end up in the hospital with breakthrough cases.  Both are home now, but require a great deal of caretaking.  They were both extremely ill.

We have been on our own at various stages during the pandemic.  Masks, no masks, safe to be with vaccinated friends and family - oh, wait - now there’s Delta - get a booster, uh, well, maybe get a Pfizer booster.  We all have to make decisions that feel right to us.  And I’m certainly not talking to anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers.  They’re a part of the reason the pandemic keeps going.

Be prudent, study reliable sources, consult your physician.  Be safe.  This is NOT going away anytime soon."
2021-09-03 19:00:12,"No, please do not scale back the booster programs. If anything, accelerate. I received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on March 7. . I had started to resume some normal activities like shopping, dining out, doctor appointments, and seeing family in May. With delta, I have retreated once again to staying home and masking when I do go out. The information available on my protection from this vaccine and a booster for it is frustrating and confusing. 

I learned what worked and what didn’t during the previous shelter in place (I will avoid soggy take-out this time) so I will hunker down until a booster is available or my fellow citizens become more accepting of vaccinations and masks. If they choose, they could speed along the end of this crisis. I don’t have to worry about work, and my income is stable. I am angry, though, that I missed a window of opportunity to visit my daughter and toddler grandson earlier, before delta took off, because airline travel to the other coast was too chaotic. If people want the economy to fully recover and business and recreational activities to return to normal, the only way to speed that up is to get themselves and their family members vaccinated and wear masks— and cut out the selfish obstreperous behavior. Otherwise I’m not sure when we can expect to see COVID and its variants fade away. Even if we avoid illness, none of us will get these months back, and many of us have a dwindling number left."
2021-09-03 18:35:20,Sounds like our leaders and CDC and FDA are in disarray.  It would be nice if they’d get their act together before announcements on safety decisions.  Unfortunately we have a huge segment of society that hangs on every word.
2021-09-03 19:01:41,"It is very strange to see how much worse we are this Labor Day Weekend than last ... and yet it appears that much of the country wants to pretend that the pandemic is over.

Almost 3,000 Americans died yesterday, a number we haven't seen since February.   Our daily average deaths for the past week are at 200,000.  Last Labor Day we were at about 40,000.   The week ending tomorrow will have us at over 1600 deaths per day.  Last Labor Day we were under 1,000.

Why is this country pretending that the era of social distancing and masking is over?"
2021-09-03 18:53:58,"The CDC and FDA are flat out unreliable.  The FDA just approved an Alzheimers drug (Adulhelm) is ineffective and can cause serious side effects from brain swelling.  Two members of the review committee for the medication resigned in protest because there was not enough evidence to support its safety and efficacy.  In addition, the FDA could not it get its act together 1.5 years into the pandemic to  approve the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines until LAST MONTH month despite the fact 165 million were already safely vaccinated.  This costly delay in approval gave vaccine deniers more fuel to support their inane theories and keep them from vaccination.  So COVID kept spreading.   Now this, despite the fact there is more than enough data to show immunity wanes around 6 months.  Protection against severe disease will also wane over time.  I firmly believe in science, but the haphazard way these  agencies conduct business has shaken my faith."

Meanwhile, a new study is out, reported by this paper, that even mild cases of covid can result in chronic kidney disease. Add to that: here comes the MU variant, which doctors have said is not now threatening the US but also that it may have immunity dodging properties. Note that none of the vaccine developers have announced and delta-speicific boosters. We are falling behind here.

It's time to hunker down and apply everything we learned during previous surges. Mask, distance avoid crowds of humans, get vaccinated. Be patient. I'll get my booster when they green light it. I have plenty of project around d here to keep me busy.

2021-09-03 20:11:10,Since this Pandemic is the first one since 1918 and everyone is new to this one that we are experiencing it seems at times that the powers that be are grasping at straws and can be very confusing to people.  I find the best person who should advise people are their own Physicians and I am sticking to that script and taking the Booster Pfizer shot on his recommendation.
2021-09-03 20:27:27,"I received a Moderna booster last week --am in my late 70s, with other risk factors. I had mild symptoms after. I will be traveling next week, and feel relieved that my dr suggested it. He erred on the side of caution. I am very lucky and grateful. 

Oh, and I survived a tough case of Covid in March, 2020, and long covid for months after. Enough for me. I will do whatever to protect from this terrible virus."
2021-09-03 20:38:54,"As a parent, I feel unbelievably dispirited reading this. I'm a  healthy person in my 30s, so if I got a breakthrough infection, it would probably be mild. However, I'm not the only person I have to think about. I have a 4 year old daughter and a 4 month old son who spent the first month of his life on supplemental oxygen. If I or my husband got a breakthrough infection, we would almost certainly pass it to our unvaccinated children, and who knows how they would fare at a time when children's hospitals are reaching capacity all over the country? Moreover, we could cause an outbreak at the university where we teach, or at our daughter's preschool. Since the pandemic started, we've been asked to make numerous sacrifices to protect others as well as ourselves, and we've generally done so without complaint. However, it is bizarre and upsetting to see the same public health officials who told us we needed to mask up, social distance, and skip holidays with family to protect our communities, now say that boosters are unnecessary because most individuals with breakthrough infections don't end up in the hospital--as if individual health no longer affects the broader community. It ignores the reality of our lives--the fact that Americans have children who can't be vaccinated, work in high risk public settings, have loved ones who are immunocompromised, etc. Hospitals are at capacity everywhere, so why isn't reducing strain on the healthcare system justification enough for boosters?"
2021-09-03 20:51:54,"What might be lost in this debate is the fact that we also need as much protection as possible from the vaccines against infections of any kind, in addition to hospitalizations and deaths. If the vaccines show waning protection against infections, even if most of these breakthrough infections are asymptomatic or mild, these infections will eventually lead to more infections, in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and some of those later infections WILL result in hospitalizations and deaths! As long as the booster shots are not clearly harmful and the risks are minimal, the FDA and CDC should approve them quickly."

Vaccines are safe and effective. I fully trust Israeli researchers and their findings. I also understand how vaccines work and their minimal severe side effect profile which wanes in comparison to the magnitude of protection they offer. I’m not waiting to see if third boosters are safe or not for healthy ppl like myself because they almost certainly are safe. And as this article points out, Israel (a country that has responded to this pandemic much more effectively than the U.S.) is already providing boosters. Irresponsible, nonsensical, politically motivated, and/or selfish people who chose to not get vaccinated will not place my life and well being at risk."

Now we all mask again because non-vaccinated people are filling up the hospitals. 
So we delay boosters for Pfizer recipients because we don't quite know what to do about Moderna and J&J recipients? Meanwhile the Israeli data is compelling that 12 days of vaccination reduced serious cases 10 fold. 
Skilled nursing facilities, health care workers, and the elderly (who all got Pfizer) cannot go through the fall and winter ""waiting to see"" what can happen.  We know what will happen.

2021-09-03 19:40:25,"I was in the stage 3 Moderna clinical trials and received my first vaccinations in August/September of 2020.    In July of this year I was invited by my trial center to convert to a booster trial.  I was randomly assigned to receive 100mcg of a beta variant tailored booster.   There were several other study arms listed in the new protocol including original alpha and a delta tailored vaccine, as well as both 50 and 100 mcg doses administered.

To my knowledge I am still in this study and report every week, thus I was shocked when Biden said that boosters would be offered the week of September 20.   I spent 9 years at the CDC and this is not how this works.  Maybe under the previous administration.    Glad I'm retired from the Federal Government and I would do exactly what the two FDA vaccine officials did in their position."
2021-09-03 20:03:29,"Enough already.  The FDA and CDC are broken.  I have nothing but respect for scientists and the need to break from the prior admin's bad policies, but we are in a pandemic and the CDC and FDA do not seem to understand the urgency.   They just don't get it.  Every day of delay means needless disease to real humans.  We already see their lack of urgency on getting vaccines to kids.  We already see other nations ACTING to protect their citizens.  If the FDA and CDC still lack data at this late hour, that is on them.  It is not an excuse for delay.  There is no excuse that the work was not done before the start of school to get a vaccine for kids - they dallied, putting our children at needless risk.  Each sick child, each kid in a hospital is now on them.  The same is true of boosters.  It is time for Biden to lead, clean out the leadership of both the FDA and CDC and replace them with people who understand how to think proactively, work in parallel and get ahead of variants and these issues, rather than being reactive - and tragically slow to react at that.  Good since does not require this level of inexcusable delay. Oh yes, and it was the CDC that decided to stop collecting data on breakthrough cases, so forgive me if now I'm not impressed with they complain they lack data.  We need forward thinking, proactive leadership.  Biden was right to push them.  And his response should be brutal, fire both Woodcock and Walensky making clear we expect action."

But there's no policy for what happens if I bring asymptomatic covid back to my clinically  immunosuppressed wife. And the antibody tests that can sort out antibody levels from vaccine and from covid direct exposure are hard to obtain. CDC issued a defensible guideline that my state turned into an inflexible regulation, without improving a good but patchwork testing system that has atrophied since early summer. But I could simply go to CVS or Walgreens and sign an affidavit saying I'm the immunosuppressed one!"
2021-09-03 20:10:28,"Having recently recovered from a breakthrough case of Covid that I contracted from a fully vaccinated friend (I got the J&J shot in March, my friend was vaccinated with Pfizer this summer) I am totally disgusted by our public health officials. Maybe Anthony Fauci thinks that being completely bedridden for 10 days and totally losing my sense of taste and smell represent a mild and acceptable case of illness, but I am devastated. Since I don't have a BMI of 40+ and am not diabetic or a senior citizen I was not eligible for monoclonal antibodies or literally anything.  I've lost all trust in these recommendations and am kicking myself for not having sought out a booster dose out of state."
2021-09-03 20:11:06,"We know the booster is effective.
We know the effectiveness of the original vaccine is fading fast.

Why can't I sign a waiver and get the booster ?

Why do other people who do not have a low oxygen rate like I do, previous heart attacks, have any say if I can receive a shot that will help prevent my and others dying by suffocation, placed in a coma where we cannot even say goodbye to our loved ones ?

Please make the booster available now."
2021-09-03 20:32:51,"I think that this debate about booster shots misses the forest for the trees.

The problem is that at the end of April Biden and his officials told fully vaccinated people to stop worrying about masks, and they continued giving this advice up to and including the July 4th Long Weekend. That was when Biden, despite the fact that the threat from Covid Delta was already clear, gave a speech celebrating ""independence"" from coronavirus.

Other countries took a more cautious approach and continued with protective measures. For example, Canada's July 1st national holiday was not celebrated.

Despite the horse having left the barn here, we should be focused on getting vaccination back on track and requiring protective measures. Canada is 15% ahead on full vaccination, and the most populous Canadian provinces are implementing rigorous vaccination passes this month, Quebec having already done so on September 1st.

The result of Canada's more proactive approach is that it has far fewer new cases, hospitalizations and deaths per 100,000 people. This is also true in big cities like Toronto and Montreal.

The solution is staring us in the face."

Why, instead of boosters, aren't we getting a new vaccine? Perhaps a polivalent vaccine similar to the flu vaccines, which would cover the most recent, most dangerous mutations? I don't really know, but I suspect that we are still underestimating the potential harm that the coronavirus can inflict on humanity."

I suspect the former."
2021-09-03 21:41:49,"Boosters are inevitable.  Delay for process now that efficacy and safety are clear puts the vulnerable in unnecessary risk.  

Continue with the process but approve for those who decide the bigger risk is what they brush off as  “you won’t die and that was the intention”.   By the CDC’s own admission protection against moderate disease is waning.  Long haul is also a risk.  So not dying is great but hardly good enough.  

My second Moderna was in February.  Moderna says six months not eight.  I’m due now.   And here in mask-defiant Trumplandia, the risks are great.  

Let us decide based on our individual circumstances."

I do not think these vaccines are a finite-resource; they are continually being produced in factories. Therefore with time, there is plenty for everyone who wants one including boosters. Additionally, even if my original two doses protects against death and severe illness, why not have more robust protection against illness ? If vaccinated people are still getting sick, what will be the economic impact to lost productivity? There are other vaccines, such as chickenpox or shingles, that protect against illness (which is usually not severe or life-threatening), but that doesn't mean the vaccine is not worth getting."

People, that's not how vaccines work.  And figuring out the right policy is HARD.   Have Americans just become so spoiled that they expect perfect protection from everything?"
2021-09-03 22:18:34,"I'm going to my immunologist to get tested for antibodies (again, I was negative more than two months after my COVID-19 diagnosis).

If I have antibodies, I won't get a booster.

But if I don't, I'll have to think about it.  I got a lot of lymph node swelling from my second COVID-19 vaccine shot, and felt unwell for over a week.  If that's not enough to get antibodies that last 5 months, I don't know what would be.

What is the chance of being logical about this and testing for antibodies then deciding on a booster or not based on the results?"
2021-09-03 22:18:46,"While we know that a booster increases the amount of antibodies in a person's system, what we don't know is whether the increased amount of antibodies leads to a lower rate of death, hospitalization, serious illness, long Covid, etc.  So it is not correct to say that a booster will necessarily yield higher immunity to Covid.

The FDA must now determine, based on a thorough review of appropriately broad and reliable data, whether boosting a person's antibodies is safe and does, in fact, lower their chances of a bad Covid outcome.  Unfortunately, the FDA is a bureaucracy, with a blizzard of regulations it must follow in reaching its decisions in order to ""do no harm"".  Inherently, the FDA is not ""nimble,"" and hence cannot reach decisions as quickly as we would like.  

In any case, I would note that under our current patchwork/ad hoc system of administering vaccines, anyone who wants to get an extra shot can get one right now.  There is no central database showing who got what shot and where.  You don't need a prescription from a doctor.  There's no law saying you can't get another shot.  The vaccine supply far exceeds demand.  There's no evidence that getting an extra shot is dangerous in any way.  And if you go to a different provider than the one you originally used, you won't be asked any questions about your vaccine history except whether you've had allergies to prior vaccines and/or whether you've had flu shot (or other vaccine) within the last 14 days.  That's reality."
2021-09-03 22:16:23,"We need our officials to remain clam, keep the information flowing, and the knee-jerk advice out of the picture.

Personally, I want the Admin to put a muzzle on the CDC. Remove their ""public voice"" from speaking, until - its vetted as to its usefulness, and in this case validity. The CDC director should not be on TV so much, and neither she or the agency should be trying to issue policy. I think they've proved their weakness at that role. 

I would rather there be a truly non-partisan, non-appointed, expert council formed that is channeling the science, from all parties, who then offer public statements, and advice to local health agencies. Its all getting too complex for this to be the work of the CDC alone.

We need to get the politics and its inherent spin out of public health. We need science, not this who runs and captures the spotlight first stuff. 

What we need is some sort of truth in public health commission, agency. Some entity with legitimacy and expertise (despite it being out of vogue with many at this strange moment) that isn't political, isn't full of appointed hacks. Not sure how that could be done these days...but if there was ever a time for cold hard facts...its now.

They have no business telling us we should be content with staying out of the hospital."

2021-09-03 22:50:14,"As an infectious diseases physician, I applaud the FDA for not caving into the administration or the CDC and waiting for appropriate data, Pfizer and Moderna's randomized studies and Israel's raw data.  Without that data, no one should be getting a booster.  If we start cowtowing to fear and headlines from politicians and pundits, we are just as guilty of being anti-science as the anti-vaxxers.  The FDA knows how to evaluate vaccine safety.  The White House and Vivek Murthy should not be scaring people into thinking otherwise.  Let people who know how to do their jobs do their jobs.  If the FDA is not moving at the pace you want them to, it's not because they don't see the urgency of the pandemic. It's because the data does not support the action.  There are downsides to being wrong about this, which includes patient safety and the future of our health regulatory agencies (which are phenomenal).  Please let science and not fear guide our actions."

Two weeks ago I crossed state lines to a state running a popup clinic in an elementary school.  I got a 3rd Pfizer shot with no trouble.  I had to give them an I.D. but there were no other questions.

Going to a different state that doesn't have your vaccine records on file is key to getting a booster shot.

I decided to do this after following the reports on vaccine data in The Jerusalem Post.  The Israelis have done a great job of collecting and analyzing vaccine data.

I was accompanied to the school for my booster shot by a fully vaccinated 69 yr old friend.  He decided he would wait until his ""official"" booster 2 months from now.  In the meantime, he has an emergency.  He has to fly cross-country to see his 99 yr old mother who is suddenly bedridden and not eating.

He regrets not getting the ""unauthorized"" booster with me and Is now planning to find a 3rd shot as soon as he touches down in California.

The CDC has been going back and forth about boosters.  Remember that if you're like my friend and hold off on the booster, events may intervene such that you'll be sorry you put it off.

BTW.  I have allergies to numerous medications and have had anaphylactic shock after exposure to certain chemicals.

The PREP Act provides immunity from lawsuits for people who administer COVID-19 vaccines and compensates patients in the event of injury. Patients who get a vaccine and suffer a rare but serious side effect may lose the ability to claim compensation offered by the act.""

2021-09-03 23:22:56,"Earlier today, Canada's chief health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, held a briefing in which she took stock of the current situation and provided advice for the coming weeks.

I believe that Tam's briefing is applicable here, except with more force due to Canada's higher vaccination rate and lower case rate.

Tam says that data is showing that unvaccinated people are 12 times more likely to get coronavirus than those who are fully vaccinated, and 36 times more likely to require hospitalization.

She says that Canada is in for a major increase in cases this fall unless full vaccination of those age 12 and up gets to about 85%.

Age groups 40 and above are already there or close to it. The 12-17 group is at 67%, but increasing rapidly. Tam's concern is with those age 18-39, who are highly mobile and account for most current cases. She says that there is an urgent need to get full vaccination of this group, currently about 66%, higher.

Tam also stressed the continuing importance of masks and social distancing. This will be helped by the rigorous vaccination passes that Quebec implemented on September 1, and that British Columbia and Ontario are implementing in the next couple of weeks.

Canada has not made a decision on booster shots. In response to a reporter's question, Tam distinguished between people who are immunosuppressed and those who aren't."

2021-09-03 23:37:36,"Fear seems to still be what dictates popular opinion, and in turn, policy re vaccines. There were clinical trials done for months to determine if the vaccines were safe and effective, the results supported they were both and a slim majority of Americans have now been vaccinated. Clinical trials to support significant efficacy of a booster in any population seem to be lacking. We can assume they are safe, but will they make a significant difference in those that fail to mount a strong response to the initial vaccine s doses? Should we be putting this much attention on boosters rather than focusing on convincing more Americans to get vaccinated? Or supplying vaccines globally to areas that are lacking? It seems most commenters are thinking solely in terms of themselves, but until more of the global population is vaccinated, no amount of boosters will get this pandemic under control."
2021-09-04 00:00:23,"What I sense reading  between the lines is that the FDA plans to wait until more vaccinated Americans die from SARS-CoV2 infections.  
So my frustration is -- why is this an appropriate criteria?"
2021-09-03 23:51:24,"I want a booster but would prefer that it goes to a person who needs the first/second dose even more, e.g. a person from a country with a lower vaccination rate. We row or sink together."
2021-09-03 23:58:08,"At 73, I got Pfizer #1 in January and #2 in February. Considering my individual health issues, including cancer, and watching the approach Israel is taking, I got a third Pfizer shot at the 6 month point. While I appreciate the fact US authorities take a measured, data driven approach for an entire population, I'm responsible for my own health. I don't yield the authority to make a final decision for me to the US government, much as I genuinely respect the work they do. And I harmed no one with my decision."
2021-09-03 23:48:31,"After the FDA blocked private and university labs from filling the critical early testing gap last year that resulted from the CDC’s incompetence, I don’t care what they think."
2021-09-03 23:45:19,"This is a National Emergency.  Therefore President Biden should stop thinking about political risk and optics, and instead follow the science,  A Federal mandate of vaccinations is immediately required.  It is on the White House to make this happen."
2021-09-03 22:12:31,"Typical bureaucratic tangles and unclear thinking will simply mean when the data is ""conclusive"", that is when many, many more of us suffer break through infections, and after treating our population as a giant lab experiment, they will order the booster shot. Why not be proactive and see if those with boosters have far fewer break through infections than those without? Not everyone will get a booster; many will not. Then we can see with hindsight whether or not it was effective. This will shed much more light on booster shots pro and con. With the large numbers involved, and delta still rampant, would it not be more prudent to err on the side of actually protecting the immunized instead of constantly lavishing attention on those who were too ignorant or stupid to get immunized in the first place, making the booster shot necessary."
2021-09-03 23:00:01,They’re already doing boosters in Israel and France.  Why are they better and smarter than we are?
2021-09-04 00:49:08,"The ""potency"" of the vaccine does not wane over time. The amount of the induced antibodies wanes over time."
2021-09-04 00:11:12,"The CDC stopped tracking breakthrough infections that didn’t cause hospitalization or death after April 30, then pointed to low figures for earlier pre-Delta breakthrough cases to justify their position that these were so rare, and mild, they needn’t be tracked. They made that decision before they knew if those vaccinated could transmit the virus, suggesting this was unlikely. It wasn’t. Weeks later, they knew and announced the Delta variant was proliferating, yet did not change their guidance on breakthroughs. In July strong evidence accumulated that breakthrough cases were easily spread, found in clusters, and growing in number, as in Provincetown. Unlike the US, Israel studied waning immunity early and began widely administering 3rd doses. The CDC said there wasn’t yet evidence to support 3rd jabs (evidence they’d declined to collect), then abruptly changed guidance for the immune-compromised—before submitting the evidence they’d said they were waiting for. Meanwhile, data from states tracking breakthroughs told a different story: cases were rising, occurred in clusters, most were symptomatic, and for the most vulnerable, could require hospitalization and cause death. 

The CDC’s failure to provide timely guidance continued with its advice Sept 1--on 2 days’ notice--to avoid Labor-Day weekend travel. Concern over such disjointed, contradictory puzzling guidance has led some to obtain 3rd jabs independently. I have not, but with each CDC misstep, I wonder if we all should."
2021-09-04 00:57:20,"I'm 74, have several underlying conditions, and got my vaccines last January. I am pretty sure that getting a breakthrough infection (which seem to be fairly common),even if labeled ""mild"" would have serious long-term health consequences for me even if I didn't die immediately. I want a booster. Americans who haven't been vaccinated to date are unlikely to change their minds at this point and it makes no sense to wait on them to do before giving boosters to vulnerable people. Getting me and others in similar situations boosters would not only help us, but also help the economy, as we as a group won't be going out to restaurants or events again, or traveling, until we feel safer. That requires getting a booster shot."
2021-09-04 00:29:23,If the data is so important to this decision why did the CDC make the decision last May to not collect data on breakthrough cases unless they were hospitalized?  That data would allow us to see if efficacy of vaccinations was decreasing over time and we wouldn't need to wait on Israeli data.
2021-09-04 00:43:46,"From what I see on the CVS website,the only people eligible for a third vax are the immunocompromised.  Are most people just lying?"
2021-09-04 00:51:46,""" More than a million fully vaccinated people have received an additional dose since mid-August. The agency authorized vaccines for some people with weakened immune systems on Aug. 12; it is unknown how many of the people who have gotten extra doses are in that group.""
I may have missed the story, but is there a simple, legal, way to get a booster shot?  If a commenter knows, please enter it as a reply."
2021-09-03 23:30:21,"This article overlooks the role Pfizer has played in this booster brouhaha.  In April, Pfizer started it without coordinating with the FDA, the White House or the CDC.  Once Pfizer mentioned booster shot without consulting the FDA the booster bungling started.  It’s hard to convince the public that data is needed when the manufacturer publicly makes a claim unsupported by science (at that time).  No wonder the administration is struggling.

In April 2021 before most of us were vaccinated  “Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said people will “likely” need a booster dose of a Covid-19 vaccine within 12 months of getting fully vaccinated. His comments were made public Thursday but were taped April 1...

“A likely scenario is that there will be likely a need for a third dose, somewhere between six and 12 months and then from there, there will be an annual revaccination, but all of that needs to be confirmed. And again, the variants will play a key role,” he told CNBC’s Bertha Coombs during an event with CVS Health.””
Source:  CNBC

Did the CEO make his claim based on data or was it an educated or non-educated guess?  

How has his booster blooper impacted Pfizer’s stock price?"
2021-09-04 00:35:04,"Those of us who have been vaccinated are partaking in a huge human trial -- period. Enough with the smug rejoinder: It's science. Yes, it is, but there are unsettling and broad conflicting views related to duration of efficacy, what's next and what's really safe. No one twisted my arm to roll up my sleeve in March, but I also feel compassion to that population of vaccine resisters who are unnerved, but not selfish and arrogant. NYT readers have had a field day ridiculing all those who are hesitant but some days I question my own judgment."
2021-09-03 23:19:47,"I am utterly confused as to how non-immunocompromised people are getting boosters. When you get the shot, you generally have to present ID which can be checked against a statewide data base. I am past my 6 month mark with Moderna, and because I have a annuloplasty ring in my heart due to a faulty mitral valve, contacted my cardiologist's office to see if I could get a note for the booster. They told me my case was a ""gray area,"" and that I would need his approval for a prescription. Waiting to hear back, but again, wondering who are these people who have no problem getting a third shot. Please enlighten me."
2021-09-03 22:26:53,"Until the deliberately ignorant, uncaring or plain stupid half of the population is required to vaccinate, I want 6-month Pfizer boosters, and a reinstatement of NY’s mask mandate.

A couple of months ago, I walked across the street to introduce myself to our new neighbors. Getting relatively (12 feet) close, I called out “don’t worry, I’m fully vaxed”.

The reply: “I’m not, I respect your position”. Huh? I nearly told the young mother who never masks what I thought of her behavior.

I don’t leave the house, now that Delta’s here, I leave the house only to shop for food - and stare in disbelief at the 70 percent of patrons showing their full faces, or the Coke delivery guy who covers his mouth with a mask not his nose.

Why are these people being allowed to threaten my life? I have to agree with the ACLU, that no one has the right to risk the lives of everyone in hir vicinity. We wouldn’t have the crisis we’re in, the CDC says, if everyone were required to vax, mask when out or face the isolation I’m stuck with, due to co-morbidity and as the only person caring for my 91-year-old mother, with her own.
I have to get weaker and weaker, while my neighbors run through the street potentially spreading COVID, while they “respect” my decision to do the right, patriotic, socially responsible thing.
No shots? Lock ‘em in and put a big orange biohazard symbol on their door. “Respect my decision, what a sick, malicious attitude!"
2021-09-04 01:12:39,"I believe the booster should not be taken.  Biden doesn’t care about risks, just like he didn’t care about leaving Americans to die in Afghanistan."
2021-09-04 02:03:01,"I have a few questions...
1. I'd like to know what percentage of breakthrough infections are going into the hospital and how does that compare to infections among unvaccinated people?  Looking at the following site I calculate about 4% of breakthrough infections go into the hospital compared to 5% of unvaccinated infections...lower but not by all that much.
<a href=""https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/vaccine-status.htm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/vaccine-status.htm</a>
Why don't we have this data for other states? Going further, why do we lack so much data on breakthrough cases?
2. How do we know that the issue we are seeing with breakthrough infections is not waning immunity but the Delta variant getting by the vaccine?
3. Where is data on reinfection rates with Delta? Are those who had COVID already better protected? If breakthrough infections are milder (not convinced based on Wisconsin data), do they convey better protection than a booster?
Will I get a booster if it's offered and recommended? Sure, but at this point I'm not convinced that a booster of Moderna will help all that much..."
2021-09-04 02:00:50,No. Please. I want a booster as soon as one is made available to me.
2021-09-04 02:04:42,"I would like to suggest that people read the article that the Times just published on today's briefing by Canada's top health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam:

""Canadian Health Officials Warn of an Urgent Need to Vaccinate Young Adults""
<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/09/03/world/covid-delta-variant-vaccine/canadian-health-officials-warn-of-an-urgent-need-to-vaccinate-young-adults"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/09/03/world/covid-delta-variant-vaccine/canadian-health-officials-warn-of-an-urgent-need-to-vaccinate-young-adults</a>

I've watched the whole briefing on YouTube and I think that Tam's warning about an increase in Covid Delta cases this fall applies equally to the U.S.

Tam is calling for a fill court press top get 85% of the population 12 and older fully vaccinated. In Canada, the problem in getting there is people 18-39, who are currently at about 66%. Unvaccinated people in this age group are responsible for most of Canada's new cases.

The situation is worse here because have a much lower rate of vaccination and are making less use of protective measures like masks.

We also aren't implementing vaccination passports, as is being done in Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and Manitoba, with more provinces likely to follow. The Key to NY City Pass is much weaker than the passports being implemented in Canada."
2021-09-04 02:46:52,"I received my third Pfizer vaccination or booster shot four days ago here in France where I live as an American expatriate.

Every French resident over 65 years old is eligible for the booster!"
2021-09-04 02:29:03,"‘Fifteen cases and most are getting better.’

Wow. And millions of Americans think the guy who said that is their savior."
2021-09-04 03:34:59,"Why not make the booster dose more protective against the new variants? The vaccine is losing efficacy because the virus is changing, so the vaccine should change too just like the yearly flu shots. The manufacturers have already said they can do it."
2021-09-04 03:44:36,"Nobody of the FDA or CDC experts state what the potential negative consequences of a booster actually are or could be,  given that we had now hundred million + vaccinations without significant downside. Those are the same experts who advised early on in the pandemic  - against any simple common sense conclusions -  that masks should not be used by the general population. The  vaccine makers themselves (Pfizer and Moderna) state the necessity for a booster shot. FDA and CDC will as usual flip flop at a later time, when thousands of lives, which could have been saved with earlier action, are lost."
2021-09-04 02:49:24,"There’s one thing, sadly, that I’ve learned from this pandemic: basically, we’re on our own when it comes to figuring out the slew of information circulating, and also that my fellow citizens don’t give a rip about watching out for each other. So, I’ll take care of myself accordingly. You take care of you, I’ll take care of me. And if that means fudging to get a booster, shrug of shoulders."
2021-09-04 03:20:19,"Oh great, more confusing back and forth from the government.

Surely, this is the most unhelpful news, that the powers that be at the C.D.C., the FDA and the White house cannot get their story straight on booster shots.

If we start to see a decrease in vaccine efficacy, and they have delayed in rolling out the boosters, they will have illness and death on their hands.

Like Nero, they are fiddling while the U.S. burns.

Yet again. 

We can all recall the back and forth on whether to wear masks or not, whether the Delta was coming or not...and, on we roll."
2021-09-04 04:33:41,"I don't doubt that the data in support of near term boosters is very incomplete. But the policy questions are 1. Should we wait until the problem becomes evident in a wide segment of the population before we act on this, or would it be better to error on the side of being too soon? 2. What would be the main objection to providing boosters too soon? Is there a medical one? Or the idea that a limited supply to go to needier groups?  That the unvaccinated in the US should be vaccinated asap is a given, but the political situation makes it pretty clear that this isn't going to happen."
2021-09-04 03:25:55,"This is ridiculous.  There is an enormous body of data that Pfizer vaccine is decreasing in effectiveness against delta variant. The number of breakthrough cases is not being adequately tracked, and the data from Israel is a warning about what will happen if there is further quibbling. There is no prudent course of action that can argue against moving swiftly to provide additional protection to everyone while there is time to fight these breakthrough infections.  That does not, of course, mean that the effort to increase the percentage of all vaccinated people should diminish -- on the contrary.  But anyone more than six months out from original is basically rolling the dice at this point if they are mixing with people who are likely to be unvaccinated."
2021-09-04 04:06:07,"That the FDA will approve booster vaccinations is a foregone conclusion. The only question is how long they will dither, and how many unnecessary deaths will result, as a result of their insistence on following their ""process."" Are we truly concerned that the Israelis aren't able to discern if booster shots are safe after they have administered millions? Has any potential health concern with three shots been raised that doesn't exist with two? The only one in danger is the FDA, which risks making itself irrelevant as people pursue off-label injections."
2021-09-04 05:07:11,"It is sad, but perhaps not all that surprising that only 52% of eligible Americans are currently vaccinated.  This number may not grow that much, unfortunately.  The general public is clearly less informed and less intelligent than we'd like to believe.  After all, a recent University of Chicago study showed that at least 50% of Americans believe in one or more conspiracy theories, indicating a rampant inability to sift and discriminate between fact and fiction.  Ignorance is quite directly killing us."
2021-09-04 06:18:42,"Public health officials have more responsibility than to simply conduct and interpret an empirical scientific experiment. 

If we wait until the data conclusively proves vaccine immunity has significantly wained over time, it will be too late to supply and administer booster protection for the millions of people who need it BEFORE they become ill. 
A good scientist waits for all the evidence and submits his data and conclusions to peer review. 
A good public health official sees the coming crisis and makes the best decisions he can with the data and information available to save the public from death, debilitating illness and the accompanying chaos. 
We can not afford to wait to begin offering boosters. It will take months to administer the number required.  
The vaccine boosters will allow our public doctors to first “ do no harm.” 
 
That a quarter of our population will have to be coerced or forced to get vaccinated because of propaganda, ignorance, conspiracies, fear, superstition and sheer stupidity is something we can’t wait on. 
A certain number of Americans have declared they will meet vaccination mandates with armed resistance. 

Some people just refuse to get into a lifeboat when a ship is sinking.  I’m willing to leave some boats for them but I’m not about to stand on the deck and argue about it while others try to figure out exact how fast the stern is sinking."
2021-09-04 02:07:57,"And so the bureaucratic whirlwind threatens to swallow a second administration, proving that the issue was never competence, the issue is the administration of public health itself.￼￼"
2021-09-04 07:05:01,"Data from Israel shows quite clearly the benefits of a third Pfizer vaccine dose. Breakthrough infections and hospitalizations are becoming rarer  among the populations that received it. 

Nevertheless, Israel made a huge policy mistake that the US should not follow: it’s very easy to vaccinate (again) those willing to be vaccinated. But the pandemic is simmering due to those unvaccinated, and third and fourth and fifth vaccine doses will not help in the long term until almost everyone is vaccinated. Israel did nothing to deal with the anti vaxxers, and COVID is raging there. Keep your eyes on the ball and focus on the unvaccinated. The third dose is helpful but not nearly as important as the initial inoculation. It’s time for serious vaccine and mask mandates. Period."
2021-09-04 04:03:28,"Biden got ahead of the science on boosters in an effort to distract attention from the messy exit from Afghanistan. (Kabul fell to the Taliban on the 8/15. Biden made his booster announcement 8/18.)

If he is not going to listen to the CDC and FDA, just what ""science"" will Biden accept? The science of his political advisors? We lived through four years of that with Trump. Biden can do better.

As for those calling for boosters now based on findings in Israel, you need to read what experts are saying about possible flaws in initial interpretations of those findings and weaknesses in the study.

I'm tired of amateur ""experts"" whose knowledge is based on popular news stories and tweets. Stick with the CDC and FDA and let others go the Trump route."
2021-09-04 02:34:04,"""Among the reasons for delaying is that regulators need more time to decide the proper dosage for a possible third Moderna shot. The company’s application asking the F.D.A. to authorize a booster shot contains insufficient data, one federal official familiar with the process said. Other data expected from Johnson & Johnson has not been delivered.

Nor has the raw data that the F.D.A. has been seeking from Israel, which is already giving boosters to everyone 12 and older. Israeli officials say their data shows that the potency of Pfizer’s vaccine wanes over time against severe disease and hospitalization, but that a third shot significantly bolsters protection. The F.D.A. wants to see the underlying data, to make sure it backs up summaries that the Israeli government has provided.""

Once one get further into your article, the more one see's discrepancies as to why either Pfizer,Moderna & J&J should be given even full approval or EUA for 3rd dose for this OWS vaccination program. Also when Israel released it's finding's it was shot right down in America, and deemed not true/acceptable. Yet it is true and should be accepted that these vaccines of mRNA are only good for 6-8 months- not the efficacy rate we were told of 95% after two shots. They just didn't state for how long. Well we have learned now how long is.

You wonder why people question your decision making policies, and this is how OWS has gone since the beginning. Every day the agenda and explanations change - everyday!"
2021-09-04 03:40:11,"Some thoughts and observations-

The FDA hasn’t been functioning as one would expect for decades. They want more data? How about the known breakthrough cases and the ones that are not reported.  

The United States is waiting to analyze the booster shot information from the tiny nation of Israel.  This country should be at the forefront of this type of data collection…what gives? 

What is the FDA and CDC waiting for? Breakthrough cases that end with people in intensive care? 

My least favorite thoughts on the FDA… WAKE UP! We’re in a pandemic and stop acting like prima donna’s."
2021-09-04 05:45:33,"If they can't make a decision on booster shots, then could they  please at least do something about stopping the spread of the virus? I live in midtown Manhattan, which is FILLED with tourists from all over the US, none of whom had to show proof of vaccination before boarding a plane and none of whom was tested either before or after the flight. I am sick of this. I am sick of taking all these precautions, sick of being told I have to be patient with the ""vaccine hesitant."" They are a bunch of ignorant boobs who are ruining other people's lives while they wait for Jesus or King Voodoo or whoever to tell them it is okay to let the vaccine in the temple of their bodies. I am sick of it. It is time they should start paying for what they have done to the lives of others."
2021-09-04 03:11:02,"I got my third shot the Saturday after it was announced on that Friday because I felt there would be government second guessing and backtracking. And now, there is. 
My husband, two sisters and three friends got their third shots when I encouraged them. 
I said, get it now…later the government will cause confusion and we will be left waiting. 
This is all so idiotic. 

I went to CVS at Target who has Moderna and my husband went to Walgreens who has Pfizer. 
Go for it. Just do it. 
Barrel ahead. 
Don’t wait for permission. You don’t need it. There is no vaccine police."
2021-09-13 09:34:15,"You cannot force someone to take medicine or a vaccine that will help or protect them.

However, if they pose a danger to others, that is a different matter.

One does not have the right to potentially infect others or to potentially require them to be in quarantine. 

If one does not want to vaccinate, then they should required to test negative every 3 days for Covid in order to enter any indoor public venue and be required to show proof of that. 

If Mr. Biden can help in that direction more power to him."
2021-09-13 10:14:34,"Even if ""the surgeries that are being put off are mainly elective,"" as an advanced country, we should have enough hospital beds for a pandemic we CAN control and elective surgeries. Yes elective surgeries are a product of a functioning country.

I've needed a total shoulder replacement for a couple of years now...the pain, discomfort, lack of mobility make it difficult to work as an educator and very difficult to sleep.

I've spent an extra year in agony because people are too brainwashed to wear a mask and now might have to wait more because some are too brainwashed to get vaccinated. 

Biden's social health mandate is less like a good parent saying no dessert until you eat nutritious food and more like a parent holding their child's hand crossing the street."
2021-09-13 10:17:44,Think Bret is going to need to make another correction. Reconciliation can only be used once a year. Thus the 3.5 Trillion bill cannot be broken up and passed in seperate pieces.

This family member is far from a right leaning Republican, voted for Bernie Sanders. Seeing what President Biden announced the other day, we took similar action.

No vaccine, the family member will not be allowed to visit us. We too are sick and tired of their false reasoning.

Thank you President Biden."
2021-09-13 10:19:39,Framing the vaccine mandate as a matter of free choice vs. government overreach dismisses the rights of the vulnerable and public-spirited and denies the importance of collective action in a global crisis. Is it really all about the individual?
2021-09-13 10:19:55,"Had Donald Trump been President in the early 1950's when the Sauk vaccine was introduced, we would still have masses of people living in iron lungs and millions dead from the effects of polio.  The failure of our country to deal swiftly and in an organized, centralized fashion lies squarely on his failed actions and speech.  Chaos ensued because of his responses over the covid-19 threat in the early months of 2020.  This single man has lead our nation down a path of destruction.  The Republican Party and media have supported his effort by playing the ""he said/she said"" game with a contagious killing pandemic.  It needs to stop.  There are no ""two sides"" to fighting a deadly disease."
2021-09-13 10:24:42,"Didn't Bret just last week call Biden's presidency a failure? Now he says there's hope.

And conveniently forgetting that this vaccine mandate offers people an out, by testing every week."
2021-09-13 10:32:09,"What everyone forgets is that the new vaccination requirements are that people are vaccinated OR get tested weekly for COVId. Each individual can make that choice: vax or test! And Biden, through partnership with companies and by using the emergency act, is ramping up production of at home tests and making them less expensive. So Americans still have a choice. I don’t hear moderate and left leaning news people stressing that there is choice!"
2021-09-13 10:37:15,"Bret doesn't seem to understand that Biden's executive orders regarding vaccinations are more than a response to a health issue; they make a statement that he is not powerless in the face of actions sandbagging our nation's progress. Or maybe Bret does realize that and doesn't mind that what drives much of this defiance is not the cause of freedom, but spite."

2021-09-13 10:44:19,Mr. Stephens solution is unvaccinated people shouldn't expect someone else to bail them out . But they do and that's why they are flooding our healthcare system for treatment of Covid. Healthcare workers don't have the freedom to choose  to deny patients who need medical care. Ethical standards supercede ignoring their cries for help. Our healthcare system is paying the price for the reckless decisions many of our Republican leaders are making regarding the spread of this deadly virus. These politicians must be held accountable.
2021-09-13 10:45:01,"I do think that President Biden is trying to run the country, not trying to win the next election.
In the meantime Republicans are, in the words of Mr. Stephens, requiring"" the government or their employer telling them what to do with their bodies.""
And, our immediate past ""president"" is pushing ""boxing"" to the level of ""professional wrestling"", a previous incarnation of his. Which, of course will further endear him to those who like to see people beating each other to the point of death.
As for death panels, promised by the Republicans, they succeeded, at least in Idaho, and coming to a state near you soon.
The Pro-Death-Party is sure doing things for the people."

2021-09-13 10:46:44,"Bret Stephens underplays the current nature of the COVID crisis. It may indeed be a ""nincompoop crisis,"" but it is still a major public health crisis. We are averaging about 1,600 deaths a day. In many states, ICU beds are filled to capacity, meaning there is no room for people with acute conditions like heart attacks or traumatic accidents. Businesses are beginning to shut down. The people who are refusing to get vaccinated are behaving irresponsibly without any regard for their fellow citizens. They are no different than people running red lights, shooting guns into crowds or pushing people on subway platforms. Stephens's suggestion that Medicaid, Medicare, and private health insurers should refuse to pay for their care if they get infected is the kind of pressure needed to curb their socially irresponsible behavior."
2021-09-13 10:47:44,"So tired of the argument being framed as either being vaxxed or unvaxxed with no mention of the co-morbidities that come into play when hospitalization is required.  On this same issue if vaccine mandates can be required under the guise of ""it saves lives and don't you want to protect your grandmother and loved ones"" then laws banning abortion which also saves lives should be allowed to stand. How ironic that the Texas law allow neighbors to turn in neighbors if suspected of having an abortion.  The parallel is the people who are vaccinated point the fingers at the unvaxxed and accuse them of spreading the disease and the cause of mutations, even when the vaxxed can carry and transmit the virus.  If you want to create divisiveness, then pass laws that mandate what can or cannot be done with ones body. My body, my choice should prevail i f we are truly a country of free choice."
2021-09-13 10:50:19,"""Anyway, as anti-vaxxers are mostly putting themselves at serious risk of getting seriously ill, I don’t see the need for a presidential directive, including the renewed mask mandates, which only diminish the incentive to get vaccinated. ""

Good God, Bret Stephens, anti-vaxxers are putting all of us at risk, not just themselves.  They are needlessly prolonging a pandemic that in a saner world, would be over by now.  They are spreading a virus even among the vaccinated, allowing new covid variants to develop, and preventing US citizens from getting vital healthcare because they are taking up all the hospital rooms.

Covid is not shingles, where only the patient suffers from avoiding the vaccine.  George Washington mandated small pox vaccines for his soldiers. Public health crises demand government responses for contagious diseases--period."
2021-09-13 10:52:35,"When one's behaviors become a threat to others at large, it is time to ask that individual to control or eliminate that behavior.

2021-09-13 10:53:55,"Biden definitely needs to tack to the center. A moderate Democratic Party is much better for America than an extreme GOP, which could take the Executive Branch back if the Dems overreach.

2021-09-13 10:58:50,"When is compelling someone to do the ostensibly right thing the right thing to do? How probabilistic does its rightness need to be to make it OK to compel it?

I think one major issue many have with this latest mandate is coupled with other, previous mandates, such as social distancing and masks that have substantially less acceptance and evidence as being helpful. Vaccines very much work, but I for one wish they were the primary focus."
2021-09-13 10:59:52,"Joe Biden is doing his best to lead. It is we, the increasingly ungovernable American public, who are failing. We the people need a legislative success and the hope that it brings. Sure hope the Democrats are going to sort themselves out. Manchin and Sinema need to agree to more than a 1.5 trillion human infrastructure package. Bernie et al need to come down from 3.5 trillion. I like the progressive proposal, but it isn't going to pass--in the Senate or even in the House, where there is angst building amongst moderate Democrats. Tell your congressional representatives to deal, and deal quickly. We need to move onto voting rights next."

2021-09-13 11:01:01,"Bret refuses to understand, hence he is a public health denialist, that unvaccinated people not only put themselves at risk but everyone else they get in contact with, unvaccinated or not. 
And what’s more cruel? Mandating a shot with a safe and effective vaccine or refusing to pay for the bills once one gets sick with a preventable disease?
Because we mandate childhood vaccines many viral infectious have been basically eradicated.
Only collective action gets us out of this pandemic.
If anyone bothers to check the infection rate in South America where the combination of public health measures and vaccination programs have left the land of the free in the dust.
The US was a terrifying laughing stock under Trump, now it’s a sad case of a country that has all the means but lacks people with a collective common sense."
2021-09-13 11:09:37,"For all of his supposed knowledge and wonkiness, Brett Stephens seems conspicuously uniformed about the long judicial upholding of public health mandates that extend to the Supreme Court ruling in 1905. Justice John Marshal Harlan wrote: ""In every well ordered society charged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand."""
2021-09-13 11:10:34,"While I agree with Bret Stephens’ comments about health insurance being denied for those who refuse to be vaccinated, I think most of his other COVID-related comments are silly. The unvaccinated are a huge danger to themselves, to children (as the stats support), and even to the vaccinated. While the overwhelming majority of those with breakthrough cases have mild symptoms, if you consider flu-like symptoms and loss of taste/smell to be mild, it also means loss of productivity for those people. They miss work or school for 10 days. It also means stress on those who have been in close contact with that person as they count the days until they can get tested and then wait the 2-3 days for their test results. And in some ways it is even worse with those who are asymptomatic as they are walking, talking Typhoid Marys, unknowingly spreading the virus around their world."
2021-09-13 11:11:47,"Bret wearing a 'Bernie' button, what an image!

2021-09-13 11:12:26,"I am so weary of all this. Just wear a mask; it's not that hard. Man up. Yes, the guidelines change; it's an evolving virus with new information in real time. I read all I can in responsible press, talk to my epidemiologist-adjacent friend, and have decided that basically I will be wearing masks indoors for the foreseeable future--and that means not taking them off to eat, etc--and outdoors when it's crowded due to the contagiousness of Delta. I am not virtue-signaling: I am protecting my immune-suppressed husband while trying to keep my job which has required in-person attendance. Once again, IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU. Mask up."
2021-09-13 11:15:38,"The idea that Medicare/Medicaid and private insurance should not pay for unvaccinated people with Covid sounds good but is totally impractical.  When someone shows up in an ER, the law (specifically EMTALA) requires the hospital to stabilize an emergency medical condition.  For someone severely ill with Covid, that likely means admitting them to an inpatient bed.  Do you think that the patient in that condition is going to say to him/herself, ""Gee, my bill is getting close to $100,000, I guess I'd better pull out these tubes and wires and get myself out of here!""  And do you think that the hospital is going to be successful in collecting these large bills from the patient's personal assets?  All it will do is add to medical debt and potential bankruptcy for the patient, and increased financial burden from uncollectible accounts for the hospital - and likely add to the trend of closing small and rural hospitals."

2021-09-13 11:17:34,"No one should be denied health care unless we reach a state where there is no longer enough to go around and it must be rationed. 

Precisely because no one should be denied, mandates are necessary. If we are going to provide care to everyone, everyone must act responsibly—and if they refuse to do so willingly, they should be forced to do so.

Only two seemed to be teens, so possibly vaccinated (??) No masks on any, though the four-year-old carried hers like a purse.  I wore my mask for those youngsters and for the many other children in church who are too young for vaccination and do not seem to see the reason for masking up."

You don't want to get vaccinated.  No big deal?  Except it IS a big deal to those you come in contact with.  To those having to care for you in the hospital.  For the cost to the health care system to care for you in the ICU. For the lost wages and productivity as you recover for what could be a couple weeks or several months or more or die.  From an entirely preventable severe illness or death. Now you are hearing all these horror stories of nurses  leaving the job because they refuse to get vaccinated. Give it a little time.  They have no where to go. They won't make the money anywhere else they do now.  Are they willing to toss away the investment in their nursing education over this?  And do what?  Wait tables? Cashier at the local grocery store? That out to complete their purpose in life.  And one other thing:  with 140,000+ cases and 1600 deaths a day and some degree of increased vaccination, this phase of the pandemic is peaking.  But watch as the virus says ""OK who is next?  Where are the unvaccinated for us to infect?""  And what do you know....all packed into a neat package , ripe for the taking, in schools across the country. Biden vs DeSantis?

Because I haven’t heard anything from the GOP on this topic.  What I have heard for 18 months are Democratic leaders proposing public health and safety orders such as mask mandates, social-distancing, and now vaccination requirements.  These strict measures are not pleasurable, but neither are 660,000 (and counting) COVID deaths in the United States. My dear mother among them. May she Rest In Peace.

So, tell me Bret, what is the Republican plan to end this national emergency? Because I have yet to find one."
2021-09-13 11:26:13,What Mr. Stephens fails to point out is that widespread Covid infections among the unvaccinated will create mutations that are resistant to the vaccine.

You are missing something important: The more sick people there are, the more likely it becomes that new variants will develop that affect us all. 
Do we need to offer the virus more opportunities to mutate, and impact us all again?"
2021-09-13 11:29:46,"No, wait:  You can't just dismiss vaccine opponents as people who should pay for their own health care.  Arguably an unvaccinated population allowed the delta variant to mutate.  Ongoing exposure of an unvaccinated subgroup will guarantee that the next variant develops soon.  This is a population health problem and it needs a population-wide solution.  Vaccine resisters risk far more than themselves and their families.  If the carrot of being immune doesn't get people vaccinated, the stick of loss of employment and opportunity is reasonable."

There was never a mandate for a major progressive agenda packed into that budget. I support withdrawing the troops. I support Biden's handling of the pandemic.

It DOESN'T.

What makes you less free is knowing that if you linger while doing your shopping you're increasing your chances of dying an excruciating death because the other people sharing the aisle with you may not be vaccinated.

What makes you less free is not feeling safe going to the dentist because the hygienist refuses to do something safe, cost free, and backed by actual science.

What makes you less free is having to give up public transport, travel, restaurants, theaters, and even gatherings with friends . .  . and it is people who refuse to get vaccinated who are making us give up all that.

Vaccination =  Freedom.

It isn't the other way around."

2021-09-13 11:38:10,"Bret's suggestion of the Democrats going small and then passing their social legislation one piece at a time is a nice theory, but reality is that budget reconciliation is their only path to getting any of this done. This is due to the Senate filibuster that takes 60 votes for a standalone bill to clear."
2021-09-13 11:42:26,"Two quick thoughts for Bret...
1. The government -- federal, but also many Republican-governed southern states -- have been catering to the sensitivities of of those who won't get vaxed. Hasn't the recent case surge proven that we've passed the tipping point when our institutions should be prioritizing the needs of those who have been vaxed, or who would like to but are still too young? Those who have vaxed, masked and distanced shouldn't spend the foreseeable future at the mercy of those who refuse to do the right thing(s). 

No one wears a mask because we prefer it to going bare-faced. As Gail says, we're forced to continue our precautions because of those who take none. But if nothing else, I thought the Conservative in you would support the advantages of a fully vaxed populace to the economy.

2. I, too, thought Larry Hogan's public statements, international sourcing of Covid testing supplies (which he flew into a local airport rather than risk the Trump-Kushner feds seizing them for the federal stockpile), and his his pro-vax stance, qualified him as a sane Republican. But it still confounds me that of all the qualified personnel he could have chosen for the position, he decided Robert Redfield was the guy to lead Maryland's Covid response effort. Maryland's vaccination rollout was a mess. And I thought once Redfield (who may be a brilliant doctor, but one with an obvious administrative skills deficiency) left the CDC, his career in public health would be toast."
2021-09-13 11:44:31,"Please, please enough already! Can folks who do not live in my home state stop criticizing us, particularly our governor? I remember a time when my husband was a CA state employee, and we had one lousy Republican governor after another. They cared less about our insidious trajectory toward global warming. Polluting cars? Big deal. Oil rigs along our coast? No biggie. The homeless? It was starting back when, and no one cared. Bret, let’s focus on DeSantis or Abbott, rather than one man who is juggling infernos and a pandemic, and very well, too. Finally, the mandates from President Biden. If it weren’t for the unvaccinated, the Republican obstructionists, Fox News, conspiracy theories, choosing politics and fanatical religion over science, and Mr. Trump, we would be living a mask-free, healthier, angst-free life right now. The Republican Party messes everything up. Period."
2021-09-13 11:44:32,"The democrats offer refreshing plans for the country.  The republicans offer nothing, except ""let's make it 1957 again.""

By the way, I'm still waiting for Trump's ""tremendous"" health care plan and ""incredible"" infrastructure plan that he promised for four years.  I'm sure his brain trust is working on them."
2021-09-13 11:45:42,"I specifically remember Mr. Stephens being rather awash with praise for President Biden, back in the Spring. How am I supposed to respect an opinion that flips so dramatically in 5 months?"
2021-09-13 11:46:26,"“But the civil libertarian in me doesn’t love the idea of this or any president using administrative powers to force vaccines on the people who refuse to get them.”

Bret needs to reconsider what is meant by the social contract. We have obligations to each other and true civil libertarians recognize  the need for government to act in the public interest when it comes to a pandemic.

As Biden correctly argues, this has become a pandemic of the unvaccinated. He has the authority to take action."
2021-09-13 11:48:16,"Gail is absolutely right that Joe Biden is saying the unvaccinated shouldn't be allowed in "" certain places where infecction is relatively easy to spread, like workplaces or public buildings."" 
I think people should have bodily autonomy and, if someone doesn't want to get vaccinated, we should allow that. But! That person should not have the right to mix with the rest of us in public spaces. If it takes a government mandate to achieve that, so be it. 
I've heard people say that the ideal would be to encourage people to do the right thing. Trouble is, that didn't work.
I just read that West Virginia, which was touted as a success story for getting trusted community members to urge that their friends and neighbors get vaccinated now has the biggest spike of the virus in the nation. It didn't work.
Parents who refuse allow their children to be masked in school are taking away the rights of other parents who want their kids to be as safe as possible. That's wrong. 
This nation is our house. We need rules to protect all of us. Gail is right. Pep talks are not enough."
2021-09-13 11:48:45,"Gee, we only have experience with vaccines going back to the 1700s.  All vaccines work pretty much the same way.  They are a non-functional pathogen or part of the pathogen (e.g., the Covid ""spike"") that cause your immune system to create specific antibodies that disable the real thing.  There is nothing particularly ""weird"" about the Covid vaccine.

Thus, there is no reason why Biden should not put the heat on these people to get vaccinated.

1. They are a danger to those who can't get vaccinated.

2. It can cause breakthrough infections in the vaccinated.

3.  It increases the possibility of a mutation that will render the  current vaccines ineffective.

4. They are unnecessarily placing a huge strain on the healthcare system.

If I could get drafted when I was a kid, I see nothing wrong with vaccine mandates, a much less intrusive interference in my ""personal autonomy."""
2021-09-13 11:49:18,"All children under age 12 are unvaccinated .
Adults in a society have an obligation to protect our children .
Brett - masking, in areas of high transmission ,is indicated to protect our children. 
It might be adequate to only mask the unvaccinated , but short of forcing them wear a scarlet letter ( ""A"" for anti-vax) this is not feasible."
2021-09-13 11:50:34,"People with a rational approach to risk should not be harmed by people who are irrationally afraid.  President Biden began his speech the other day by correctly asserting that the vaccines are excellent at preventing hospitalization and death (and by the way, this is even more true for working age adults); then, inexplicably, he said he had to ""protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated workers.""  Well, the vaccine protects vaccinated workers from every worker--vaccinated and unvaccinated--and don't forget that vaccinated workers can spread the disease quite easily, as the CDC pointed out when it re-instituted its mask guidelines for the vaccinated after the Provincetown breakout.

So, from a public health perspective, a vaccine mandate won't protect anyone except the people getting vaccinated.  In addition, I think it IS a very bad idea for a president to politicize what should be an apolitical entity, OSHA. You recall that Trump was accused of politicizing government agencies and departments.  And heck, two high level FDA officials resigned because of the political pressure imposed upon them by Biden.  The Imperial Presidency is a road to ruin."
2021-09-13 11:51:28,"Where are the ""centrist"" Republicans when their party-mates are doing their all to see Biden (and therefore) the county fail?

2021-09-13 11:52:21,"People in Idaho and eastern Washington state are unable to have “elective” surgeries for brain tumors and painful orthopedic conditions due to hospitals in the area being overwhelmed with Covid patients, largely due to Idaho having no mandates on masks and other measures at virus control and patients, according to doctors, are in misery, as reported today by this newspaper.  

So saying “its gone from being a public-health crisis to a nincompoop-health crisis” seems somewhat flip towards people who are suffering.  It’s a crisis to the person with a tumor inside their head for sure.  So a vaccine mandate seems the only way now to make any difference. 

On the other hand, my patience with people choosing not to get vaccinated has made me low on empathy, so denying care by Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies to the unvaccinated does not seem totally unreasonable anymore.  This is not going to happen though.  

Simply a letter to everyone by insurance companies  stating that deductibles and copays will be considerably higher, or even higher premiums, if you are unvaccinated seems quite reasonable and logical.  You can choose to be unvaccinated but know you are facing higher costs.  Denying people care is not realistic, making them pay more is, I think."
2021-09-13 11:54:32,"It is sad that ostensibly serious people like Bret can continue to make specious arguments about COVID vaccinations.

Good grief, Brett--get a clue or write for a lesser publication."
2021-09-13 11:54:53,Biden must go big. The clock is ticking and our world is literally on fire. I’m vaccinated but continue to mask because six grandchildren cannot be vaccinated. They stayed away to protect me. It is the least I can do (and I mean least. I wish there were more.)
2021-09-13 11:55:07,"You both need a good science lesson in virus mutation.  A virus is a power law function like compound interest.  The higher the ""rate"" and the longer the time the more you get.  Public health officials know that the key to holding down the rate is time.  To make matters worse evolution is at work.   The longer the virus lives it mutates to create a stronger virus with a higher ""rate"".   The virus is actively learning to overwhelm the vaccines.  The quicker and more decisive the stop the sooner it dies.  Masks should have been mandated when the first case happened and vaccines mandated when the first one started shipping.  Public health officials at local, State and Federal levels should have this power.  The virus is an invader from nature and this is war.  The ""nincompoops"" are those who continue to not understand the seriousness of this problem."
2021-09-13 11:55:34,"Just want to add one other Republican to Brett's list -- Gov. Charlie Baker of Mass. If the national GOP had even a semblance of sanity, Baker would be a hands-down favorite to beat Joe Biden in 2024. Similar to Larry Hogan, he's been able to win even in a Deep Blue state because of his common-sense approach to governance -- a reasonably-progressive platform (pro-choice, etc.), but with a decidedly conservative (i.e., no new taxes) fiscal stance. But they're dinosaurs, politically-speaking, representing what the former GOP meant to America in the mould of Nelson Rockefeller, Jacob Javits, Howard Baker, Charles Percy -- I could go on.  Instead we have a GOP whose icon is  Marjorie Taylor Greene, a total disgrace to our country. The reality for Brett and other old-school Republicans is that there is no Dem candidate (even if it were AOC! ) who even remotely poses an existential threat to our democracy, whereas a return to the White House of Trump or any of his progeny -- DeSantis, Noem, Abbott, etc. -- will mean the end of the so-called American experiment."
2021-09-13 11:56:09,"Bret Stephens, the unvaccinated are not just hurting themselves, but putting others in danger--particularly children under 12, who cannot be vaccinated. Fewer people vaccinated in any given area creates a high level of spread and more chance that these children will contract the virus. In addition, as President Biden made clear, the high numbers of Delta in the country, due to low vaccination rates, are dampening the economic recovery because many vaccinated people are still too worried under these circumstances to travel, dine out, and generally spend money.  While such caution among the vaccinated may be unnecessary, it will persist until the infection rates decline,  a function of vaccination rate."
2021-09-13 11:57:45,"""his predictions about the end of the pandemic when the virus had other ideas.""

This sentence is bothersome. It follows an entire discussion about mask and vaccine mandates. If people had followed those mandates the pandemic would be largely under control. In fact, the pandemic could have been under control without vaccines if we'd had more discipline in our social distancing early on. Biden has been strong on all of it. To accuse him of poor leadership on the pandemic is a bad faith argument..."
2021-09-13 11:59:09,"The impact of mask and vaccination mandates pales in comparison to the effects a fourth wave of covid will have on not only the nation’s economy and physical health but our emotional stability as well. As autumn deepens each day will slowly become colder and darker in much of the country.  School closures and interruptions have already thrown communities and parental work schedules into chaos.  And it’s only a matter of time before the virus unchecked mutates into a vaccine-resistant variant.  Most arguments against the mandates citing “freedom” are absurd, simply ignoring the mandatory inoculations required to enter kindergarten or the insurance necessary to drive a car.  Trump, with ample support from a thoroughly gelded GOP, has politicized everything including simple decency.  What’s perhaps the worst part of all this is that while republican minions spread poisonous lies they’re focused on what their constituents want to hear rather than the possible life-saving truth.  They don’t even believe what they’re saying.  Their cowardly homage to the Trump and the expansion of The Big Lie is killing Americans every day."

So that state's governor is railing against Covid vaccinations, as are most other Republican Party governors.  The conclusion is obvious: vaccination, like mask wearing, has nothing to do with science or public health. It is instead the manifestation of an ongoing and growing right-wing revolt against government authority.

Republicans clearly think this is a winning strategy in upcoming elections. If they are right, then our national unity and ability to move forward will be in serious doubt."
2021-09-13 12:00:06,"I think Brett has this right.

Their lack of understanding the difference between individual rights and human rights or just between right and wrong is astounding."

2021-09-13 12:02:31,"Between Collins, Biden and Stephens who's got the most old and tired ideas? Not the old guy in the group. Mr. Stephens' ideas for change are old tired prescriptions that don't work. I'm proud to have a President who'll stand in front of the public unafraid to the truth and whose solutions are responsive and energetic, in stark contrast to the timid failed ideas of Bret Stephens."
2021-09-13 12:04:34,"Mr. Stephens makes one comment that I find flat out false, and another that is just silly. 

Regarding his view that ""anti-vaxxers are mostly putting themselves at serious risk of getting seriously ill."" This is just not true. If any virus is allowed to spread, it has the potential to mutate. This is how the Delta variant of Covid-19 developed. The overriding concern I have is that way too many people are not taking the vaccine, not wearing a mask in enclosed public spaces, and not taking other precautions such as social distancing, which presents the conditions for this virus to mutate again, and render our current vaccines obsolete. The anti-vaxxers are putting all of us at risk.

Regarding his statement that those ""who have a solid medical or emotional need to take great precautions, including masks, and I totally respect them. The busybodies and virtue-signalers, not so much."" I feel that my right to not be infected by others who refuse the vaccine, even if they have no legitimate health reason to do so, and that my right to life, trumps those who feel it is there right to not mask up, nor take the vaccine. The responsible majority of Americans, who are doing the right thing, are not ""virtue-signaling"", we are concerned that the next variant will break our vaccine induced immunity."
2021-09-13 12:05:22,"The problem Mr. Stephens is having with President Biden's performance, is President Biden is acting like a Democrat--rather than, what he would like to see as Republican-lite. As to the vaccination debate, we have a whole host of vaccine mandates already on the books, along with a Supreme Court decision supporting mandated vaccines. The GOP is playing political games with this issue--and President Biden, the adult in the Oval Office, does not play games. Oh, forgot about Afghanistan, whose newsworthiness decreases by the day."

It shows."
2021-09-13 12:07:41,"All this ANGST about people who live among us, in public, as fellow citizens, who don't want to be vaccinated ""because it takes away their freedom""!  HOW MANY MORE TIMES do we have to listen to anyone spew this argument at us?  I'll say it one final time:  ANYONE who doesn't live in a bubble has a MORAL AND LEGAL OBLIGATION TO BE VACCINATED.  It's not about ""them"", it's about ""US"".  Our health.  Our children's health.  If they want to keep their bodies free of life-saving vaccines that will not only protect them but MORE IMPORTANTLY the rest of us, fine.  But stay off the streets and away from the rest of us.  In fact, that would be one blessing of them not getting vaccinated - not having to continue this argument anymore because every time I hear about it I'm reminded of a child who won't drink his milk, not even because he doesn't like it, just because he doesn't want to."

2021-09-13 12:11:23,"The point of wearing masks is to reduce the possibility of transmitting the virus to another person. Hopefully masks also help to protect the wearer, but not all masks are highly effective.
People who have gotten vaccinated can still have a breakthrough infection and can still transmit the virus.
So, much as I dislike wearing a mask, I’m happy that my county requires wearing one indoors in public spaces. I do wish they had required them earlier this Summer. If they had, then we might be closer to getting back to normal now."

Biden tried to reason with the anti group, but most will tell you their goal is to defeat him. I support him in this mandate and believe it will hold up to legal challenges. How many more deaths, how much more severe illness must be delivered to us by this pandemic before we fully support action to control the virus?

 Religion should not be considered when people refuse vaccination. Someone undergoing an organ transplant, for example, could be a candidate for refusing. Hopefully, such a candidate will be able to find a safe hospital bed."

2021-09-13 12:13:13,"One question to Mr Stephens, so what to do with the current vaccine mandates (requirements ) in every state and territory of the US?

By the way, Mississippi has one of the strictest vaccine requirements with no exceptions of rreligious or conscientious objections.

These requirement apply to vaccines suchs as measles, mumps and rubella, among others, and a common enforcement mechanism is when the person enters school, regardless of age."
2021-09-13 12:13:22,"In Texas I generally ignore the suggestion to don a mask in most indoor public settings because it enables the anti-vaxxers to continue their stand against receiving the vaccine. The prevalence of mask usage dropped in the Spring after rollout and decrease in cases, hospitalizations and deaths. However usage has sprung up with Covid Delta strain in Summer. With a paltry 50 percent vaccinated here it is clear the anti-vaxxers are scared of this virulent new wave coming after younger cohorts."
2021-09-13 12:15:05,"Well over 100 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court held that vaccination could be REQUIRED of EVERYONE in a public health crisis. That is still the law. In its decision, the Court dismissed the notion that a person could evade his/her responsibility to the community by claiming ""freedom"":

""...a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.""

""Society based on the rule that each one is a law unto himself would soon be confronted with disorder and anarchy. Real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own...regardless of the injury that may be done to others."" 

See: Jacobson v. Massachusetts, decided in 1905 by a 7-2 majority."
2021-09-13 12:15:25,One thing missing from this discussion regarding Biden's vaccination order is the fact that there is an opt out whereby the worker can submit weekly test results instead of getting vaccination.  Those who are against the order and who fail to mention the testing opt out are merely playing the straw man game.
2021-09-13 12:16:12,"Elective surgery does not mean frivolous - the surgeries that have been put off are knee replacements, stent insertions, and other procedures that treat conditions not classified as ""life threatening"" - the way that Stephens blithely dismisses the crisis caused throughout the hospital system in this country by the unvaccinated indicates his privilege as a healthy middle-aged male, whose politics hew closely to his own personal convenience (he might have a different option about the breadth of the criss if he needed a non-life threatening cyst removed and was told to wait six months)."
2021-09-13 12:16:21,"In an ideal world people would study and absorb the benefits of getting the Covid vaccination as well as the miniscule dangers.  We would trust our neighbors to do the right thing, with keeping their very own communities in mind.  Unfortunately, misinformation fueled by right wing political ambition has zapped millions of Americans' clarity of thought.  Anti-vaxxers are forcing Biden to make the right choice for them, as it is his responsibility to keep our citizens safe.  Ignorance is no excuse.

If someone was determined to keep their hand over a fire because they've been told it is good for them, it's the government's responsibility to remove that hand for their own good."
2021-09-13 12:18:16,"Mandates are a public health blunder compounded it with a civil liberties blunder.

Spectacularly bad decision making always has political repercussions. First there's denial. Then the cover ups and then the lies.

It's not clear who Biden is getting his public health strategy from but it was poor from the start and has only gotten worse.

How can that be? The vaccine rollout has been a success. It has been a short sighted, temporary success that's already starting to backfire.

Mass vaccination campaigns during a pandemic of highly infectious variants fail to control viral transmission. Instead of contributing to building HI, they dramatically delay natural establishment of HI (Vanden Bossche, August 2021).

This is why the ongoing universal vaccination campaigns are absolutely detrimental to public and global health.

A sound public health response needs better detection methods (the PCR test is highly unreliable).

It needs a variety of treatment options (Fauci has single handedly repressed the dozen or so repurposed drugs that are saving lives elsewhere)

And it needs a long term strategy for prevention.

Instead all we've gotten is a protein specific vaccine, now mandated for nearly everyone that the virus has already circumvented precisely because it is single protein specific and being given to everyone.

Vaccines should be part of a comprehensive public health program. But this one size fits all strategy is already failing and mandates only increase its rapidity."
2021-09-13 12:18:25,"Covid continues to rage mostly because so many people refuse to be vaccinated and to wear masks.    These people's refusal to get a safe and effect vaccine is costing this country billions in unnecessary spending on hospitals and medical expenses.  Hospitals in much of the country (in particular the South) are over loaded.  I read this morning about a hospital in Georgia designed for 90 ICU patients but it has over a 100 now.  That is true in many places.

Everyone is worried about the ""rights"" of the anti-vaccine folks.   But what about the rights of the people who have been vaccinated.  Many of us are afraid to go out in public because so many people in public places are unvaccinated and refused to wear masks.

Best wishes."
2021-09-13 12:20:20,"The dialogue on vaccine mandates misses an important characteristic of the reasoning for the mandate.  
Without much broader protection in our population, the country runs the risk of permitting a much more lethal variant of COVID to take hold in the unvaccinated and perhaps then overwhelm the currently vaccinated population.  At the root, none of this is about civil liberties it is all about public health policy.  
If this country is broadly vaccinated then what comes next after Delta and Mu will have a difficult time in establishing itself, mutating and finding new strategies to infect people."
2021-09-13 12:20:32,"Both columnists fail to mention the impact of the non-vaccinated on the development of COVID variants which endanger even the fully vaccinated.

And things are not slowing down in any sense of the term. I’m a physician and my local hospitals are overrun with sick, unvaccinated people. My colleagues in medicine, nursing and ancillary services are EXHAUSTED and see no end in sight. We’ve tried the carrot- good vaccine freely available and appealing to people’s better nature (ha) with our resulting horrible vaccination rate in Idaho and a republican governor who used to have sense missing in action so SOMEBODY had to be a grownup and lead with a stick. We are just tired of unnecessary death so thank you Joe."
2021-09-13 12:24:00,"It's just painful to read the thoughts of two people who seem to be missing the points, mainly Bret.  The mandate allows for frequent testing in lieu of vaccination. The reasons to attempt to reduce infections are to take the burden off hospitals, to reduce the probability of mutations in the virus, to allow the economy to return to pre-covid activity, and to allow people to live without the restrictions that are necessary to prevent infection. This is not the only vaccine mandate and the legal system has supported mandatory vaccination in the past."

No slippery slope there? Substance abuse/mental health treatment? If your teenage kid repeatedly gest intoxicated and wrecks on the long board requiring multiple fractures, stitches, or worse, how many times before we stop paying?  Adults? Not easy, especially in mental health and that's with those whom don't always agree with their diagnoses given the lack of objective measurement (i.e. no antigen nor antibody test to indicate current or recent infection and no powerful scanning electron microscope to ""see"" the virus and spike proteins).  How many individuals with diabetes and and cardiac illnesses follow their physicians directives based on data/science? Many still end up in the ER, repeatedly, despite average to above average intelligence.   If this path were to be followed, the devolution of humanity (yes, I agree it has already begun) will continue at a faster pace.

We also don't withhold medical treatment from those who become sick due to smoking.  Maybe we should.

Hospitals are required to provide care to anyone who walks in whether or not they have insurance or ability to pay.  It irks me that there are people who choose not to have health insurance and say that they are expressing their individual rights but then when they get sick or have an accident expect others to pay for their care either through increased taxes or increased insurance costs.

I have no problem with adults whose minds are intact choosing not to have health insurance.  However, I do mind my having to pay for their care.  If they make that choice fine, but when they go to a hospital let them either show an ability to pay for care or be shown the door."

Until recent weeks, the 14 million fellow Americans and I that took that version, have been asking questions that those in power have ignored and essentially not answered.

Now, today's New York Times morning newsletter points out that the science and follow-up to the J&J vaccine has been unclear; that a person may not find boosters of the product available; and the newsletter directly suggests that a person may have to consider lying to get another type of vaccine in coming months.

I trusted the CDC and the leadership of our nation to review and approve these vaccines for public use, and the New York Times to truthfully report on all the vaccines and their future use. Being told the vaccine is not as effective, may become unavailable, and that I should lie to get a booster shot, is not exactly my idea of good public leadership.

James Madison himself denounced this as an “evil,” but we seem to treat it as part of the natural universe. There is simply no reason that Wyoming or, for that matter Vermont, should have the same voting power as California and Texas. It is not simply a question of population, which is terrible enough.

 And you wait and you wait and you wait for a listing of the Republican ideas and policies that would have any effect on the above.  But nothing appears, only that phrase ""complete Democratic Party Control"". as if that is the cause.

The mere elective procedures being put off include things like kidney biopsies—even for kids.  This is what happened to my 17-year-old daughter two weeks ago.  She has a life-threatening kidney condition.  We were told at the time it would be put off “indefinitely” because of the Covid surge.  I am sure you can imagine the dread we felt.

How many of President Biden’s proposals has Congress voted on so far, almost nine months into his administration?  Not that many.  How many months until the next major election?  Fourteen.  And, given the bloc like nature of Senate Republicans under Mitch McConnell, how many of these broken down proposals would pass the Senate? One, maybe?  

The number of bills that can be run through the reconciliation process, where a simple majority is all that is necessary, is limited.  And, getting through that process with a 51/50 Senate is hard enough.  Breaking them up is only likely to provide the Democrats little more than the “opportunity” to run next November on a platform of “See what we tried to do, but couldn’t”.  That is not usually a successful platform.  And, if the omnibus proposal fails to get through reconciliation, the factor of “We really tried!” is a much clearer message."

I want to protect my freedom from Covid so I just got the booster shot as are many members of my Senior Club.  I wear the mask but only inside eventhough I find it uncomfortable especially during allergy season.  Many Grandparents did not see their Grandkids for fear of getting Covid but with my Doctors permission I see mine every month . The fear of Covid has not stopped me from buying tickets for 2 Broadway shows that were cancelled but are now reopening and my Senior Club reopened 2 months plus my friends and I have been dining inside for months.The thought of living a life of solitude at my age for the past 1-1/2 years is something I rejected and would have been emotionally draining so as I said it is up to the person to listen to themselves plus their Doctor.
2021-09-13 12:57:55,"""Anyway, as anti-vaxxers are mostly putting themselves at serious risk of getting seriously ill"".   

What about the exhausted doctors and nurses caring for them?   What about the rest of us whose taxes and insurance premiums are subsidizing what is in many cases entirely preventable?  What about the other medical problems (some of them life-threatening) that aren't being addressed because of overburdened hospitals?"
2021-09-13 12:59:34,"""Elective"" surgery doesn't mean a nose job. It just means any surgery that doesn't start with an ambulance to the emergency room, i.e., something that can be scheduled. It means hernia surgery, removal of kidney stones, hip replacements, biopsies, tumor removal, etc.  Those who don't get vaccinated put others at risk of pain and potentially an increased risk of death or disabilities.  Elective surgeries should be prioritized over COVID patients who didn't bother to get vaccinated (with the exception of   people who cannot get a vaccine because of medical conditions.  Religious exemptions? A personal choice that shouldn't inflict pain and suffering on other people either. Go to the back of the line for medical care.)"
2021-09-13 12:59:49,"Brett, it is very likely that without a large share of the country being vaccinated our current outbreak would put the winter one to shame.  As it is this out break is beginning to level off, but as in another article states that have controlled their cases must accept unvaccinated cases from other states les vaccinated. such as Idaho sending its cases to Washington State.  And further the less vaccinated states almost totaly Republican send their bills to Medicaid  and Medicare and other Federal programs.  We are all paying the bill and hardship caused by the unvaccinated and their self righteous obstinacy   something they blame on Biden, but the figures do not lie and DeSanto and the rest are fully criminally at fault here."
2021-09-13 13:04:05,"On your prior headline, Bret, it’s hard to take back those words. People have seen them, but they may not see your regrets.

As for those refusing vaccination without a valid medical reason, yes - bar them form entry into places where they could spread Covid and limit their benefits. This vaccination is equally important as polio, smallpox, etc. just get it."
2021-09-13 13:05:33,Brett's qualms about mask mandates and requiring people to be vaccinated are typical knee jerk conservative reactions to government acting for the public good by imposing some limitations on iniividual freedom. It is that attitude that stands in the way of sensible gun legislation and gives the green light to people to put selfish comfort and desires above the common good. Wishing for people to act in responsible ways cannot substitute for rules that requires them to do so. People are not allowed to walk around naked in public places and I am sure Brett is ok with that. But walking around infecting other people with a potentially deadly disease when simple measures can prevent contagion should be allowed in the name of personal liberty. Logic does not seem to be a strong point with those who consider civil liberties paramount.
2021-09-13 13:06:55,"Eight months ago i lamented how we've given up on all the measures of stemming a pandemic but the vaccines will save us.  Well, somehow, someway, we've (collectively) managed to mess that up too.  The human condition is that, while a few people lead us into an age of technical advanced enlightenment, many of us are basically medieval, hoping that the angels on the pinhead are going to save them."
2021-09-13 13:07:08,"Bret Stephens needs to take a break and get educated about health care and public health. And this statement needs a ""misleading"" flag: ""Covid hospitalizations seem to be declining and the surgeries that are being put off are mainly elective. Otherwise, I don’t see the latest Covid spike as the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago."" 

Hospitals and especially ICUs are full in many jurisdictions. Patients with and without COVID-19 are being turned away. Some are dying. Idaho has instituted crisis care, rationing resources, withholding or delaying optimal care for some patients. Other jurisdictions are doing the same without a formal declaration. 

""Elective surgeries"" are not tummy tucks. They include cardiac, cancer, neurologic, and orthopedic surgeries. Americans are suffering and dying. The 1,200+ COVID-19 deaths per day is just one tragic aspect.

Health professionals are suffering, mentally and physically, with high rates of burnout, PTSD, and increased risk of suicide. 

It's not clear if that statement comes from cluelessness, heartlessness, or both, but it is sadly far for the truth."
2021-09-13 13:07:51,"It's surprising to see Bret so misinformed about  'elective' surgeries and masks after 1.5 years of this pandemic.

'Elective' surgeries just means it can be scheduled in advance.  It's not botox treatments, people are postponing chemotherapy and cardiac surgery.

As for masks, they are more effective at protecting others than protecting yourself.  A fully vaccinated person who wears a mask in a crowded area is doing their part to reduce transmission, even if their personal danger is low.  100,000+ people per day are getting infected in the United States right now.  It is absolutely prudent and patriotic for everyone to do their part to reduce the spread.  

Calling patriotic Americans busybodies and virtue signalers simply because they are trying to prevent their fellow citizens from getting sick is such a deeply cynical and toxic attitude, and I encourage Bret to assess what led him to this point.   

One of the most depressing realizations of this pandemic for me has been that we have lost our ability to work together as a country towards a common good."
2021-09-13 13:08:22,"I do not recall any choice in getting the Polio and Measles vaccine when I was a kid being enrolled in public school. Maybe we shroud bring back the ""Freedom!"" to get Polio again - just like the good old days?"
2021-09-13 13:10:04,"Bret, I understand the whole point-counterpoint narrative here, but let's stop and think rationally for just a moment.   The anti vax crowd may be filling up hospitals, frustrating us all, and keeping the pandemic going indefinitely, but they are far from the only people at risk.   A dear friend of mine has RA and other health issues.   Although fully vaccinated, she walks into a fifth grade classroom every day-a classroom full of unmasked, unvaccinated students.  Her right to work in a safe environment, at least semi free from dread and worry takes a backseat to ""parent rights"" in our state and school district.

Here's a quote from this morning's edition of our local newspaper, ""Tampa Bay Times"" regarding our most recent School Board meeting.

""They had five or six doctors speak and say how bad the hospitals are, said Brian Martin, a chemical engineer with children in Pinellas schools. "" This is real.  Masks work.  Masks help.""   Then they had tons of not medically informed parents say crazy things that are scientifically untrue.  And the board decided to side with them.""

And here we are.  Over 4,000 cases of Covid in our school district since school began on August 11th, and only a matter of time before we lose a teacher, staff member, or child.   A governor who plays to the anti mask, anti vax crowd, and a school board who follows right along.   So, yes, it's past time to get tough.

2021-09-13 13:11:13,"Bret, I have no problem with President Biden's mandating vaccination everywhere he can. I have no problem with Biden mandating face masks everywhere he can, as well.

I have no problem with President Biden telling people who ""choose"" to be unvaccinated that they cannot use any public transportation regulated by the government without proof of vaccination, and a face mask. I have no problem with Biden telling people face masks are required in all schools for all kids and staff, and all kids and staff over 12 must be vaccinated. We require vaccines for measles, polio, diptheria, and many other diseases; COVID is just one more required shot.

I have no problem with Medicare and Medicaid not paying for unvaccinated people's medical bills. I have no problem with private insurers charging unvaccinated people appropriate premiums for the increased risk. I have no problem with hospitals prioritizing facility space and staff resources for vaccinated people first. I have no problem with private businesses of all sorts requiring vaccinations for all employees and customers.

I have no problem with ""choice"" - but all choices have consequences. I have no problem with making people who choose to give COVID a fertile unvaccinated body to grow, mutate, and spread in paying those consequences instead of free riding on the rest of us.

Bret, I have no problem with enforcing ""responsiblity"" along with ""rights""... no problem at all."

Now that the vaccine is approved their unreasonable failure to take precautions that foreseeably clogged the ICU is actionable. Every person denied brain tumor surgery, every heart attack patient left to die without care, every trauma patient who suffered waiting for care or died without care, they or their survivors have a case against the unvaccinated people in the ICU."

2021-09-13 13:15:17,"Civil libertarians always believe their individual freedoms have no impact on anyone else. Bret believes Medicare, Medicaid and Private Insurers should refuse to pay for the care provided to anti-vaxxers. This only works if Hospitals are also allowed to withhold that care. Is that what he’s suggesting? Does he really think the unvaccinated will pay their health care bills? The answer is no. Hospitals and Doctors will bear the bad debt and will pass that cost onto the insurers in the form of higher premiums, so all of us who pay are bills will be negatively impacted. There is no free lunch."
2021-09-13 13:17:25,"Bret Stephens thinks Biden is a failed president, he wrote this just a week ago. Biden could do everything right and the Stephens would still find fault due to his inability to think beyond his right wing dogma. President Biden implemented the mandate because there are some Americans who are acting like petulant  adolescents and somehow equate freedom with spreading a deadly virus. Meanwhile his party, the Republicans, are fully embracing nihilism as a political strategy. 

I suggest Bret familiarize himself  with Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), tin which the Supreme Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. The Court's decision articulated the view that individual liberty is not absolute and is subject to the police power of the state."
2021-09-13 13:19:36,"The names.

Imagine, just for a moment, that America had to read the names aloud. Or commemorate them in quilt squares.  Or granite.  How large would a memorial to those fallen to COVID need to be?

The lives.  The names.

The reading of the names at the New York Memorial on 9/11, with  takes 4 hours. 

Those lost to COVID are like the names read aloud on 9/11.  The names reflect ordinary humans of every faith, ethnicity.

In January, on the eve of inaugurating a new president, 400 lights were lit; each light representing 1000 lives.  How insufficient!  How can one light represent 1,000 lives.  Names.  Families.  Children, niecies, wives, brothers.  Just like we saw at the Memorial.

And there are those who survived the initial impact of the disease but are still suffering with all sorts of symptoms.  A part of them will never be quite right.  What if we included their names?

Imagine if we read the names of those who perished to COVID aloud.  More than 500,000 Americans.  Or we assembled the squares on a quilt.  Or a single illumination for each person.  Imaging we memorialized all of the names in granite.  Doing so would make the size of our collectively losses real, tangible, enormous."
2021-09-13 13:19:39,i just don't understand the angst about biden's stance on vaccines.  didn't the supreme court long ago settle the issue of whether a vaccine can be mandated.
2021-09-13 13:21:28,"""...refuse to allow Medicare or Medicaid to pay their medical bills in the event they become seriously ill. Private health insurers might also follow suit."" 

I agree with Bret Stephens on this one. However, he might have mentioned that if employees don't wish to be vaccinated, they still have the option of being tested periodically before stepping foot into their workplace. In my opinion, this testing should also be at their expense since they are refusing a free vaccine. 

Trump is starting to bore people. Since DeSantis and Abbott have modeled themselves and their politics on Trump's, they won't be far behind."
2021-09-13 13:25:02,"The Medicare and Medicaid laws, and private insurance contracts, don't permit them to refuse payment to patients whose illnesses result from their irresponsible or reckless behavior.  If you become quadriplegic after riding a motorcycle without a helmet, they are still obliged to pay.

This might be a good idea, but would require legislative action and new contracts."
2021-09-13 13:29:42,"There's a case to be made for bodily autonomy as a valid reason to be able to refuse vaccination AND testing.  Ultimately, a person has a right to reject any medical intervention.  At a fundamental level, we should all respect that.  

But the mandate isn't absolute.  It simply makes vaccination or testing a condition for certain types of employment.  Many jobs and opportunities to travel are already conditional on vaccination for other illnesses, so this new rule is not much different from preexisting ones."
2021-09-13 13:30:12,"Back when the Republican party was sane, it would have made sense to make the libertarian argument about vaccine semi-mandates. Since it has turned into the party of ""Trump for Emperor"", one has to be a little shame-faced to even bring it up. The monster that Gingrich et.al. created and Trump jumped in front of has gone off on its own now and will boo when its ""leaders"" (including Trump) show minimal sense by recommending they get vaccinated. If one projects from the current trends, I would say the most likely Republican presidential nominee in 2024 is Marjorie Taylor Greene."

2021-09-13 13:34:36,"Bret:
Requiring people who go out in public to work, school, business, of social events to be vaccinated is absolutely not a violation of their civil liberties.  We don't allow people to do these things without wearing clothes so what is the difference? We also don't allow people to drive cars or fly aircraft or carry firearms without licenses proving competency.  So why shouldn't we require people to be vaccinated for a deadly and highly communicable disease?"
2021-09-13 13:36:33,"""Covid Isn’t Finished Messing With Politics"" is not the problem.  The problem is that Politics is messing with Covid!

As to refusing Medicare or other health insurance coverage to the unvaccinated, that is immoral, impractical  and as costly as their coverage would be.  In my State, NJ,  as in most or possibly all other States an uninsured patient cannot be turned away from an ER, nor denied necessary medical care. In the end the cost of the insured's care is made up by increases in hospital bills that others must pay (Medicare, private insurance and other patients) and by direct reimbursement from the government (indigent care).. This leads to higher insurance premiums and taxes (or more deficit spending).

The least expensive, and healthiest solution is more vaccinations before another Covid strain emerges."

Maybe a little more education about the virus would help him with his political position.
The virus is not going to disappear this year or next year or the year after until the World is sufficiently vaccinated and it will linger still.
Humans may need booster shots for years to come, you've heard of the seasonal flu virus, right?

Once the dollar amount is taken out of the argument, we can debate the substance of the bill. Since the substance of the bill sounds pretty good to many people, Republicans, Manchin and Sinema have to resort to yakking about the $3.5 trillion. It amazes me how much questionable spending is approved by Congress with nary a whimper (recent example: the strategic uranium fund -- much less expensive at $75 million for a study, but of highly dubious utility), while Biden's proposal to help people in tangible ways is widely attacked for its alleged price tag."

The home belongs a lone man, played by Tim Robbins, who offered them sanctuary from the invaders. Soon a spat breaks out between the two men: Tim Robbin's character wants to fight back while Tom Cruise's character doesn't. One man champions freedom/liberty/resistance (he flies the Gadsden flag?), even if it kills him, while the other is concerned for his daughter and simply wants to live, perhaps  to fight another day. 

I can't help but see this stand off as a perfect analogy for our divided nation in the face of the Covid-19 onslaught. The writers and director artfully captured the American psyche."
2021-09-13 13:52:57,"Biden's proposed rule is infinitely reasonable. OSHA is tasked with keeping workplaces safe. A workplace in which employees harboring a deadly, highly contagious respiratory virus are breathing on, coughing on, sneezing on vulnerable co-workers is not a safe workplace. Also, not mentioned is that weekly testing can substitute for vaccination.

My Republican governor, who has mildly recommended vaccinations, is considering challenging the rule in court. The result of suggestions rather than mandates is that Indiana is in the bottom ten of states in terms of vaccination rates. Our hospitals are overrun with unvaccinated Covid-19 patients, such that major hospitals have temporarily cancelled elective surgeries and have intermittently gone on diversion (turning away ambulances). I got vaccinated as soon as I was eligible, but I have to worry that if I were to require hospital care for another reason, there would be no beds or staff available for me. So, the anti-mandate governors are punishing responsible citizens in order to accommodate the whims of the selfish and irresponsible among us. Maybe Bret Stephens has the luxury of living in an area with a high vaccination rate and low community spread, but he should consider the real-world effects of his libertarian ideology."

2021-09-13 13:53:48,The problem with Mr. Stephens' civil libertarian argument is that the vaccine does not offer 100% protection against the virus.

If you don't like the OSHA vaccine mandate, think of it as a testing requirement with an exemption for the vaccinated.

The social spending bill is $3.5t in gross new spending, not net, but it's all anyone ever talks about.  The budget resolution caps the net new outflow at $1.75t over the next decade.  For context, that's about a 4% increase in spending, which is a far less sensational number."

Along the way he takes a shot at people who he believes may be ""virtue signalling"" with excessive mask-wearing. Let me give your columnist another perspective. My sister is the lead at a walk-in clinic. She finds no distinction between the idiocy of this time last year (people avoiding masks, vaccination, social distance) and what's going on now (the same). In her work, every day, in full PPP garb, she is trying to help people who are suffering from a spike in infections: the emerging variants now at loose in the U.S. population. Why are we seeing a spike from emerging variants? Because this  virus has been allowed to play house in America by people who feel ""their freedoms"" are at risk. To bring this still closer to home, I have two housemates who both got a positive COVID test this week (so-called ""breakthrough"" infections). My Pfizer immunization and the precautions we are taking here at home has so far kept me healthy.  But this has been a personal education in why we should give full support to a President whose message last week was ""Our patience is wearing then."" Bret Stephens, your constituency, if you have one, is trying to play Gotcha with an American President who keeps bringing the focus back to where it needs to be.

It is like they are oblivious to those taking the hospital beds away from vaccinated persons with other medical needs. They have no respect for the health care providers who have worked long and hard combating this disease. 
I support all of the mandates and would go father. All masks all of the time. No vaccination, no medical bills paid by Medicare, Medicaid, or any other government provided medical plan. No public transportation without a vaccine card. No entry to any public building without the proof of being vaccinated.

Hunting down anti-vaxxers and inoculating them by force is impractical, but doing what Delta did and adding $200 a month to their health insurance bill is just dandy. As is requiring a vaccine passport for public venues and transport.

""The civil libertarian in me doesn’t love the idea of this or any president using administrative powers to force vaccines on the people who refuse to get them."" Biden is not ""forcing"" anyone to get a vaccine. He is saying that if you don't get a vaccine, there may be consequences. This may include losing a job. But how is that any worse than ""forcing"" an unvaccinated COVID patient to pay their own medical bills, which could lead to bankruptcy, as Bret seems to condone?

""As anti-vaxxers are mostly putting themselves at serious risk of getting seriously ill, I don’t see the need for a presidential directive."" You may think differently if you had, as we do, young children not yet eligible for the vaccine, or an immuno-compromised family member. Also read today's NYT article on sick unvaccinated North Idahoans, where the governor has done nothing to mitigate COVID, flooding Washington State's hospitals, where the governor has done everything, depriving Washington residents of needed care. What does a libertarian do there? Close the border?

Biden has done exactly the right thing by following the widespread advice of medical experts on how to deal with this public health crisis. The Republican outrage over it is disgracefully hypocritical given the even more stringent vaccination requirements many red states such as Mississippi have imposed to fight measles, mumps and many other diseases. The politics is killing people and should stop."
2021-09-13 14:11:05,"I believe Bret Stephens omitted some crucial facts when formulating his opinion about President Biden’s vaccine mandate.

First, people still have a choice. Get the vaccine or submit to weekly covid testing.

Second, Stephens does not believe the current spike in covid cases poses the same public health crisis we faced last year. He’s wrong. Hospitals in unvaccinated areas are facing a true crisis including a lack of ICU beds, and an overwhelmed and diminished health care staff. Is Mr. Stephen’s unaware that last week the State of Idaho moved to crisis standards of care? This means covid care can be rationed based on the likelihood of recovery. This is what Republicans during the Obama administration derisively referred to as death panels.

Lastly, although it is true that the current spike in covid cases is primarily among the anti-vaxxers, they are not the only ones affected. Covid cases among children who are too young to be vaccinated have risen significantly and has included a rise in pediatric hospital admissions."
2021-09-13 13:08:52,"States and businesses aren't requiring that everyone wear masks, regardless of vaccination status, because they are afraid vaccines don't work. They are requiring it because without vaccine passports there is NO WAY for businesses and public building managers to know if someone is actually vaccinated or if they are lying.  Most of the anti-vax people are also ""anti-mask"" people so it is a safe bet that most of them are going to choose not to wear a mask if they can easily get away with lying about it.

When you go to the grocery store and 1 out of 10 people are masked up in a state with 50% vaccination rates is it because you went to the most pro-vaccine grocery store in the state or is it because some people are lying about their vaccination status and throwing health and safety of others to the wind?

Suggesting that these mask mandates are for any other reason only serves to propagate the anti-vaccine rhetoric that these people are fed on daily basis. The only difference being is that they are reading it in the NYT instead of their anti-vax Facebook group."
2021-09-13 14:18:05,"Brett, we live in a society and as members of a society we are required to contribute to the greater good. President Bidens vaccination push isn't directed at those with legitimate medical or access reasons for not getting vaccinated. In fact, his plan is designed to protect them to the greatest extent possible. His plan is an attempt to restore the federal governments role in assuring  and returning society's right to individually pursue life, liberty and happiness.
Unfortunately, public health is one of the few areas where libertarian views confuse individual freedoms with ones societal duties and responsibilities. This is a terrible disease that has taken far too many lives, unnecessarily, due to politics and poor leadership at the federal level. President Kennedy said it best ""ask not what the country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.""

Advocate for vaccines, Brett. This is not the individual freedoms fight you make it out to be. Do it for your fellow man, your country."

Sounds good. One reaps what one sows. Punishment for one’s sins!

Except...hospitals will not refuse care and turn people away. Healthcare workers will still risk their own and their family members’ health to provide care. Others will have their health put at risk. Insurers will find it impossible to unilaterally and suddenly eliminate benefits. Unpaid bills will be ignored and/or written off. New, perhaps worse, variants will evolve. The economy will continue to stagger along. 

Or someone could try do do something useful. 

Bret, as usual, is divorced from reality."
2021-09-13 14:18:58,"Bret - I had a close family member last year who could not get a bed in a NYC hospital  in 2020 for his cancer and by the time a bed opened up, it was too late.  Is that ""elective?"""
2021-09-13 14:20:36,"I agree with Brett on this one: make the voluntarily unvaccinated pay their own hospital bills.

This is exactly the kind of flawed thinking that has made US the worst in the world for COVID cases/deaths. Wearing a mask is not just for oneself - it is to protect others as well. A person without a mask could put themselves in danger, but they can also start a chain of infections that can put many, many more in danger. So even if one is perfectly healthy/young whatever and is vaccinated, with the coronavirus raging in so many parts of the country, it is imperative to wear a mask. What's so difficult to understand about this?"
2021-09-13 14:22:09,"Just a word or two about masking even in vaccinated people. In medicine, we assume that everyone carries the virus unless proven otherwise. The rationale for vaccinated people is to assume they are carriers or prevent them from becoming one. In both cases, the best protection is a mask for everyone. Vaccination for all individuals is the only way the virus will be vanquished. Until then it’s is a war in which we’ve all been drafted and all of us have to fight. There is no choice. The anti-vaxers are either delusional or just unable to understand the issues. Hopefully we can educate the latter group and isolate the former"
2021-09-13 14:23:59,"Mr Stephens,  you fail to understand how vaccines and mask work. They are designed to decrease the spread of the virus so that the pandemic eventually ""burns out"" due to the lack of opportunities for the virus to replicate. The risk to the mask wearer or the vaccinated is never eliminated - though to be fair these vaccine are especially powerful particularly against the original versions of the virus. This virus is spread by healthy young individuals who may not ever know that they were infected. They will never know how they contributed to the deaths of many others. And there are also the other costs to the economy, to the education of our children etc.

2021-09-13 14:27:38,"Gail and Bret may be missing the forest for the trees. You can argue masks, mandates, big spending, taxing the wealthy and helping the poor until the cows come home. But it’s pretty much all academic.  Congress is evenly divided between the left and the right . And the lack of a consensus for much of anything is the rule of the day. 

I flew across the country and was told by flight attendants to wear my mask between each peanut I ate. Then I went to a football game with 100,000 fans who wore no masks at all, vaccinated or not. 

The subtleties of all the issues are argued on these pages. But they are largely removed from reality. Reality is that there are two Americas that are torn asunder, making most of politics an argument over what inevitably will not get done. 

Issue #1 is how to get things done. Until that is addressed everything else is idle talk."

2021-09-13 14:28:19,"The most elegant policy riposte to the anti-vaxxers — and I mean the willful ones, not the people who simply haven’t had access to the shot or have a compelling medical excuse — is to refuse to allow Medicare or Medicaid to pay their medical bills in the event they become seriously ill. Private health insurers might also follow suit. 

I LOVE IT, in complete agreement until I start to realize that many if not most of these medical bills are going to not get paid.  Then what?  Hospitals etc. can't afford to absorb the costs, so it ends up as higher billing for everyone else.  One way or the other it ends up on the backs of those who have already made better decisions regarding vaccination."

He seems to be in denial of the fact that such programs are necessary for a country to be considered ""leading"".  Since at least the 1960s, Western Europe has had a higher standard to living and quality of life than the USA.  The gap is widening.  We all see it and know it."

This illustrates why a presidential directive is needed. We need policies that stretch across state borders because the irresponsibility of citizens and government in one state endanger the citizens in other states."

Biden is right to mandate vaccines, it's a public health crisis — those refusing vaccines are jeopardizing the lives of everyone."

If anti-vaxers and anti-maskers would only stay in their own bubble, but they are not.  They are out spreading the virus to anyone and everyone who comes into contact with them, then filling hospitals in their own communities and OTHER communities and other states.  
I heard mealy mouthed Asa Hutchinson from Arkansas on Meet The Press complaining about Biden's federal overreach in vaccinating and masking mandates.  According to him State governments should be issuing the mandates, not the federal government.  WELL THEN DO IT.   
  This is an invisible virus and as such none of us can know who has it, who is spreading it,  who will be able to fight it off even with vaccinations.  As long as Republican governors are abdicating their responsibilities, and this has been going on now for almost 20 months, then the Federal Government must step in."

The fact is no organized religion, including the Christian Science Church,  holds that any vaccination is against their religion.  The idea that a person can avoid vaccination by waving the Bible at governments and employers is testament to the unwillingness of government to put public health above the self-centered and opportunistic demands of those wrapping themselves in the cloak of mysticism."

When will his handlers come to realize that a large percentage of Federal employees are Black and that they make up a considerable percentage of those who haven't taken the vaccine.  How many of them will be fired, due to his new mandate?

How many hospital nurses and staff, school teachers and bus drivers, grocery store workers, and first responders are Black and haven't gotten the vaccine? What will happen when they are fired?

2021-09-13 14:43:06,"The idea that Biden's mandate was to be a centrist is OK - but the meaning of ""centrist"" has to be considered before saying he's too radical.

A centrist is inclined to do what most of the public wants. They are not obliged to veer their policy decisions to strongly reflect whacko positions - and the GOP has a large portion of their base who've been encouraged for years to feel their whacko positions deserve support.  They do not.

When Civil Libertarian views are that people should have freedom to choose what happens to their bodies, fine. But they do not have the right to then allow their behavior to put other bodies at risk. 

So, don't want vaccine because ""freedom"" or just because someone said you should an you don't wanna (insert tantrum).

Fine. Don't expect you're going to be allowed to make that choice and still be treated like everyone else who realizes that the vaccines are to protect all of us, not just the one getting the shot.

The Donors Trust crowd, and whackos like anti-doctor-certification Rand Paul, have taken the ""I don't wanna"" part of the libertarian view to extremes, while handily discarding the fact that a true libertarian with morals would not let their choices harm others.

So Biden SHOULD be acting strongly on the safety net and on decarbonizing - most people want that and it does the most good, even though the GOP's leaders don't wanna.

Same with vaccines - you don't want a shot? Fine. Expect less convenience in your life based on your choice."

The vaccine is incredibly well understood at this point to be safe and effective (see the proportion of deaths occurring are now 1 pct. vaccinated, 99 unvaccinated). So the administration is trying to force people to do something that's 1. safe, 2. for their own good, and 3. has a community benefit.

Your brilliant alternative is to let people choose to get sick, and when the chickens come home to roost be stuck with potentially bankrupting levels of medical debt. What a better way to serve the people. Truly Reagan's dream for America."

I’m in favor of mask mandates as long as the under 12 cannot be vaccinated and kids are tested regularly at school.  How is there any question about this."
2021-09-13 14:51:12,"Brett,
With all due respect, those of us who are vaccinated but still wear masks are not merely “busybodies and virtue-signalers.” We are not signaling our “virtue” but (as Gail suggests) we are reminding ourselves and everyone around us that we’re still in a pandemic. It is our social responsibility to take precautions for the health of everyone. If you see virtue in that, well, great.

Also, your comment about the effects of Covid-related hospitalizations suggests that it’s not a big deal if the “surgeries that are being put off are mainly elective.” Well, “elective” surgeries aren’t all nose jobs and tummy tucks. This category includes anything scheduled, such as surgery to remove a cancerous tumor or open a blocked artery. “Elective” doesn’t mean “not medically necessary,” FYI. 

While I agree that “people shouldn’t expect someone else to bail them out of their terrible health decisions,” this is exactly what our health care system does (cigarette, anyone?). 
What is inexcusable is when one person’s terrible health decision affects the health of others…like, second hand smoke or spreading a deadly infectious disease. There are rules to prevent this, and they should be enforced, for the good of everyone."
2021-09-13 14:52:07,"We too often forget that Freedom also carries Responsibility. If a person can get vaccinated and chooses not to, then they need to take responsibility for that freedom. If you get Covid and could have been vaccinated, please don't go to our hospitals. Your ""freedom"" is overwhelming the system. Your ""freedom"" is denying others in need.
I sometimes think that better than a vaccine mandate would be a ""hospital mandate."" Only a certain percentage of beds could be allocated to unvaccinated patients(not including those unable to be vaccinated, of course). Hospital staff wouldn't be so overwhelmed. Others who were responsible would be able to get the needed care.
If medicare and insurance stop paying for unvaccinated patients, then the hospitals pick up much of the bill. Smaller hospitals already struggle. We need our hospitals and we need our hospital workers.
Oh yeah, freedom also ends when it adversely effects the well being of others...but that's another story."
2021-09-13 14:52:35,"Gail- I am surprised you see people wearing masks in your vaccinated part of the world as anything but a reaction to the spread of the Delta variant and numerous reported cases of breakthrough infections.

In my corner of the mostly-vaccinated world, masks came off for a few weeks back in June-July and then went back on again last month. Not by mandate but rather by people being prudent about risk for now."

2021-09-13 14:53:48,"Perhaps Mr. Stephens should start reading the NYTimes, especially the Article in this issue: ""‘Their Crisis’ Is ‘Our Problem’: One State Grapples With Another’s Covid Cases."" It illustrates perfectly how serious the current problems is, well beyond his trivial description as a ""a nincompoop-health crisis."" People who do not get the vaccine infect  others, they refuse to wear masks and and as a result are even more effective in infecting others. They tax the medical system to extremes and take a disproportionate amount of medical services resulting in others needing care for a variety of serious illnesses to be denied services.  This continues to be a national crisis and could easily escalate again with the possibility of new variants. We should stop the political nonsense and be unequivocal in insisting on vaccines, and work as a community to protect  one another. I wholeheartedly agree with Biden's actions."
2021-09-13 14:54:13,"The tangled web continues. 

We are suffering from Covid Wars, Mask Wars, and now the Booster Battle.   

 The ongoing fights and gaps in all of the above create more opportunities for cases of Long Covid to grow, no doubt about it.   

 The next epidemic of Long Covid is rarely addressed in the media. There is a severe lack of data but the debilitating symptoms of Long Covid are numerous, chronic, and serious. 

 We have relatives who are young, healthy professionals with debilitating Long Covid conditions on medical leave now with an uncertain and painful future.  ( they contracted Covid before the vaccine)  They live in CA and are very lucky to have the best medical care money can buy but they cannot buy their way out of Long Covid.

Disability payments due to Long Covid will drain Social Security even more.   I wish our politicians and public health leaders would see the full picture and take the ""long"" view on this pending crisis.  Not likely though given the current state of affairs.   

 Our country as a whole won't even look at the real-world data in Israel in a timely and clear fashion.   The data has been there for months.  Israel has the highest vaccination rate in the world and is struggling with cases of Covid breakthrough.  
 
We have so much infighting state by state we are imploding."

Going unvaccinated impinges on the freedom of others by exposing them to the virus, is an unwarranted  cost upon  our economy, potentially leads to new variants that are resistant to the available vaccine, and is no different from vaccine requirements for children going to school."
2021-09-13 14:55:48,"Bret,  I don’t know where you are getting your sunny view of how well the health care system is doing, but Idaho is out of ICU beds and is shipping patients next door to Washington, which is already strained in the eastern part of the state in particular. People are dying of non-COVID condition because they are unable to get ICU care. Breakthrough infections of the vaccinated are on the rise, and while not usually life-threatening, can be serious, especially in vulnerable individuals. As Gail said, no one is being held down and forcibly vaccinated. But the unvaccinated will need to test frequently and may not be able to enjoy all the privileges of being in public spaces where they can infect others.  This is not just a matter deciding about one’s own health— it’s the fact that every unvaccinated person can be a reservoir for development of a new variant, can spread disease to others and threaten the community as a whole. Get a clue."
2021-09-13 14:57:06,"The notion that the only people the unvaccinated hurt are themselves is not true. The variants like Delta emerge from mutations of the virus. If we could shut down more transmission, we might save each other from more infectious and deadly variants."
2021-09-13 14:58:17,"Of course the pandemic is political, as is rightly the case.

Science can advise, but science cannot decide. The reason is that fighting the pandemic continues to require us to balance two good things that will always be in fundamental tension with each other:  minimizing the transmission of the virus versus producing the goods and services we all need for life.

Threading that needle is the role of politics, for at its roots, politics is about reconciling conflicting interests.

Our problem continues to stem from Donald J. Trump and the misinformation he trumpeted:  the pandemic would be over by Easter 2020; it's just the flu; bleach might help;  ultraviolet light kills the virus (no practical points on how to get the UV light inside you once you were infected).  Trump's lunacy still holds sway over much of the world.

Imagine an alternative history:  rational use of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as distancing and masking were widely understood and practiced; vaccines were embraced as a technological God-send; and people knew we were all in it for the long haul.

Imagine.
So,"
2021-09-13 11:43:22,"Please, please stop calling Biden's directive a vaccine mandate.  The most irksome part of this action to the unmasked, unvaccinated and frankly untethered Republicans is the requirement set by OSHA for employers of more than 100 people to TEST their employees weekly.

The employees may avoid swabs in noses weekly by getting vaccinated.  That's the choice in play.

And, BTW, I would have the employees pay for the testing by docking their wages.  Having the costs borne by the employer or, worse yet, passed through in higher prices for the customer makes the vaccinated pay for the dalliance of the holdouts."
2021-09-13 15:04:34,"I'd love to be able to tell the difference on the street between those who ""deserve"" to wear masks, according to Bret, and those who are ""virtue-signaling"" in some way that offends him.  The problem is, if you're offended by somebody wearing a mask, that's all it is.  You're literally offended by something which is actually a virtue.

Not something I'd be particularly proud of, but then again I'm not a Republican."
2021-09-13 15:05:29,"Bret's thinking about masking is emblematic of what's wrong with most of the mask- and vaccine-resisters: Considering only personal, individual benefits.

He's fine with immunocompromised folks wearing masks, but those of us who, like me, wear them to protect other people are  ""busybodies or virtue-signalers.""

Like far too many people, Bret completely misses a key point: A public health emergency requires community-level thinking and concern, not simply a calculation of individual risk."
2021-09-13 15:06:03,"""is to refuse to allow Medicare or Medicaid to pay their medical bills in the event they become seriously ill. Private health insurers might also follow suit.""

As a physician, we can not deny care.  If the hospital doesn't get paid, they go bankrupt and close as they have in many of the states that refused to expand Medicaid.

""I don’t see the latest Covid spike as the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago.""

The Covid spike now is more regional, with areas with lower vaccination rates having worse numbers that a year ago. And 1500 deaths per day is not a number you can ignore, especially since it is now happening in younger people.
 
""as anti-vaxxers are mostly putting themselves at serious risk of getting seriously ill, I don’t see the need for a presideyountial directive, including the renewed mask mandates""

Antivaxxers are putting those unable to get the vaccine and those with underlying conditions at risk.  

""people, particularly the immunocompromised, who have a solid medical or emotional need to take great precautions, including masks, and I totally respect them. The busybodies and virtue-signalers, not so much.""

The mask does not significantly reduce your risk of getting the disease (10-20% max) if you wear it.  It reduces your spread of the virus via aerosol droplets, if you are infected, by 74%.  Since vaccinated people can still get the disease and spread it even if they are asymptomatic, all should where masks.  

Very poor column from Bret."

He says they are o lay endangering themselves but that’s not true! I don’t want a mild break through and then long Covid. Why not just acknowledge that the anti Covid valets are doing this for some misguided political vision. Or worse, as Christians who see Covid, like climate change, as signs of the coming rapture. Start from there : they are ignorant and want to impose their beliefs on the rest of us. Then let’s hear the argument."

People aren’t wearing masks to “virtue signal”, Bret.  They want this pandemic to end sooner rather than later. Why you oppose that, or feel the need to project people’s motives, is beyond me."
2021-09-13 14:05:21,"The Republican Party agenda since Carter has been to delegitimize any Democratic president.  Clinton turned toward the middle and got himself impeached.  Obama was some sort of foreigner and a secret Muslim.  Biden didnt really win the election.  

Republicans will believe just about anything that makes Biden look bad.  They willingly believe that Democratic presidents are incompetents and diabolical plotters at the same time, which makes no sense.  Having contradictory attributes is a sign of evil, and assigning contradictory attributes to someone else is a sign of being out of touch with reality.  

Biden can pursue any course he wants; he will be demonized for something or other no matter what he does.  Republicans do not have a platform to stand on these days; their own victory is all they stand for.  

Bret does not consider global warming a serious problem, and wants it dealt with in a way that does not increase government power or reduce the power of the monied.  He is willfully out of touch with reality in this, but refuses to go whole hog and become a Trumpie.  Whether this refusal is a matter of real principle or a ploy to retain credibility with the NYT audience he writes for is not very important; either way he is helping divide the opposition to Trump."

But these same people shouldn’t expect someone else to bail them out of their terrible health decisions.”

Picture this Bret - critically ill people lying on the sidewalk outside of hospitals because they are unvaccinated and can’t afford the estimated bill for treatment.  Not going to happen, of course.  
But, you say, let them in and have them pay for care.  Well, if they survive, that might work for those who can afford it.  Otherwise, the cost of “free” care is borne by the rest of us through taxes, increased insurance premiums and higher medical costs generally.  I thought you Repubs knew all this “economy stuff”."
2021-09-13 11:27:25,"Bret seems to be thinking in sound bites. 

If Medicare doesn't pay for the tens of thousands of willingly unvaccinated COVID patients, then who pays for their hospital stays? 

These are conservatives, Bret, from Red States. That means they are takers, not makers. They have no resources. The wealthy Red Staters are as vaccinated as we are. They just lie about it. 

I guess we could throw  these poor people out in the street, while chanting ""let them die"". What Republican debate did people start chanting that slogan at anyway? Whatever it was, Bret was a GOPer in good standing then. 

But that doesn't seem right either. 

BTW--this is still a real health crisis. Blue State Washington is taking Red State Idaho's COVID patients as we speak. Idaho can't handle them anymore. While Red State Mississippi denounces Biden for imposing mandates exactly like those imposed by Mississippi on its school children for decades--except Biden's vaccine mandates are much more limited. 

The only Republican justification for this seems to be ""our base is crazy so we have to pander"". No you don't. Man up and become patriots again. Get on the Biden bandwagon. Support the vaccine mandates.

New York Metro is a lot different than most of country. Subways, buses, elevators and crowded office's. They were hit faster. Where in the hinterlands it was more spread out leaving people to say what virus?  

DeBlasio ordered city workers back to the office. Right or wrong? Again not an easy call. But if you look at the top down power structure of the left. Don't those workers know their place? They don't think it's over but who are they to think in a perfect world.

DeBlasio is about as far left as you can get. New York is about as close to our dream of ""The Shining City on the Hill"", except for maybe cities like San Francisco. So how dare they question DeBlasio? Hasn't he consulted with best minds of science and medicine? Don't they know they're in good hands? Shouldn't they just obey?

There is a deep inconsistency in that argument. Mississippi has some of the strictest vaccine mandates in the nation, which have not drawn opposition from most of its elected officials. Not only does it require children to be vaccinated against measles, mumps and seven other diseases to attend school, but it goes a step further than most states by barring parents from claiming “religious, philosophical or conscientious” exemptions.

We are all frustrated and angry with people who refuse to get vaccinated, keep us from attaining herd immunity and increase the likelihood of a more virulent variant infecting us.  But denying them insurance coverage?  We are all concerned about high and rising insurance premiums, but denying coverage to people who get hurt when drunk?

About a quarter of PhDs are in the no-covid-vax-no-way group.

Writing from a land where free-at-point-of-service healthcare is a right, it is also dismaying to see Bret argue that a large share of the US population, and a quarter of American PhDs, should have their Medicare terminated for holding a view of Covid vaccines that is different from his.

I have a elderly friend who told me last Fall, when we met,  they didn't believe in masks. I was told he yesterday he might have COVID-19 now. When I mentioned that they may be unvaccinated to another person, I was told not to judge. This explains what we are up against as we try to get people to respond to the science and experts. 

Oddly, and I am Pro Life, it seems the ones not wanting to do the only three things we have as tools to beat this virus  are saying they should have control of their bodies. These are usually the same people wanting to limit access to abortion. Regarding any medical intervention, I am for informed consent. We live in a state of contradictions. 

Politically we also live in a state of contradictions as well. Many people who voted for Donal Trump would never tolerate his words and actions for their children or people with which they wanted to be around. I had to laugh when someone was critical of Joe Biden for swimming nude when we have recordings of Trump bragging about his thoughts on women and what he said about John McCain.

We are in the middle of a nationwide pandemic we should have been out of by now. The U.S. has fallen to the least-vaccinated country of the wealthy G7s… it's beyond inexcusable and embarrassing. I'm thrilled Biden issued mandates; I think he should have done it sooner. If the populace is going to act like children then they are going to be treated as such. 

Secondly, from almost everyone I talk to and every comment I read, this ""Afghanistan debacle"" is media-fueled. No one else thinks it's a debacle and everyone commends Biden for being the only president in 20 years to have the backbone to get us out of there.

""Failed Presidency"" headlines sell newspapers. No one in the real world thinks that."
2021-09-13 13:26:33,"Wow, I actually find myself agreeing with Bret on most of the stuff he's saying here.  No, Medicaid/Medicare should not be paying for nincompoopery, and neither should Blue Cross/Blue Shield.  They made their beds with their ridiculous refusal on vaccines; let them lie in them.  What are we up to?  177 million fully vaccinated?  Are the hospitals full of people with vaccine side effects?  No.

And as for the super big monster $3.5 Trillion with a really big T spending bill, yes, trim it down, if that's what it takes, break it up into a few smaller pieces, if those pieces can stand on their own merit (if they can't, they shouldn't be in there to begin with), and take the sticker shock out of this thing.  

But as for simply getting things done, I think the President and the Democratic leaders of Congress realize that their window is short, and if they don't get it done by the end of the year, it won't get done at all.  This means thinking big.  If it were me in the Oval Office, I would target Guantanamo Bay next, and dare Congress to do anything about it.  And then I would give it back to Cuba."
2021-09-13 13:29:40,"I think the anti-vaxers have to live more honestly. If they are against FDA approved life-saving vaccines, then they need to insist that children also will no longer get vaccinated against polio, measles, mumps, whooping cough, pneumonia, flu, etc. If they don't trust western medicine, then it seems foolish to go to doctors or a hospital when sick. They need to stay home when sick. With this new level of anti-vaxer honesty it would be an exciting time for schooling and education. In the interest of choice, we could establish separate anti-vaxer and pro-vaxer schools. Of course experimental schools would also be permitted, schools where the opposed-to-health-care and in-favor- of-health-care families mix freely. We missed a chance to pretty much wipe out the COVID virus when vaccines became available. Now thousands a day are contracting the virus and passing it on and creating the perfect climate for more and more mutations. But, we are resourceful Americans who believe in free choice, right! So let's go with free choice regardless of consequences and even expand on it. Separate schools, churches, festivals, community centers, sports teams, neighborhoods, etc. for  anti-vaxers and pro-vaxers. This way everyone gets to choose the society they want to live in and no one has to even think about the responsibilities that go with living in a free, democratic country. Enough with the idea of a social contract and responsibility.  Free choice for all regardless of consequences."

All of this means that care that we take for granted — from cancer care to orthopedics to basic prevention — is unavailable. The ramifications of all of this will last for at least a decade.

I think this is a great opportunity to show that those who deny reality are harming others and themselves. If one is rational, then that is the lesson of Covid. That many people will choose to suffer because their cult leaders want them to, just like they always have. Except this time the results are obvious and severe for those who deny the truth.

Everyone that refuses to do so without a vaild medical reason threatens the safety and wellbeing of everbody else.

Here in the real world, fully vaccinated people, many with pre-existing conditions or with well-founded concerns about the transmissibility of the Delta variant, are still unable to live their lives normally. And just on the other side of the NY Times website front page, one sees this story about how the abject failure to address Covid in Idaho is leading to massive spillover problems in the healthcare system in Washington state. That is why a federal vaccination mandate is important.

The entirety of Biden's policy decisions are due to one vote.  C'mon man.

As before, Stephens ignores changing circumstances and contexts.   Long range thinking is what he read yesterday.  Breadth of thinking?  Well, there isn't any.

I can't understand why he dislikes Trump.  They're two peas in a pod."

Biden could do everything right and the Stephens would still find fault due to him being a partisan hack. President Biden implemented the mandate because there are some Americans who are acting like petulant  adolescents and somehow equate freedom with spreading a deadly virus.  The Republican party is of nihilist who would rather see Covid-19 spread through the nation then admit the a Democratic president is right. 

I suggest Bret familiarize himself  with Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), tin which the Supreme Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. The Court's decision articulated the view that individual liberty is not absolute and is subject to the police power of the state."

The world is reeling now due to Delta -- a mutation from original Covid.  And the more human bodies that process this virus, the more likely another, worse, mutation arrives, and erupts.

Covid-19 isn't ""the big one.""  The big one is Covid with a 17% mortality rate, and among healthy 30-year-olds.  That's not theoretical -- that's Hong Kong 2003.  The only reason we beat it is that symptoms showed up in 36 hours, not 14 days.  Shut everything down, and beat the virus.

And I think you need to define your concept of ""elective"" for everyone.  Follow up surgeries for serious operations?   Removal of painful gallstones?  Surgery for a problem that is not going to kill you now, but is getting worse and worse (and is likely to kill you if it keeps getting worse).  Just what to you mean by ""elective"", Bret?"

Think of Covid-19 infected folks as replicating glitter bombs. If you are vaccinated, it’s annoying to clean up at best with slight odds it’ll overwhelm you.

And sometimes the glitter changes so that potentially you can’t clean it up and it overwhelms you.

COVID-19, like glitter, can’t get cleaned up if we’re constantly introducing more of it and making versions more pernicious in avoiding the vacuum.

As many folks as possible need to vaccinated or the glitter bombs keep going off all around us.t"

 For the anti-vaxxers, I don't think it is hyperbole to declare they now want their virus and spread it too.  By now, I believe virtually everyone in this country knows the virus is highly contagious and while they may not get sick, that is no guarantee those they infect couldn't  become extremely sick and die. But apparently the spreaders don't care. 

So perhaps they should slightly modify their actions since they seem totally unwilling to change their attitudes. Stay home. Don't expect to go to work. Your co-workers don't want you around. And if you go broke because you've lost your source of income, just remember the other old saying.

Also, the overcrowding of hospitals effects everyone. Let’s not forget about the potential impact of the Covid spike on the economy (jobs report last month fell way short of expectations).

2021-09-13 13:23:25,The only issue I have with the mandates that Biden announced is I do not think they go far enough.  I would suggest that Medicare not cover unvaccinated adults and that hospital be required to give vaccinated patients priority.  Why should the rest of us pay the huge unnecessary medical bills of those that refuse to be vaccinated.  Any Federal employee that refused to be vaccinated should be summarily terminated and banned from applying for Federal employment.  Those of us that did the right thing and got vaccinated have suffered enough.  People have lost jobs and had their lives turned upside down due to a minority of ignorant people.  Enough is enough.
2021-09-13 14:25:43,"Bret, these conversations are revealing an increasing incoherence in your stated positions.  Biden risks ""division"" (love this argument by the right!) by mandating vaccines/tests, but Medicare should not pay for anti-vaxxers who get sick?  That's a catastrophe.  Biden should be the ""unifier"" he promised, but you call millions of Americans ""nincompoops""?  I agree, but that doesn't sound like unity.  And you rattle off problems of California, which are large, complex, and widely shared nationally, and want Biden to be a ""moderate""?  You need to spend more time at the movies and then think this all through."

There should be no question of the constitutionality of vaccine mandates."

George Washington had a small pox vaccine mandate for the troops for goodness sake.

Every school child in every State is vaccinated by mandate against a half dozen or more diseases non of which are nearly as contagious or deadly as COVID 19. 

As to using OSHA and other agencies to compel vaccination... 

How do you think we got the drinking age to 21? Federal Government withheld all highway funds from any State that refused to raise their drinking age.

We did the same thing back when we had mandatory 55 national speed limit.

This is nothing new. 

It is nothing weird. 

It is NOT some Totalitarian Unconstitutional Infringement on Your Rights.

This is a matter of Public Health.

If you don't want to be vaccinated you need to work from home and buy your groceries on Amazon.

I'm a Bernie Bro, but Bret shakes my faith in the workability of Democratic governance, as intended, when he lists their glaring failures in California: a housing crisis, a homelessness crisis, an affordability crisis, an addiction crisis, a pension crisis, a schooling crisis, a power-outage crisis, a wildfires crisis, a water-shortage crisis. That is daunting, eye-opening even, when you stare at just those ugly existential problems.

Of course, Republicans' solutions would be to shrink government, to do even less, let capitalism solve any and all solvable problems, and let the devil take the hindmost: ""It's not government's job to provide everything that's needed to all the people, all the time."" Sink or swim is their overriding mentality. (Just feel that freedom as your family goes to bed hungry every night, if they have a bed to go.)

For those in other areas in the country where Delta hasn’t hit yet - just wait, you will be glad your state took the restrictions it did. Delta is taking down younger and healthier people.

2021-09-13 13:56:52,"Regarding Freedom during a pandemic --

As to adults:
1905 (Jacobson v. State of Massechusetts) - The Supreme Court ruled that Americans ""[M]ay be compelled, by force if needed, against his will and without regard, to his personal wishes or his pecuniary interests, or even his religious convictions, ..."" 

Further - ""It is not, therefore, true that the power of the public to guard itself against imminent danger depends in every case involving the control of one's body upon his willingness to submit to reasonable regulations established by the constituted authorities, under the sanction of the State, for the purpose of protecting the public collectively against such danger.”

Implication?  The exercise of an individual's right is not supported when that action harms or even kills another.  Example:  The 2nd Amendment is not unlimited, nor is its exercise free from accountability and responsibility.

As to children:
In 2002, (applying the 1922 Zucht v. King Supreme Court ruling) ""a federal district court declined to find an exemption to mandatory vaccinations laws for 'sincerely held religious beliefs' or a fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning medical procedures of their children."""

2021-09-13 10:46:51,"Brett seems to forget that there is an entire population that is harmed by the anti-vaxxers which is kids under 12 (and kids over it whose parents refuse to let them get it). It is why I who is vaccinated and hate masks started wearing them again. Not to virtue signal but because we have a large group who are at risk. 

And additionally, all the people who are taking up beds in hospitals for covid that they could have vaccinated themselves against, are also harming anyone with any of the many other ways to get ill --who can't get help because all the beds being taken by the dopes. 

The parent of my child's friend is dope, if she or her ex- husband get it it is on them but their child (who wants to get it but can't is a innocent victim).

2021-09-13 12:08:22,"The origin of Federal Government mandating vaccines goes back to President George Washington. As General of the Continental Army, he mandated all his troops be inoculated for small pox. That success inspired President Washington to mandate vaccines for small pox for children before they went to school. The Preamble of our Constitution recognizes that the promotion of the general Welfare is part of what it takes to promote a more Perfect Union. President Biden's Covid-19 vaccine mandates are well within American tradition and history."

He knows full well that there is little in the Western tradition that allows full, anarchic freedoms, without a consideration of harm to others or infringements or constraints on their freedom to make choices.  So, I don't vaccinate.  I may catch Covid.  I may spread to others.  I may show severe symptoms.  I may go to hospital.  I may take up scarce hospital beds.  Others may get sick and die. Let freedom ring.  No.  It's not civil libertarianism, Stephens.  Of course, these ""freedoms"" are solidly embedded in our economic thinking. We warn against them!  There are shirkers, free riders, defectors, all of whom engage in actions designed to enhance their welfare (or utility) while passing the costs to others.  There's a lot of that in 21st C. America.  And the point of the economic theory and the regulation that follows is how do you handle these whack jobs because they add grotesque inefficiencies and harm to our public lives.  I hate to break the news to Stephens, but if a manufacturer pollutes and kills people we sanction them by directing them to pay damages and agree not to pollute.  So, we won't compel someone to get the vaccine?  One more point.  Mr. Stephens is not up on an extensive literature in evolutionary biology.  Human groupings engage in ""altruistic punishment."" The group protects itself.  It is an adaptive evolutionary response to ensure survival."

But little consolation that will bring as even more get sick and die."

As far as the vaccination plans are going, we were doing great as a country and then the (mostly) red states decided they weren't going to get vaccinated.  Biden's fault?  

And if it is his doing (or undoing), is it at least possible that disgusted Trump voters saw their lack of vaccination as a political choice to either stymie Biden's success or cling to the idea that the election was stolen from ""their guy""?"

Right about Newsom's stupidity in having dinner unmasked at the French Laundry, but many of the problems on his watch are hardly his fault, such as wild fires and the homelessness crisis, which was caused by Prop 13, a similar populist proposition. There's sluggish turnover in homes in California because a newly purchased home is taxed at today's tax rate. New homeowners are paying inflated rates to support the needs of the older homeowners whose rate has remained steady for decades. When my grandson went for a sleepover in Hillsborough, one of the wealthier SF suburbs, he and his friend slept in the dining room. His friend decides each night where he's going to sleep, he doesn't have a bedroom. There are  three generations, including cousins, living in a single home, and they adapt.

No one is legally required to be vaccinated nor to get a drivers license, but failure to do so limits their public mobility under the law. It is still fundamentally a matter of individual choice:  public access when vaccinated, or quarantine upon rejection of the vaccine.

Furthermore, it must be pointed out to the public-at-large that the anti-vaxxer movement is in large measure a series of business enterprises driven by about 12 major operators. These operators are in the business of selling fake anti-COVID remedies. A recent study analyzed 812,000 posts extracted from Facebook and Twitter. Researchers found that 65 per cent of all posts could be traced back to 12 accounts representing major anti-vaccine personalities including Joseph Mercola, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Ty and Charlene Bollinger, among others, most of whom have a significant financial interest in the anit-vaccine effort..

WRONG! This isn't some cute affectation. This is virtue signaling and it's NOT a victimless act. It actively dissuades resistant people from getting vaxxed. Why get the shot if nothing changes? And post vax mask wearing is NOT based on science at all! Joe Biden: “Only 1 out of every 160,000 fully vaccinated Americans was hospitalized for COVID per day"". He further said that we are in an “epidemic of the unvaccinated”. Indeed, that is what all the data show. 99% of the hospitalizations and more than 99% of the deaths from the Delta variant are among the unvaccinated. If you have a reasonably healthy immune system and are vaccinated the pandemic is over. Moreover, unvaccinated kids in any given area represent a consistent low percentage of total Covid cases in that area. This has held steady since January and includes the Delta wave. Thus, there are very few young kids in high vaccination areas, like New York or Massachusetts, who are seriously ill or die. Vaccinated people 12 and up with healthy immune systems, and kids under 12 with healthy immune systems who live in high vaccination areas, must be allowed to resume a normal, mask free life."

The condescension in this comment is appalling: we're having 1600 deaths per day.

(This disinformation included outlandish paranoia about microchips, but also more dangerous disinformation: that 'natural immunity' is better, that the vaccines are risky, that only the most vulnerable need the vaccines. Or simply the political message that the campaign to get everyone vaccinated is government overreach.

Well, Bret, right now a lot of people who did the right thing, got vaccinated, keep a mask on in public places, are waiting in line that keeps getting jumped by the nincompoops. 

I practiced in a non-Covid era. Those who work in hospitals are exhausted, and even before this were often asked to work ungodly hours and shifts. Their service is remarkable. But they are burning out and will leave, not only because of Covid, but because we have a way to prevent Covid now and millions refuse to take the vaccine or even cover their face, while those outside medical campuses are partying away, many without a care.

And has she not taken up an ICU bed, thereby denying it to a stroke victim who has to be driven from hospital to hospital seeking care… and dies? These are real and not rare events. I am sure you know this. If so, why do you give good breath to these arguments? 
And if I politely ask, say, a maskless waiter or nurse if they are vaccinated, I am not being a “busybody?”"

Centrist moderation is not mealy compromise - socially liberal/fiscally conservative is the most consistent policy umbrella there is. It derives from Hobbes, Locke, and the Enlightenment and it can , by definition, unite. It is the former mantra of Wm Clinton, Al From, and Al Gore.

The unvaccinated with the resources to pay for care, the 'nincompoops of means,' are just fine taking up the beds and sucking up medical resources, denying others surgery and treatment that is often life-saving. Because the nincompoops can pay for it.

Just withhold the Medicaid. That'll teach the undeserving!

Rationing of medical care will be a fact because of scarcity of resources, especially as medical staff burns out, quits, and moves to other, less draining forms of service. That's a reality.

First, children: Those under 12 years of age is unable to receive an approved COVID vaccination and at risk of contracting it. The risk increases exponentially if COVID is truly allowed to run rampant. I've got a three year old and am worried what would happen to him should he become infected. Not to mention that it could easily spread to his classmates, school staff, and (potentially immunocompromised) family members.

1 - The delta variant is so virulent that unvaccinated people can pass it along to someone else more easily than a vaccinated person.  To be fair vaccinated people can pass it along too, and some even grasp at that straw to defend not getting vaccinated.  But the virus finds a much more hospitable host in an unvaccinated person, and can thrive much more easily in an unvaccinated nasal passage
2 - every time there is a successful transmission, the odds of a new mutation that can avoid the vaccine’s defenses gets higher.  The more unvaccinated people there are the more successful transmissions there are.  The more successful transmissions the higher the probability of a new variant that sends our vaccination program back to square zero.

It isn’t about personal choice, and like Gail, I want a president who is more than a cheerleader for vaccines.

They are more interested in punishments than solving the roots of the problem in the first place. It almost seems like that they enjoy being cruel. So, no gun control, instead heavily arm the police that can kill at will. No diplomacy, just wars. No support for common good like affordable education, job security, decent wages, secure retirement, worry free healthcare etc., but fill up the prisons with desperate citizens who have committed petty crimes out of abject hopelessness, that is if the militarized police hasn’t already shot them dead!"

Over 650,000 have died but people are still arguing about ""freedom"" while the virus just keeps spreading.

She replied that there are a lot of awful Americans who aren't getting vaccinated. Talk about a non-sequitur. OK, so she doesn't care about those poor people who are coming here to LIVE, and she doesn't care if they die. Gee. I wasn't talking politics. I was in church, and they are Children of God, as the late Sen John McCain called them. What do we do about the unvaccinated Americans? Well, we need to help them, too, to see the truth and get vaccinated. My young exterminator, 26, refuses. The two young guys who installed carpet in my bedroom won't get it. They're not Republicans.

I have no patience with folks who refuse to be vaccinated or wear masks. In my day, such folks would have been quarantined.

Two of my early and fully vaccinated friends got a breakthrough case of covid several days after finding out they sat next to two UNvaccinated people at a memorial service.  

God only knows how many more they infected that we don't know about because no one wants to reveal they are positive.

2021-09-13 15:31:47,"Bret continues to speak nonsense. The Democrats need to pass every piee of legislation they can as fast as they can. If they lose one or both chambers we'll get nothing. Republicans want government to always be broken so they can run on that issue. Broken government emboldens their party and depresses democrat leaning voters-- especially young ones -- and that helps the GOP.

What does the GOP do right away when they are in control? Assuage their supporters with tax cuts and judge ships. The Democrats need to do the same, but they can't coalesce around the vision of HELPING People because there are Senators and House members who fear the SOCIALIST label. 

Low information, emotional voters shouldn't have the control that they have, but they do. So now the Dems need to just do it all, FDR style."

In fact, many of the jobs where increases will occur are related to dining out and taking care of the elderly.

Mr Stephens should know these things - we need green jobs to mitigate greenhouse gases, and the working class in this country deserve to be compensated for all the shortcomings brought on by excessive greed. Without Biden’s plan, the climate will get much worse, and much of the remaining opportunities for good jobs will go only to the children of the wealthy. Not a formula for success."
2021-09-13 15:38:18,"Sending a bunch of uninsured people to ERs already under enormous stress is not a helpful alternative to a vaccine mandate.  Hospitals will treat them. They will pay a reduced fee.  And maybe not pay if they already have bad credit.  We'll all pay for it in higher medical costs downstream, and even more over-worked front line responders and Drs. 

Also, a large reservoir of unvaccinated people is a society wide problem.  Viruses mutate - like Delta.  Next one could be worse.  The more people vaccinated now the less likely that happens.

Sorry to say it, but classic libertarian answers to complex social health problems are typically uninformed and/or naive"
2021-09-13 15:40:13,"I'll never understand why ""sophisticated libertarian"" anti-vaxxers like Bret don't understand that their failure to vaccinate themselves endangers lots of other people - like my asthmatic 4 year old grandson and my 89 year old great uncle who, although vaccinated, would almost surely succumb to a breakthrough infection.  Also, continuing to spread the disease as the non-vaccinated do,  just gives this virus more opportunity to replicate into a strain that overcomes the protection of current vaccines.  I suspect they do understand that, they just don't care.  So much of Bret's faux freedom mindset is simply, "" I could not care less about anyone other than me"" dressed up with nice words."

Like many situations, judging others based on assumptions can be incredibly harmful, or in this case, deadly.  I’m a healthy 51 year-old with 1) a parent with rapidly advancing blood cancer, 2) a brother who teaches a class of unvaccinated third graders and 3) a best friend whose parent was diagnosed with a terminal/untreatable brain tumor two months ago.  I imagine that many people are like me, seemingly healthy people who wear masks everywhere to protect their friends and relatives and everyone else in the community who is at great risk if they contract Covid.  Does that make me a busybody or virtue-signaler?"
2021-09-13 15:41:06,"Two problems with what Bret Stephens said. First, withdrawing health insurance from people who have refused the vaccine and end up hospitalized with COVID-19 is a sure bet hospitals  and some physicians will go bankrupt. The costs would be so high that most would not be able to afford them, and won’t pay for their care. You can’t get water from a stone, as they say. Second, stopping elective surgery because of the overwhelming demand to treat COVID patients is no trivial matter. Just because someone needs elective surgery does not mean they are not suffering. How would you like to wait indefinitely to have a joint replacement so you walk again, or cataract surgery so you could see again. Many surgeons’ practices specialize on doing elective surgery. Having to stop those surgeries would be economically catastrophic to them."
2021-09-13 15:42:44,"I am with Bret on this one. He captures the balance I feel between civil liberties and trying to get people to do the right thing.

As to Gail and getting rid of masks - my read on Delta is that the vaccine is necessary but not sufficient, so even though I am vaccinated I still wear a mask and will continue to do so for the near future. It is worth remembering that one out of ten vaccinated people are still capable of catching the bug and unknowingly spreading it due to lack of symptoms."
2021-09-13 15:43:13,"Biden's grip on Washington is in trouble because he never had one. The real power is Nancy Pelosi, who continues her long-standing course of making life difficult for the Democratic Party.  Now she is holding up Biden's infrastructure bill. Had the bill been passed by the House this summer, Biden would have had a signature win just as he was confronting the Covid surge and the Taliban coup. If the House flops next year and Biden is a one-term President, much of the blame will be with Nancy Pelosi, who could have granted Biden a much-needed win. The wound to Biden is a deep one that has many wondering who is truly in charge. What is clear is that Pelosi is more fixed on maintaining her power than on supporting her President. She has become the Republican's not-so-secret weapon."

Both are owned and operated by Wall St. and the rich. So far, it looks as if Biden is playing a kabuki game in which he sort of pretends he's ""progressive,"" always knowing that Manchin and Sinema have been well bought to keep him from actually being ABLE to follow through.

No, count me as one, who although not immunocompromised, has a solid emotional need to take certain precautions, including wearing a mask, so as not to have a breakthrough infection, possibly became fatally ill and die.

He hates the vaccine mandate because it is useful, moral, and the work of a Democrat, three things Republicans hate with an unhinged passion. And his claims to be libertarian on the subject don’t hold up under as little scrutiny as just reading his weekly columns.

He sees nothing wrong with more preventable deaths occurring every two days than the total on 9-11.

He repeats the blatant partisan lies that the unvaccinated are basically only putting themselves at risk, that the immunocompromised of all ages just have an emotional need to protect themselves from dangerous oppositional defiant toddlers who won’t get vaccinated, and that mask wearing to protect oneself and others is merely virtue signaling.

He pretends to wish for a successful Biden administration, even as he ankle-bites and undercuts everything Biden says or does. Hint:  there are medications to help with that kind of wild mood swing.

He repeats the counterfactual, Party-approved, attack line that it is Biden, not Republicans’  pathological response to him, that is divisive.

In saying he wouldn’t vote for Trump the next time around he claims “ I’d rather have a president who’s a danger to the economy and national security than one who’s a danger to democracy and national sanity”. His favorite president, Trump, proved to be all those things."

This virus is no joke, and when people compare it to just the flu, they have no idea what they are talking about. It lingers for close to 2 weeks, and you do lose the sense of taste and smell and the malaise is unrelenting. Thats being vaccinated! I would hate to see how we would have felt if we were not vaccinated. Until it hits you, it's everyone else's issue. I've heard this argument over and over again from very smart people; If I get it, it won't be that bad as I'm vaccinated. Baloney. It is that bad, and my heart goes out to the families of those who lost loved ones to this, and the very sick who took a lot longer than 2 weeks to recover. At least we have a commander-in-chief who actually cares about people. He's trying his best to educate those who refuse to acknowledge the intensity of this little virus that does so much damage.

Doctors and nurses are breaking under the “lot of strain”. They did not sign up for daily work in a war zone that was self created through stupidity. And repeated every few months because state government, for political talking points, refuses to protect the health of their own constituents.
Mainly elective surgeries? Like the man who died making the 6pm national news because he had to search seven hospitals in three states before he found one able to accommodate his heart failure condition? Probably not the minimal number you suggest. He was just “lucky enough” to make the news. How many more don’t make the news?
The latest Covid spike is not the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago? Until the next variant is 90% vaccine resistant. Then the little pool of self centered science deniers can be the petri dish that voids all of the hard work getting to a vaccine that is safe & effective, and directly cause thousands more deaths. Based on the pleas from the Biden administration and directly from Joe himself, he will have every right to say, “I told you so.” But that’s not Joe Biden.

Setting limits on their health insurance is absolutely stupid and if they are paying for it probably illegal. What about no insurance for illnesses due to smoking, obesity, drugs? In public health we have struggled to get attention to those behaviors because they contribute far more heavily to the top causes of death and healthcare costs than COVID. 
I am vaccinated and I have friends who are unvaccinated. I have no intention of losing them as friends. It’s time to move on from making the unvaccinated scapegoats for those who are obsessed with forcing everyone to be on the same page. That’s not how life words."

2021-09-13 14:47:16,"Brett, you made so many questionable observations, where to start? First, the main problem with allowing the unvaccinated to roam freely is they are actual incubators. The virus is using these people to keep evolving into more potent and deadly variants. If we keep on the current track, the virus will evolve into a variant that will make the current vaccine useless. Second, to call the end of the current war Biden’s Afghan debacle is as premature as calling his presidency failed. Not only did he manage to evacuate more people in the shortest amount of time ever accomplished by anyone, he is still evacuating people after the Trump/Taliban deadline. That is a miracle, not a debacle. Third, the current Republic Party has shown itself to be a danger to our life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.

Sorry Brett Medicare and Medicaid cannot should not do this. Private insurance, yes they can and should. M&M are social programs and everyone receiving the benefit must be treated the same. Would you suggest that the VA also decline treatment? 

Also, let's not judge Biden after 9 months. He was left with a mess on multiple fronts. 3 little words ""de-fund the police"" cost Dems big time in the last election and could give the majority back to both houses.

Even with the vaccination several of them have become very ill.  

It is our responsibility to our society to help to keep each other safe. Getting the vaccine is just not a huge ask considering the risk others face from those who carry very high viral loads.

2021-09-13 15:53:04,"The siren call of small government seems to cause many R’s to become disoriented and toss out foolish ideas that don’t correspond to the reality on the ground.

Covid safety measures are not a freedom issue, but are public health issues. By their nature, public health issues are anti-democratic because they constrain individuals from complete free-choice. If this were a smallpox epidemic engulfing the populace and people were dying in the streets like used to happen in the bad-old-days, I suspect that the anti-vax rhetoric would magically tone itself down into near non-existence except for those who are eagerly awaiting the rapture.

Instead lots of people are fooling themselves into believing that Covid is not a serious problem and that it is an easily survivable illness. While it is less serious than some contagions, it is plenty dangerous, and it is reasonable for society (i.e. government) to take measures to control it. This involves constraining normal levels of free choice. The truth is that Covid is serious enough that public health measures are warranted and that some moderate limits on absolute liberty are justified.

After all, we still feel obligated to limit our freedom by stopping at red lights, don’t we?"
2021-09-13 15:53:43,"I have thought the same thing, that Medicare, Medicaid, and perhaps even private insurers should not pay for hospital stays for those who could have been vaccinated but chose not to. This should be no problem for those in the ""party of personal responsibility"". If you knowingly assume the risk, yet can externalize much of the costs of a bad outcome, it's easier to assume the risk. Risk certain bankruptcy and it might help vaccine-decliners make the right decision for themselves. The rest of us would benefit from their wise decision as well. That's one that really should be made so."
2021-09-13 15:54:15,"How can a presidency be weak because a president tries to do something important and probably necessary?  That's not logical.  If ""the loyal opposition"" is way off center, then the president remains in the center without moving towards them.  He hasn't moved; he just sees that the means must change. 
 As to vaccine mandates, they'll surely work better than burdening the system with refusal to pay for caring for the unvaccinated.  If not for past mandates, we'd still have polio, smallpox . . . .  The unvaccinated do threaten all of us.  They endanger our children, drag down our economy, hurt our health via variants and overwhelmed hospitals, and keep many older people from getting back to living while they are still alive.

It is not a progressive wish list. It is precision spending for what the country needs to function at this time of demographic change, with Baby Boomers getting older and neglected parts of America, rural and urban, structurally locked out of the labor market.

For instance, the bill puts forth ideas like ACA subsidies, not a refashioning of health care. Similarly, the budget nips and tucks around areas where the health care system has inefficiencies, such as in Black maternal health, our lack of support for caregivers for the elderly and disabled, our lack of investment in community and home care and culturally competent health care. It provides for paid leave for medical crises.

Also the bill should appeal to conservatives, as it effectively offers ""housing choice"" by allowing people from poor areas to move to more economically dynamic areas. It strengthens Community Development Block Grants, allowing local areas to choose how to invest in themselves. It advances access to business loans for minority entrepreneurs and expands broadband access in rural areas. It funds workforce development and job training, which will address the skills gap. It champions education for preschoolers and middle-skilled community college students.

It also invests in new technology to repair the climate. What's not to like?"

The continued spread of the virus, even if it was just limited to the “nincompoops”, also poses the very serious risk of further mutation of the virus to one that is impervious to existing vaccines, putting us all at risk once again. This isn’t fiction, it’s real life, and real people are being seriously affected and killed by the “nincompoops”.

One further thing, Mr. Stephens; this isn’t a vaccine mandate. It’s a testing mandate. Get tested just once a week, OR, get vaccinated.

The red states are unvaccinated and spreading the virus everywhere, hurting what Bret values most, the economy. And (3) it is not universally agreed that inflation is a serious issue. 

The biggest problem, though, is that the NYT and other big media who made tons of money off the Trump reign of terror feel the need to publish outrageous headlines like Bret's prior column. That column and his contributions here are not just inaccurate, but slanted and a cheap hit on Biden, who has only had 7 months to clean up the former guy's mess.

First, isn't the point of Obamacare that every citizen is guaranteed healthcare coverage so that nobody ever again will lose their house and life savings because of illness?

I wasn't vaccinated for measles due to being born prior to the vaccine's creation in '63.  If I contract measles now, should insurance refuse to cover my medical expenses?  I can certainly go be vaccinated with the MMR, now mandatory for most all children and CDC recommended for adults.

Second, I have for all of my adult life - and I'm 65 - paid for top shelf health insurance.  In fact I've paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for those policies.  

I have never spent a single night in the hospital, been to an ER only twice (both times for laboratory related accidents). I use chiropractic and acupuncture which is not covered by even my expensive health insurance and I haven't taken a prescription drug in decades.  I have all my own teeth with no fillings or dental work.

I am an insurance company's dream.  My premiums subsidize other less healthy individuals.  That's how insurance works and I have NEVER complained about helping to fund cancer treatments for smokers, liver transplants for alcoholics or heart disease treatments for the obese.  All of those things are the result, with few exceptions, of poor lifestyle choices yet receive treatment without prejudice, paid by insurance."

They are also risking the lives of those who can't get vaccinated, not to mention children under 12. It isn't really that hard a concept to grasp: we get vaccinated partially for ourselves, but primarily for the strength of the herd. It is the same with masks. I continue to wear one not as virtue signaling, but.because in case I have covid and don't know it, I don't want to give it to anyone that isn't vaccinated (yes, even those who are too stupid to protect themselves deserve our protection). Lastly, please drop this ridiculous idea that we just have to make them ""pay the bill"" if they refuse the vaccine. This isn't how medical care works: Whether you like it or not we are all going to be paying the bill for these idiots through higher costs and premiums.

It was post 1964 and the Goldwater campaign that evolution to liberal democracy took place in Quebec and America's two political parties put aside empathy, compassion and freedom in their theologies.

""Otherwise, I don’t see the latest Covid spike as the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago. It’s gone from being a public-health crisis to a nincompoop-health crisis.""

The implication is that the current surge is not as big of a deal because the people getting sick kinda deserve it. But those patients (deserving or not) have overwhelmed an extremely fatigued health care system so that ERs are backed up, ICUs (and PICUs) are full, and some places like FL had ration water to make sure there was enough oxygen to keep the patients in their overflowing hospitals alive. 

Anecdotally at least, there has been quite a large amount of attrition amongst the hospital workers taking care of these sick people, meaning this ""nincompoop-health crisis"" will have some long lasting effects on our health care system."

Buck Turgidson in ""Dr. Strangelove"", who shrugs off the prospect of all-out nuclear war with the Soviet Union,  saying, ""I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed....""

He continues by blaming Gavin Newsom for the effects of global warming (""a power-outage crisis, a wildfires crisis, a water-shortage crisis""), brought to us by conservatives/Republicans who have spent decades denying it exists, then claiming ""We'll adapt!"" to a global disaster, then saying ""It's too late to do anything!""

People have died due to lack of access to a hospital bed. Unvaccinated people were tying up all the beds. To hand-wave it away by saying the surgeries being put off are ""mainly elective"" is absurd. Also, he doesn't seem to understand that the more cases of COVID there are, the more opportunities there are for it to mutate.

Extrapolating from this, we can expect, as vaccinations rise, a new variant that is still more infectious and deadly to the unvaccinated.  Unless of course, those resisters stop resisting and both get the vaccine and start taking sensible precautions.

Which, from the viewpoint of a vaccinated person who believes in following the rules, means we have a self solving problem: either full vaccination of the population or the rapid demise of the remaining resisters.

How about California's many problems given their Democratic grip on government?  No mention of Texas' many problems or Florida's (under Republican ""leadership"").  

How about inflation?  Guess what?  Maybe a little inflation is good for the economy.  Pushes wages higher, especially when people who've been working for slave wages and uncertain hours suddenly refuse to to work that way any longer.  Or older folks suddenly are able to earn a bit more than .8% interest on their hard-fought for savings.

I don’t see the latest Covid spike as the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago. It’s gone from being a public-health crisis to a nincompoop-health crisis.""  The premise that the personal choice to refuse a vaccine has no consequences for others is false.  Breakthrough infections do occur at apparently somewhere around 10 to 20% of those infected.  Given that anti-vaccers frequently also refuse to mask in indoor public spaces, many of these breakthrough cases can undoubtedly be traced to them.  He downplays the strain on the overall medical system, ignoring today's story of an Alabama resident who suffered a heart attack, was turned away from numerous hospitals without space in their ICU's, transferred to a hospital over 200 miles away, and subsequently died.  Mr Stephen's himself suggests that Medicare/Medicaid should refuse to pay for treatment for the willingly unvaccinated, clearly recognizing their choice results in a significant societal cost.  He also assumes that the current peak, which may be declining, makes the public health situation less critical, ignoring that similar beliefs were expressed after the initial peaks.  There is no guarantee this is the end of mutations and outbreaks.  So, the willing choice not to vaccinate affects us all."

This caused all citizens of the U.S. to unite and work towards a common threat. We even started a war that lasted 20 years in hopes of eradicating the threat, safety and security of our country. 

Yet last year when 3,000 U.S. citizens a day were dying from an invading, microscopic virus, we couldn’t get people on the same page concerning how to fight and protect one another. 

Then, a miracle seemed to occur. A vaccine weapon that could completely and unequivocally wipe out this viral enemy, restoring the United States to a land where fear and anxiety no longer dominated.

Yet, that was not to happen. The Republican party decided not to unite behind a message of medical knowledge and vaccine efficacy. Instead they chose to work directly against the best interests of the health and wellbeing of the country. 

I look at the Republicans as those that would aid and abet a terrorist threat. Not in an invading foreign army but in the form of an invading foreign virus. They are a continued threat to the health, safety, and economy of the United States. They, and their followers, should be treated like the public health terrorists they are."

We can only resume the 'experiment' if we replace that rotted fragment.  It has been done before, as the very history of the gop proves.

A mandate to require vaccinations by private businesses, say, airlines, or governments is still the law of the land:

The Supreme Court in 1905 ruled on the right of the state of Massachusetts to mandate and require smallpox vaccinations during an epidemic there.

The Court held that ""in every well ordered society charged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand"" and that ""real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own [liberty], whether in respect of his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be done to others.""

Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. The Court's decision articulated the view that individual liberty is not absolute and is subject to the police power of the state.

You might want to check local data before you declare that this a ""nincompoop-health crisis"".

Hospitals in places like Duval County Florida and Orleans Parish in Louisiana continue to operate beyond full capacity - particular for ICU beds.   As you noted, this is almost all due to unvaccinated people.

As someone who is fully vaccinated and has multiple health issues, I would like to be able to live without worrying if I can get into the hospital  if I need help. 

We need vaccinate mandates to reduce the strain on our healthcare system and allow people to live more normally again.   I like that Biden is standing up for MY freedom to live, travel, and be safe rather than focusing on supposed ""freedom"" from vaccines."

Sir, do you have children under the age of 12, who cannot be vaccinated and are therefore held hostage to the antics of anti-vaxxers? How many children have already died having contracted COVID from their unvaccinated parents? And do those children go to school with a child who cannot be vaccinated? And,when (not if) a child becomes ill from COVID (because parents are confronted daily with the terror of their child becoming ill from this entirely preventable life threatening illness),will those same selfish, detestable miscreants be held accountable for causing needless suffering and death? 
Rejecting a vaccine is not a reflection of civil libertarian beliefs. Not when it impedes the rights of others. It's one thing to reject a vaccine for polio (which would be stupid but most likely only affect the refuser), refusing the covid vaccine is homicidal, depraved indifference, and ought to be prosecuted as such."

You can always count on some bad faith from Stephens. Surely he knows that in this context ""elective"" can mean addressing a painful and life-affecting but not fatal orthopedic issue, to pick just one example. And the more unvaxxed people are in a community, the more transmission will ensure, and the greater the opportunity for more people (vaxxed or not) to get covid and continue trading it back and forth, allowing it to continue to mutate. 
Also, this howler: ""I think he has misread his political mandate, which was to be a moderate, unifying leader in the mold of George Bush Sr."" Why is it that pundit moderator types always throw this at Dems but so rarely apply the same standards to GOP politicians? Donald Trump received like three million fewer votes than Clinton but NYT treated us to nonstop diner coverage for months afterwards, demanding Clinton voters work to understand Trump voters, while moderate pundits left and right advised that he should be given a chance (after chance after chance) to see what he could do."

For me a strong president is an experienced person who is not afraid of his popularity by making executive decisions when the safety and good of the people demand it and staying in the background at other times yet keep thinks running. These are the qualities of an effective CEO. People not wanting the government telling them what to do regarding their health or other matters which put the nation’s health and safety at risk are just being selfish and power hungry. There are many laws on the books which very few disagree with because they have been around for so long that even though the government is telling them what to do for their health, safety, and the safety of others. These include drunken driving restrictions, seatbelt mandates, children’s mandatory education and so on. Just because Republicans use government mandate opposition to safety measures for political purpose is a clear indication that the government in power is doing the right thing particularly when they have nothing constructive to replace them with for example Trump advocating using household disinfectants to cure Covid.

2021-09-13 16:57:11,"Bret is wrong that the unvaxxed only present a risk to themselves. They place everyone at risk. First, the vaxxed can be infected too. While they are likely to have mild symptoms, recent research shows that they have viral loads in their nose and throat as high as unvaxxed infections for a week or longer, and can therefore infect unvaxxed kids and contacts. Second, as long as a significant proportion of the population is unvaxxed, the virus can find plenty of new hosts to infect and generate new mutations. As with Delta, some mutations will be highly contagious, and some may be able to overcome the antibodies induced by vaccine. Until 85-90% of people have antibodies from vaccine or infection, the virus will linger and we will go through repeated cycles like this past spring and summer. This why Biden's vaccine crackdown is justified, if late in the coming. We all want to move on with our lives, but we can't do that with much of the country refusing vaccine."

------------

1.  The increased risk of another even more transmissible, more lethal variant the longer tens and tens of millions of Americans remain unvaccinated.

2.  The risk to individuals who are immunocomprised or otherwise less fully protected by the vaccine than most of us who are fully vaccinated.

3.  The impact on the overworked, over-stressed medical profession.

4.  The likely need to ratio access to care (e.g., ICU beds) impacting people whose need does not arise from COVID.

5.  The fact that there is a growing risk to children -- including those currently too young to be vaccinated; a risk that will likely increase further if another variant becomes dominant.

6.  The further erosion of confidence and belief in fact-based science.

7.  The further erosion of the notion of community -- replaced by a growing primacy of selfishness.

It is easy enough to add to the list but yes Bret, I think you are missing a few things."
2021-09-13 16:58:38,"Brett at least two people who had treatable health conditions that were not COVID have died because the hospitals were too full.  And those elective surgeries getting cancelled?  That’s cancer surgeries being delayed.  Elective doesn’t mean you really don’t need it (like a nose job), elective just means it can be scheduled beforehand.  Some of those surgeries are really, really necessary and delays could be disastrous."
2021-09-13 09:47:27,"Those who don't want the vaccines breathe the same air everyone else does, drink the same water, eat the same food, take the same pharmaceuticals and have most likely already had vaccinations before (e.g., for polio, measles, mumps and rubella).  All of these things are subject to government regulation.  And that's no problem for them - so apparently the government must be doing a great job.

But suddenly the idea of getting Covid vaccinations inspires concerns over vaccine safety and effectiveness along with questioning whether or not the government knows what it's doing in terms of properly assessing the true dangers of this pandemic.

That's simply irrational thinking.  And it's not confined to a small subset of people - we're talking about a third of the vaccine-eligible US population.

Biden is absolutely doing the right thing.  We need to get as many people vaccinated as possible.  Mandating vaccinations is the single best way to control the pandemic, save lives and get the economy back on track.

And we need to impose robust international travel restrictions until we can help get vaccines in ample quantities to the countries that are in desperate need of them.

If Biden wins on this issue, then Democrats have the best chance to retain control of Congress next year and the presidency in 2024.

Let's face it: we have no other viable option.  This is a serious pandemic.  A deadly serious one.

And we have no more time to lose."
2021-09-13 16:59:15,"Bret Stephens-Hardly a nincompoop crisis. Health care workers, particularly nursing staff, are leaving their jobs in significant numbers. Physicians are retiring early. The vaccinated and unvaccinated will feel the effects of this for years to come."
2021-09-13 17:01:57,"Covid is far from finished with us on any level.  The current variant is something like 1,000 times more contagious than the the original version of the virus.  Even though most new cases are among unvaccinated people, the people I know personally who have gotten the virus were fully vaccinated, and have gotten, and recovered from ""breakthrough"" infections.  This is because none of my friends are unvaccinated, and being retired I am not forced to come into contact with unvaccinated people.  I will continue worry about people who are flying again, even the fully vaccinated, until strict mandates are enforced.  I will not travel by air, eat inside any restaurant, attend any large gathering, etc. until such mandates exist.  Any thought that Covid is on the run, and things are somehow ""back to normal"" is crazy in my opinion."
2021-09-13 11:06:15,"The idea that insurance should refuse to pay for care for unvaccinated COVID patients, while tempting, is completely unworkable.  Few, if any, of those patients have a spare $200,000 lying around to pay the costs of a couple of weeks in the ICU.  All this would do is bankrupt hospitals, which are already under pressure from the cancellation of elective surgeries.  By the way, elective surgeries are not just nose jobs and tummy tucks-most are to relieve very painful and debilitating conditions.  Delaying them causes considerable suffering, and, in the case of some cancer or cardiac surgeries, can even cause death.

As for, ""forcing"" people to get vaccinated, OSHA ""forces"" all sorts of health and safety measures on employers and employees all the time-hard hats, safety glasses, vests and on and on.  Some are to protect the individual and some are to protect others.  Requiring vaccines will do both."

The Republicans keep shouting about the $3.5 T price tag but fail to point out that this is spent over the next ten years.  No one is running out on a buying spree.  
The benefits of the big bill will provide most Americans with opportunities and the ability to advance their family's lives.  
The items in the bill are not socialist, but rather the benefits a country of our size and wealth should already provide. 
The 25%-30% of the Republican party that wants to risk their lives, rather than take a life-saving vaccine, are emblematic of the ignorance in the party.  Facts and science clearly show that anyone not taking the vaccine is adding substantial risk to their life and their family's lives.

So, I reluctantly agree that Medicare should not cover the costs of hospitalization for those who chose to remain unvaccinated without a religious or medical exemption.

A little social responsibility for those of who work or travel in public spaces."
2021-09-13 17:31:44,Small point here. Brett... But you dismiss elective surgery as unimportant. Elective surgery doesn't necessarily mean a face lift or a tummy tuck. It might mean a joint replacement which relieves awful pain or prevents permanent damage -- or other similar surgeries which may not be life or death situations but have a great deal to do with quality of life.

He had already had a total failure with this administration’s response to COVID and they were worried that another one would utterly annihilate any chance of his reelection. As for inflation—that’s nobody’s fault except for the businesses that keep raising prices. Every business that raises prices kicks off a chain of price increases. Every commercial landlord that demands more rent kicks off the same cycle. Capitalists will always try to raise prices whenever they can, using whatever excuse they can find, because they are always chasing higher profits. The president cannot stop this — no one human being could, because no one person has control over any economy as a whole. Individuals and branches of the economy have only limited influence. The economy is a live beast that shifts in tandem with psychological factors and the emotions of the majority of humans who participate in it. And humans are notoriously irrational, especially when it comes to money. Inject oppositional politics into the economy, as Republicans are increasingly doing with their efforts to make Biden a failure, and it’s a recipe for even more chaos and less rationality."

Where is the benefit of refusal to be vaccinated? What is their logic? Presumably, a desire to endear themselves to Trump, the obnoxiously undemocratic American President in history. By blindly following him as their leader, with a passionate love of white supremacists, aren’t they showing a preference for someone similar to a twentieth-century fascist who triggered the second world war?

That's a pretty judgmental, mean-spirited label to slap on people whose worst crime is attempted to lead by example after four years of Trump."
2021-09-13 17:30:58,"I guess Bret must have missed the article about the heart patient who had to ask for transfer to 43 hospitals before he found one out of state that could take him.  Or read that Idaho is now sending patients to Washington state because their hospitals are full.  On what planet is COVID on the wane?

I thought Republican were all about beefing up the economy.  Well, the way to accomplish that is to get the pandemic under control.  The administration has tried consideration and persuasion and it hasn't worked.  That ""we're all in this together"" post-9/11 feeling ain't there this time.  Time for some tough love!"

“I accept that people don’t want the government or their employer telling them what to do with their bodies. But these same people shouldn’t expect someone else to bail them out of their terrible health decisions.”

Question to anti-vaxxers: 
If you get sick from the Covid virus do you want to stay at home and tough if out on your own, or do you want the government and hospitals to help keep you alive? 

If it were me I would not want help from the same people I vilify and accuse of conspiracy."
2021-09-13 17:39:55,"Bret alwasy ignores the Republicans' mismanagement of these issues that he attacked Joe Biden for not instantly solving.  
Bret apparently never heard the old saying: ""You break it, you buy it."""
2021-09-13 17:10:25,"Bret still seems to be taking the side of the anti-vaxxers by using terms like ""virtue signalling"".  Could it possibly be that people pushing for more vaccinations because they don't want to get sick, don't want their friends and family to get sick, don't want the economy to be mired in this mess?  Nope according to Bret, it's about feeling 'holier than thou""."
2021-09-13 17:12:00,"Deny health care or payments from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance (all probably illegal) to the willfully unvaccinated but heavens no to a government mandate. A mandate would force people to do the right thing. Rather, do the Republican thing and punish people under the guise of “you deserve the bad consequences for your terrible personal choice”  and if there are no sufficiently bad consequences we will invent some."
2021-09-13 17:13:58,"At this point I don’t care much if the purposefully unvaccinated get sick and die. What I do really care about are those persons making other people get sick. If we don’t stamp out this virus, no one is safe. Those that choose not to get vaccinated are putting all of the US at risk. That not libertarianism- that is murder."
2021-09-13 17:24:12,"My former nanny refused to get a vaccine, even though she was caring for my infant children who were ineligible for vaccination. She quit the job, moved to Florida, and got Covid within 2 weeks.

2021-09-13 17:34:31,"Bret, c'mon. All the states mandate vaccines for children who attend public schools, vaccines for measles, mumps, smallpox, Hepatitis B, chicken pox. This is nothing new, and, in fact, the state's authority to do so was confirmed in the Supreme Court decision of Jacobson vs. Massachussetts in 1905. Our freedoms are limited when it comes to public health and public safety. That's why we have stop signs, and speed limits, . . . and vaccine mandates."

3 vaccinated cousins in a family of 4 came down with. Covid;
My son had to take his daughter out of preschool and miss work for 3 days, isolate the whole family and get his whole family, including an infant, tested because of exposure to said cousins;
A good friend’s son was in a serious accident, is in the neuro ICU in another state, and neither she, her husband, nor his wife can visit him;
My husband had an acute medical issue for which he was hospitalized and is on meds which make him immunocompromised, so neither of
Us can see anyone, again leaving my son without childcare;
Another friend’s pregnant daughter had to labor at home, only using hospital care at the last minute—we all know this could have been dangerous
And 12 more example i won’t list here.  
I don’t’ know what planet you live on, but no, this is not only a problem for the unvaccinated.  What about the concept of public health crisis do you not understand?"
2021-09-13 17:46:56,"I'm surprised more people haven't picked up on the financial argument for vaccination.  If you decide not to wear a motorcycle helmet because the constitution guarantees your freedom to crack your head open, you won't be turned away from the hospital if you're short on cash.  So it follows that Joe Manchin and the rest of the Republicans, who worry about the taxes needed to pay for fixing the roads, should be equally upset about taxpayers picking up the tab for the unvaccinated."
2021-09-13 17:20:13,"Brett…Uh…do you read your own paper?
Here is what you wrote…. “I understand that puts doctors and nurses under a lot of strain, though Covid hospitalizations seem to be declining and the surgeries that are being put off are mainly elective. Otherwise, I don’t see the latest Covid spike as the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago. It’s gone from being a public-health crisis to a nincompoop-health crisis.”

And yet the NYT just published an article on the horrible situation of hospitals in my state of Washington inundated by COVID patients from maskless, undervaxed Idaho. Sixteen hour work shifts for hospital staff. Postponed neccessary surgeries for Washington residents who did mask up, who did get vaccinated.

You have laid out the thinking of the dire problem and reason for exhaustion and deaths in my state. Pain and suffering have not stopped.

And don’t get me started with the comment that you have a problem with governments telling us what we can do with our bodies while the political values you align with are forcing women in Texas to flee to Mexico, MEXICO, if they can get there, to have reproductive care they need. 
Bah."
2021-09-13 17:47:52,"Bret seems to forget the filibuster. If the social program isn’t tied to infrastructure, moderate Democrats will take their victory and walk. Nothing will pass before 2022 where Democrats stand to lose ground. The only opportunity for the progressive agenda is budget reconciliation. If Republicans and moderates don’t like it, they can undo the same the next time they hold power.

The safe bet though is most of the social programs progressives want will be too popular to repeal once they’re in place. Unlike Trump’s tax cuts, you’re not going to find many people upset with federally paid daycare or prescription drug medicines. Conservatives fear the package not because the price tag but because they know the programs will stick.

As for Biden, pivoting to the center is a non-starter. He’ll just alienate everyone. The minority isn’t cutting him slack for moderating his agenda now. The only course forward is ensuring the budget passes. The only thing worse than a gigantic social program is a gigantic failed social program. Case in point: Hillary Clinton."

2021-09-13 17:41:35,"""the vast majority of Covid-related hospitalizations are happening among the unvaccinated"" - yeah Brett. Unfortunately this increasingly includes children who don't have a choice. Are they also ""nincompoops""? This is a war against a vicious foe. The virus is taking every opportunity to mutate and this could mean more potent strains which could be more contagious & / or deadly. It doesn't care about your political hesitancy.

2021-09-13 17:51:05,"I know two young adults who have recently gotten COVID, both of whom were vaccinated. Their symptoms have been generally mild and they didn't require hospitalization. Both of them were most concerned with telling everyone they saw in the prior two weeks that they could be infected. So far, neither of them knows of anyone who was infected in that period. 

Given that the pandemic is far from over, it's incumbent on all of us to do what little we can, including getting a vaccination and wearing a mask in public (at least indoors). That's a small price to pay for keeping everyone safe."
2021-09-13 17:52:21,"I take issue with Brett Stephen’s claim that not vaccinating hurts no one but yourself. It hurts vaccinated older immunocompromised as well as children to young to be vaccinated, snd provides the hosts for the virus to mutate.

Do we really believe, in our deranged mind, that getting vaccinated impinges on our individual freedom...while ignoring the people around us and whom we seem 'free' to infect and kill, and with no scruples, especially if republican and adamant in obstructing a democratic president, out of irrational spite? What is so difficult to understand...unless you are paid not to?"

2021-09-13 17:54:53,"There is absolutely no way that Americans who willfully refuse to get Covid vaccinations, thereby endangering many other Americans and overburdening our healthcare delivery teams, should get away with this behavior without any downside.

If we wait until these maleficent characters contract Covid and become deathly ill, it is not enough simply to say them, ""There, serves you right!"" By then, they already have harmed untold numbers of innocent men, women and children trying to the right thing.

Bret Stephens is way off base when he writes, ""the civil libertarian in me doesn't love the idea of this or another president using administrative powers to force vaccines on the people who refuse to get them.""

Let's see a show of hands of the people who are fed up with the right-wing, self-identified 'civil libertarians' who repeatedly get our nation in trouble on every conceivable issue."
2021-09-13 17:53:03,"Brett, be honest.  If this were Ronald Reagan mandating the vaccine you would call it the best thing since George Washington mandated smallpox inoculation for his troops.  If Joe Biden cured cancer you would fret about the damage to hard-working oncologists' careers."
2021-09-13 17:58:03,"Bret says he has no problem with ""elective"" procedures being put off to make way for the willfully unvaccinated covid adults. Does he know that cancer surgery, heart pacer and bypass surgery, chemotherapy, dialysis, etc. are all considered ""elective"" procedures?
The willfully unvaccinated covid adult should be at the back of the line for medical treatment. After all, they're only ill from a hoax or they're exercising their ""rights"" to get sick and die (like drunk driving, they have no ""rights"" to force others to get sick and die)."
2021-09-13 13:46:28,"Stephens seems to think delaying elective surgeries is no big deal.

Watching my mom, who needs a knee replacement, go downhill while she awaits this deferred surgery gives me plenty of ammunition to counter Stephens's shrug. When you can't walk or do other routine physical exercise, your overall health degenerates. Ditto when you can't sleep due to pain. And when you can't perform simple tasks like preparing dinner or driving your car, you become dependent on others--a significant blow to mental health as it drags on month after month.

""Elective surgery"" doesn't mean what Stephens seems to think it means. We're not talking about facelifts here. The fact that unvaccinated folks are directly responsible for delay of elective surgeries, leading to suffering and harm, is an outrage."

2021-09-13 17:59:26,"Mr. Stephens: ""I accept that people don’t want the government or their employer telling them what to do with their bodies.""

Why? Why do you accept that, Mr. Stephens? Listen: when it comes to getting a vaccine that will prevent a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease from continuing to spread and mutate, there is no personal freedom. We either do what is needed to protect others (in this case, get the vaccine), or we opt out of society altogether--not driving on public roads, entering other people's buildings, or allowing ourselves to pass within many feet of other people. 

Would Mr. Stephens write, ""I accept that people don't want the government telling them what side of the road to drive on""? If yes, would he be okay with driving down a dark highway at night with precious family aboard, not having any clue which side of the road an oncoming truck might be traveling on just around the next bend? And if no, then how can he possibly accept people opposing the government's mandates about vaccines? Try logic, Mr. Stephens. It does come in handy.

Note to the unvaccinated: Yes, you should be mandated to get a vaccine if you want to live in a society with other humans. Just grow up and deal with it--or permanently leave, please."
2021-09-13 11:32:04,"Have to say, I am weary of debating the masking issue. Pre-pandemic, I had a relative who was undergoing treatment for leukemia. When we visited her, we had to mask up. No one questioned or thought otherwise about it. We were doing it for her, not ourselves. It was the right thing to do. Didn't define me as a Republican or a Democrat. Just said I cared about her health and supported her quest to defeat her cancer. 
Why can't all of us support what we all embrace, to stay healthy in the face of this virus invasion, and do our part? Just doesn't seem that difficult to grasp and comply."
2021-09-13 11:17:33,"I favor stricter Federal mandates to force vaccinations such as a ban on interstate travel without a covid vaccination, like EU does.  Completely a Federal Government power, interstate travel whether my plane, train, bus or private vehicle should be limited to those who are vaccinated and CDC should provide IDs like EU does already to prove it.

Freedom is fine but it is always tempered by responsibility to the safety of other people.  We owe something to each other as Americans and getting a vaccine to prevent the death of others including children and those who cannot for medical reasons be vaccinated is the least thing we owe to other Americans.

As John Kenney famous once said, 'ask not what my country can do for me, ask what I can do for my country.'   Be kind to others, obey the law, pay your taxes, vote, and get vaccinated seems to be the least we all can do now for our fellow Americans."
2021-09-13 17:35:05,"Mr Stephens, It is inaccurate-- as well as indecent-- for you to  minimize the impact of having an elective surgery cancelled. People waiting to have, say--  a back fusion, their 3rd staged surgery for a complex leg fracture, or a gall bladder excision--are miserable, as well as at risk of becoming dangerously ill.
I have an 83 year old friend who needs another back fusion. How dare you tell her to suck it up as she is having to do, given Seattle hospitals are flooded with patients acutely ill with COVID, who are there because they have refused to vaccinate."

2021-09-13 18:03:37,I'm frustrated that people keep talking about Biden's vaccine mandate and not mentioning that there is an option for weekly testing if you are not vaccinated. Not really much of a hardship in my view.
2021-09-13 12:52:04,"Bret, your 'civil libertarian' side is very self-centered. My civil liberties are being trampled on by folks like yourself. My sisters--the only remaining siblings I am close to--live out of the country and they would visit once a year for a month or so. It was wonderful. 

I am 64 (still working full-time), one sister is 66, and the oldest sister is 74. IF we can get together next summer--depending on your civil liberties, of course--it will be three years since I've seen them. 

But hey, your civil liberties outrank mine, apparently. And keep in mind that, as Gail commented, that no one is tying people up and injecting the vaccines by force. You don't have to get the vaccine, but live with the consequences, and stay home."
2021-09-13 11:31:44,"Every state in the nation has a seat belt law.  Not because the state cares whether an unbelted individual is killed in an accident, but because the consequences of not belting up taxes too many systems and we all pay for it in the end.  It's just common sense.  Likewise with the COVID vaccine.  This country of ours is a ""community"" and we have responsibilities to one another as a result.  In a nation of true adults, this, like seat belts, would be a non-issue, because everyone would do the obvious thing to protect the community.  We are not living in a nation of true adults.  We are living in a nation of cynical politicians, stoking the fears of the uneducated and the paranoid, for cheap political gain.  Frankly, that's a recipe for disaster and a call to action.  Biden did the right thing."
2021-09-13 18:09:59,"Speaking of vax politics, is Ms. Mandavilli going to decide on boosters from the conference room where the Times’s Editorial Board meets? I hope not. I’m tiring of the crusades, and given the steady climb of (unadjusted) hazard ratios for hospitalization from 0.03 early this year to about 0.2 now, the motives for President Biden’s plan to re-inoculate at 8 months, beginning with the nursing homes and proceeding in the same order the original campaign did, look obvious to me.

I suspect the FDA dissidents chose to leave primarily because they feel the US should be vaccinating Latin America and Africa for equity reasons, although they cite the Biden Administration’s turf intrusions and hurried timeline undercutting the FDA’s authority. I could be totally off base here, but equity has grown predominant as a theme at the general journals, especially Nature, and experts can be as opinionated as anyone else once the drumbeat starts.

The argument that most of our new strains are evolving in unvaccinated populations in the Global South omits our inability to export enough doses to stop that from happening; the donor effort will be lucky to reach the seniors facing the highest risks. Biden’s decision must come well ahead of need, as most of the boosters won’t go out until next year even if they’re ordered today, not to mention how protection from America’s apathetic unvaccinated also figures. We might have to reformulate the shots to cover different antigens by then."
2021-09-13 18:17:17,"The problem with the libertarian position (or the liberal one, for that matter) is the believe in an individual, discreet citizen (or subject). 

COVID-19 has deconstructed that subjectivity. We are not discreet bodies, but rather connected vectors. This isn't like the right to carry a gun. We are already carrying the gun, and sometimes it goes off without our agency. 

The liberal subject of our democratic republic is a fiction in the leaky, interconnected, vector subjectivities of this pandemic."
2021-09-13 18:22:25,"Bret needs to stick to advising Conservative Republicans, not the Democrats. The very centrist Dems who elected Clinton are not the same Dems who coalesced to elect Biden—the Bernie and Elizabeth Warren progressives were an important part of the Biden constituency, and still are. If Biden forsakes them, Bret, he’ll be even more disappointing to his “yes we can” base than was Obama."
2021-09-13 18:26:09,"A loyal fan of Bret's, I never expected to see him guilty of intellectual dishonesty or even culpable of mere lies of silence.  But to define the anti-vax problem as a ""libertarian"" choice when he knows we are trying to strangle the virus before the emergence of more lethal variants -- that is irresponsible, Bret!  If Covid were  -- or evolves into -- a pox that leaves everyone who contracts it hideously scarred; or if it mutates to a paralytic agent consigning its victims to life in an iron lung?  How fast would the libertarians mutate into vaccine seekers, abandoning a ""principle"" predicated upon the fact that, so far, they can gamble that at least for the privileged like Mr. Stephens Covid appears rather low risk?"
2021-09-13 18:28:06,"Saying ""surgeries that are being put off are mainly elective"" makes it sound like they are frivolous or unnecessary.  Elective just means planned, and also includes many serious surgeries, such as mastectomies.  I needed a heart procedure and it was delayed twice due to Covid patients filling the beds.  I finally had it March 24 of this year."
2021-09-13 18:29:44,"Could Bret please try to keep in mind that viruses mutate, and that the mutations that persist (e.g. Delta) follow the 'survival of the fittest paradigm'. Delta is not going to be the last COVID variant. What follows it could be more infectious, more virulent, more vaccine resistant, or some combination of the three. The longer we wait to try to stamp the virus out completely, the more likely such variants become to take hold somewhere and spread from there. This is truly a situation where an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."

There is no difference whatsoever when it comes to the anti-vax citizens. Throw 'um overboard if they refuse vaccination. Their refusal puts everyone else at risk.

Biden is making the tough calls that only a real leader, a person of experience and intelligence can make.

Critics like Collins and Stephens are lowly individuals in comparison.

""It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.

A friend who is immune compromised now has two kids sick with covid. Everyone who can be vaxxed in her family is vaxxed. Community spread is still a problem for everyone, and it is still hurting the economy. That is definitely the government's concern and it's about time we had stronger action. Look at the world ""hotspot"" map in today's Times. It is unacceptable that the US is in such dire shape."
2021-09-13 18:41:27,"Bret, what is so difficult about understanding that the vaccine does not provide lifelong protection against infection? Just like the flu shot, vaccine effectiveness will wain over time. The longer these clowns run around ignoring medical advice, the more likely responsible people will contract the disease on the tail end of their current shot's effectiveness. And the more likely  a variant will appear that the current vaccine cannot protect against. Yes, you're ""missing"" more than a few things."
2021-09-13 18:42:43,"It's hard to keep a straight face when many of the unvaccinated argue ""we don't know"" what's in the vaccine while  some are the same folks who rush to and defend the consumption of  horse de-wormer  to prevent  Covid .  The level of ignorance , selfishness and disinformation is astonishing.  So yes, after having tried and failed with the ""carrots"" of compassion, education, understanding and bribing  w/incentives it's time to try the ""stick"":  denial of hospital beds and medical treatments to the unvaccinated (unless they have proof of a legitimate medical exemption);  charge them for every test their employer must administer as well as docking their time;  no admission to public venues such as restaurants, theatres, airlines and more.  Without a host to attach to Covid will  eventiually die;    with hordes of unvaccinated Covid will  only continue to spread, duplicate and mutate."
2021-09-13 18:46:54,"Bret incorrectly concludes that anti-vaxxers are mostly harming themselves by refusing vaccination. Not so. At a minimum, they are clogging hospital ICUs and thus denying critical care to non-COVID critical care patients; they are contributing to breakthrough infections among the vaccinated; and they are facilitating further mutations of the virus, which may put all of us at risk from a more easily spread virus that can evade current vaccines. Their failure to vaccinate is costing all of us."
2021-09-13 18:49:45,"Personally I think that personal freedoms stop when they start to impose harm on others.

As for the social spending bill? This country has been shamelessly propping up the moneyed elite when they did not really need it. This generated record profits. As record profits continued they began to view that as status quo and their divine right.

Taxes are currently lower than they have ever been except for 1 period. Coincidentally the wealth inequality and sway by that moneyed elite has never been greater. Add in the amount of federal support that went, you guessed it, to the wealthy produced speculative trading raking in greater profits but forming a bit of a nasty bubble...

When this all bursts and we are in the midst of a new Great Deperssion, we're gonna need that bill..."

2021-09-13 18:53:57,"What does the Federal government do, Bret.  Does it maintain a stronger than might be needed (granted, no way to really know this) military to protect Israel from its a nihilistic neighbors, should that be needed, or is its primary purpose in the General Welfare, Pursuit of Happiness stuff.  I suspect you like Sen. Lieberman, are first and foremost one issue guys on the former.  Nothing wrong with that, as long as the military part assumes acting on good intelligence which includes knowing how to use diplomacy to preclude a military response.

But the rest of us in the Democratic world seems to be stuck on the latter, what's in the social spending bill--giving Americans what the rest of the Democratic world takes for granted. 

And it's affordable at a very low price in the bill, and paid for with only modest tax increases, and from those who have previously successfully spent millions to avoid billions in taxes. Making Stealing from the Treasury Legal, has been their motto.

And there's climate change.  It's in there but the Democrats are downplaying it.  In the great scheme of things, it's all that's really important in the bill--survival of the human race stuff.  And Joe Manchini (Italian hit man) is against it.  It's important that it pass now--already at least 20 years late.  You don't need a deceased McCain to stand up, but a living Republican.  And you are right about one thing:  Make sure the climate change part passes, even if it is decoupled from the bill to do it."

I can remember my parents talking about  WWII rationing, my entire family standing in line at the elementary school to get our Salk polio vaccine shots and families in the neighborhood looking out for one another when problems arose. It was a given because that’s what my parents were taught and what parents in the neighborhood taught us all to do. Most but not all went to church so religion backed the actions of some but beyond that it was a matter of common decency, ethics if you will, for everyone to look out not only for themselves but for the community.

2021-09-13 19:06:28,"Once we start ""mandating"" treatments we enter a possible Twilight Zone moment.

Our debate over a vaccine mandate is very important and one that needs careful consideration. Once we start making people put things or not put things into ""their"" bodies we need to be insightful of its possible progression in the wrong direction in the name of ""community"" health. 

Humans do crazy things with their bodies all the time. For example; type 2 diabetes is a pandemic in the US.  Type 2 diabetes is primarily the result of two interrelated problems:

1. Cells in muscle, fat and the liver become resistant to insulin. Because these cells don't interact in a normal way with insulin, they don't take in enough sugar.

2.The pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels.

Exactly why this happens is unknown, but being overweight and inactive are key contributing factors.Type 2 diabetes drives up the cost of health insurance, burdens our healthcare providers and reduces life expectancy while significantly impacting our economy. Its a major cause of death in the US.

Treatment is well defined via diet control and exercise but yet the pandemic grows. Should we mandate treatment in this group of patients for the good of ""community"" health? In other words control what foods they eat, what amount of exercise they must do for ""their"" body. If not should we raise the cost of their health insurance or ask them to weigh in at work each week or pay higher insurance premiums?"

2021-09-13 19:16:29,"I haven't liked our nation's response to the virus outbreak since the beginning.  Trump and Cuomo fought for control over managing the outbreak in New York and Cuomo won.  Cuomo ran an interference campaign against the national response by appearing live on TV on a different channel at the same time Trump was advising the nation on the national response.

I blame the Democrats and the liberal media for destroying the public's trust in our government for the results we are getting today.  Delta variants, Trump supporters and the unvaccinated does not explain the deaths we are experiencing.

We are an international red zone for the outbreak.  Countries with less than 10% vaccination rates have less cases and less deaths than we do.  One year ago, no one was vaccinated in the US and we had half as many cases and deaths.

It is hard to tell what is happening.  The Director of the CDC, second in charge, resigned after Biden took office.  Both the FDA and the CDC have seen high level resignations over disputes with the Biden administration.  Saying Trump wasn't following the advice of scientists and Biden would turned out to be another hoax.

As hoax after hoax gets called to light against the Democrats, Biden and the liberal media, Biden's approval rating is in free fall."
2021-09-13 19:23:54,"Yes, Gail, I, too, am buying into big change - given where we were since 2016 and what we well might have become - an autocracy at the very least - had the wannabe dictator and his cronies won in 2020. Texas, enabled by an illegitimate Supreme Court, paints a grim and vivid forecast of what government control by the right wing minority looks like. The voter suppression laws recently enacted in not just a few states, if allowed to stand, will seal democracy's fate. Bret's fiscal worries ring hollow in the face of undeniable enormous fiscal inequities. It is time to right the ship - and, by the way, address the threat, the clear and present danger January 6 represents. That only a tiny handful of the GOP is willing to investigate and roundly condemn the perpetrators and at the same time refuses to show their unqualified support for the Capitol police who defended valiantly smacks of treason."
2021-09-13 19:27:48,"As for mandatory vaccines there is the law and a Supreme Court case which makes the point: from NPR

""There is, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, [a Supreme Court case from 1905]. The case itself was about a vaccination mandate.

In the early 1900s, smallpox outbreaks were fairly frequent and many people had been vaccinated earlier as children, but needed to be vaccinated as their immunity waned. The state of Massachusetts passed a law that gave authority to local boards of health to make a decision at any given moment in response to an outbreak that smallpox vaccination should be mandatory for all residents of their local area if — in the opinion of the medical experts who were serving on the board — it was necessary to protect the public's health.""

This is the basis for Biden's mandated vaccine requirements. Without vaccine shots for everyone many people will get Covid including those and especially those who claim religious exemption. And I won't go into why I think ANY religious exemption is absurd."
2021-09-13 19:37:50,"It is unfortunate and sad if those who choose not to get vaccinated get sick and/or die.  But at least it's a choice they made.  My niece and a friend are now resident doctors and both are immune compromised...one a cancer survivor and another suffers lupus. They are both dedicated professionals and continue to care for all who require their services. The way I see it, the civil libertarian argument is flawed.  If you refuse to get vaccinated and want to gamble with your own life, that's one thing.  When other lives are placed in great jeopardy because ""civil liberties"" defend your refusal to get vaccinated, then you've ceased being civil.  You've become totally self-centered and harmful."

This willful misunderstanding (there's been abundant genuine pandemic information available over the last year) has dogged public compliance with public health policy since January 2020.  It's not that difficult.  Every single infected person is a virus factory that spreads it around.  There is no such thing as ""decisions that affect only myself"" here.  Vaccinated people can be infected and die, though at much lower rates.  So the fact remains that so long as the reproduction rate of the virus remains above 1 WE ARE ALL endangered by the un-vaxed."

Is there any particular reason we're playing Russian Roulette with our children's lives? 

Things we know:

Delta is MORE infectious
Delta may be more deadly
Delta is now making children sick and hospitalizing them
Children under 12 cannot yet be vaccinated

Who looks at THAT list and decides it's a jolly good idea to ring the bell and pack the rooms? Who?!!

So what do we do? March the kids off to schools that have neither the time nor means nor money to provide social distancing, fresh air, or any of the things necessary to curb the spread of the disease. 

 Last year, through Herculean efforts, wealthy schools who ponied up millions were able to do a reasonable job of safeguarding lives but at tremendous cost. So what do we do while in the midst of a deadly surge? Throw open all doors, cram kids into rooms that STILL don't have ventilation systems that work, windows that open, or enough room, don't require masks and vaccines, don't provide hand gel. 

Every smart thing my school did last year? We did away with it this year for reasons no one will explain. 

2020. The year rational thinking died in this country. If we get very very lucky we may resurrect some semblance of a ghost of a country when this is all over, but all signs point to our decline and fall. Why? Because we REFUSED to behave like rational beings capable of being proactive and of implementing life-saving measures.

So, the overall common perception of the ravages of COVID-19 is that we’ve only lost over 650,000 weak in the survival of our species struggle. In fact, in the long run, such “culling” might actually save us billions in health care expenses?

Of course, if it had been over 650,000, say, young children through 30-something’s in prime health dead or permanently disabled, the public concern would have been dramatically raised. 

In our communal heart of hearts, one might sincerely wonder if this explains some of these current political deliberations?

""No"" he replied, ""God will save me!"" Now the waters rose to his 2nd floor; again a rescue boat came, and again he refused, ""Leave me alone, God will save me!"" Finally, the rising flood waters forced the man onto his roof. This time a helicopter came, the men yelling that this was his last chance. He refused of course - ""God will save me!""

Joe Biden has stepped up to the plate and even in the midst of spiking of the weird Covid pandemic has continued to push the importance of the U.S. using its technological, research capability, and wealth to take on the challenge of decarbonizing the global economy.  

This is no small task. it is economically wrenching because our standard of living is very closely tied to oil, coal, and natural gas.  Our daily lives are tuned to carbon-fueled transportation and electricity for our homes, factories, agriculture.  This is the U.S. economy so we will need to work our butts off to achieve zero global carbon emissions by mid-century.

In the midst of these two huge existential issues, we still have the social and economic problems associated with the inequality gap in this country. Bret's litany of crises doesn't just apply to California. They are nationwide.  

I see it clearly and the reconciliation and infrastructure bill are both urgently needed.  I don't expect the very wealthy 1 percenters to vote for Democrats but I know that until we get a handle on the global pandemic and global warming if you love your family and want greater economic and financial stability, better health access, better education, and greater opportunity, you will vote for the Biden Build Back Better plan."

Second,  Stephens should be reminded every time he trims on the subject of vaccination that 660,000 have died (and counting) because of the politicization of public health by his party.  It is incumbent on him to formulate just how he thinks the country should deal with the idiots who will not be vaccinated.

In large part, these very same people feel powerless in their own lives, and TFG and current GOP governors stoke the anger and frustration that comes from these feelings of impotence and lack of respect.

It is common knowledge that all the Trumps got vaccinated; every governor (that I know of) that refuses to cooperate in a public health emergency has accepted the vaccine into their arms.  By standing on a virtual soap box and declaring respect for their base by saying that vaccines are a matter of choice and no one should force them to get vaccinated (or masked), it is the proof their base needs that SOMEONE sees them as worthy of making their own decisions.

It is the very worst form of gas-lighting; it is disingenuous and hypocritical, but it works for the politicians who do this, because even though they are killing off their base they have lost none of the remaining one's loyalty.

I would like to hear someone with a very large bullhorn scream this out in the hopes that the message will get out.

2021-09-13 20:19:22,"Dear Gail, Brett no longer merits sharing this forum with you after his recent attacks on President Biden especially regarding ending the Afghanistan war. While I admire your willingness to tolerate his divergent views, you’re far too polite with your collegiality. His caustic dismissal of the President’s careful character and decisiveness, after years of Trump’s outright attacks on our institutions, besmirches your own. Don’t allow him to further taint you. Please!"
2021-09-13 19:52:09,"It's a sick irony...many of my anti-vax neighbors, friends and family, question the ingredients of a life-saving vaccine, yet they could care less about what's in those 7 or 8 Mountain Dews they drink a day."
2021-09-13 18:26:04,"""Anyway, as anti-vaxxers are mostly putting themselves at serious risk of getting seriously ill,...""

I guess that means Stephens doesn't have a kid under 12.

What I dislike so much about the NYTimes conservative crew of Stephens, Douthat, Brooks -- especially of late -- is that their argumentation is so plainly built on finding some way of critiquing Democratic politicians. That is intellectually dishonest in the extreme, and as such ethically reprehensible. IMO."
2021-09-13 19:07:19,"There you go again, Bret.  Anti-vaxers are NOT ""mostly a risk to themselves.""  They are a risk to everyone including the vaccinated (perhaps you've heard of breakthrough infections), the overall health of the public (by giving the virus more room to grow and mutate into God knows what); the education of our children (because schools in semi-pandemic mode indefinitely are destined to damage the next generation) and the economy (other than the stock market - which might be your only concern).

You were seemingly somewhat rational when Trump was in office.  Now that we have President Biden you are spouting the same nonsense that Republicans and the right wing media disseminated for 30 years - teeing up the anti-democratic monster to enter the WH.

For the sake of our country how about telling the truth - consistently?"

2021-09-13 20:22:32,"I wish we would stop conflating mask issues with vaccination issues. Yet, every single article or discussion seems to focus on both of them as if they were one, or at least co-equal, matters. They are not.
As a result, so many times, a discussion on what should be the overwhelmingly overriding issue-vaccinations-gets obscured in debates about masking.
I fault the CDC for that. In its July guidelines  it communicated the Provincetown situation as an alarming development compelling universal indoor masking.  It could instead have been communicated in a positive manner, as an example of how well vaccines work- out of hundreds of infections, there were only a handful of hospitalizations, and no fatalities ! What a great message. Instead, the CDC led with the retraction  of its previous masking recommendation. The good news about vaccine efficacy was lost in the masking change.
I am fully vaccinated, and I have little tolerance for those who won't get vaccinated. I do have a problem with the way masking recommendations are communicated. 
Most people wear poorly fitting cloth masks which are virtually useless, except perhaps for optics.  But, they don't realize this. That false impression could create a false sense of security and actually contribute to the spread of infection. Sometimes, doing something is not better than not doing anything.
Focus on vaccinations, vaccinations, vaccinations. Masking is a distracting issue and will never prevent the ultimate spread of COVID."
2021-09-13 18:28:25,"Bret's comment about prohibiting Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance payment for the unvaccinated demonstrates why libertarianism is a dead end - it isn't consistent with how people behave. Hospitals won't turn away the unvaccinated, and Covid patients won't pay the horrendous treatment bills out of pocket. I guess he was just trolling, but I expect better from a NYT columnist. And his comment that Covid hospitalizations are no big deal isn't consistent with the facts, which are that some areas are exporting patients they don't have room for."
2021-09-13 18:56:02,"This notion the US government cannot compel it citizens to do something simply needs to be put to rest. 

The government can and does. The example of men aged 18 and older being legally required to register with Selective Service is a good one. The government requires it; it's been doing so for more than 40 years, and prior to that, the government drafted -- compelled young men into military service, lest they face prosecution in the absence of a viable reason to be excepted. 

The covid pandemic represents as much of a national security emergency as any armed conflict, or another 9/11 attack.

Anyone who thinks the government cannot compel you to do something is a complete fool and oblivious to history. 

Also, that Republicans would champion imminent domain to build a border wall, then turn around and insist that Biden has wiped his feet on the Constitution with a vaccine mandate are likewise fools. What they really intended to say is that the government is their henchman, their means to an end, not anyone else's."

hey Bret - how can you tell who the immunocompromised are? you can't, right? and how can you tell if you're infected, especially if you've been vaccinated and probably are not showing symptoms? again, you can't, right?

THAT is why you should wear a mask. come on. we've been doing this 18 months now. keep up."

I’m sure Bret would also agree we should extend that to anyone who is overweight, abusing substances, doesn’t exercise, smokes, eats foods that are shown to cause cancer, has unprotected sex, or engages in any other lifestyle choices that have a negative impact on health.

It's time for our nations collective responsibilty and well-being to take precedent over the selfish notion of ""my freedoms."""
2021-09-13 18:01:28,"So, Bret, your claim of the nincompoop health crisis leaves out one very important consideration.  The more active cases, of longer duration, the more likely a new variant will emerge.  No bets on what it will be but I don't like the odds.  Add that to the seemingly willful disregard of my fellow citizens for the weaker and unimunizable amongst us and mandates are the way to go.  We have to collectively put all of our shoulders to the proverbial wheel and get this pandemic to some minimally tolerable level that minimizes the chances of yet another new variant having the opportunity to emerge and force us back to square one."

It is that the Republicans haven't yet finished messing with covid and pushing it in the wrong direction--unfortunately for hundreds of thousands of people, for our economy still flattened by covid and waiting to open up again, and for the good of our country.  

How arrogant do you have to be to campaign on beating Mother Nature and science by defying them at every turn?

It was telling that the GOP did not even have a platform when Trump ran for president. 

About all the party really stands for now is being against anything the Democrats are for; against anything that helps, rather than hurts our environment (including safe drinking water and clean air); and against anything that helps working or poor Americans, their children, and this country and the planet's future.

No platform, no plans except to defeat the Democrats and aggrandize the rich and powerful corporations--running on empty essentially.   

So no wonder Republican campaigning, such as it is, relies on nothing but lies, disinformation, propaganda and political stunts.

Because none of us have ever done anything stupid, or with bad optics. The other side -- that most every single governor in the United States (putting aside people like Abbott or DeSantis) has been guessing on Covid because information changes daily -- is that Gavin Newsom has been a great governor when it comes to the pandemic. That people have objected to some of his policies, hey, you can't have it both ways. He made decisions that he felt were for the best, and pretty much saved a lot of lives.

Yet he had dinner at a French restaurant once against regulations. That's what counts. Sometimes I hate the pundit press."

That might be true among elite New Yorkers who don't have to mingle with the unvaccinated and have enough hospital space to go around, but in places like the rural South even the vaccinated are still suffering from the choices of the unvaxxed.

Bret should do a little research.
Supreme Court 1905 Jacobson v. Massachusetts ruling, upheld some five times in succeeding cases, gives the government authority for such mandates.
That is the law of the land.
Bret can argue with the rulings, but the law is on President Biden's side.
The stance of several GOP state governors is that President Biden's order is overreach.
It is not.
Evidence:  state governors all mandate vaccination for several diseases in their states.
This include South Dakota Gov Kristi Noem, who objects to vaccination mandate even while she herself has such state mandates for vaccination in her state.  That appears to be hypocritical, and her argument that President Biden cannot do what he did doesn't hold a thimble of water.
Bret Stephens should update his opinion after studying Supreme Court cases to wipe off the pie in his face."

However, to the extent every infected person, vaccinated or otherwise, becomes a host for the virus to potentially mutate into a variant resistant to the current vaccines, the recommendations are supported by science. Every potential infection needs to be systematically avoided regardless of its chance of resulting in hospitalization or long Covid or death."

2021-09-13 21:07:20,"Bret misses one important point about the virus spreading among the ""nincompoops"". If only that were the whole story. But every time the virus infects someone, it replicates many *trillions* of times. Each person can infect many others, leading to trillions more replications. And each time there's a chance that the copy will have some random variation. The vast majority of those will be harmless, but once in while there will be a variant that's worse than the original - more easily spread, or more destructive. The more people there are who get infected, the greater the chance of a dangerous new variant emerging. That affects everyone, not just the anti-vaxxers. It really is true that we're all in this together."

2021-09-13 21:40:39,"Bret and Gail,

I discussed  ""The Conversation"" with my wife at lunch and she joins with me in believing that Joe Biden is the best President we have had since we became a member of the Washington community in Jimmy Carter's term.  We were never that political because we were retired Navy and in the military our training was to be public servants for whoever was elected.

At lunch we went over the record of Presidents that we were acquainted with as we play by play went through the records of all including President Carter and came away with the agreement that Joe Biden is perfectly suited for the challenge of our time.  We don't believe his decisioning is being fully recognized by the people of the U.S. and the news media.  

We think the Covid pandemic has demonstrated that the Trump followers including many of the red state governors have been irrational in their failure to join the intelligent people of the country to get vaccinated and wear a mask.  The ineptness as leaders is documented in the resurgence of the Covid infection rate, hospitalizations, and death rates in those Red States -- the correlations is stunning.

The Senate is back today and I note that the Republican speakers are seizing the moment to criticize President's decision to get out of Afghanistan, which was a good decision.

We must move on and begin to address the real urgent crises that you both know well.  These crises will require a strong national commitment to future proofing the U.S. economy."
2021-09-13 21:51:35,"Bret, no one is forcing anyone to get vaccinated. Requiring people who chose not to get vaccinated to pick their noses once a week to ensure the safety of others is not a tall ask. Our kids have been getting tested once every other week for almost a year."
2021-09-13 22:01:57,"Let's make this a Republican market driven solution.  Charge those who aren't fully vaccinated full cost of their covid19 care. Like Texas on abortions, let vaccinated and other healthcare patients who get covid19 or are denied or delayed treatment sue states that don't have covid19 vaccination mandates."
2021-09-13 22:43:15,"I found its extremely disappointing to discuss covid vaccine mandates. Does Bret have his right to speak up, of course! But this conversation wouldn't be so dividing if certain politicians and news media are not spreading non sense and misinformation. In the end, if pandemic keep rolling, we are all going to pay. Biden is right, the unvaccinated is cost us all!"
2021-09-13 23:08:06,"I am surprised that our fearless columnists, Gail and Bret, have missed one of the most bizarre way the  Covid will be ""messing with politics"".

This Friday there will be another far right demonstration in Washington at Capitol Hill.  On the paper, the demonstration is in support of those who were arrested on January 6.  The organizers claim that those arrested were simply exercising their first amendment rights; hence, convicting them of anything turns them into ""political prisoners"".

At the same time, those behind Arizona election audit are getting ready to release their audit result.  We should expect the following:

1.  The audit results will be released very close to the time of the demonstration, to turn into battle cry. It could be either on Thursday afternoon or early on Friday morning; and,

2. The audit will claim discovery of a major election ""fraud"" in the form of votes casted by ""dead"" individuals.

According to CDC, in 2019 the no. of deaths in the US from all causes was just under 3 million.  Because of Covid, that no. is well above 3 million for 2020 and 2021.  That means by the time of the audit an atypical no. of 2020 election voters had passed.  So, the Arizona audit organizers could claim - with straight face - that an unusually large number of votes had been casted by dead people.

Of course, don't expect them to make any reference to the lag time between the election date and the time of their audit or the impact of Covid on the number of dead voters."
2021-09-13 23:15:22,"Bret continues to engage in Susan Collinesque levles of denial about what the real problem is here - the pathlogical hatred and mistrust of gov't, cultivated in no small measure by very wealthy people with big megaphones (in all kinds of media) and deep pockets who just hate, hate, hate paying taxes. 
I am tired of hearing never Trump Republicans who refuse to connect the dots between their ""gov't is the problem, not the solution"" rhetoric and the election of the former bozo-in-chief,  with zero understanding of gov't, but perceived as a successful businessman because of his wealth - achieved via inheritance, with the help of business scams and tax evasion that went largely unremarked on - perhaps because for people in Trump's position, such behavior is unremarkable. 
I am tired of having them blame backlash to gov't initiatives as the fault of the initiatives themselves, as opposed to the mistrust his side has been cultivating for decades. 
When is Bret going to admit that it is time for him to recalibrate his political worldview and stop hiding behind the reactions of people who clearly don't recognize a con man when they see one - but mistrust everything Joe Biden does."

And that even the vaccinated can contract and spread the virus?  Stephens’s comment seems  irresponsible and surprisingly ill-informed."

2021-09-13 23:24:57,"There are already a variety of so-called refusal rules/laws based primarily on religious or moral  exemptions. For example, a hospital could very well refuse to provide an abortion to a woman whose life is at risk. So --- we've already decided that we can limit healthcare based on certain criteria. However, the core issue is denying critical and often life-saving treatment for others who need medical attention for an existing condition or emergency event. 

There are a growing number of cases were hospitals have had to make a difficult triage decision to free up a scarce bed for an unvaccinated patient requiring intubation, for example, by discharging a non-COVID-19 patient before it would have previously been medically indicated. They are taking a chance with one life to possibly save another. 

If we can't in all good conscience deny medical care to the willfully unvaccinated, we can certainly make some tough, necessary triage decisions in terms of when they receive that care relative to others."

Another reason, however, is something that Bret and his like need to own up to: Proposition 13, which has caused much higher sales and income taxes and decreased housing mobility. It has also starved the schools of revenue. And as for our environmental issues, here is a man and a party who has historically been opposed to measures to combat climate change. So who is exactly at fault here? The ""elites""...or the Republicans?"

2021-09-13 20:33:02,"In many ways Biden has tried the ""civil libertarian"" approach.  He has mostly let the states decide for themselves on vaccine and mask mandates.  Even though that approach has merits )The number of vaccinated rose as the number of infections and deaths spiked).  It's been less than an overwhelming success to say the least.  At the current pace, it could take months or longer to get new infections low enough to drop all restrictions.  Biden doesn't have the time.  He's in a damned if you do damned if you don't box.

2021-09-13 22:11:34,"You may have a good point, Mr. Bret, with your opposition to a vaccine mandate: since unvaccinateds do harm to themselves (mostly), there should NOT be an external intervention to defend them against the negative effects (such as death) of their own inaction. To put it cynically, you are suggesting to let irresponsible people kill themselves !  as long as innocents do not die. Yes, the government has the duty to protect everyone, no matter how irresponsible, but you suggest that Biden should make an exception to that duty.
As for your criticism that Biden is not the unifying-mollifying president that you think his mandate demanded, well ... these are not quite the good times for which that kind of presidency would be appropriate. We are in a little bit of a hell, Mr. Bret, and that requires a pushier president. Let him try a couple of things. To quote the great trump: ""what do you have to lose?"" sanity, dignity, life ?

2021-09-13 19:50:44,"Hey Bret Stephens, you’ve got it backwards. COVID is not messing with politics, Republicans and “libertarians” are making very real and very critical public health issues political! And they’re endangering innocent and less educated people doing so.

You write that your inner “civil libertarian” “ doesn’t love the idea of this or any president using administrative powers to force vaccines on the people who refuse to get them.”
How do your inner civil libertarian feel about seat belt laws? Or the fact that it’s illegal to drive while drunk or while texting? Or are you uncomfortable with the fact that you can’t carry a gun onto a plane? Or that you have to be security screened?

A huge number of the 650,000 + Americans that have have died of COVID died because because selfish people believe conspiracy theories about vaccines or masks that Republican politicians are pushing and quacks like Rand Paul are spreading.
Please grow up."
2021-09-13 20:01:22,It’s not a nincompoop health care crisis when people die from treatable conditions but are unable to get an ICU bed because they’re all occupied by unvaccinated Covid patients.
2021-09-13 20:21:57,To not have mandates means you are giving in to the stupidity and irrationality of the right.  And most of us are tired tired tired tired of this state of affairs.
2021-09-13 21:41:46,"an addiction crisis, water crisis, power crisis, abortion crisis, schooling crisis, homelessness crisis... what? i thought Stephens was talking about Texas."
2021-09-13 22:24:29,"If death or long difficult hospitalizations are the option for the un-vaccinated....and they still ignore the science..do you really think anything you say will change their mind?  All we are doing  now if thinning the red herd...but on the way, the virus is having a good time mutating with this large pool of fools to play in. Ultimately they harm all of us.  And by the way..it's the economy stupid..get a vaccine."
2021-09-13 20:14:19,"Bret
I'd just like to remain that your that your last column, headline aside, was pretty awful.  Mean and Iinsulting.  If you want a moderate, as you would define one, go find someone.  You've got  platform.  By the way, I don't think Biden look tired or aged or any of the other agist insults you've been tossing around."
2021-09-13 21:09:38,"Where were these people when they were vaccinated for measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, diptheria, tetanus, pertussis, varicella, and zoster? Where was all the outrage when you needed to show proof of these vaccinations to go to elementary school all the way through college? ""well the mRNA vaccine is different, they pushed it out too fast, do your own research, it changes your genes, blah blah blah.""

When you ask them to explain how an mRNA vaccine is different from growing a virus in a cell culture for traditional vaccines, they have no idea. When you ask them what FDA approval entails, a typical timeline for approval and why it was expedited, they have no idea. When you ask them to explain the ""research"" they did on their own, and how it compares to the comprehensive scientific effort published from Pfizer and Moderna and vetted by the scientific community (microbiologists, pathologists, infectious disease specialists, PhD researchers, public health experts, pharmacologists, chemists, biomedical engineers), they have no idea.

They know nothing about microbiology, genetics, molecular biology, critical thinking, sources of evidence, or the scientific method. Instead, they know Fox News, deep state distrust, NewsMax, OANN, Facebook posts, Youtube videos, random wackos and grifters spouting off Ivermectin/bleach/whatever drug to ward off Covid, and an inability to come to terms with reality and truth. Ignorance that knows no bounds. Truly sad."
2021-09-13 21:16:34,"Blah....the headline was so much more interesting than the article. 

This time is different, kids who don't have a choice to take the vaccine or not are getting sick.  There isn't even a vaccine for their parents to choose to give them.  Kids are 26% of the covid cases right now.  So yes if the anti-vaxxers wnt to kill themselfs okay....but do it somehow else.  It is every American adults responsibility to make sure kids are given the best lives possible.  Contaminating them because you are too weak and selfish to be considerate for those who cant protect themselves is what a patriot looks like.  A true patriot anyway..."
2021-09-13 20:38:29,"""Nincompoop crisis"" has a nice ring to it--and it's true. But it's also true that nincompoops who refuse the vaccine are getting other people sick and some of those people are dying, like a 4 year old this week whose parents refused the vaccine and who didn't take her to the doctor immediately when she got sick. She died in her sleep that night through no fault of her own.  Now her mother says, "" I wish I got the shot.""  Too little, too late.  I understand regret after a child dies, because I lost one, but he died due to an accident when he was driving, not because I failed him as a little one. This child deserved more of a shot at life. Line up, nincompoops, and get your shots. The life you save may be your own."
2021-09-13 20:52:48,"Brett, I'm surprised you're so clueless about masks and vaccines. Sure they may protect us, but the big idea is they protect others from us. And if you're so worried about people being forced to vaccinate or test, how about the rest of us, the majority, forced to be at risk because of anti-vaxxers? The coercion cuts one way or another, and you seem to favor those who would risk the well-being of all the rest of us for no good reason."
2021-09-13 21:12:37,"Unfortunately you have politicians like DeSantis, Abbott, and others playing politics with the health of children to please a certain ex-president and no matter what will not get on board with the rest of us who want this thing to be over yesterday.

Add to that our ""alternative facts"" world, where everyone is suddenly an epidemiologist, constitutional law scholar, or both. And worse yet, you have public servants elected to serve the public health and the public good, often with stellar academic credentials and who know better, playing stupid...again, for political advantage. 

No wonder the president is at the end of his rope. A majority of the country is as well. 

And as others have pointed out here, no one is being tied to a chair and stuck with a needle. But if you aren't willing to do your part and no compelling reason exists for you not to, then prepare to live with the consequences. We all make choices.

It's not that complicated."
2021-09-13 21:18:40,"Bret: Even George Washington recognized he needed to mandate getting his troops inoculated against smallpox. ""Buoyed by the success of the mandate, Washington wrote to his brother in June 1777 that he was upset by a Virginia law restricting inoculations.

That is 1 of the reasons why In a new Sep. review, some F.D.A. scientists and others say boosters aren’t needed for the general population contrary to the position of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). My publication in July suggesting need for more studies on boosters was met with the resistance from the top brass of the NIAID. I was asked to publish a disclaimer indicating what the NIAID position is. The Disclaimer which will appear in the amended version of the publication basically is as follows 

Delaying vaccination by individuals who were naturally infected 
with SARS-CoV-2 in order to follow antibody levels does not reflect the opinion of a distinguished NIAID investigator and  to my knowledge that of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). 

The sole purpose of vaccinating an individual who cleared the COVID infection would be to boost immunity and therefore it is an attempt to ignore the immunity acquired through natural infection. The natural immunity acquired maybe variable and some may have not acquired immunity quantitatively better than the immunity acquired by average vaccinated person and I get it and therefore I advocate for testing of antibody levels before considering a booster. Certainly those with genetic or acquired immunodeficiencies need not be tested and could be given boosters but most DO NOT need boosters."

Their Crisis’ Is ‘Our Problem’: Washington Grapples With Idaho Covid Cases
Hospitals in Washington State, already strained, are taking on an influx of Covid patients from Idaho, where the governor has refused to require masks or vaccinations."
2021-09-13 21:04:12,Republicans and others who are all up in arms about mandatory covid vaccines don't seem to have any problem requiring employees or recipients of any kind of meager public assistance to be tested for drugs.
2021-09-13 21:09:14,"Over and over, seeming intelligent people like Bret get masks backwards. We don’t wear masks to protect ourselves, we wear masks to protect others. “There are people, particularly the immunocompromised, (for whom we need) to take great precautions, including (wearing) masks”. Stop letting Republicans flip this issue! The GOP plays silly games by claiming “it should be up to concerned parents to decide if their kids wear masks”. If it was up to concerned parents, they’d insist that everyone else wear a mask. That’s what protects their kids!"

2021-09-13 21:59:00,"Bret, you are wrong, wrong, wrong. We are in the middle of a global pandemic emergency, the consequences of which may kill you if you are not vaccinated. The President, any President has the moral obligation to protect their nation. Vaccines have proven worthwhile at saving lives. They should be mandated. No one objects to having their children vaccinated in order to attend school, yet those who choose not to be vaccinated are showing a selfish disregard to their fellow citizens. Their right to not be vaccinated ends where my right to have a safe life begins."
2021-09-13 20:32:36,These Republican governors are hypocrites. They are vaccinated and want to oppose vaccine mandates. How long do they want the pandemic to last? The anti-vaxxers are also hypocrites. They'll put hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin in their bodies instead of a vaccine. When will the insanity end?
2021-09-13 20:45:47,"A man and his family was looking for an ICU bed this weekend.  It was in Alabama and they called 43 hospitals. Finally, they found a bed 200 miles away.  He was 71.  He died because he got to that ICU bed too late."

2021-09-13 21:28:05,Trying to use reason and logic on the anti-vaxxers is a complete waste of time.  It would be like trying to convince QAnon that the government wasn't out to get them.
2021-09-13 21:49:42,"No, I don't understand the reasoning of Republican ""civil libertarians."" According to Bret, it's up to individuals to decide what goes into or onto their bodies when it comes to this vaccine and wearing a mask in public. They don't seem to understand that the protective measures are not just for their own benefit. Yet these same individualists claim the right to tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies, in the case of unwanted pregnancies (under any conditions), although it's none of their business--can't catch pregnancy. All I'm hearing at this point are mega-reasons to get rid of the whole ""states rights"" idiocy."
2021-09-13 20:47:35,Vaccines are for self-protection.  Masks are for self-protection and the protection of others.  Simple enough?
2021-09-13 21:59:36,Our country used to listen to science and undergo vaccinations even if mandated by the federal government.
2021-09-13 22:26:38,"""refuse to allow Medicare or Medicaid to pay their medical bills in the event they become seriously ill. Private health insurers might also follow suit. ""
Why not? This is what pet insurance companies do. If you don't get your cat vaccinated, they won't pay the bills if he gets sick!"
2021-09-13 20:47:16,"Looking purely at the statistics, it's easy to think that Republicans would rather kill off their electorate than have them vaccinated...or wear a mask, even if it means saving their children under 12 years of age.
It's also no surprise that these largely Red-leaning states, who mainly give creedence to conservative right-wing media (and Donald Trump), are also experiencing some of the highest infection and mortality rates -- as they continue to rant against ""big government"" while depending on federal assistance, by way of military mobile units to treat the infected and refrigerated trucks to contain the dead.
Apparently there's no end to their hypocrisy or worse, this pandemic."
2021-09-13 20:51:32,Shouldn’t the title read: Politics ( and politicians) aren’t done messing with Covid??
2021-09-13 21:10:11,"Brett: ""Otherwise, I don’t see the latest Covid spike as the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago. It’s gone from being a public-health crisis to a nincompoop-health crisis.""

This ""nincompoop"" crisis is starting to affect people who need emergency care who do not have COVID. Every day there's another story about someone who had a heart attack or the like and couldn't get in because the hospital didn't have room.

And Washington State is now taking COVID overflow from Northern Idaho because Idaho has been so lax about vaccines and masks.

I'm not saying nincompoops shouldn't get treated...I just want them to realize it's not all about them. We are a society of many people and we should all take some responsibility for each other."
2021-09-13 21:16:19,"""It’s too early to say that the Biden presidency has failed. But people who wish the president success — and that includes me — need to grasp the extent to which he’s in deep political trouble......I think he has misread his political mandate, which was to be a moderate, unifying leader in the mold of George Bush Sr., not a transformational one in the mold of Lyndon Johnson.""  The mandate was to be sane, to make the best decisions for the good of the country as a whole, in short, to do everything the other dude wasn't doing.  By that measure, Biden has not just done well, he'd been courageous.  He's making very difficult, politically risky decisions because he feels strongly that it's for the greater good.  Whether or not he's correct, we'll find out, but I for one am glad he's leading bravely, not hiding in a corner trying to be inoffensive moderate during times that demand courage and action."
2021-09-13 21:40:11,"So Bret thinks that Biden is a failed president because he yanked us out of a costly and nearly interminable GOP Neocon boon-doggle, is responsible for the inflation caused by Trump’s tariffs that are the cause of significant price increases on thousands of consumer goods and must also take the blame for not ending a pandemic that is getting worse by the day precisely because Bret’s party’s nihilistic adherents refuse to get a simple vaccination?
Wheeew! That’s quite a stretch, even for a giraffe!"
2021-09-13 20:28:51,More un-vaccinated people means more chances for mutations.  This puts us all at risk. Not vaccinating is more than just a personal choice. It's not just the 'nincompoops' in danger. Why is this so difficult to follow?
2021-09-13 21:06:06,"My grand-kids can get infected by another student, teacher or bus driver or cafeteria worker and become very ill or even die. You do not have the right to impose that on my grand-kids Bret. Of course living in Iowa, their school is rural and my grand-kids get mocked for wearing their masks at school. Your disgust with trump and all that he stood for, which led you to vote for Biden and even embrace some Liberal Policies has waned more and more the further out we get from the Election. I am really sick of the right claiming they know anything about debt and deficits and the ever popular ""personal responsibility"". Instead of implying ""The busybodies and virtue-signalers"" are just too much for you to handle or actually make up the bulk of people that are vaccinated. You should exert some personal responsibility and applaud any kind of mandate that will ""make"" people get vaccinated even if they don't want to in order to slow the infection and killing of our fellow citizens. Then the worst part is the anti-vaxxers suddenly willing to listen to doctors and nurses as they overflow hospitals across the country you don't seem to believe is the main issue, it is. I could go on about how you continue to return back to the old, stale mantra of the right, even though it has been exposed for what it really stands for but no doubt, you are missing more than a few things."

Typhoid Mary traveled around spreading typhoid and many died because she did not do the social responsible actions NOT to infect others. Pres. Biden is taking the same approach. Those that do not vaccinate need to be vaccinate because they are not being socially responsible."
2021-09-13 20:35:27,"Re: Vaccines -- Biden and the left need to change their messaging. It's not ""Do it for America"" or ""Do it so we can all go back to normal"" or the implied by the right ""Do it so I look good as president"", it's ""Do it for yourself (and maybe) your family."""
2021-09-13 21:25:04,"I think Gail is too passive in this ""conversation"" and let Brett got away with all sorts of false/semi-truth claims. Gail, if this supposes to be a conversation, then there needs to be back and forth, push-back, and arguments. Not just let what Brett said go unchallenged and slid by. If the conversation is so tame, we might as well read individual columns from both of you."

But no, Brett has to get his silly Libertarian digs in. In the midst of raising infection rates in so many states, he has to go the ""virtue signaling"" route regarding the folks who are still just being responsible.

TFTFY

In fact, politics would mess with a grain of sand if the politician(s) involved thought they could gain an advantage, no matter how small.

Speaking of small, doesn't the average politician of either party strike you as being quite a bit smaller than the average politician of 40-60 years ago? Average pols certainly present themselves that way to me.

For quite some time now, potential politicians with something meaningful to offer have been driven away by the spectacle of contemporary politics, not to mention the fact that, year after year, so little of lasting value actually gets done. As a nation, we are dumbing ourselves down while electing politicians who are more than happy to take advantage of the fact."
2021-09-13 23:39:40,"Maybe the wrong forum to advertise other opinions, but since Bret Stevens was mentioned, perhaps relevant.  In a piece titled ""Forget About Biden's 'Cruel Summer' - He's Doing Big Things"", David Rothkopf and Bernard Schwartz try to put a little perspective down.  Noting where we were just a few months ago, in public health, economic and political crisis, topped off with an unprecedented attack on our country by our own leader and the fascist mobs he provoked in an attempted autogolpe, they laid down the facts of where we are now:
An actual vaccine distribution plan, 200 million vaccinated and a new bold push to crush the new variants.
The American Rescue Plan cut poverty in half.
More jobs created in 8 months than 12 years of Bush and Trump combined, economic growth at 'remarkable' 6.5%.
Re-prioritizing climate change.
Appointing judges faster than his predecessors.
The most diverse cabinet in history.
Ending the 'forever war' in Afghanistan.
Swift aid for Americans beset by fires, floods and hurricanes.
Finally investing in infrastructure with bipartisan agreement, plus the BBB plan that together represent the biggest investment in America in almost a century.
And more.
And yet, they note, here is the NYT publishing a 'divorced from reality' headline (by Bret Stevens) about Biden's failed presidency, among other mainstream outlets questioning his competency and trumpeting his 'mistakes'.
I am glad Mr. Stevens walked it back a little bit here.  More would be better."
2021-09-13 23:42:42,"Right on Gail. Accentuate the positive. 

Bret? You talk about opening your mind but I think it would be prudent to open it...a bit further. For instance, I know if we were discussing polio you wouldn't hesitate to join the mandate bandwagon.  It only one life were saved this would be worth mandates...but we're not talking about one life we're talking thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives saved. 

Meanwhile, Joe Biden plows on. Thinking only of how to best save lives. That's the great thing about this president. He takes the hits for doing what's right. We all know Biden's his all for us. Bret too. Only he won't admit it."

But when it comes to outawing abortion, Republicans are ALL FOR the government telling American women what they can and can’t do with their bodies. They are so easy to troll with the obvious it’s not even the slightest fun!"

Friends, this is not cute and it's not funny.  People are dying in the thousands and thousands, in our country alone.  As folks have attested in these comments, serious surgeries are being delayed and health care resources are stretched thin.  And the biological, economic, psychological, environmental, etc. health of our society is at stake.  The reader comments on societal selfishness are spot on.  Bret Stephens won a Pulitzer Prize?  This is the best we can do in terms of measured debate?  We're supposed to chuckle when the term ""nincompoop"" is used by an ""intellectual libertarian,"" apparently for some kind of comic relief?  I find it appalling, embarrassing and pathetic.  And truly sad."
2021-09-14 00:55:44,"Rather than policies to directly prod people into getting vaccinated, Bret would prefer to prolong the crisis and expose more vulnerable people to the risk of infection by pursuing a policy of denying coverage to sick people who make the wrong choice... because it's more ""elegant."" 

Thank goodness Biden has the courage to pursue an inelegant solution."

Northern Idaho went to crisis care standards a few days back.

This is absolutely a public health crisis.  Not all states are slammed right now, but the ones who are, you don't want to risk a car accident or a heart attack.  Or cancer."

We could have avoided all this by issuing vaccine mandates months ago, except that people like Bret insisted that Biden not do anything so divisive.

Speaking of divisive, how would we describe a columnist who is calling the Biden presidency ""failed"" a little more than half a year into it?

Biden is doing everything he can to fight the pandemic, but he's being undermined by Republicans who see it as being to their political advantage. He's taking the blame for the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations' mistakes in Afghanistan. He's governing in a way that is not liberal enough for some, too activist for others: in other words, from the middle.

You want to call that failure? Biden's been underestimated his whole career, and you're doing it again."
2021-09-14 01:21:22,"To the collective shame of the Republican Party COVID is most assuredly not done with politics, and they'd have it no other way. Whether it's Republican members of congress or Republican state officials barking about mask mandates, vaccine mandates or vaccine passports, they just couldn't be less credible or more silly if they were paid to be. The only reason they are on the wrong side of COVID is because they know that is ground being ceded by Democrats so what better way to take the wrong side and hope like hell that the three legged mule wins an upset at the Kentucky Derby."

Hospitals and doctors will treat patients - even if they are stupid or arrogant  - but we are all paying the cost of stupid and arrogant these days. Go to Idaho - Kootenai Hospital up North is on triage care - selective care.  They are not doing surgeries for brain cancer - (sure that's an elective Bret) and hospitals in the nice masking state next door (Washington) are being overwhelmed taking these Idaho maskless sick fools.  19 months and counting Docs and Nurses and experts are leaving in droves because they are exhausted, AND fed up with risking their lives in treating arrogant and selfish deniers of science or the common good!  

You write, ""I understand doctors and nurses under a lot of strain.""  That's the most tragic understatement of the year. I dare you to sit next to a person struggling to breathe for 5 minutes, or 5 hours or 16 hours as some dedicated professionals are doing and not scream in the hallways or develop PTSD.  This is crazy-making - we've asked these professionals to fix something BIG - that a SMALL act of personal responsibility could fix and WE ARE ALL PAYING.  

Frankly, I'm tired of the democrats cleaning up the Rpub created messes and then getting blamed when it's costly.  Trump and his GOP are the real crisis - a clear and present ""danger to democracy and national sanity"" - and that's not nincompoop. It's criminal sedition."
2021-09-14 00:41:23,"Sorry, Bret, but Prop 187 was NOT, in any way, shape or form, an ""anti-immigrant"" stance.  It was specifically, and narrowly, and anti-ILLEGAL-immigrant stance.

There's a humongous difference when you add the word ""illegal.""  And yes, immigrants can be illegal.  As in, they don't have permission to enter the US.

This is the biggest lie the Democrats tell.  No person has the unlimited right to enter the US and live here.  No other western democracy allows it, either, for those of you that idolize Europe.

Try moving to Canada...or Australia....or England.....ain't gonna happen.

Reading your column is like seeing Mike Nichols & Elaine May in action...beautifully witty and entertains yet thought provoking...

I agree with the Medicare / Medicaid approach.  It is not unreasonable.  Life insurance  companies “rate” certain policies, that is, require additional premium where risk is present in the proposed insured...heart disease, etc.  Years ago, policies were rated over “morals”!

I’m fully vaccinated and still wear a mask.  My wish is that my fellow citizens who are hesitant...think positively and get vaccinated.  And whether or not you do, be safe not sick!"
2021-09-14 00:53:15,Bret seems unaware that elective surgery includes almost all surgical procedures for cancer? Why? Because the definition of elective surgery is merely any procedure that is scheduled in advance. There have been untold numbers of cancer patients who have had to wait for their elective surgeries (and hope their cancers don't spread) because of the selfishness of the unvaccinated.  Many cancer patients will no doubt die. A national disgrace. Shame on the unvaccinated!!

This is still a significant risk to people who have done the right thing by getting vaccinated. I wouldn't care one bit if the vaccine gave me 100% immunity forever, but it does not, so those nincompoops are directly affecting my health in addition to theirs."

Such a simple action and they act like it is tyranny.  Their sick culture of freedom and independence is killing them and they refuse to see it.

Except for those perishing from COVID in some ICU, these people will tell you it's not so bad; they'll survive, and, as a bonus, they'll be immune and, so, no vaccine needed!  So GOP officeholders must sacrifice true leadership to their ambition if they want to save their jobs. Plus, they get to ""own the libs"" every day!

All this unnecessary pain and suffering needs to produce at least one good outcome - the electoral defeat of what's left of the Republican Party. And THAT is the responsibility of the voters - we govern ourselves, after all, AND the excellent President Joe Biden and the Democrats.

The people out in this part of the country will hold bake sales to cover their neighbors' healthcare costs, but they won't take the very basic steps of getting a vaccine to protect themselves, their families, and their neighbors from getting in the hospital in the first place. 

This example of sending patients across state lines because leaders in some states won't lead and protect their constituents is why we need a national approach.  

This virus is literally killing hundreds of thousands of Americans.  Come on Idaho (and Montana).  Let's see that so-called patriotism of yours.  Do your part!  Get vaccinated."

Not Idaho.  They send the problem to the people of Washington, because they did what was necessary to flatten the curve and preserve a functioning medical system.  Because of this, Washington is now at high risk of their own medical system collapsing.

The same could not be said for my major---political science---whose theories evaporated in every election cycle.

And the resistance did not emerge out of a vacuum. It was stoked by  Republican elected officials, from Trump on down, who did not have to wherewithal to understand that the pandemic offered them an opportunity to lead. 

What's the big deal about showing a little courtesy and regard for the well being of the people of your community by putting on a mask for a few minutes when shopping at a store? Since when is showing concern for others, or doing one's small part to help a national public health effort, confiscatory?

No one else’s health or safety is a factor. The cynicism is through the food. “I will not comply” until I need care.” No more.

Failure to get a vaccine and the healthcare costs that result when an unvaccinated person goes to the hospital, however, is not something I signed up for.  The unvaccinated should pay more for their callous disregard of their very preventable level of infection and use of hospital services.  They put others in harm's way through their selfishness.  Public health is not a freedom issue.  Without public health rules and vaccines,  we actually lose our freedom.

Treating COVID cases equally, regardless of vaccination status, is part of the culture of Medicine. That said, the crisis is affecting care for everyone else, delaying so-called elective cases, putting essential cancer treatment on hold and risking the availability of treatment for heart attack and stroke patients, and others. To meet the needs of the crisis, hospitals should be free to place a cap on admissions of unvaccinated COVID patients, so as to ensure adequate capacity for ALL patients. Further, Washington State should sue Idaho for the cost of the ongoing pandemic, and not just for the cost of the hospital patients admitted in transfer. The state certainly has standing to do so.

We need to take a serious look at first amendment rights when it comes to the deliberate spread of disinformation. The bar can and should be a high one but not even politicians should get a pass. Spreading disinformation for profit or political gain during a pandemic amounts to shouting fire in a crowded theater. Victims should sue Facebook and the FCC should go after the licenses of media outlets that participate, including cable providers, TV and radio stations that carry programming that encourages people to unmask, forego vaccination and pursue dangerous alternative treatments."

Those who have health insurance should pay a big premium if choosing not to vaccinate and/or co-insurance for their covid related care if unvaccinated. For those who are uninsured, the bill for care should go straight to Idaho. This would likely require legislation in WA, but the second piece at least would I suspect be popular. 

This care is extremely expensive to provide. I work in a hospital system - it takes many staff, many machines, many meds, long stays. It is entirely unfair requiring a hospital to eat the cost of a social problem exacerbated by political fecklessness."

Part of the reasoning was that most of the patients filling up Tulsa hospitals were from outlying areas and would not be subject to Tulsa’s mitigation measures anyway. It’s been that way to some extent since the start of the pandemic."

You wait for the tumor patient, the knee surgery patient, etc., then, if there's space, you get service. Also, your insurance payments should go up—a lot.  Flying people across state lines and putting them in an ICU is not cheap.  Why should everyone else have to pay for what is now a largely preventable disease?  Isn't that socialism? (of the dumbest kind?)"

Having lived near Moscow, Idaho, I’ve wondered what will happen when the well-known U of Idaho and WSU student parties, mixing, sports events challenge that state border….and challenge Moscow, a liberal enclave in the North.

Conservative eastern Washington, like our conservative eastern Oregon, challenge our attempts to get back to some kind of normal. I wanted to attend our own State Fair recently, but news that our mandates are being ignored- decided not to go.

2021-09-13 12:23:35,"We have similar problems here in NM with TX. Throughout the entire pandemic their anti science choices have hurt us. We are a very poor state with limited hospital resources. It’s one reason why our very tough governor implemented strict mandates very early in the pandemic. As soon as things took a turn for the worse this summer she immediately put the mask mandate back in place. The problem is the closer you get to the TX border the less compliance of any public health guidelines you see. These eastern and southern NM counties are rural and all have high Covid rates because of their anti science mentality. They clog up the Albuquerque and Santa Fe hospitals with their totally unnecessary Covid cases and we too are stretched to the limit. The federal government needs to put the squeeze on areas of the country that refuse to do anything to protect their neighbors, community, or country. They are not patriots. They are selfish fools. Let their public funds be taken away. Let them be the pariahs they are. Enough is enough."

Every Washington state resident should be getting care first, including non-Covid care, before Idaho residents. It’s criminal to vote in a state you don’t reside in, but fine to deplete another’s state of critical resources, thereby preventing Idaho residents from holding their Governor accountable for his criminal and immoral actions. The constitution gives power to the states - let them reap what they sow. Residents of beautiful Idaho, act up."

It’s all of us Americans who got our shots as early as possible, wear masks religiously and have been extra-careful as to where we venture.  We had high hopes that the second half of this year would allow us to ease restrictions and return to something of a normal life.  Instead, we have these ignorant resisters dragging us down.  

I have no empathy for them.  Every time I hear that one of them has been fired from a job, yanked from a classroom or denied entry to a restaurant, it makes me happy.  This is one case where discrimination is wholly justified."

Maybe the rugged, freedom-loving individualists of Idaho ought to man up and accept the consequences of not taking the virus seriously, not wearing masks, not taking reasonable precautions.  After all, they made their choice.  Let them live with it.  Or, as the case may be, die from it."
2021-09-13 12:27:55,"So Idaho hospitals are entering a ""Crises of Standard Care"" and they see nothing wrong with sending their patients to Washington because thats what a good neighbor would do, help out a neighbor in need.  Wearing masks and being vaccinated would be the neighborly thing for Idahoens to do to return that favor, but they are too immersed in being victims rather than responsible citizens.   Respect for life, personal responsibility, doing the right thing for your neighbor, supporting your country, sadly lacking in Idaho."
2021-09-13 12:34:07,The final step in the downward path of social insanity - abusing the care givers who are doing their best after you have been brought to a hospital in another state that you paid nothing for and due to a cause that you could have very likely prevented.

2021-09-13 12:51:46,"Hospitals have 3 obligations under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA):

1.  Provide a medical screening examination to someone requesting emergency care, to determine whether an emergency medical condition (EMC) exists.

2.  If an EMC exists, the hospital must provide treatment until the EMC is resolved or stabilized and the patient can provide self-care following discharge or can receive needed continual care.

3.  If the hospital does not have the capability to treat the condition, it must make an appropriate transfer of the patient to another hospital with such capability.

I suggest that Washington State hospitals determine that they don't have the capability to treat Covid patients who refused to get vaccinated and transfer them to Montana or Wyoming."

So now that tumor patient will have to be punished by losing their legit space in line to someone reckless and irresponsible!"

Northern Idaho has demonstrated utter contempt for and ignorance with regards to Covid since the beginning; if I were A Decider in the excellent Spokane medical community, I know how I would prioritize the medical resources. It's time to start delivering a blunt and unvarnished message to these patients that recover and their families when they wind up in Spokane's hospitals. And then, send them the bill."

They got them to fear the government, to hate people of color and immigrants, and Democrats. All the stuff they propagandize (and what they do is definable as being propaganda, repetitious lies.) about around COVID was a part and parcel of the daily oppositional orientation designed to keep them amped up. Because their audience thinks they are being spoken to in a code what you hear can be complete impossible nonsense. There are 70 million of them. Lachlan Murdoch has, reportedly, supremicist sympathies. With leadership like that you can hope they defeat themselves but they are damaging the whole country. They are also damaging other English speaking countries, England and Australia (Canada won’t let Fox in). It’s been shown that people don’t necessarily make rational economic choices. They equally do not make rational choices in the information they consume. They are dying but accepting it as Gods will and not changing their racist orientation. We are on a precipice.

As far as I’m concerned, every death in Idaho is on the governor."

I love those folks even though now a lot of them are acting like idiots. In the last few years, a small fraction of Idaho people have seemed openly hostile when I encounter them out in the woods. In Montana just a couple weeks ago, there were no masks in grocery stores, parks and gas stations, and a fair number of pro-trump flags flown in front of homes. This situation is heartbreaking. I am just as annoyed as the other commenters but less inclined to blame these victims of misinformation. People in this region are largely decent but the politicians who stand to profit in their power are leading many to this. It is the politicians we should be angry with, not our brothers and sisters who may or may not have drunk the kool aide."

Issue healthcare IDs only to those whose primary residence is in-state. This would solve the problem that Washington State is now having - any Idaho resident will (a) be placed in a lower priority to get an ICU or hospital bed in Washington State, and (b) if treated, will not be covered except by their own insurance and will be responsible for all local costs.

It’s high time for disallowing healthcare externalities- the granting of private benefits (a hospital stay) and foisting those costs on the public (the Washington State taxpayer). It’s the conservative thing to do (and I’m a progressive liberal)."

2021-09-13 13:00:20,"The problem is within a state, too. South of us are some of the worst outbreaks in the nation. Our urban county has been flooded with cases from rural counties, where ""I will not comply"" signs are common (although that dealt with a modest, sensible gun control measure). Last week, we read about a 66 year-old with very early pancreatic cancer can't get surgery. That is the tip of the iceberg. 

Gov. Little, YOU are out of touch with reality.  Your anti-mask policies will kill people, just as surely as your gun policies.

2021-09-13 13:14:23,"There is such an easy solution to all this. Health insurers would be well within bounds to deny claims filed by anyone who gets sick and chose not to get vaccinated. They can charge you a higher premium for smoking. How is this any different? Your personal choice should not affect their bottom line and the public’s health. When hospitals are full of covid, they can’t perform other important functions like do elective surgery which then effects the hospitals bottom line and makes it even harder to take care of covid patients

The personal choice crowd needs to open their wallets to pay for their decisions."

2021-09-13 13:12:34,"Hospitals in Washington should refuse to treat the unvaccinated from Idaho. The people who are refusing to be vaccinated should be ""allowed"" to die at home with little fanfare. They have no right to take hospital beds from others doing the right thing and masking and being vaccinated."
2021-09-13 13:15:31,"Republican governors like Idaho’s Governor Little try to side step their own responsibility to lead by saying that they have “urged personal responsibility” and that they hope people get vaccinated. Even if Little and others could have perhaps made that argument plausibly months ago when vaccines became available, it is beyond clear now that his citizens have chosen to act irresponsibly.  In the face of abundant evidence of the equivalent of drunk driving by a huge portion of his state, a responsible leader would act to set people straight on how viruses spread and mutate, on the value of masks, and most importantly on the value of this vaccine which is efficacious and just as safe as all the other vaccines most of these people have already had in their lives.  But, my guess is that he is too afraid of the monstrous constituency his party has created to lead."
2021-09-13 12:57:41,"So let me get this straight. Unvaccinated Idahoans become ill and invade Washington seeking treatment that was necessitated by their own poor choices and failure of their state government to properly protect the public's health. As a result, Washingtonians are unable to access proper care for non-Covid related illnesses and conditions. And, to top it off, care givers are subject to abuse by these same people and their families who insist that Idaho's lax approach to Covid should apply when they cross the border into Washington. I do hope Washington sues Idaho for the cost of treating these people. In the meantime, no more out of state admissions. Go home and take your chances with your own state health care system. This is what Idahoans voted for, and they should be required to live with the consequences."
2021-09-13 13:04:26,"Part of me feels that the deniers and defiers should suffer for their ignorance and wallow in their own problems.  They’ve spent over a year arguing against it, and spreading it around.  Or at the least they should be expected to deal with it themselves until they acknowledge that it’s a real problem.  

The more decent part of me feels that the view of ‘their crisis is our problem’ is the better way, especially for the kids who are told what to believe and don’t have any choice.  

Bailing them out only reinforces the mentality of denying reality, science, common sense, truth.  We’ve had way too much of that mentality in recent years, which has ripped the country apart.  And it won’t change until the worst of them recognize their own folly, probably through crises like this which affect them personally.  

If we all took it seriously 16 months ago we could have the economy mostly back to normal by now, kids back in school last winter, and plenty of hospital beds for those who would need them.  

At the very least, I’d like to see beds prioritized for those who are vaccinated or are too young to make their own decisions.  Maybe others should be accepted only if they acknowledge their blunder, or if their Governor institutes mandates.  It's more justifiable to leave the deniers and defiers on the sidewalk, than those who took the crisis seriously."
2021-09-13 13:18:11,"This is infuriating.  My dad recently had a surgery postponed due to our own hospitals being filled with Covid patients. According to our mayor, many are also from surrounding areas, where vaccination rates and mask usage is low. Please do more of these articles. The governors leeching off the care of citizens from other states should be held to account."
2021-09-13 13:19:28,"This issue of right or wrong boils down to whether our citizens trust medical and scientific experts and their experience and research or twitter. Regretfully, we have a segment of our population who are not informed except by those who have a  stake in being disruptive. There is a market for those who aid and abet  behavior inimical to public health. Controversy sells and it helps make some feel more important and less ignored. Some media helps fan the flames of ignorance because if it bleeds it leads."
2021-09-13 13:02:24,Cancelling elective or minor surgeries makes sense.  Serious surgeries for conditions like brain tumors that have patients suffering in misery should not be delayed because of unvaccinated patients from either state.  Unvaccinated patients should have to wait their turn for beds. They made a decision to forgo medical care when they willfully denied themselves the protection of the vaccine.  Make public announcements letting them know the new costs and limitations for their care and then let them deal with the consequences. If they don’t like it they are free to change their minds and get a shot. Possibly doctors could call their patients to deliver the news as well.
2021-09-13 12:55:43,"""Until death do you part"" is a wedding vow, it should not be a plank in a Party platform. In turning every crisis and issue into a never ending culture war, the Republican Party has chosen to turn itself into a Pied Piper of sickness and death."

Now, with the Covid pandemic at full throttle, I suggest that Washington put up a sign for those coming in by car from Idaho. It will read, ""If you have Covid, go back.""

Dr. Epperly was recently fired from the the CDH Board and then replaced with a quack who calls COVID vaccinations ""vaccine rape.""  (Yes, he actually said that.)  So you can imagine that a lot of us here feel enormous frustration and anger over this state of affairs.  I certainly understand the comments below because I share many of them.  I can only reflect on the driving force of this idiocy; namely Donald Trump and the Republicans on the national stage who are so cowardly that they will not stand up to him.  This contagion is every bit as dangerous as COVID, and it infects every state in the country.  No state is truly immune from Trump, as we can see in the election fraud allegations surrounding the California recall election.  We must never let this awful disgusting man back into the White House."

In certain situations, face masks limit the spread of Covid-19.  The Delta variant of this disease is said to be more transmissible than the original version, and more virulent, and now the dominant strain of the disease.

At this point, some people still believe all of the above is either a hoax or exaggerated.  In Idaho, people are free to ignore science, medicine, their health and the health of others.  Some take horse pills.  Some get very ill with Covid.  Hospitals in Idaho are full.  So these Idahoans go to hospitals in neighboring Washington because they believe in their illness.  For non-Covid people in Washington (and Idaho), hospital beds are now unavailable for their healthcare needs.  They can’t be patients.  This is happening around the United States.

Where is this capability hiding; does it even exist or am I just being foolish?
    and, b) What would happen if, God forbid, we should ever have a worse situation, a nuclear explosion or a new strain of Ebola, even more virulent then the original, or...?

Vaccinated patients who have non-COVID related issues should get treatment.  Willfully unvaccinated people should not. 

I understand that nurses and physicians are in a terrible situation but that vaccinated cardiac patient, that vaccinated trauma patient, that vaccinated cancer patient all deserve the skills of the medical professionals whereas an unvaccinated person who ""had done their research"", refused the jab, and then got sick only deserves sympathy for their stupidity.

Some stubborn Americans have brought a whole new meaning to the popular slogan ""Live Free or Die""... it's really sad to witness the mass social ignorance show itself so blatantly in the US....

The problem with Gov Little is he has no spine. The far right, especially our Lt Gov has been infected with the same Trumpian anti-vaccine nonsense, and if he were to put these measures in place the legislature would likely over turn it, and Little would undeniably lose the next election.

One of my physician colleagues in northern Idaho told me yesterday that a patient almost died on her because they were out of set ups to administer high flow oxygen. The patient lived after they borrowed equipment from a neighboring hospital. My colleague's further comments: 
""We don’t “have trouble transferring critical care patients”. We just can’t transfer ANYONE. We have transferred 2 patients in the last 3 weeks I’ve been aware of. Both took hours to almost a day- 1 was a ROSC after cardiac arrest, the other a patient with Covid on high flow when we RAN OUT OF OXYGEN. Things we’ve kept- massive PE, gallbladders without ability to do surgery, seizing patients, 13 cm abdominal wall abscess without ability to drain, volvulus also no surgery for a day or two, large diabetic foot ulcer needing wound care, infected pancreatic pseudo cysts, NSTEMI needing cath lab, people on multiple pressors, etc. Our nurses have been true super stars but they’re not staffed for acuity here. I know it’s bad everywhere, but when it’s just you and two RNs to take care of 10-15 patients on the floor plus whatever comes in through the ER, knowing there is no help, no outside back up, just figure something out, it’s really lonely and really scary."""

When COVID first hit and Washington set out its various mandates to close/limit business, Washington residents flowed across the border to Idaho to seek out entertainment (golf, swimming, boating), restaurants that were still open and other activities.  If you look closely, the Spokane County-Kootenai County (Spokane-Coeur d'Alene) COVID numbers are usually fairly close as are the Asotin-Nez Perce numbers (Clarkston-Lewiston).  Plus there are MANY people crossing every day for work.  For good or bad, we really are in this together."

What we have are states where politicians and huge numbers of people believe in absolute constitutional freedom, taking absolutely no responsibility for the health and lives of other people. Next door, we have politicians and people who believe in freedom, but also believe that with freedom comes responsibility. I think perhaps the most important lesson of democracy I learned growing up is that, yes, I have freedom in the United States, but with freedom I accept responsibility for using it to help to support the common good. Right now, America is seriously out of whack. Finally, this is, to me, precisely the kind of behavior that Republican Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. was once compelled to call out when he wrote an opinion in 1919 in which he said that  ""falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic"" is not protected speech under the First Amendment."

Unfortunately, it didn't take long to realize we had entered a cultural Twilight Zone. Few people wore masks. Indeed, people stood close in groups while talking with others. We went to a restaurant, and found no outside seating, but a maskless hostess who seated us among others who didn't wear masks. At the height of a Covid wave, being in Idaho was like being in a land where everyone simply imagined Covid never existed. To say it was creepy is an understatement. We went to a grocery store, and bought groceries, then stuffed that little refrigerator in the motel for a three day stay wile we waited for the smoke to clear in Oregon. While there, I went to a park to stand outside and practice my violin. A man came over to listen. When he learned I was from Portland he said, ""Portland, eh? Well, we vote Red around here."" I pointed out that Red or Blue, we are all Americans, and I hoped we could work together to solve our problems. Once the smoke cleared in Portland, we left Idaho. Weeks later, as is the case now, Idaho hospitals were flying Covid patients to Seattle and Salt Lake City. Looking at this article, it's clear that even after a year of this, even after having a vaccine, the land where they pretend Covid isn't real still lives in its own enigmatic Twilight Zone."

Instead we have states like Florida, who gobbled up about a third of national delivered supply of Regeneron REGN-COV2..."
2021-09-13 14:23:12,"In July, the two largest healthcare providers in Idaho, St Luke’s and St Alphonsus, made Covid vaccination mandatory for all staff throughout the state. 

Medical professionals continue to provide care to every human who comes to our hospital emergency departments. For whatever reason they come. This is a moral, ethical, and legal imperative. 

When a health district institutes crisis protocol standards, this gives the healthcare providers the legal authority to employ more strict rules of triage.  If you don’t know what those strict rules of triage are, you should read up on your local hospital’s own emergency triage rules. You may be surprised. With Covid, crisis triage factors in the age of potential patients for admittance.  How old are you? How old are your loved ones? 

I’m reading many comments that say “Deny medical care to unvaccinated. They are non compliant. Let them die.” 
I hope people realize that there’s a good chance that they themselves would be denied medical care if we acted like that. 
Most people are non compliant with some of their doctors recommendations. 

People put up signs by their houses “Hate has no place here.”  Don’t just virtue signal with that sign. Live it in your own life.

2021-09-13 14:17:26,"The answer is always money. 
The easiest way to get people to comply with health directives would be to stop covering health care expenses for COVID treatment for all those who are not vaccinated. Because the government had indicated they would cover the costs of COVID treatment a situation of moral hazard has been created for all those Yahoo’s who think COVId is a hoax, they never get sick, blah, blah, blah, blah.  When they do get sick their not on the hook for the full amount of their own medical care.  If a few of them got a $350,000.00 med bill for a couple of weeks in the hospital that would certainly motivated the other anti vaxers to get a vaccine. Also start charging  $1000.00 per vaccine shot for everyone who hasn’t been vaccinated yet, stop giving them away for free.  People don’t really appreciate the goods in life until they have to pay.  Also the Republican governors are taking advantage of the policy of the US government picking up the tab. Let some of their hospitals go bankrupt caring for COVID patients, instead of making money off COVID treatment.Republican governors think they can rely on their constituent’s ideas of“ personal responsibility”  then let them do it, but why should the US government and federal tax payers foot the bill."

Translation of the Governor’ actions: 1) Don’t ask me any questions that will embarrass me because ...  2) I have abdicated my responsibility to protect the health of my constituents in Idaho. 3) Furthermore, I will do everything in my power to resist scientifically proven measures to protect people’s lives and health."

Life was unbelievably hard, but Rosie made sure everyone of her kids went to college.  The baby in the hospital became a surgeon and worked at Sacred Heart in Spokane.

They don't take care of their population and expect the Blue states to fill their own hospitals. They refuse programs such as Medicaid and the Affordable Care act, yet expect federal dollars to support their health care systems in other ways. Other ways like abortion services. They will deny these services to the families in their state, knowing the women will travel to Blue states for this care. Florida, Louisiana, and even Texas, are happy to receive disaster funds and federal help to rebuild after some disaster, while spouting the nonsense of ""drowning the government in a bathtub"".

But the article does not say the main thing. We have no idea how many people have covid in Idaho. Do you know why? Because you still cannot get a covid test without a doctor’s order. We are a poor and underinsured state, and most people do not want to know whether they have covid, because they don’t want to add to the numbers. You only “see” them when they are hospitalized. That is why Idaho looks so puzzlingly not red on the NYTimes map of cases. As far as I know, we’re the only state where this is true.

Governor, how about /you/ take some personal responsibility for your job and actually lead your state? Management 101: if persuasion doesn't work, penalties. If penalties don't work, a cudgel. If the cudgel doesn't work: termination.

The patient expressed more contempt  when discharged from ED thinking they ""deserved"" a highly coveted hospital bed when their symptoms didn't warrant one. Sadly, when discharged, the patient was told to isolate and took off their mask once outside. Another patient said they didn't want COVID mentioned anywhere in their medical record. Seriously? Not going to happen. That patient now deceased (mid 40's was otherwise healthy). The arrogance is astounding.   At this stage of pandemic, empathy is hard to find for anti-vax, anti-mask COVID patients who are angry, spiteful and filled with contempt toward healthcare workers. Frankly, we are happy to see those folks have a ""celestial discharge."" Clears the bed for someone else. Sad but true."

They need our tax dollars to pave and plow their roads, they need our wealthy to pay property taxes at their lake houses and ski condos, they need our airport and our roads, and now they need to crowd our hospitals with their plague.

Given the low levels of income that pervade Northern Idaho, the state's refusal to expand health insurance, and the cost of treating covid, I have no doubt that our hospitals will be left holding a huge financial burden, that we will all have to make up with higher costs down the road.

Put aside 10 percent of your beds for unvaccinated COVID patients and move on once they're full. Don't waste time or energy on guilt.

While I totally understand the sentiment and am equally angry at these selfish people, this is a dangerous precedent to set. Should we also not pay for the diabetes treatments and heart disease of people who refuse to go on a diet to lose weight? What about cancer treatment for smokers? Should we also refuse to care for the children of parents who refused to do genetic counseling, and decided to have children with genetic conditions such as cystic fibrosis? Maybe we shouldn't pay for children's healthcare or maternity care at all since some don't choose to have children. We're all in this together and not a single one of us are 100% responsible and 100% capable of caring for ourselves in a crisis.

It is difficult to know what to do in order to try to influence states to do the right thing so that all of us can be protected.  It saddens me deeply that so many seem to think that the ultimate expression of their freedom leads to death for others.  As I have tried to figure out what to do, the only conclusion I can come up with is to vote with my dollars.   I love to visit Idaho and other Covid-States for athletic events or other recreation, but I've decided I won't.  I'm one person, and the impact may be negligible, but maybe if more of us from states that are actually taking Covid seriously choose to not go to Disney World, not go to the Grand Canyon, not visit the Covid-States, maybe we can collectively make a difference.

We have the president, the CDC, the NIH, members of Congress, judges, state governors, local mayors, private businesses and now even school boards setting policy. We have, as a result, become covid's best friend. One state's stupidity becomes another state's problems. This is NUTS! 

All of which begs the question of what we would do if we were ever invaded by a foreign military. Would governors be directing their national guard, other governors negotiating, local police forces abandoning their posts while others telling their citizens to shoot on sight? 

Any foreign adversary viewing our total lack of coordination must see this as a dream come true. No need to invest in bombs or cyber-technology. Just focus on the bio-weapons facilities."
2021-09-13 15:18:58,"Hospitals and clinics that are unable to safely meet the health care needs of their areas should close.
Maybe it's time to tear down our health care ""system"", and recreate it.
An ex-nurse, I abhor the capitalization of our health care.
As evidenced by: Hospitals and clinics no longer run by doctors but by holders of MFAs. Physicians and nurses and all other staff now considered mere employees without say in patient care protocols and long-range planning. The outsourcing of vital hospital and clinical services and entire departments. The business management practice of ""on-time delivery"" extended far beyond the stockroom and into the hiring and training of staff, no longer maintaining empty beds in case of emergency or disaster, down to determining the number and allotment of parking spaces. The capitalist control mentality behind closing community clinics and hospitals, with centralization of care focused on a single mega-facility or a tight string of specialized monoliths unable to care for patients who, say, don't have cancer or need a colonoscopy. The abandoning of community hospitals once funded by local donations, and instead chasing bulk-funding -- first from patients, then insurance companies and the govt -- the corruption of health care as Big Business, rather than institutions committed, first and foremost, to meeting health care needs and the common good. The HUGE salaries and bonuses paid to the directors and presidents of hospitals and ""health care systems""."

The Interior Health Region of BC is now struggling with higher case rates. According to the dashboard at the BCCDC, the reporting district just north of the Idaho border has the lowest vaccination rate in the province (69%), with the exception of a few areas in the northeast of the province, which are on the eastern side of the Rockies and culturally more similar to Alberta than BC. However, even they have well over 50% vaccination rates. 

The border between Idaho and BC is closed to the unvaccinated, but these things are never 100% effective, and it would be best to deal with the root cause. So I’m wishing Joe Biden good luck as well."

2021-09-13 15:16:49,"I recall not so long ago, the GOP was up in arms over Obamacare, specifically that it would create “death panels” which would decide who would get care and who wouldn’t. 

“… care rationing could mean having to decide which patients get priority for oxygen or ventilators.”

Now, the GOP has created its own de facto “death panels” due to their unwillingness to implement necessary public health measures that would make a huge difference. And of course all the simpletons who deny what they see with their own eyes all around them gleefully thumb their noses. 

My own suggestion would be that those living in Idaho, Texas, and other non-compliant states, live by my grandmother’s words: You made your bed; now lie in it."

Libertarianism and “personal responsibility” just seem to be other terms for selfishness.  The “free market” has been shown to be largely a fantasy after the comprehensive public bailouts of 2008.  I pay taxes, buy liability insurance on my property and automobiles not just to protect myself but also everyone else that I may come into contact with even fleetingly.  Is wearing a mask, getting vaccinated against Covid 19, influenza, measles, rubella, pertussis or polio any different?  My HOA has rules that require me to water and cut my grass, so why is mask wearing or getting vaccinated to end a life threatening pandemic so difficult to accept?"

Providence has a large hospital system across Washington, Idaho and Montana. When the local Providence hospital can’t provide a service, patients are directed to Seattle. It’s the way things work in the sparsely populated parts of the country. 

That said, many of the citizens of northern Idaho aren’t doing their share, but they haven’t been for a long time. Many don’t vaccinate their kids against anything, so a whooping cough outbreak strains the system.

This G.O.P. governor merely resorts to public expressions of milquetoast suggestions to vaccinate and wear masks. No mandates. Let other states, including Washington, admit unvaccinated residents whose self denial and refusal placed them in their tragic position in the first place. President Biden is absolutely positively right to express open condemnation of Republican governors, acting in concert, stand in the way of national efforts to save lives and rebuild our economy. The Idaho governor has the unmitigated gall and the sheer audacity to plead for medical and health care providers from Democratic governed states to pick up the cost of care for the self deniers and adamantly refuse to mandate mask wearing and promote vaccinations. When hospitals are confronted with the grim task of choosing to care for vaccinated persons, and deny unvaccinated persons admission, maybe, just maybe, G.O.P. governors will see the light. When insurance carriers increase premiums on unvaccinated clientele, maybe, just maybe, those persons will see the light.

This would require a change in the operating rules for hospitals, but we need to bring home the reality of the situation to the holdouts who refuse to believe that Covid is serious.

""Who's gonna pay for all this?""

I can imagine that some of these people have employer provided health insurance that's going to end up footing the bill. This probably implies that, since the CEO of the healthcare system will ""need"" their multi-million dollar salary and bonus, in addition to paying out all these claims, the costs for coverage are going to rise and/or they are going to find more ways to extract money from plan members. Higher co-pays, higher co-insurance, or less stuff covered. All because they wanted ""freedom"" from a FDA approved vaccination.

For those that don't have coverage, since there's no longer a mandate/penalty for the ACA, I can imagine many of these folks have no healthcare coverage. This means someone's getting stuck with a bill. So it's going to go on Medicaid's tab, or the hospital's going to end up eating the bill, or the patient's spouse/family ends up with tens (hundreds? hundreds of thousands?) of thousands of medical debt if they die. If they live, not only will they be under that crushing mountain of debt, but they are likely to have follow-on complications and disabilities that will required additional care (taxpayer $$$) and might even qualify them for disability checks (taxpayer $$$). I'm betting a lot declare bankruptcy. Which, like the ""I have insurance"" people above, could have likely been avoided with a shot that is widely available and free of charge (to them)."

But commentators who want to outright deny medical care to unvaccinated people are pretty funny. They don’t realize that a major component of Covid crisis triage is sorting people into age groups. Age.  Older people are less likely to respond to treatment, older bodies are less resilient. Triage does sort people by age.

    It's all about power for these people. Little was not a bad person but he's becoming one in his refusal to protect the citizens he has sworn to serve. McGeachin is dumb as a rock but highly ambitious -- our homegrown version of Sarah Palin. Our Democratic representatives in the state legislature are excellent, but they are so outnumbered that they can't bring about any substantive legislation. 
    The Idaho Legislature refused, for more than five years, to expand Medicaid. They didn't want to accept federal dollars and thought the poor should just get another job. It finally passed, due to a citizen initiative. So then the legislature passes a law making citizen initiatives almost impossible to do. This is how our elected Republican ""leaders"" think.

But no big deal if they don't do the responsible thing.  Just imagine if drunk drivers killed twelve people per day, which is the average seven day covid death rate in Idaho."

You yourselves are refusing to take your personal health and community responsibilities seriously in this crisis. Live free or die - isn't that the motto? Looks like you may get both.

2021-09-13 15:34:31,"We are over 1.5 years into this pandemic. The magical thinking by Republican governors that folks will “do the right thing” doesn’t hold water anymore. They are too cowardly to do the right thing, so their constituents continue to die unnecessarily and their health care systems are at the breaking point. President Biden has the fortitude to call for a vaccine mandate and they attack him. 

If left to these republican governors, we will be living this nightmare for years to come. Its time for some tough love, we have no patience left for those holding us hostage."

2021-09-13 15:54:27,"1. The government of Idaho, and the state’s right-wing vaccine refusers, are a mooch. 

2. And so are the anti-vaxx right-wingers across the border in Washington: a mooch. 

3. Actually they’re worse than an honest mooch: Wimpy never infected anybody.

4. Whatever your thoughts might be about the health care system: no system in the world, and no conceivable system, can cope with these caseloads.

5. Vaccination and masking are essential, if hospitals are going to be able to work.

Oh, and special bonus: before the pandemic, forty or fifty percent of our health care spending went to people who were fat, or had untreated high blood pressure, or unchecked diabetes, or heart disease, or something similar. A big chunk of the rest went to people who demanded every pill or procedure under the sun, or to insanities like those amazing 22-week preemies and the amazing 99 year old dementia patients on ventilators.

So if you’re wondering why your premiums and deductibles are as they are, well, it ain’t mainly what the CEO gets paid, obnoxious as that is."

Those who choose not to be vaccinated do so because they believe the lies they hear about the vaccine.  My anger is reserved for platforms that promote vaccine falsehoods- Facebook, Parler, YouTube, Reddit, Twitter and many others- but my anger is especially reserved for Fox News, Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity in particular.  Fox could have done much to encourage their viewers to trust and get the vaccine, but instead the lies they promote make them complicit in the preventable deaths of thousands of people.  And the advertisers who continue to sponsor these ""talking heads"" are complicit too. I find it sickening that large corporations continues to support Fox News with millions of dollars in advertising revenue."

When reckless behavior leads to predictable outcomes, we have to step back and let them reap the consequences of the actions they've sown. 

As the article states(and numerous examples happen everywhere in this country), people who need medical treatment who are taking precautions, getting vaccinated, wearing masks are being denied/delayed treatment-and in some cases dying. And it would not happen if not for the petulant and selfish who now need those hospital beds.

The trolley car dilemma posits that either choice leads to someone dying. But make no mistake-this is not that dilemma. On one set of tracks, we have innocent people, and on the other set of tracks, we have rabidly defiant people who have been warned countless times, told to get off the tracks and been offered a way off the tracks because the covid train is coming through. When people want to face down an oncoming train, we don't divert it to accommodate their whims at the peril of everyone else."

If people in Idaho refuse to get vaccinated, get ill as a result, and we take them into our health care system --- how do we protect our own dwindling resources? Nobody is saying turn them away, but people in Idaho including the governor should  put on their big boy or big girl pants and deal with your own crises of your own making."

Those who do have a bed may not get a place in the I.C.U., as they normally would. The hospital has begun canceling elective procedures and is proceeding only with those that are urgent, Dr. Getz said. Procedures to excise brain tumors and treat orthopedic injuries are among those that have been postponed, he said.

“We are delaying care for people who are in misery,” Dr. Getz said. “It’s agonizing for those patients. This has real impacts on these people who are waiting.”

I genuinely think it's time for a crisis standard that factors in vaccine and mask refusal. Let medical professionals concentrate on helping people who listen to medical advice about the prevention of disease. Those who don't, perhaps a tent clinic in the parking lot?

We cannot deny people emergency life-saving medicine for any reason. That choice is beyond the pale. 

Nobody should have the power to decide when someone else deserves to live or die. Even if one favors the death penalty, people get a trial before they're convicted.  

Who are we going to deny? An irresponsible teenager who didn't bother? An elderly woman who has had her cultish children scaring her with crazy misinformation that right wing media squawks into the ears of people in these regions? A person who is vaccine hesitant because of the history of brutal racist experimentation? The many mentally ill people who are easy targets for the purveyors paranoid conspiracy theories?

Two main reasons the US has had such trouble controlling the pandemic are 1) our piecemeal healthcare system and 2) our deepening social rifts.  Undermining fundamentals of public health and accessible medicine in a way that deepens social rifts will only make us more vulnerable in the future.

My fellow sane people I *implore* you to maintain your commitment to basic human rights--the 20th century's greatest invention. Human rights are possessed by every human--even the worst.  If we cast them aside we throw away our civilization's hardest-won lessons."

Let the chickens roost."

Washington state would do well to put limits on number of Idaho covid transfers until Idaho adopts mask mandates like Washington does to mitigate covid spread.
Freedom and consequences go hand in hand.  
Time for Democrats to force Republican governors to face the music - let the GOP unveil their health care death panels to cope with covid mismanagement.
Republicans must face the harsh truth of covid; freedom from masks combined with vaccine hesitancy is a death sentence for many.  Time to choose wisely.  If not RIP - in your own state; don't clog up blue state hospitals."

When people think that their wishes by themselves can affect things, that is magical thinking. When the expect some deity to alter natural forces to benefit themselves, that is magical thinking. Magical thinking results in unexpected outcomes because those thinking that way are not really paying attention.

Personal freedom asserts the ability to choose actions which will produce intended outcomes. Many think that is just means escaping responsibilities. The personal freedom assertions here are just people thinking that they can evade what they do not want by appealing to some social contract memorialized in a document which founded a state."
2021-09-13 16:29:41,"Eastern Washington (where I'm from, and have parents in Spokane still), and North Idaho (where I have lots of family too) have far more in common with each other culturally and politically than they do with the more populated areas of their respective states. To attribute the situation to policies set by officials in the Olympia (Seattle) and Boise population centers is a stretch. 

Spokane, WA and Kootenai County, ID are essentially one highly-integrated metro area, far removed from the population centers of Seattle or Boise. For example, Spokane airport is the only commercial airport serving North Idaho. People shop, live, and get medical care on both sides of the state line. Spokane has always been the main economic, transport, and healthcare service center for the entire region. Coeur d'Alene Idaho (a beautiful lake resort town) is visited by thousands of Spokane residents every day.

I know there are political and cultural differences between the two states, but the current situation in that area has far less to do with the technical policy or political differences on either side of that state line, and more to do with the unique distribution of people - Spokane being much larger than the smaller towns on the Idaho side."
2021-09-13 16:07:38,"Why are these people who refuse to be vaccinated then showing up at hospitals crying ""save me, save me""?  At this point, people who won't take a simple step to protect themselves should not expect rescue."
2021-09-13 16:08:36,"Freedom of choice? I think the idea of no insurance compensation for any medical bills accrued is a fine way to go about this if you are one to refuse the vaccination for Covid and then get sick. We all know freedom comes at a cost. Don't we? Well, that's the lesson right there. Medical experts and Biden etc have tried to educate the population. But, as Mom and Dad taught me, there is nothing like first hand experience to teach you a life (or death) situation."
2021-09-13 16:25:25,"No unvaccinated adult with Coronavirus from Idaho should be accepted in a Washington Hospital. Deferring brain surgery for those with functioning brains in favor of intubating vaccine deniers with clearly non-functioning brains is medical malpractice.

Children too young to be vaccinated and those 12 and up who were prohibited vaccines by their guardians with Coronavirus should be accepted. 

There is no reason to punish good people with medical needs in Washington State for those in Idaho who have shown heartless, willed disregard for their own health and the health of those around them. These adults freely elected their existing governor and his death-wish politics. They can deal with the consequences of their own actions."
2021-09-13 16:19:50,"The Idaho governor and his like-minded colleagues that do not believe in masking or other covid safety protocols need to immediately be put on the front lines of treating covid patients in the hospitals and medical centers. Gown them all up and get them to work, drawing blood, assisting in the ICU’s, cleaning toilets, helping feed the patients, anything that can help the patients and those treating them. Maybe after 5 minutes of a dose of this reality they will change their tune and rejoin the real world. It is beyond incredible at this stage of the covid crisis that individuals such as the Governor of Idaho and his like-minded colleagues are still fighting the safety protocols to protect their constituents. So I say get them intimately involved in cleaning up the horrific situation they created."
2021-09-13 16:06:05,"It feels like the red party has become to desperate to sabotage the country under Biden that they are weaponizing the bodies of the constituents.  These non prime physical specimens with disbelief of science are duped into thinking that they need to not wear masks and clump together.  Next they become hosts to a lethal virus, and pass it around so that the virus can mutate into a worse virus.  Then, the bodies of the constituents are sent around the country to physically block health care to others and no doubt spread the virus more.   It is like a zombie attack.  I agree with the comments in this thread about not giving free health care to those who knowingly put themselves at risk.  Biden should go beyond OSHA basis for vaccine mandates.  This incubation of disease  and transfer of virus laden people is a national emergency in terms of its danger to all."
2021-09-13 16:13:25,"A straightforward bipartisan conversation is in order, to extirpate politics from a health issue.

 At the national level, Biden should change his message: rather than mandating masks to ""protect the vaccinated against the unvaccinated,"" which is illogical, he should urge mandates to protect the vulnerable children under 12 who cannot yet be vaccinated and those unable to be vaccinated due to medical ailments. The message should become: stop killing the children; take the d--- vaccine.

V.P. Harris should be accountable, for making this into a political issue when she opined that she would be wary to take a ""Trump vaccine."" She should apologize for those words heard by all of us, including dismayed Dems, and emphasize that this should not become a partisan issue but solely a health issue.

Some doctors, including my own doctor in Miami, have announced over national television that they will no longer treat the unvaccinated. This may be a bridge too far, considering that it may violate the Hippocratic Oath. However, when considering factors regarding who gets the lung transplant, the fact that a person is unvaccinated should be taken into consideration when measured against a rival candidate who fills the same boxes, including the vaccination box.

 Republican dominated Miami promulgates the notion that blacks are dying in disproportionately greater numbers because of culture rather than admit it's no health insurance, no doctors serving them in Death Santis' state."

He sat in the waiting room chair for 12 hours and could barely keep from collapsing. The lines were long and there were 40 people ahead of him. When he finally got examined, he was sent home at midnight because they had no bed for him.  Health care workers kept telling us: next time call 911; at least he'll get a bed in an ambulance.  I am disgusted with our Idaho neighbors and governor. I am proud of our Washington governor. It saddens me that Idaho, a stunningly beautiful state has become filled with such vile and selfish people."

Insurance companies need to start issuing notices that premiums are going to increase significantly for non-vaccinated  members.

Personal choice, freedom to decide ends when it affects another.  It is time to make tough decisions and if Idaho doesn't have enough beds, then either set up more or triage but do not send these patients elsewhere.  There are always consequences and these people who choose not to get vaccinated and then get Covid, need to man up and accept their fate.  I know brutal but I am frustrated how these people are ruining things for everyone else.  Enough already."

After they are fully cared for, then and only then should the healthcare system treat people with Covid 19 who didn’t get vaccinated.

2021-09-13 16:04:37,"THINK CAUSE AND EFFECT:
Being helpful to someone who has an accident is reasonable but Being benevolent has its limits. There should be some way that a state that opens its hospital doors to non-state citizens can immediately get US federal dollars that were earmarked for the home state released to hospitalizing state without even going to a court. Then the states will be paying for the care that they refused to give or for any other reason could not/would not provide. Careful Washingtonians should not have could-care-less Idahoans plundering their tax coffers. I am not for feeding my enemy so he can get well to attack me again nor even getting a drunk sober enough to get more booze and get behind the wheel and kill again. Enough.

It is beyond conscience that South Dakota sponsors Biker Rally and then, in 1 month afterwards, all the other states & Canada get a mushroom Covid surge. When the Biker Rally was held, the US had less than 20K infections per day and it is no coincident that the viral surge soon followed. This Effect we are seeing did not just happen. SD went from almost nil cases to over 500% increase in cases within a month of that event and then it spread from there.

What we are seeing is a cascade of CAUSES AND EFFECTS and it is not near over, according to Dr Fauci, ""We are nowhere neat containment.""

2021-09-13 16:04:00,"I own a small medical clinic in Spokane across the border.  In northern Idaho and parts of rural WA and MT there is almost a religious devotion and zeal to the idea that COVID is not real or not a threat and that all the problems are due to government imposed restrictions.  The more they are pushed the deeper the devotion gets. It's almost like with traditional religion and other senses of community breaking down over the last few decades that now being part of this ""COVID is fake"" group has given people a sense of community and something to rally around.  Almost like being part of this group gives them ""something to live for"" even though the effect is the opposite.  It's beyond disturbing if you actually sit with that idea.  I moved from the southern US to get away from these types but seems like the modern age is no protection from magical thinking and this is part of our DNA as a nation at this point."

Washington and other states should simply bill states not enacting public health mandates for the full cost of care it is providing to the citizens of these states.  I am fully vaccinated and follow public health measures stringently, but I shudder to think how these commenters would respond to the needs of my too young to be vaccinated child if I lived in a red state and they became ill.

First, the federal government needs to expand its marketing effort. Just like the WAR BOND effort paid for WWII, Biden should expand the role of agencies to get the word out. Second, where personal liability can be proven, affected parties should sue the offenders. Third, at the government level, Governors like Abbott of Texas, DeSantis of Florida and Ducey or Arizona need to investigated by Justice and charged. Said investigation should be public so all of the other Trump wannabees will think twice. Last, but not least, Justice needs to go to the root of the evil which is Trump.

Virulent Covid mutations are more possible among the unvaccinated - so the unvaccinated are causing far more harm than simply being spreaders of the current variant and burdens on health resources.  

Every measure possible needs to be deployed to stop the insanity of the red state death cults. Once again, Biden is showing more clear thinking and strength than any of his recent predecessors by deploying sticks in addition to carrots to require Covid vaccinations with only validated health exemptions.  Private insurers, employers and schools need to step up as well.

Even cop killers get medical treatment. Society pays the medical costs... We all pay the medical costs.

So we also need to treat sickened Covid deniers from states who are still in the state of denial. But every time a child is made ill by their selfish behavior, and every time a citizen of one of states perishes from this preventable disease, we need to shame these organized Covid Deniers who are often led by elected officials. Photos of the Covid dead need to be posted on the lawns of the governors' houses in these backward states. News media need to have the names the dead on hand and use them during these press interviews with these officials. Especially of the children...

Obviously, there are no limits on the human ability to deny the obvious or to refuse fallibility. And apparently, that breath-taking stubbornness and ignorance are given quarter -- and even encouraged -- in large swaths of the country.

He and the Republican legislatures are too busy wasting our tax payer dollars on lawsuits that never go anywhere.  Prolife?  Ha!!  Fiscal responsibility?  What a joke!  

President Biden arrives today to support the front line workers fighting all of the wildfires.  Governor Little's gratitude is how can I blame Biden for our Covid numbers.

In addition, he has one small child with another on the way in three months.    He also stated that it was the healthcare systems operating in Idaho that has caused this problem and that they are the ones at fault. REALLY?!

This friend of mine struck me as the poster  child for what is  occurring there! He should know better and lead by example being a physician. A great disservice is being done by his attitude or both his family and his patients.

I am so done with anit-vaxxers. Their “ buyer’s remorse” upon getting infected is too little too late. It is inconceivable that these ignorant people are taking beds away from those who really need them and deserve the care NOT THOSE WASHINTONIANS who live in the state!

We can never become like them, and maybe that's the bigger message."

Have if not the responsibility then at least the basic decency not to demand medical care from people whose cautious behavior your rejected and mocked.

Personal responsibility means take two aspirins and stay at home."
2021-09-13 16:41:48,"Stories like this are at the heart of the outrage felt by the vaccinated who see the unvaccinated as freeloading leeches demanding special treatment.

This is the creed of American conservatives, who emphasize the importance self interest and personal freedom and downplay the interests of society and the common good. For those responsible American adults who choose to exercise their personal freedom by refusing free COVID vaccinations, perhaps healthcare should be limited to comfort care at home, where nature is permitted to run its course, without further medical intervention."

2021-09-13 16:51:49,"We keep having a cyclical bioethics discussion regarding rationing care for the unvaccinated. In my opinion it is not unethical to limit care for those who made a conscious decision to omit vaccination. It is unethical to not provide full and proper care to those who are in the hospital due to accident, injury, cancer, etc. Crisis care should enable this to occur. Patients should also be charged the full amount of their stay. I left medicine and have no desire to go back. The amount of abuse HCW are dealing with is staggering. Suicide is increasing rapidly. 

Your “freedoms” do not mean you can harm others. Just as you have consequences for drinking, driving drunk, and causing an accident, so too should those who get gravely ill from a preventable disease. Those consequences mean the rationing of care includes sending you gone with hospice care"

I don't want to hear about rules hospitals have to follow. No one is following the rules."
2021-09-13 17:00:44,Lets not forget that the overworked doctors and nurses will be forced to skimp on the care and make a lot more mistakes - long before the hospital administrators acknowledge the problems and shut down transfers.

Why should other people die because of these folks ""freedoms""?"
2021-09-13 16:49:31,Our country has the capability of setting up tent hospitals and has done so in every warzone in my lifetime. The unvaccinated with covid need to be placed in separate facilities outside of mainstream medical care.

All that equipment and care being concentrated on a patient who lungs just can't get them the oxygen they need.  In many cases a good and functioning body before Covid-19 and now a basic function of our respiratory system (our life system) just failing.  It is difficult to grasp.    

I'm lucky to be alive.  70 years old and I could have caught Covid-19 before the vaccination became available just a short time ago, March / April of 2021.  If I need a booster shot in the future, just tell me when and where and I'll be right over."

I had to be carried out by other hikers and a volunteer Search and Rescue team. I am fully vaccinated, but was asked for permission to be carried by people who were not. We all wore masks. Two ambulances arrived and a decision had to be made where to take me. The closest hospital was full of Covid patients, so I was taken to a different town that had room in its ER. This event made clear to me that the shortage of hospital beds due to Covid is all too real.

If your right wing loudmouthed uncle kept driving on a suspended license, and calling on you to come bail him out when he was arrested, how many times would you do it before you told him he needed to deal with the concequences of his choices? 

As long as we keep propping Idaho up for its politician's caring more about reelection than people's lives, it has no reason to have mask mandates or seriously invest in getting its populace vaccinated. 

Meanwhile, Washingtonians who need ""elective"" procedures, such as getting a knee replaced so you can walk, or removing a giant painful but not immediately life threatening tumor are suffering.

Hospital administrators (i.e., the Death Panels) are having to decide which of the patients receive care because of a lack of overall supplies (e.g., beds, ventilators, PPE, nurses, doctors) due to COVID deniers and anti-vaxxers overwhelming the medical system due to not choosing a medically proven remedy. Thus, the Republican created Death Panels should place these types of patients last in line for death preventing care. Makes perfect sense to me!"

I would not be torn if the crisis in Idaho was not of their own making. Because they shot themselves in the foot (and continue to do so), I feel compelled to charge them for the medical care that Washington gives them, in part because of the opportunity cost of that care for Washingtonians who depend on those hospitals in actual emergencies."

2021-09-13 16:00:55,"Most of those who choose not to be vaccinated are bettering that they will either not become infected or they will not become seriously ill, let alone die.  There is evidence to suggest that this is not irrational as the numbers tell us. That is the calculus we are dealing with here.  Putting the unvaccinated at the end of the line for care probably won't change their thinking and is unethical. 

Ironically, the concept of insurance is all about you betting you will get sick and the insurance company is betting that you do not.   The insurance company wins enough to cover its losses.  The insured win---a catastrophic hospital bill can wipe out a lifetime of financial planning even for the insured.  The unvaccinated will not change their bets.

The link between Covid and its medical and financial consequences is lacking.  A simple vaccine shot(s) improves the odds and is paid for by the Federal Government.  This is why it is so frustrating."
2021-09-13 17:49:33,"A lot of folks here in eastern WA owe their lives to the fact that Seattle is in our state.  It's not like the people in eastern WA are any different in their attitudes from ID.  The divide is more urban-rural and Spokane is one of the most conservative small urban areas in the country.  WA has a much higher vaccination rate because of the high rate in the Puget Sound area with its relatively huge population.  The vaccination rate in eastern WA is similar to ID.

The mandates are successful even in rural WA and places like Spokane because it puts the onus on the Governor, making it easy for the vast majority to wear masks even if they, or their friends and family privately rail against the ""tyranny"".  It's always a good excuse to be following the law and almost everyone does.

Would you attempt a tally of Republican covid deaths over Democratic deaths?  A rough estimate might be obtained by assuming 60% of covid deaths are unvaccinated republicans.
Applying this to the current tally indicates 132,000 more Republican voters lost than Democrats.  Hooray!
Keep it going!  The midterms are only 14 months away."

Ironically, north Idaho used to be a Democratic stronghold with a strong pro-labor ethic but then the Nazis moved in.  Yes, there are progressive, responsible people in Idaho but overall the citizenry has a limited world view which creates a ""it's your misfortune and none of my own.""  Having a high-school diploma is all most Idahoans aspire to and living in the same town surrounded by your kids and grandkids is the high mark of success.  They can't really envision a bigger picture, one that includes setting aside individual needs for a collective good."

2021-09-13 17:39:08,"Most of the unvaccinated made a choice not to seek available preventive measures. While having complied with requirements for all other vaccinations for school and workplaces. 
Why ask for treatment of the same science when you clearly chose the risk to be sick instead?  You taking up  the place of someone who actually needs treatment and did not choose that risk.
The view of ‘it won’t happen to me’ is not a product of independent thinking— This view is held by the duped, putting  their heads in the sand and pretending the virus can’t see you."
2021-09-13 18:08:54,"Isn't this yet another instance of the transfer of 'blue state' resources to 'red states' that fail to provide for community needs? If the unvaccinated and their elected leaders have a death wish then why should they be bailed out by communities that are working hard to protect themselves and their futures, including health care workers who shouldn't have to endure this risk and burden."
2021-09-13 18:16:28,"It is truly outrageous that Idaho citizens think they can be treated in Washington if they refuse to take any measures to prevent the transmission of the virus.

In the furniture stores, mask use was marginal. a few employees wore them, even fewer customers. We did wear ours.

Anyone who thinks their freedoms are being stepped on consider this:

The possible Covid outcomes for YOU without a vaccine are:

Didn’t get sick, but might later on.
Got sick, but toughed it out at home.
Got really sick, hospital, $80,000 bill, financial ruin. But survived it.
Got extremely sick , hospital, icu, ventilator, died, left family with $125,000 hospital bill.

Bright future eh?

Life involves making good choices. 

Some are “grown ups” and get vaccinated, wear masks. 
Some are clueless and introduce terrible risk into their life, their familes and to others. 

Choose wisely."

2021-09-13 18:16:10,Just say no. Idaho needs to deal with the situation they created and innocent victims should sue the state.
2021-09-13 18:35:22,One can only assume that this aspect is one of the motivations that has prompted Idaho state government officials to take the position that they have on COVID protections.
2021-09-13 17:37:08,"Joe Biden: “Only 1 out of every 160,000 fully vaccinated Americans was hospitalized for COVID per day"". He further said that we are in an “epidemic of the unvaccinated”. Indeed, that is what all the data show. 99% of the hospitalizations and more than 99% of the deaths from the Delta variant are among the unvaccinated. If you have a reasonably healthy immune system and are vaccinated the pandemic is over. Moreover, unvaccinated kids in any given area represent a consistent low percentage of total Covid cases in that area. This has held steady since January and includes the Delta wave. Unfortunately, There is a large influx of kids in unvaccinated areas. The percentages of seriously ill kids has remained constant for months, but since the total number of sick is higher in unvaccinated areas, the total number of sick kids is higher too. But again the percentage of sick kids, not just kids with positive tests, remains the same. So the answer is that everyone eligible must get vaccinated and that those who don't are traitors."
2021-09-13 17:45:06,"Triage proposal: Those who refuse to get vaccinated (without a valid medical reason) and, got deathly sick with COVID as a result, should be treated last.

All other procedures should be taking a priority at this point."
2021-09-13 18:07:20,"In terms of calls to ration care to the unvaccinated, we should not punish children under 18 who have not been permitted to be vaccinated by their parents."
2021-09-13 18:18:54,The federal law that requires states to accept patients from other states should also be temporarily lifted for the remaining duration of this pandemic (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)) States should be forced to reckon with the results of their own (bad) decisions (overrun hospitals and increased COVID deaths). States that have high vaccination rates and mask mandates should be allowed to save their beds for their own residents whether they show up with COVID or any other medical issue. WA brain tumor patient should have priority over an unvaccinated Idaho COVID patient - it is ludicrous to suggest otherwise
2021-09-13 18:26:15,"There has always been and remains a need to invoke the Defense Production Act to make and distribute high-quality masks. It’s absolutely criminal to ignore the most effective tool there is to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Of course there are too many zombies walking around here maskless. But everyone should know by now that wearing a surgical mask does little to protect you from them. Cloth masks have been shown to be worse yet.
 
NIOSH approved N95s or better on every face and we could contain this in about a week. That's not even the astonishing part. What is? That we could have done it at any time in the last 19 months. Even more astonishing; Getting high-quality masks into everyone's hands is the first step of the Pandemic Response Plan.
 
650,000+ did not need to die.

Fear not, they are readily available on Amazon, eBay, etc. and have been for over a year. Your health and your contribution to society is worth a few cents more to get something that works."
2021-09-13 18:12:42,"I think that the media should profile and highlight the stories of people who are suffering and tragically dying, not from Covid, but from other ailments because they are not able to get access to medical and resources that are being consumed by Covid patients who chose to remain unvaccinated. It is important to put a human face to patients suffering from other serious ailments with the hope that some of the anti-vaxxers will realize the devastating real-world consequences of their stance."
2021-09-13 18:32:28,Crazy that somebody that has a life threatening emergency in a state that is taking precautions doesn't get treatment over somebody that could easily take a free and easy vaccine that reduces risk by 11X.
2021-09-13 17:46:57,"I would propose that any Washington resident who is put on hold for a necessary medical procedure because hospital beds aren't available, and suffers any degree of physical or mental harm as a result, file a civil lawsuit for pain, suffering, and damages against the governor of Idaho, its state legislature, and its secretary of health."
2021-09-13 18:24:18,"Thus patients with Covid who are unvaccinated should be turned away. As the sign in the pick up in the photograph says ""We will not comply"" and in turn Washington State should not comply by taking them. We need to make noncompliance more painful for the unvaccinated. They made their ""personal choice"" let them live with it."
2021-09-13 17:59:30,"Bill Idaho (use addresses).  Pretty simple.

Of course, I also believe that those who catch Covid but are unvaccinated - children who cannot be vaccinated excepted - should also be billed in full, and they should be given legal advice too in how to sue their state government for giving them Bad Information.

Freedoms and rights do not mean ""right to say or do whatever I want to say or do without personal responsibility or consequence.""

(And the reason for that is because inevitably, someone's right(s) will end up stepping upon someone else's right(s), e.g., religious ""freedom"" has been treated as being inviolable, while everyone else's freedoms are secondary to dogma.)"
2021-09-13 18:06:44,"Presumably many of the unvaccinated and unmasked people of Northern Idaho and elsewhere are the same folks who were so concerned about rationed care, long waits for procedures, and the ""death panels"" that never materialized under the ACA. They then continued to elect Republican legislatures who refuse to mount an adequate public health / government response to even a once in a century pandemic, creating the conditions they supposedly feared so much. Sadly, there's little reason to be optimistic that lessons will be learned by people who are consistently more motivated by their imagined problems than their actual ones."
2021-09-13 18:16:09,"Several decades ago it was predicted that many of our future problems would be crossing national and international boundaries--largely involving environmental pollution and disasters and diseases and chronic health conditions that disregard boundaries of any kind. 

The only way to get through these issues is to have the attitude that we are all in this together and therefore must establish cooperative policies and procedures to curtail, rather than make worse, these cross-boundary issues. 

It seems the Republican party--most especially the Trump faction--did not get the warning and the message. 

Worse, the GOP is treating covid and climate change as liberal hoax issues.  

Like some kind of fraternity hazing and initiation test, the GOP is telling its supporters to show their allegiance to the Party by combatting any attempt to require cooperative behavior in a public health crisis. 

No, it is not about a citizen's freedoom to do choose to make a bad situation worse and thereby doom innocent people to terrible sickness and even death. 

One question for the anti-authoritarian authoritarian Republican Party that demands everyone go in lock-step with policies and laws that they even know are wrong and dangerous: 

Question: Are the Republican Party no-mask mandates, disregard for social distancing, and discouraging vaccinations reducing covid sickness and death, or is the GOP making the situation worse and essentially delaying the opening of commerce and the economy?"
2021-09-13 18:24:53,The GOP is apparently cynical enough to sacrifice its own supporters in order to “own the liberals” and try to scuttle pandemic mitigation and economic recovery before the 2022 elections. I have no other rational explanation for their opposition to mask and vaccine mandates. The problem with this strategy is that it will mostly play out in counties that are already deeply conservative and may actually cause a swing to the left rather than an expected midterm swing in support for the right. This is not different from the GOP opposition to expanding Medicare under the Affordable Care Act; the red states needed it the most but many red states’ residents were denied access by GOP gubernatorial opposition.  It’s definitely a lose:lose strategy for the GOP. Additionally the ongoing Jan 6th commission and the fight over the TX abortion law will also play to the Democrats’ advantage as the 2022 midterms approach. Get vaccinated: it’s safe and effective.
2021-09-13 18:26:18,"It's time for individuals to except responsibility for their personal freedom. Children under the age of 12 should be treated. 

I suppose you could argue that teenagers from 12 to 17 is there not legally adults, should also be treated.

Unvaccinated adults who  are eligible to be vaccinated and didn't take it should not be treated. Why should the rest of us pay the costs with massive increases in our health insurance premiums? Why should medical professionals and first responders risk their lives for people who are contemptuous of their communities?

I really don't need to see one more person on their deathbed in the hospital tragically pleading with others to take the vaccine that they should've taken.It is having zero effect on the unvaccinated and the rest of us already understand how dangerous and painful this disease can be"
2021-09-13 17:51:10,"Not to put too fine a point on this, but I'm going to need neurosurgery this calendar year.  The outcome will have life-shaping impact on the quality of life I enjoy the remainder of my days.

I am fully vaccinated and will take the booster when it comes due.  I bitterly resent residents of Idaho consuming scarce medical resources in Washington State, built on Washington land with Washington taxpayer resources and maintained by fees we pay the superb corps of health care providers we nurture and value in this state.

Beyond the fact I have a self-interested perspective here, I am also motivated by my sense of right and wrong.

Our public health policy should be that citizens of Idaho cannot blow off sensible precautions and responsible behavior and then expect to have their needs take priority over those of Washingtonians who have done their part to control the pandemic. 

We'll help if we can but not by sacrificing to reward selfishness."
2021-09-13 18:41:32,"The State of Washington should sue the State of Idaho for care provided to Idaho residents, if that care is not paid for by insurance. Since the hospital have to take the patients.

Or do they? They can divert when they are full. But why should they divert Washington residents while full of Idaho residents? Why are Washington residents' scheduled procedures being postponed to care for Idaho residents? Can they divert when they are ""full,"" where ""full"" means full of scheduled procedures?"
2021-09-13 18:09:37,"I saw the Mike Wallace interview with Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts yesterday, where in the governor's mind all of these things are true.  

1.  He wants you to take the vaccine.
2.  He doesn't trust those who created the vaccine.
3.  You are obliged have your children take polio or chicken pox vaccines.  
4.  You are not obliged to not take the covid vaccine.
5.  He disclaims responsibility for the surge of deaths in his state.
6.  He plans to sue the federal government for taking more responsibility to mitigate deaths in his state.

It's exactly this kind of asinine incoherence that will continue to kill the governor's constituents all in the name of ""freedumb.""  Pete Ricketts and the other Republican members of the Trump death cult should be ashamed of themselves although I know they are not."

The area, except for the rich with their fancy homes around Lake Coeur d'Alene, are extremely right wing.   It's no surprise they refuse any kind of public health measures.   People in Washington shouldn't be denied life saving health care because the good people of Idaho and their Governor think getting a vaccination is an assault on ""liberty"".  If I or a family member had a brain tumor and couldn't get treatment because of this behavior, I would be beyond angry.  I really don't think Washington State residents should be denied care while offering it to Covid deniers is Idaho."

2021-09-13 17:51:51,"I've been living in Spokane off and on this year caring for an aging relative, and this outcome was set in motion long before.

But once infected, they should be denied the right to seek medical treatment in adjacent states where the effort is focused on trying to curb the disease. That's only fair and just.

I’m licensed to provide equitable medical care to patients. I’m thankful that it is illegal to deny emergency care to people, including on the basis of vaccination status. 
Enacting crisis protocol standards is necessary in some areas of Idaho now. People should read up on the specific rules of strict triage for Covid. It may surprise you.

These colonies would be staffed entirely by other un-vaccinated covid survivors, who would be required to serve  a given term there as repayment for those that helped them through their own illness.  Staff would have access to advice from doctors or nurses by phone, if said doctors and nurses had time to talk with them between treating their own patients.   Treatment would consist of comfort care, and burying the dead. 

This system would allow people to choose their freedom to become infected and die, without putting the rest of us at risk for infection, or bear the trauma of caring for them. Hospital staff could then give their full attention and resources to those who are unable to be vaccinated and  contract covid, or treat the rare breakthrough cases. It would greatly reduce the cost of medical care and resulting boost in price of insurance borne by the rest of us. 

If Kurt Vonnegut was still with us, I could see him turning this into a nice story or novel."
2021-09-13 19:31:21,"Now more than ever I think the state of Idaho resembles a gigantic middle finger pointed at Washington.  But I applaud the healthcare workers who are working tirelessly to take care of all patients nonetheless.  Idaho's governor, like those of many red states, doesn't seem to understand that ""personal responsibility"" extends beyond a person or their family.  There is a societal responsibility that many Republicans have abdicated. Disheartening, and it does punish the unvaccinated more, but the jet wash is claiming lives, careers and the physical and mental health of hospital workers."
2021-09-13 19:39:37,"This affects Alaska, too.  We don't have enough hospital infrastucture here to care for the large number of summer visitors we've had this year, all our Covid patients (including some of those visitors), and our normal medical needs.  Summer is a time when even young healthy residents hurt themselves doing outdoorsy things, as do many tourists, and in a normal year we would cope by hiring lots of temporary medical staff from the Lower 48 -- workers who don't exist this year. Our governor is also anti-mask and lukewarm on vaccination.  Our biggest city, Anchorage, has gone from strong pro-mask and pro-vaccine leadership to a mayor who's more of an ivermectin guy.  As a result we have had scarce or nonexistent ICU beds available in Anchorage for weeks, and our ERs are all closed most of the time, too.  (Normally Anchorage is the place our many rural residents come for specialized medical care; it also has the state's only Native hospital, so this doesn't merely affect those who live here.)  Now neither Seattle nor Portland (3-4 hours away by jet) are taking patient overflow.  One patient was recently medevaced to Denver, 3000 miles away. i.e. much farther than WA is from ID."
2021-09-13 20:08:06,"My brother, who lives in Toronto, had his cancer surgery delayed by well over a month last year because the hospitals there were completely slammed with the COVID patients. The wait for his surgery to be scheduled was terrible and afterwards we still had to worry about possible exposure in the hospital. That was before the vaccine became available, when everybody was facing the same tragic situation and except for masking and social distancing there was little one could do. But now a safe and effective FDA approved vaccine is available that millions of people have taken with no significant negative effects. When people refuse to get vaccinated under these circumstances and hospitals are so overwhelmed that other critical procedures are delayed or canceled because of it, the refuseniks should be made to pay the consequences. The hospitals in states like Idaho and Washington are more than justified in prioritizing care for vaccinated patients, including non-emergency but critical scheduled procedures, and sending unvaccinated COVID patients home without admission. In fact, I believe the hospitals have an obligation to do so."

Let the unvaccinated Covid sick stay home to contemplate personal responsibility and their “freedom”.

Effective today, our governor mandated outdoor masking in crowds 500+ and vaccination for state employees was mandated a few weeks ago.  You think ID’s governor is bad?  Just read about the lieutenant governor, who, in all sincerity, could be a candidate for commitment to a mental health facility.  If any member of my family is denied emergency treatment for anything, I will sue every single entity and person I can.

There are cancer patients unable to have procedures that might save their lives, and car accident/heart attack/stroke victims who didn't choose to be ill who can't get care because anti-masking, anti-vax people are choosing to become sick.

It's time to stop. Stop prioritizing patients with a preventable disease and treat them second if they don't mask or vaccinate. There are so many people who are sick right now who wish being well was as simple as wearing a mask or vaccinating. Since these people are brave enough to throw off a mask and not vaccinate, let them continue being brave while other patients receive treatment. Do not prioritize."

Those who are eligible to be vaccinated but have chosen not to are ignorant but likely doing what they, in their ignorance, think is best.  However,  I do think there should be a priorization list so that those with brain tumors, for example,  should never be turned away.  Healthcare providers are quitting or retiring early because of burnout much of it do to having to treat unvaccinated patients who unnessicarly put healthcare providers at risk. Perhaps as cruel as it sounds, pragmatically no unvaccinated eligible adults with COVID should be admitted to hospitals bacause when healthcare providers quit they are not available to provide care to anyone and everybody loses."

Unvaccinated, covid-positive persons without a legitimate medical exemption from vaccination should expect to be placed at the back of the queue for hospitalization and for any other medical care beyond the most basic interventions.

The failure of (supposed) leaders to lead with courage and intelligence is appalling.  Most Idahoans agree with their current approach to this pandemic.  And to compound the issue, the majority of the population in eastern Washington approaches this situation the same way as does Idaho.  It's a disastrous situation.  I have a difficult time not wishing the worst upon many of them.   My father lives in Idaho but is fully vaccinated and wears a mask whenever he must venture among the crowd of idiots.  At 86, I worry a lot about him.  And yes, there's a reason I left Idaho and other than to visit my dad, I am completely unmotivated at this point to return for any reason."

I am appalled by my state’s response and so sad for my colleagues in northern Idaho, who are suffering greatly. But this is just terrible reporting, taking one tiny snapshot of this pandemic and forcing it into the narrative that NYT wants to promote. Oh yeah, and there is a vaccination mandate for all employees at most hospitals in the state. My children wear masks at school. So that is just a lie to say those measures are “not in place” in Idaho. I wish everyone would get vaccinated too but I don’t think this article will have the intended result as shaming has never been a successful way to influence people."

It was unprecedented.   Parents saw the frightening and crippling effects that polio had on the body and didn’t hesitate for a moment to line up their kiddos for the trial.  The trial was a huge success. 

Fast forward 65 years later, with huge advances in medicine, we now have a highly effective vaccines for COVID-19 and we have to beg people to get a shot.  So sad!

This sham view of ""freedom"" that avoids taking responsibility for actions is not freedom. It is freeloading, and it is killing people.

You'd probably lose on re-election among the base you are pandering to today, but you'd do them a favor if you'd tell them to stop the childish behavior, get their shots, and before fully vaccinated - wear the simple bit of cloth over their face so they don't catch the virus and then sicken others.

42 U.S. Code § 1395dd says that a hospital must provide a patient with emergency medical screening within their capability and emergency stabilizing treatment when staff and facilities are available.

First, Democrats should immediately draft legislation amending the above statute to exempt a hospital from being forced to admit an individual for Covid when they are eligible to be vaccinated, but have not done so (children under 12 would be exempted).  There is widespread frustration at the unvaccinated, and Republican resistance to this bill would be highly unpopular and could anger a large slice of the voters.

Also, if hospital and ER beds are in short supply, it is acceptable for facilities to only treat patients most likely to recover - excluding most unvaccinated Covid patients.  And it is legal for doctors and nurses to refuse to treat the unvaccinated if their refusal is nondiscriminatory - a possible loophole to the statute.

If Blue states really wanted to play hardball, they could pass legislation mimicking Texas' anti-abortion law, but instead deputize ordinary citizens to sue any hospitalized and unvaccinated Covid patient and their enablers.  (Texas' law deputizes citizens to sue when the woman seeks a constitutionally protected right, so this law doesn't seem too much of a stretch."

And what do you expect during a pandemic when your neighbors have an outbreak?  Of course you'll be affected, sooner or later.  Then you affect your neighbors, and the cycle goes on.

Or maybe Bret does realize that and doesn't mind that what drives much of this defiance is not the cause of freedom, but spite."
2021-09-13 10:43:44,"Here in Silicon Valley nobody and I mean none of my ""coastal elite"" friends support paying the higher taxes Biden needs to ""fully pay"" for his $3.5 trillion social spending bill, but they are unanimous in their support for the end of the SALT deduction cap. Pelosi is pretty good at smoke and mirrors but the money just isn't going to be there."
2021-09-13 10:44:19,Mr. Stephens solution is unvaccinated people shouldn't expect someone else to bail them out . But they do and that's why they are flooding our healthcare system for treatment of Covid. Healthcare workers don't have the freedom to choose  to deny patients who need medical care. Ethical standards supercede ignoring their cries for help. Our healthcare system is paying the price for the reckless decisions many of our Republican leaders are making regarding the spread of this deadly virus. These politicians must be held accountable.
2021-09-13 10:45:01,"I do think that President Biden is trying to run the country, not trying to win the next election.
In the meantime Republicans are, in the words of Mr. Stephens, requiring"" the government or their employer telling them what to do with their bodies.""
And, our immediate past ""president"" is pushing ""boxing"" to the level of ""professional wrestling"", a previous incarnation of his. Which, of course will further endear him to those who like to see people beating each other to the point of death.
As for death panels, promised by the Republicans, they succeeded, at least in Idaho, and coming to a state near you soon.
The Pro-Death-Party is sure doing things for the people."
2021-09-13 10:45:26,"The longer Covid is allowed to spread the greater the chance of another variant that currently available vaccines can't handle. This endangers everyone.  For that reason the vaccine-hesitant are a risk to everyone,  not just themselves."
2021-09-13 10:46:44,"Bret Stephens underplays the current nature of the COVID crisis. It may indeed be a ""nincompoop crisis,"" but it is still a major public health crisis. We are averaging about 1,600 deaths a day. In many states, ICU beds are filled to capacity, meaning there is no room for people with acute conditions like heart attacks or traumatic accidents. Businesses are beginning to shut down. The people who are refusing to get vaccinated are behaving irresponsibly without any regard for their fellow citizens. They are no different than people running red lights, shooting guns into crowds or pushing people on subway platforms. Stephens's suggestion that Medicaid, Medicare, and private health insurers should refuse to pay for their care if they get infected is the kind of pressure needed to curb their socially irresponsible behavior."
2021-09-13 10:47:44,"So tired of the argument being framed as either being vaxxed or unvaxxed with no mention of the co-morbidities that come into play when hospitalization is required.  On this same issue if vaccine mandates can be required under the guise of ""it saves lives and don't you want to protect your grandmother and loved ones"" then laws banning abortion which also saves lives should be allowed to stand. How ironic that the Texas law allow neighbors to turn in neighbors if suspected of having an abortion.  The parallel is the people who are vaccinated point the fingers at the unvaxxed and accuse them of spreading the disease and the cause of mutations, even when the vaxxed can carry and transmit the virus.  If you want to create divisiveness, then pass laws that mandate what can or cannot be done with ones body. My body, my choice should prevail i f we are truly a country of free choice."
2021-09-13 10:50:19,"""Anyway, as anti-vaxxers are mostly putting themselves at serious risk of getting seriously ill, I don’t see the need for a presidential directive, including the renewed mask mandates, which only diminish the incentive to get vaccinated. ""

Good God, Bret Stephens, anti-vaxxers are putting all of us at risk, not just themselves.  They are needlessly prolonging a pandemic that in a saner world, would be over by now.  They are spreading a virus even among the vaccinated, allowing new covid variants to develop, and preventing US citizens from getting vital healthcare because they are taking up all the hospital rooms.

Covid is not shingles, where only the patient suffers from avoiding the vaccine.  George Washington mandated small pox vaccines for his soldiers. Public health crises demand government responses for contagious diseases--period."
2021-09-13 10:52:35,"When one's behaviors become a threat to others at large, it is time to ask that individual to control or eliminate that behavior.

It is that simple. Or is it too hard for the MAGA crowd to understand that?"
2021-09-13 10:53:55,"Biden definitely needs to tack to the center. A moderate Democratic Party is much better for America than an extreme GOP, which could take the Executive Branch back if the Dems overreach.

2021-09-13 10:59:52,"Joe Biden is doing his best to lead. It is we, the increasingly ungovernable American public, who are failing. We the people need a legislative success and the hope that it brings. Sure hope the Democrats are going to sort themselves out. Manchin and Sinema need to agree to more than a 1.5 trillion human infrastructure package. Bernie et al need to come down from 3.5 trillion. I like the progressive proposal, but it isn't going to pass--in the Senate or even in the House, where there is angst building amongst moderate Democrats. Tell your congressional representatives to deal, and deal quickly. We need to move onto voting rights next."
2021-09-13 11:00:24,"Once upon a time Americans simply would have done their civic duty and gotten vaccinated. There would have been no babbling about ""personal freedom,"" no Republican governors undermining the fight against a deadly pandemic. Our current state of affairs is sad indeed."
2021-09-13 11:01:01,"Bret refuses to understand, hence he is a public health denialist, that unvaccinated people not only put themselves at risk but everyone else they get in contact with, unvaccinated or not. 
And what’s more cruel? Mandating a shot with a safe and effective vaccine or refusing to pay for the bills once one gets sick with a preventable disease?
Because we mandate childhood vaccines many viral infectious have been basically eradicated.
Only collective action gets us out of this pandemic.
If anyone bothers to check the infection rate in South America where the combination of public health measures and vaccination programs have left the land of the free in the dust.
The US was a terrifying laughing stock under Trump, now it’s a sad case of a country that has all the means but lacks people with a collective common sense."
2021-09-13 11:09:37,"For all of his supposed knowledge and wonkiness, Brett Stephens seems conspicuously uniformed about the long judicial upholding of public health mandates that extend to the Supreme Court ruling in 1905. Justice John Marshal Harlan wrote: ""In every well ordered society charged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand."""
2021-09-13 11:10:34,"While I agree with Bret Stephens’ comments about health insurance being denied for those who refuse to be vaccinated, I think most of his other COVID-related comments are silly. The unvaccinated are a huge danger to themselves, to children (as the stats support), and even to the vaccinated. While the overwhelming majority of those with breakthrough cases have mild symptoms, if you consider flu-like symptoms and loss of taste/smell to be mild, it also means loss of productivity for those people. They miss work or school for 10 days. It also means stress on those who have been in close contact with that person as they count the days until they can get tested and then wait the 2-3 days for their test results. And in some ways it is even worse with those who are asymptomatic as they are walking, talking Typhoid Marys, unknowingly spreading the virus around their world."
2021-09-13 11:11:47,"Bret wearing a 'Bernie' button, what an image!

2021-09-13 11:12:26,"I am so weary of all this. Just wear a mask; it's not that hard. Man up. Yes, the guidelines change; it's an evolving virus with new information in real time. I read all I can in responsible press, talk to my epidemiologist-adjacent friend, and have decided that basically I will be wearing masks indoors for the foreseeable future--and that means not taking them off to eat, etc--and outdoors when it's crowded due to the contagiousness of Delta. I am not virtue-signaling: I am protecting my immune-suppressed husband while trying to keep my job which has required in-person attendance. Once again, IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU. Mask up."
2021-09-13 11:15:38,"The idea that Medicare/Medicaid and private insurance should not pay for unvaccinated people with Covid sounds good but is totally impractical.  When someone shows up in an ER, the law (specifically EMTALA) requires the hospital to stabilize an emergency medical condition.  For someone severely ill with Covid, that likely means admitting them to an inpatient bed.  Do you think that the patient in that condition is going to say to him/herself, ""Gee, my bill is getting close to $100,000, I guess I'd better pull out these tubes and wires and get myself out of here!""  And do you think that the hospital is going to be successful in collecting these large bills from the patient's personal assets?  All it will do is add to medical debt and potential bankruptcy for the patient, and increased financial burden from uncollectible accounts for the hospital - and likely add to the trend of closing small and rural hospitals."

Precisely because no one should be denied, mandates are necessary. If we are going to provide care to everyone, everyone must act responsibly—and if they refuse to do so willingly, they should be forced to do so.

I wore my mask for those youngsters and for the many other children in church who are too young for vaccination and do not seem to see the reason for masking up."

You don't want to get vaccinated.  No big deal?  Except it IS a big deal to those you come in contact with.  To those having to care for you in the hospital.  For the cost to the health care system to care for you in the ICU. For the lost wages and productivity as you recover for what could be a couple weeks or several months or more or die.  From an entirely preventable severe illness or death. Now you are hearing all these horror stories of nurses  leaving the job because they refuse to get vaccinated. Give it a little time.  They have no where to go. They won't make the money anywhere else they do now.  Are they willing to toss away the investment in their nursing education over this?  And do what?  Wait tables? Cashier at the local grocery store? That out to complete their purpose in life.  And one other thing:  with 140,000+ cases and 1600 deaths a day and some degree of increased vaccination, this phase of the pandemic is peaking.  But watch as the virus says ""OK who is next?  Where are the unvaccinated for us to infect?""  And what do you know....all packed into a neat package , ripe for the taking, in schools across the country. Biden vs DeSantis?

Because I haven’t heard anything from the GOP on this topic.  What I have heard for 18 months are Democratic leaders proposing public health and safety orders such as mask mandates, social-distancing, and now vaccination requirements.  These strict measures are not pleasurable, but neither are 660,000 (and counting) COVID deaths in the United States. My dear mother among them. May she Rest In Peace.

So, tell me Bret, what is the Republican plan to end this national emergency? Because I have yet to find one."
2021-09-13 11:26:13,What Mr. Stephens fails to point out is that widespread Covid infections among the unvaccinated will create mutations that are resistant to the vaccine.

You are missing something important: The more sick people there are, the more likely it becomes that new variants will develop that affect us all. 
Do we need to offer the virus more opportunities to mutate, and impact us all again?"
2021-09-13 11:29:46,"No, wait:  You can't just dismiss vaccine opponents as people who should pay for their own health care.  Arguably an unvaccinated population allowed the delta variant to mutate.  Ongoing exposure of an unvaccinated subgroup will guarantee that the next variant develops soon.  This is a population health problem and it needs a population-wide solution.  Vaccine resisters risk far more than themselves and their families.  If the carrot of being immune doesn't get people vaccinated, the stick of loss of employment and opportunity is reasonable."

It appears the $3.5 trillion budget is payment to all those progressives that supporting Biden. But what about the conservatives and moderates that voted for Biden? There was never a mandate for a major progressive agenda packed into that budget. I support withdrawing the troops. I support Biden's handling of the pandemic.

How does getting a shot make you less free?

It DOESN'T.

What makes you less free is knowing that if you linger while doing your shopping you're increasing your chances of dying an excruciating death because the other people sharing the aisle with you may not be vaccinated.

What makes you less free is not feeling safe going to the dentist because the hygienist refuses to do something safe, cost free, and backed by actual science.

What makes you less free is having to give up public transport, travel, restaurants, theaters, and even gatherings with friends . .  . and it is people who refuse to get vaccinated who are making us give up all that.

Vaccination =  Freedom.

It isn't the other way around."

2021-09-13 11:38:10,"Bret's suggestion of the Democrats going small and then passing their social legislation one piece at a time is a nice theory, but reality is that budget reconciliation is their only path to getting any of this done. This is due to the Senate filibuster that takes 60 votes for a standalone bill to clear."
2021-09-13 11:42:26,"Two quick thoughts for Bret...
1. The government -- federal, but also many Republican-governed southern states -- have been catering to the sensitivities of of those who won't get vaxed. Hasn't the recent case surge proven that we've passed the tipping point when our institutions should be prioritizing the needs of those who have been vaxed, or who would like to but are still too young? Those who have vaxed, masked and distanced shouldn't spend the foreseeable future at the mercy of those who refuse to do the right thing(s). 

No one wears a mask because we prefer it to going bare-faced. As Gail says, we're forced to continue our precautions because of those who take none. But if nothing else, I thought the Conservative in you would support the advantages of a fully vaxed populace to the economy.

2. I, too, thought Larry Hogan's public statements, international sourcing of Covid testing supplies (which he flew into a local airport rather than risk the Trump-Kushner feds seizing them for the federal stockpile), and his his pro-vax stance, qualified him as a sane Republican. But it still confounds me that of all the qualified personnel he could have chosen for the position, he decided Robert Redfield was the guy to lead Maryland's Covid response effort. Maryland's vaccination rollout was a mess. And I thought once Redfield (who may be a brilliant doctor, but one with an obvious administrative skills deficiency) left the CDC, his career in public health would be toast."
2021-09-13 11:44:31,"Please, please enough already! Can folks who do not live in my home state stop criticizing us, particularly our governor? I remember a time when my husband was a CA state employee, and we had one lousy Republican governor after another. They cared less about our insidious trajectory toward global warming. Polluting cars? Big deal. Oil rigs along our coast? No biggie. The homeless? It was starting back when, and no one cared. Bret, let’s focus on DeSantis or Abbott, rather than one man who is juggling infernos and a pandemic, and very well, too. Finally, the mandates from President Biden. If it weren’t for the unvaccinated, the Republican obstructionists, Fox News, conspiracy theories, choosing politics and fanatical religion over science, and Mr. Trump, we would be living a mask-free, healthier, angst-free life right now. The Republican Party messes everything up. Period."
2021-09-13 11:44:32,"The democrats offer refreshing plans for the country.  The republicans offer nothing, except ""let's make it 1957 again.""

By the way, I'm still waiting for Trump's ""tremendous"" health care plan and ""incredible"" infrastructure plan that he promised for four years.  I'm sure his brain trust is working on them."
2021-09-13 11:45:42,"I specifically remember Mr. Stephens being rather awash with praise for President Biden, back in the Spring. How am I supposed to respect an opinion that flips so dramatically in 5 months?"
2021-09-13 11:46:26,"“But the civil libertarian in me doesn’t love the idea of this or any president using administrative powers to force vaccines on the people who refuse to get them.”

Bret needs to reconsider what is meant by the social contract. We have obligations to each other and true civil libertarians recognize  the need for government to act in the public interest when it comes to a pandemic.

As Biden correctly argues, this has become a pandemic of the unvaccinated. He has the authority to take action."
2021-09-13 11:48:16,"Gail is absolutely right that Joe Biden is saying the unvaccinated shouldn't be allowed in "" certain places where infecction is relatively easy to spread, like workplaces or public buildings."" 
I think people should have bodily autonomy and, if someone doesn't want to get vaccinated, we should allow that. But! That person should not have the right to mix with the rest of us in public spaces. If it takes a government mandate to achieve that, so be it. 
I've heard people say that the ideal would be to encourage people to do the right thing. Trouble is, that didn't work.
I just read that West Virginia, which was touted as a success story for getting trusted community members to urge that their friends and neighbors get vaccinated now has the biggest spike of the virus in the nation. It didn't work.
Parents who refuse allow their children to be masked in school are taking away the rights of other parents who want their kids to be as safe as possible. That's wrong. 
This nation is our house. We need rules to protect all of us. Gail is right. Pep talks are not enough."
2021-09-13 11:48:45,"Gee, we only have experience with vaccines going back to the 1700s.  All vaccines work pretty much the same way.  They are a non-functional pathogen or part of the pathogen (e.g., the Covid ""spike"") that cause your immune system to create specific antibodies that disable the real thing.  There is nothing particularly ""weird"" about the Covid vaccine.

Thus, there is no reason why Biden should not put the heat on these people to get vaccinated.

1. They are a danger to those who can't get vaccinated.

2. It can cause breakthrough infections in the vaccinated.

3.  It increases the possibility of a mutation that will render the  current vaccines ineffective.

4. They are unnecessarily placing a huge strain on the healthcare system.

If I could get drafted when I was a kid, I see nothing wrong with vaccine mandates, a much less intrusive interference in my ""personal autonomy."""
2021-09-13 11:49:18,"All children under age 12 are unvaccinated .
Adults in a society have an obligation to protect our children .
Brett - masking, in areas of high transmission ,is indicated to protect our children. 
It might be adequate to only mask the unvaccinated , but short of forcing them wear a scarlet letter ( ""A"" for anti-vax) this is not feasible."
2021-09-13 11:50:34,"People with a rational approach to risk should not be harmed by people who are irrationally afraid.  President Biden began his speech the other day by correctly asserting that the vaccines are excellent at preventing hospitalization and death (and by the way, this is even more true for working age adults); then, inexplicably, he said he had to ""protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated workers.""  Well, the vaccine protects vaccinated workers from every worker--vaccinated and unvaccinated--and don't forget that vaccinated workers can spread the disease quite easily, as the CDC pointed out when it re-instituted its mask guidelines for the vaccinated after the Provincetown breakout.

So, from a public health perspective, a vaccine mandate won't protect anyone except the people getting vaccinated.  In addition, I think it IS a very bad idea for a president to politicize what should be an apolitical entity, OSHA. You recall that Trump was accused of politicizing government agencies and departments.  And heck, two high level FDA officials resigned because of the political pressure imposed upon them by Biden.  The Imperial Presidency is a road to ruin."

2021-09-13 11:52:21,"People in Idaho and eastern Washington state are unable to have “elective” surgeries for brain tumors and painful orthopedic conditions due to hospitals in the area being overwhelmed with Covid patients, largely due to Idaho having no mandates on masks and other measures at virus control and patients, according to doctors, are in misery, as reported today by this newspaper.  

So saying “its gone from being a public-health crisis to a nincompoop-health crisis” seems somewhat flip towards people who are suffering.  It’s a crisis to the person with a tumor inside their head for sure.  So a vaccine mandate seems the only way now to make any difference. 

On the other hand, my patience with people choosing not to get vaccinated has made me low on empathy, so denying care by Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies to the unvaccinated does not seem totally unreasonable anymore.  This is not going to happen though.  

Simply a letter to everyone by insurance companies  stating that deductibles and copays will be considerably higher, or even higher premiums, if you are unvaccinated seems quite reasonable and logical.  You can choose to be unvaccinated but know you are facing higher costs.  Denying people care is not realistic, making them pay more is, I think."
2021-09-13 11:54:32,"It is sad that ostensibly serious people like Bret can continue to make specious arguments about COVID vaccinations.

Good grief, Brett--get a clue or write for a lesser publication."

2021-09-13 11:55:07,"You both need a good science lesson in virus mutation.  A virus is a power law function like compound interest.  The higher the ""rate"" and the longer the time the more you get.  Public health officials know that the key to holding down the rate is time.  To make matters worse evolution is at work.   The longer the virus lives it mutates to create a stronger virus with a higher ""rate"".   The virus is actively learning to overwhelm the vaccines.  The quicker and more decisive the stop the sooner it dies.  Masks should have been mandated when the first case happened and vaccines mandated when the first one started shipping.  Public health officials at local, State and Federal levels should have this power.  The virus is an invader from nature and this is war.  The ""nincompoops"" are those who continue to not understand the seriousness of this problem."

If the national GOP had even a semblance of sanity, Baker would be a hands-down favorite to beat Joe Biden in 2024. Similar to Larry Hogan, he's been able to win even in a Deep Blue state because of his common-sense approach to governance -- a reasonably-progressive platform (pro-choice, etc.), but with a decidedly conservative (i.e., no new taxes) fiscal stance. But they're dinosaurs, politically-speaking, representing what the former GOP meant to America in the mould of Nelson Rockefeller, Jacob Javits, Howard Baker, Charles Percy -- I could go on.  Instead we have a GOP whose icon is  Marjorie Taylor Greene, a total disgrace to our country. The reality for Brett and other old-school Republicans is that there is no Dem candidate (even if it were AOC! ) who even remotely poses an existential threat to our democracy, whereas a return to the White House of Trump or any of his progeny -- DeSantis, Noem, Abbott, etc. -- will mean the end of the so-called American experiment."
2021-09-13 11:56:09,"Bret Stephens, the unvaccinated are not just hurting themselves, but putting others in danger--particularly children under 12, who cannot be vaccinated. Fewer people vaccinated in any given area creates a high level of spread and more chance that these children will contract the virus. In addition, as President Biden made clear, the high numbers of Delta in the country, due to low vaccination rates, are dampening the economic recovery because many vaccinated people are still too worried under these circumstances to travel, dine out, and generally spend money.  While such caution among the vaccinated may be unnecessary, it will persist until the infection rates decline,  a function of vaccination rate."

This sentence is bothersome. It follows an entire discussion about mask and vaccine mandates. If people had followed those mandates the pandemic would be largely under control. In fact, the pandemic could have been under control without vaccines if we'd had more discipline in our social distancing early on. Biden has been strong on all of it. To accuse him of poor leadership on the pandemic is a bad faith argument..."
2021-09-13 11:59:09,"The impact of mask and vaccination mandates pales in comparison to the effects a fourth wave of covid will have on not only the nation’s economy and physical health but our emotional stability as well. As autumn deepens each day will slowly become colder and darker in much of the country.  School closures and interruptions have already thrown communities and parental work schedules into chaos.  And it’s only a matter of time before the virus unchecked mutates into a vaccine-resistant variant.  Most arguments against the mandates citing “freedom” are absurd, simply ignoring the mandatory inoculations required to enter kindergarten or the insurance necessary to drive a car.  Trump, with ample support from a thoroughly gelded GOP, has politicized everything including simple decency.  What’s perhaps the worst part of all this is that while republican minions spread poisonous lies they’re focused on what their constituents want to hear rather than the possible life-saving truth.  They don’t even believe what they’re saying.  Their cowardly homage to the Trump and the expansion of The Big Lie is killing Americans every day."
2021-09-13 11:59:22,"In a deadly pandemic of an intensely contagious virus, vaccination should not be an option. As even backward-facing Mississippi requires all children in the state to be vaccinated for a wide variety of contagious diseases -- no ""religious"" exceptions allowed. Mississippi!

So that state's governor is railing against Covid vaccinations, as are most other Republican Party governors.  The conclusion is obvious: vaccination, like mask wearing, has nothing to do with science or public health. It is instead the manifestation of an ongoing and growing right-wing revolt against government authority.

Republicans clearly think this is a winning strategy in upcoming elections. If they are right, then our national unity and ability to move forward will be in serious doubt."
2021-09-13 12:00:06,"I think Brett has this right.

It is fine for government to mandate vaccines in government run places like airports and schools or for its workforce.

It is fine for private businesses to mandate vaccines to enter or work (although there is a slippery slope here you have to prepare for)..

It is not fine for government to mandate that businesses require vaccines to enter or work.  

that is why Biden's directives last week went to far."
2021-09-13 12:01:29,"Yea.  I'm virtue signaling or being a busy body by wearing a mask.  What kind of paranoia grips Mr. Stephens?  If enough people act in accordance with the public good, then the pandemic could be brought under control.  But being good is equivalent to a suspicious act to Republicans like Brett.  Rather than being an anonymous ""do gooder"" like the rest of us doing her or his part, Brett and his philosophical buds would rather stand out as the obstinate ""freedom fighters"" guarding our rights.  Their lack of understanding the difference between individual rights and human rights or just between right and wrong is astounding."
2021-09-13 12:02:15,"during WWII, the government mandated rationing.  Not a peep from the public.  we believed it was necessary for the common good and helped to win the war.  we have lost our way and may not ever get back."
2021-09-13 12:02:31,"Between Collins, Biden and Stephens who's got the most old and tired ideas? Not the old guy in the group. Mr. Stephens' ideas for change are old tired prescriptions that don't work. I'm proud to have a President who'll stand in front of the public unafraid to the truth and whose solutions are responsive and energetic, in stark contrast to the timid failed ideas of Bret Stephens."
2021-09-13 12:04:34,"Mr. Stephens makes one comment that I find flat out false, and another that is just silly. 

Regarding his view that ""anti-vaxxers are mostly putting themselves at serious risk of getting seriously ill."" This is just not true. If any virus is allowed to spread, it has the potential to mutate. This is how the Delta variant of Covid-19 developed. The overriding concern I have is that way too many people are not taking the vaccine, not wearing a mask in enclosed public spaces, and not taking other precautions such as social distancing, which presents the conditions for this virus to mutate again, and render our current vaccines obsolete. The anti-vaxxers are putting all of us at risk.

Regarding his statement that those ""who have a solid medical or emotional need to take great precautions, including masks, and I totally respect them. The busybodies and virtue-signalers, not so much."" I feel that my right to not be infected by others who refuse the vaccine, even if they have no legitimate health reason to do so, and that my right to life, trumps those who feel it is there right to not mask up, nor take the vaccine. The responsible majority of Americans, who are doing the right thing, are not ""virtue-signaling"", we are concerned that the next variant will break our vaccine induced immunity."
2021-09-13 12:05:22,"The problem Mr. Stephens is having with President Biden's performance, is President Biden is acting like a Democrat--rather than, what he would like to see as Republican-lite. As to the vaccination debate, we have a whole host of vaccine mandates already on the books, along with a Supreme Court decision supporting mandated vaccines. The GOP is playing political games with this issue--and President Biden, the adult in the Oval Office, does not play games. Oh, forgot about Afghanistan, whose newsworthiness decreases by the day."
2021-09-13 12:06:19,"How quickly do people forget how far off polls can be when people perceive judgement in the poll-taker for the ""incorrect"" response.  

And getting caught once in a restaurant likely means he did it all the time, just never caught - and that burns people under serious restrictions of work and family.  All the other Democratic leaders who have done the same doesn't help, even if it is not California's fault.

And I think people misunderstand how much the first Black governor of California under US rule might draw some  voting there way."
2021-09-13 12:07:24,"""Anyway, as anti-vaxxers are mostly putting themselves at serious risk of getting seriously ill, I don’t see the need for a presidential directive, including the renewed mask mandates, which only diminish the incentive to get vaccinated. No doubt I’m missing a few things ….""

It shows."
2021-09-13 12:07:41,"All this ANGST about people who live among us, in public, as fellow citizens, who don't want to be vaccinated ""because it takes away their freedom""!  HOW MANY MORE TIMES do we have to listen to anyone spew this argument at us?  I'll say it one final time:  ANYONE who doesn't live in a bubble has a MORAL AND LEGAL OBLIGATION TO BE VACCINATED.  It's not about ""them"", it's about ""US"".  Our health.  Our children's health.  If they want to keep their bodies free of life-saving vaccines that will not only protect them but MORE IMPORTANTLY the rest of us, fine.  But stay off the streets and away from the rest of us.  In fact, that would be one blessing of them not getting vaccinated - not having to continue this argument anymore because every time I hear about it I'm reminded of a child who won't drink his milk, not even because he doesn't like it, just because he doesn't want to."
2021-09-13 12:11:02,"I just want to let you know that your political commentary is always so very refreshing.  In a time where people are so politically divided your respectful and humorous political conversations bring me some joy and insight.  
I have always loved good political debates in which ideas are shared and challenged.  When done respectfully, I think it makes us a better nation.  Thank you both for doing that!"
2021-09-13 12:11:23,"The point of wearing masks is to reduce the possibility of transmitting the virus to another person. Hopefully masks also help to protect the wearer, but not all masks are highly effective.
People who have gotten vaccinated can still have a breakthrough infection and can still transmit the virus.
So, much as I dislike wearing a mask, I’m happy that my county requires wearing one indoors in public spaces. I do wish they had required them earlier this Summer. If they had, then we might be closer to getting back to normal now."
2021-09-13 12:12:03,"Dem Party's base of affluent professionals is ""frustrated"" (as Biden put it) with all the discomfort and anxiety they feel they've been subjected to by the recalcitrance of ""the unvaccinated,"" who just happen to be their cultural adversaries, and so they want them punished."
2021-09-13 12:12:42,"When relatives or close friends die or have been near death with the virus, you have a different perspective about the mandate. Biden tried to reason with the anti group, but most will tell you their goal is to defeat him. I support him in this mandate and believe it will hold up to legal challenges. How many more deaths, how much more severe illness must be delivered to us by this pandemic before we fully support action to control the virus?

 Religion should not be considered when people refuse vaccination. Someone undergoing an organ transplant, for example, could be a candidate for refusing. Hopefully, such a candidate will be able to find a safe hospital bed."
2021-09-13 12:13:06,"YES! Finally someone understands that if only Biden were more moderate like Bush Sr., Republicans would engage in bipartisan governance for the betterment of all.

Watch FOX and it is easy to see that Republicans prefer reasoned, rational discussion of issues, which is now impossible only because Biden has become a Socialist tyrant."
2021-09-13 12:13:13,"One question to Mr Stephens, so what to do with the current vaccine mandates (requirements ) in every state and territory of the US?

By the way, Mississippi has one of the strictest vaccine requirements with no exceptions of rreligious or conscientious objections.

These requirement apply to vaccines suchs as measles, mumps and rubella, among others, and a common enforcement mechanism is when the person enters school, regardless of age."
2021-09-13 12:13:22,"In Texas I generally ignore the suggestion to don a mask in most indoor public settings because it enables the anti-vaxxers to continue their stand against receiving the vaccine. The prevalence of mask usage dropped in the Spring after rollout and decrease in cases, hospitalizations and deaths. However usage has sprung up with Covid Delta strain in Summer. With a paltry 50 percent vaccinated here it is clear the anti-vaxxers are scared of this virulent new wave coming after younger cohorts."
2021-09-13 12:15:05,"Well over 100 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court held that vaccination could be REQUIRED of EVERYONE in a public health crisis. That is still the law. In its decision, the Court dismissed the notion that a person could evade his/her responsibility to the community by claiming ""freedom"":

""...a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.""

""Society based on the rule that each one is a law unto himself would soon be confronted with disorder and anarchy. Real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own...regardless of the injury that may be done to others."" 

See: Jacobson v. Massachusetts, decided in 1905 by a 7-2 majority."
2021-09-13 12:15:25,One thing missing from this discussion regarding Biden's vaccination order is the fact that there is an opt out whereby the worker can submit weekly test results instead of getting vaccination.  Those who are against the order and who fail to mention the testing opt out are merely playing the straw man game.
2021-09-13 12:16:12,"Elective surgery does not mean frivolous - the surgeries that have been put off are knee replacements, stent insertions, and other procedures that treat conditions not classified as ""life threatening"" - the way that Stephens blithely dismisses the crisis caused throughout the hospital system in this country by the unvaccinated indicates his privilege as a healthy middle-aged male, whose politics hew closely to his own personal convenience (he might have a different option about the breadth of the criss if he needed a non-life threatening cyst removed and was told to wait six months)."
2021-09-13 12:16:21,"In an ideal world people would study and absorb the benefits of getting the Covid vaccination as well as the miniscule dangers.  We would trust our neighbors to do the right thing, with keeping their very own communities in mind.  Unfortunately, misinformation fueled by right wing political ambition has zapped millions of Americans' clarity of thought.  Anti-vaxxers are forcing Biden to make the right choice for them, as it is his responsibility to keep our citizens safe.  Ignorance is no excuse.

If someone was determined to keep their hand over a fire because they've been told it is good for them, it's the government's responsibility to remove that hand for their own good."
2021-09-13 12:18:16,"Mandates are a public health blunder compounded it with a civil liberties blunder.

Spectacularly bad decision making always has political repercussions. First there's denial. Then the cover ups and then the lies.

It's not clear who Biden is getting his public health strategy from but it was poor from the start and has only gotten worse.

How can that be? The vaccine rollout has been a success. It has been a short sighted, temporary success that's already starting to backfire.

Mass vaccination campaigns during a pandemic of highly infectious variants fail to control viral transmission. Instead of contributing to building HI, they dramatically delay natural establishment of HI (Vanden Bossche, August 2021).

This is why the ongoing universal vaccination campaigns are absolutely detrimental to public and global health.

A sound public health response needs better detection methods (the PCR test is highly unreliable).

It needs a variety of treatment options (Fauci has single handedly repressed the dozen or so repurposed drugs that are saving lives elsewhere)

And it needs a long term strategy for prevention.

Instead all we've gotten is a protein specific vaccine, now mandated for nearly everyone that the virus has already circumvented precisely because it is single protein specific and being given to everyone.

Vaccines should be part of a comprehensive public health program. But this one size fits all strategy is already failing and mandates only increase its rapidity."
2021-09-13 12:18:25,"Covid continues to rage mostly because so many people refuse to be vaccinated and to wear masks.    These people's refusal to get a safe and effect vaccine is costing this country billions in unnecessary spending on hospitals and medical expenses.  Hospitals in much of the country (in particular the South) are over loaded.  I read this morning about a hospital in Georgia designed for 90 ICU patients but it has over a 100 now.  That is true in many places.

Everyone is worried about the ""rights"" of the anti-vaccine folks.   But what about the rights of the people who have been vaccinated.  Many of us are afraid to go out in public because so many people in public places are unvaccinated and refused to wear masks.

Best wishes."
2021-09-13 12:20:20,"The dialogue on vaccine mandates misses an important characteristic of the reasoning for the mandate.  
Without much broader protection in our population, the country runs the risk of permitting a much more lethal variant of COVID to take hold in the unvaccinated and perhaps then overwhelm the currently vaccinated population.  At the root, none of this is about civil liberties it is all about public health policy.  
If this country is broadly vaccinated then what comes next after Delta and Mu will have a difficult time in establishing itself, mutating and finding new strategies to infect people."
2021-09-13 12:20:32,"Both columnists fail to mention the impact of the non-vaccinated on the development of COVID variants which endanger even the fully vaccinated.

2021-09-13 12:22:10,"Bret, please refer to the article in today’s paper pertaining to COVID patients from “ freedom loving Idaho” now overwhelming north Washington hospitals to understand why Biden’s decision concerning vaccines may be a bit more aggressive than you like but absolutely necessary in a country of patchwork mitigation practices for COVID. And things are not slowing down in any sense of the term. I’m a physician and my local hospitals are overrun with sick, unvaccinated people. My colleagues in medicine, nursing and ancillary services are EXHAUSTED and see no end in sight. We’ve tried the carrot- good vaccine freely available and appealing to people’s better nature (ha) with our resulting horrible vaccination rate in Idaho and a republican governor who used to have sense missing in action so SOMEBODY had to be a grownup and lead with a stick. We are just tired of unnecessary death so thank you Joe."
2021-09-13 12:24:00,"It's just painful to read the thoughts of two people who seem to be missing the points, mainly Bret.  The mandate allows for frequent testing in lieu of vaccination. The reasons to attempt to reduce infections are to take the burden off hospitals, to reduce the probability of mutations in the virus, to allow the economy to return to pre-covid activity, and to allow people to live without the restrictions that are necessary to prevent infection. This is not the only vaccine mandate and the legal system has supported mandatory vaccination in the past."

After all, we know their behavior leads to serious chronic disease. What about someone who is injured in a crash and wasn’t wearing a seatbelt? I guess the EMTs should just shrug and walk away. Ditto a heroin user having an overdose.

We don’t deny medical care to people based on their actions for good reason. Who among us is a paragon of perfect healthy behavior?"

To his first point, isn't there the slightest correlation between vaccines and abortion, especially in states like the Texas government's recent  legislation telling women when and what they can and cannot do?

To his second point, yes the anti-vaxers/maskers do, and with gusto and priority handling by the medical community to the detriment of others."

Why then?

1) Partly, to protect myself against Delta

2) Mostly, so that other people in the building are comfortable that they won't get COVID from me.

Of the 17 homes affected, all but one have agreed to fund immediate replacement of the pipe. The holdout wants to sue the Coast Guard and GSA to make them pay for it.

Interesting take this ""bail out"" comment. Always comes down to money for the conservatives. 

No slippery slope there? Substance abuse/mental health treatment? If your teenage kid repeatedly gest intoxicated and wrecks on the long board requiring multiple fractures, stitches, or worse, how many times before we stop paying?  Adults? Not easy, especially in mental health and that's with those whom don't always agree with their diagnoses given the lack of objective measurement (i.e. no antigen nor antibody test to indicate current or recent infection and no powerful scanning electron microscope to ""see"" the virus and spike proteins).  How many individuals with diabetes and and cardiac illnesses follow their physicians directives based on data/science? Many still end up in the ER, repeatedly, despite average to above average intelligence.   If this path were to be followed, the devolution of humanity (yes, I agree it has already begun) will continue at a faster pace.

There are laws requiring that motorcyclists wear helmets.  Yet we don't withhold health benefits from motorcyclists who violate the law and then suffer serious injury.  We also don't withhold medical treatment from those who become sick due to smoking.  Maybe we should.  But until we equally treat, or should I say refuse to treat, everyone who does something that places them in danger of getting sick or injured, the unvaccinated should not be singled out.  I'd prefer that they be fined or banned from entering public areas."

2021-09-13 12:41:43,"Regarding people making bad health decisions and expecting others to bail them out, we already have this.

Hospitals are required to provide care to anyone who walks in whether or not they have insurance or ability to pay.  It irks me that there are people who choose not to have health insurance and say that they are expressing their individual rights but then when they get sick or have an accident expect others to pay for their care either through increased taxes or increased insurance costs.

I have no problem with adults whose minds are intact choosing not to have health insurance.  However, I do mind my having to pay for their care.  If they make that choice fine, but when they go to a hospital let them either show an ability to pay for care or be shown the door."

It might also be good to remember that, ""Months ago, pre-Delta, it was already plain California handled the plague better than the other big Sun Belt states to which it is often compared.
But here are numbers, as of mid-August: Texas, with 63.6 percent as many people as California, had 80% as many cases since the pandemic began. That’s a 17% differential in California’s favor. The contrast with Florida is as dramatic: The Sunshine state, with 53% as many people, had 70% as many cases, also a 17% differential."""

2021-09-13 12:42:41,"As a former public health professional, I believed the vaccines are an important part of the fight against any pandemic-level disease or illness, and so in tow I took the vaccine. I'm not so sure now, particularly since I took the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

Until recent weeks, the 14 million fellow Americans and I that took that version, have been asking questions that those in power have ignored and essentially not answered.

Now, today's New York Times morning newsletter points out that the science and follow-up to the J&J vaccine has been unclear; that a person may not find boosters of the product available; and the newsletter directly suggests that a person may have to consider lying to get another type of vaccine in coming months.

I trusted the CDC and the leadership of our nation to review and approve these vaccines for public use, and the New York Times to truthfully report on all the vaccines and their future use. Being told the vaccine is not as effective, may become unavailable, and that I should lie to get a booster shot, is not exactly my idea of good public leadership. 

It's no wonder the distribution, use and response to the vaccine for the public has become such a chaotic mess."

If Joe Biden “fails,” which is quite likely, it will be because of a Senate that gives every state equal voting power. James Madison himself denounced this as an “evil,” but we seem to treat it as part of the natural universe. There is simply no reason that Wyoming or, for that matter Vermont, should have the same voting power as California and Texas. It is not simply a question of population, which is terrible enough. It’s also the case that they are significantly less diverse or urban than the largest states, not to mention the excessive power of senators from small coal-producing states.

 And you wait and you wait and you wait for a listing of the Republican ideas and policies that would have any effect on the above.  But nothing appears, only that phrase ""complete Democratic Party Control"". as if that is the cause.

I have an obligation to my community in exchange for being allowed to live in the community, and to enjoy the support of my community. Mr. Stephens can't wrap his brain around this."

2021-09-13 12:51:51,"Dear Bret Stephens, 
The mere elective procedures being put off include things like kidney biopsies—even for kids.  This is what happened to my 17-year-old daughter two weeks ago.  She has a life-threatening kidney condition.  We were told at the time it would be put off “indefinitely” because of the Covid surge.  I am sure you can imagine the dread we felt.  Several days later they tried scheduling it again for the following week, and she was able to have it, but we held our breath until she was wheeled into the room.

NOTE:  I live in Virginia, not even one of the states with the highest Covid caseloads."
2021-09-13 12:52:32,"Re: Mr. Stephens’ statement: “As for his $3.5 trillion social-spending behemoth, he might consider breaking up the bill into separate items of legislation to bring the headline price tag down.”

How many of President Biden’s proposals has Congress voted on so far, almost nine months into his administration?  Not that many.  How many months until the next major election?  Fourteen.  And, given the bloc like nature of Senate Republicans under Mitch McConnell, how many of these broken down proposals would pass the Senate? One, maybe?  

The number of bills that can be run through the reconciliation process, where a simple majority is all that is necessary, is limited.  And, getting through that process with a 51/50 Senate is hard enough.  Breaking them up is only likely to provide the Democrats little more than the “opportunity” to run next November on a platform of “See what we tried to do, but couldn’t”.  That is not usually a successful platform.  And, if the omnibus proposal fails to get through reconciliation, the factor of “We really tried!” is a much clearer message."

I want to protect my freedom from Covid so I just got the booster shot as are many members of my Senior Club.  I wear the mask but only inside eventhough I find it uncomfortable especially during allergy season.  Many Grandparents did not see their Grandkids for fear of getting Covid but with my Doctors permission I see mine every month . The fear of Covid has not stopped me from buying tickets for 2 Broadway shows that were cancelled but are now reopening and my Senior Club reopened 2 months plus my friends and I have been dining inside for months.The thought of living a life of solitude at my age for the past 1-1/2 years is something I rejected and would have been emotionally draining so as I said it is up to the person to listen to themselves plus their Doctor.

2021-09-13 12:59:34,"""Elective"" surgery doesn't mean a nose job. It just means any surgery that doesn't start with an ambulance to the emergency room, i.e., something that can be scheduled. It means hernia surgery, removal of kidney stones, hip replacements, biopsies, tumor removal, etc.  Those who don't get vaccinated put others at risk of pain and potentially an increased risk of death or disabilities.  Elective surgeries should be prioritized over COVID patients who didn't bother to get vaccinated (with the exception of   people who cannot get a vaccine because of medical conditions.  Religious exemptions? A personal choice that shouldn't inflict pain and suffering on other people either. Go to the back of the line for medical care.)"
2021-09-13 12:59:49,"Brett, it is very likely that without a large share of the country being vaccinated our current outbreak would put the winter one to shame.  As it is this out break is beginning to level off, but as in another article states that have controlled their cases must accept unvaccinated cases from other states les vaccinated. such as Idaho sending its cases to Washington State.  And further the less vaccinated states almost totaly Republican send their bills to Medicaid  and Medicare and other Federal programs.  We are all paying the bill and hardship caused by the unvaccinated and their self righteous obstinacy   something they blame on Biden, but the figures do not lie and DeSanto and the rest are fully criminally at fault here."
2021-09-13 13:04:05,"On your prior headline, Bret, it’s hard to take back those words. People have seen them, but they may not see your regrets.

As for those refusing vaccination without a valid medical reason, yes - bar them form entry into places where they could spread Covid and limit their benefits. This vaccination is equally important as polio, smallpox, etc. just get it."
2021-09-13 13:05:33,Brett's qualms about mask mandates and requiring people to be vaccinated are typical knee jerk conservative reactions to government acting for the public good by imposing some limitations on iniividual freedom. It is that attitude that stands in the way of sensible gun legislation and gives the green light to people to put selfish comfort and desires above the common good. Wishing for people to act in responsible ways cannot substitute for rules that requires them to do so. People are not allowed to walk around naked in public places and I am sure Brett is ok with that. But walking around infecting other people with a potentially deadly disease when simple measures can prevent contagion should be allowed in the name of personal liberty. Logic does not seem to be a strong point with those who consider civil liberties paramount.

2021-09-13 13:07:08,"Bret Stephens needs to take a break and get educated about health care and public health. And this statement needs a ""misleading"" flag: ""Covid hospitalizations seem to be declining and the surgeries that are being put off are mainly elective. Otherwise, I don’t see the latest Covid spike as the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago."" 

Hospitals and especially ICUs are full in many jurisdictions. Patients with and without COVID-19 are being turned away. Some are dying. Idaho has instituted crisis care, rationing resources, withholding or delaying optimal care for some patients. Other jurisdictions are doing the same without a formal declaration. 

""Elective surgeries"" are not tummy tucks. They include cardiac, cancer, neurologic, and orthopedic surgeries. Americans are suffering and dying. The 1,200+ COVID-19 deaths per day is just one tragic aspect.

Health professionals are suffering, mentally and physically, with high rates of burnout, PTSD, and increased risk of suicide. 

It's not clear if that statement comes from cluelessness, heartlessness, or both, but it is sadly far for the truth."
2021-09-13 13:07:51,"It's surprising to see Bret so misinformed about  'elective' surgeries and masks after 1.5 years of this pandemic.

'Elective' surgeries just means it can be scheduled in advance.  It's not botox treatments, people are postponing chemotherapy and cardiac surgery.

As for masks, they are more effective at protecting others than protecting yourself.  A fully vaccinated person who wears a mask in a crowded area is doing their part to reduce transmission, even if their personal danger is low.  100,000+ people per day are getting infected in the United States right now.  It is absolutely prudent and patriotic for everyone to do their part to reduce the spread.  

Calling patriotic Americans busybodies and virtue signalers simply because they are trying to prevent their fellow citizens from getting sick is such a deeply cynical and toxic attitude, and I encourage Bret to assess what led him to this point.   

One of the most depressing realizations of this pandemic for me has been that we have lost our ability to work together as a country towards a common good."

2021-09-13 13:10:04,"Bret, I understand the whole point-counterpoint narrative here, but let's stop and think rationally for just a moment.   The anti vax crowd may be filling up hospitals, frustrating us all, and keeping the pandemic going indefinitely, but they are far from the only people at risk.   A dear friend of mine has RA and other health issues.   Although fully vaccinated, she walks into a fifth grade classroom every day-a classroom full of unmasked, unvaccinated students.  Her right to work in a safe environment, at least semi free from dread and worry takes a backseat to ""parent rights"" in our state and school district.

Here's a quote from this morning's edition of our local newspaper, ""Tampa Bay Times"" regarding our most recent School Board meeting.

""They had five or six doctors speak and say how bad the hospitals are, said Brian Martin, a chemical engineer with children in Pinellas schools. "" This is real.  Masks work.  Masks help.""   Then they had tons of not medically informed parents say crazy things that are scientifically untrue.  And the board decided to side with them.""

And here we are.  Over 4,000 cases of Covid in our school district since school began on August 11th, and only a matter of time before we lose a teacher, staff member, or child.   A governor who plays to the anti mask, anti vax crowd, and a school board who follows right along.   So, yes, it's past time to get tough.

2021-09-13 13:11:13,"Bret, I have no problem with President Biden's mandating vaccination everywhere he can. I have no problem with Biden mandating face masks everywhere he can, as well.

I have no problem with President Biden telling people who ""choose"" to be unvaccinated that they cannot use any public transportation regulated by the government without proof of vaccination, and a face mask. I have no problem with Biden telling people face masks are required in all schools for all kids and staff, and all kids and staff over 12 must be vaccinated. We require vaccines for measles, polio, diptheria, and many other diseases; COVID is just one more required shot.

I have no problem with Medicare and Medicaid not paying for unvaccinated people's medical bills. I have no problem with private insurers charging unvaccinated people appropriate premiums for the increased risk. I have no problem with hospitals prioritizing facility space and staff resources for vaccinated people first. I have no problem with private businesses of all sorts requiring vaccinations for all employees and customers.

I have no problem with ""choice"" - but all choices have consequences. I have no problem with making people who choose to give COVID a fertile unvaccinated body to grow, mutate, and spread in paying those consequences instead of free riding on the rest of us.

Bret, I have no problem with enforcing ""responsiblity"" along with ""rights""... no problem at all."

Bret believes Medicare, Medicaid and Private Insurers should refuse to pay for the care provided to anti-vaxxers. This only works if Hospitals are also allowed to withhold that care. Is that what he’s suggesting? Does he really think the unvaccinated will pay their health care bills? The answer is no. Hospitals and Doctors will bear the bad debt and will pass that cost onto the insurers in the form of higher premiums, so all of us who pay are bills will be negatively impacted. There is no free lunch."
2021-09-13 13:17:25,"Bret Stephens thinks Biden is a failed president, he wrote this just a week ago. Biden could do everything right and the Stephens would still find fault due to his inability to think beyond his right wing dogma. President Biden implemented the mandate because there are some Americans who are acting like petulant  adolescents and somehow equate freedom with spreading a deadly virus. Meanwhile his party, the Republicans, are fully embracing nihilism as a political strategy. 

I suggest Bret familiarize himself  with Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), tin which the Supreme Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. The Court's decision articulated the view that individual liberty is not absolute and is subject to the police power of the state."

The lives.  The names.

The reading of the names at the New York Memorial on 9/11, with  takes 4 hours. 

Those lost to COVID are like the names read aloud on 9/11.  The names reflect ordinary humans of every faith, ethnicity.

In January, on the eve of inaugurating a new president, 400 lights were lit; each light representing 1000 lives.  How insufficient!  How can one light represent 1,000 lives.  Names.  Families.  Children, niecies, wives, brothers.  Just like we saw at the Memorial.

And there are those who survived the initial impact of the disease but are still suffering with all sorts of symptoms.  A part of them will never be quite right.  What if we included their names?

Imagine if we read the names of those who perished to COVID aloud.  More than 500,000 Americans.  Or we assembled the squares on a quilt.  Or a single illumination for each person.  Imaging we memorialized all of the names in granite.  Doing so would make the size of our collectively losses real, tangible, enormous."

I agree with Bret Stephens on this one. However, he might have mentioned that if employees don't wish to be vaccinated, they still have the option of being tested periodically before stepping foot into their workplace. In my opinion, this testing should also be at their expense since they are refusing a free vaccine. 

Trump is starting to bore people. Since DeSantis and Abbott have modeled themselves and their politics on Trump's, they won't be far behind."
2021-09-13 13:25:02,"The Medicare and Medicaid laws, and private insurance contracts, don't permit them to refuse payment to patients whose illnesses result from their irresponsible or reckless behavior.

2021-09-13 13:29:42,"There's a case to be made for bodily autonomy as a valid reason to be able to refuse vaccination AND testing.  Ultimately, a person has a right to reject any medical intervention.  At a fundamental level, we should all respect that.  

But the mandate isn't absolute.  It simply makes vaccination or testing a condition for certain types of employment.  Many jobs and opportunities to travel are already conditional on vaccination for other illnesses, so this new rule is not much different from preexisting ones."

Requiring people who go out in public to work, school, business, of social events to be vaccinated is absolutely not a violation of their civil liberties.

As to refusing Medicare or other health insurance coverage to the unvaccinated, that is immoral, impractical  and as costly as their coverage would be.  In my State, NJ,  as in most or possibly all other States an uninsured patient cannot be turned away from an ER, nor denied necessary medical care. In the end the cost of the insured's care is made up by increases in hospital bills that others must pay (Medicare, private insurance and other patients) and by direct reimbursement from the government (indigent care).. This leads to higher insurance premiums and taxes (or more deficit spending).

The least expensive, and healthiest solution is more vaccinations before another Covid strain emerges."

The virus is not going to disappear this year or next year or the year after until the World is sufficiently vaccinated and it will linger still.

Once the dollar amount is taken out of the argument, we can debate the substance of the bill. Since the substance of the bill sounds pretty good to many people, Republicans, Manchin and Sinema have to resort to yakking about the $3.5 trillion. It amazes me how much questionable spending is approved by Congress with nary a whimper (recent example: the strategic uranium fund -- much less expensive at $75 million for a study, but of highly dubious utility), while Biden's proposal to help people in tangible ways is widely attacked for its alleged price tag."

Soon a spat breaks out between the two men: Tim Robbin's character wants to fight back while Tom Cruise's character doesn't. One man champions freedom/liberty/resistance (he flies the Gadsden flag?), even if it kills him, while the other is concerned for his daughter and simply wants to live, perhaps  to fight another day.

Also, not mentioned is that weekly testing can substitute for vaccination.

My Republican governor, who has mildly recommended vaccinations, is considering challenging the rule in court. The result of suggestions rather than mandates is that Indiana is in the bottom ten of states in terms of vaccination rates. Our hospitals are overrun with unvaccinated Covid-19 patients, such that major hospitals have temporarily cancelled elective surgeries and have intermittently gone on diversion (turning away ambulances). I got vaccinated as soon as I was eligible, but I have to worry that if I were to require hospital care for another reason, there would be no beds or staff available for me. So, the anti-mandate governors are punishing responsible citizens in order to accommodate the whims of the selfish and irresponsible among us.

In her work, every day, in full PPP garb, she is trying to help people who are suffering from a spike in infections: the emerging variants now at loose in the U.S. population.

To bring this still closer to home, I have two housemates who both got a positive COVID test this week (so-called ""breakthrough"" infections). My Pfizer immunization and the precautions we are taking here at home has so far kept me healthy.

No public transportation without a vaccine card. No entry to any public building without the proof of being vaccinated.

Don't most of these apply to nearly every large city in the US and the world?  And they don't have the budget surplus of California to deal with them.

2021-09-13 14:11:03,"I strongly disagree with Mr Stephens:

""The civil libertarian in me doesn’t love the idea of this or any president using administrative powers to force vaccines on the people who refuse to get them."" Biden is not ""forcing"" anyone to get a vaccine. He is saying that if you don't get a vaccine, there may be consequences. This may include losing a job. But how is that any worse than ""forcing"" an unvaccinated COVID patient to pay their own medical bills, which could lead to bankruptcy, as Bret seems to condone?

""As anti-vaxxers are mostly putting themselves at serious risk of getting seriously ill, I don’t see the need for a presidential directive."" You may think differently if you had, as we do, young children not yet eligible for the vaccine, or an immuno-compromised family member. Also read today's NYT article on sick unvaccinated North Idahoans, where the governor has done nothing to mitigate COVID, flooding Washington State's hospitals, where the governor has done everything, depriving Washington residents of needed care. What does a libertarian do there? Close the border?

Biden has done exactly the right thing by following the widespread advice of medical experts on how to deal with this public health crisis. The Republican outrage over it is disgracefully hypocritical given the even more stringent vaccination requirements many red states such as Mississippi have imposed to fight measles, mumps and many other diseases. The politics is killing people and should stop."
2021-09-13 14:11:05,"I believe Bret Stephens omitted some crucial facts when formulating his opinion about President Biden’s vaccine mandate.

First, people still have a choice. Get the vaccine or submit to weekly covid testing.

Second, Stephens does not believe the current spike in covid cases poses the same public health crisis we faced last year. He’s wrong. Hospitals in unvaccinated areas are facing a true crisis including a lack of ICU beds, and an overwhelmed and diminished health care staff. Is Mr. Stephen’s unaware that last week the State of Idaho moved to crisis standards of care? This means covid care can be rationed based on the likelihood of recovery. This is what Republicans during the Obama administration derisively referred to as death panels.

Lastly, although it is true that the current spike in covid cases is primarily among the anti-vaxxers, they are not the only ones affected. Covid cases among children who are too young to be vaccinated have risen significantly and has included a rise in pediatric hospital admissions."
2021-09-13 13:08:52,"States and businesses aren't requiring that everyone wear masks, regardless of vaccination status, because they are afraid vaccines don't work. They are requiring it because without vaccine passports there is NO WAY for businesses and public building managers to know if someone is actually vaccinated or if they are lying.  Most of the anti-vax people are also ""anti-mask"" people so it is a safe bet that most of them are going to choose not to wear a mask if they can easily get away with lying about it.

When you go to the grocery store and 1 out of 10 people are masked up in a state with 50% vaccination rates is it because you went to the most pro-vaccine grocery store in the state or is it because some people are lying about their vaccination status and throwing health and safety of others to the wind?

Suggesting that these mask mandates are for any other reason only serves to propagate the anti-vaccine rhetoric that these people are fed on daily basis. The only difference being is that they are reading it in the NYT instead of their anti-vax Facebook group."
2021-09-13 14:18:05,"Brett, we live in a society and as members of a society we are required to contribute to the greater good. President Bidens vaccination push isn't directed at those with legitimate medical or access reasons for not getting vaccinated. In fact, his plan is designed to protect them to the greatest extent possible. His plan is an attempt to restore the federal governments role in assuring  and returning society's right to individually pursue life, liberty and happiness.
Unfortunately, public health is one of the few areas where libertarian views confuse individual freedoms with ones societal duties and responsibilities. This is a terrible disease that has taken far too many lives, unnecessarily, due to politics and poor leadership at the federal level. President Kennedy said it best ""ask not what the country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.""

Advocate for vaccines, Brett. This is not the individual freedoms fight you make it out to be. Do it for your fellow man, your country."

Sounds good. One reaps what one sows. Punishment for one’s sins!

Except...hospitals will not refuse care and turn people away. Healthcare workers will still risk their own and their family members’ health to provide care. Others will have their health put at risk. Insurers will find it impossible to unilaterally and suddenly eliminate benefits. Unpaid bills will be ignored and/or written off. New, perhaps worse, variants will evolve. The economy will continue to stagger along. 

Or someone could try do do something useful. 

Bret, as usual, is divorced from reality."

This is exactly the kind of flawed thinking that has made US the worst in the world for COVID cases/deaths. Wearing a mask is not just for oneself - it is to protect others as well. A person without a mask could put themselves in danger, but they can also start a chain of infections that can put many, many more in danger. So even if one is perfectly healthy/young whatever and is vaccinated, with the coronavirus raging in so many parts of the country, it is imperative to wear a mask. What's so difficult to understand about this?"
2021-09-13 14:22:09,"Just a word or two about masking even in vaccinated people. In medicine, we assume that everyone carries the virus unless proven otherwise. The rationale for vaccinated people is to assume they are carriers or prevent them from becoming one. In both cases, the best protection is a mask for everyone. Vaccination for all individuals is the only way the virus will be vanquished. Until then it’s is a war in which we’ve all been drafted and all of us have to fight. There is no choice. The anti-vaxers are either delusional or just unable to understand the issues. Hopefully we can educate the latter group and isolate the former"

This virus is spread by healthy young individuals who may not ever know that they were infected. They will never know how they contributed to the deaths of many others. And there are also the other costs to the economy, to the education of our children etc.

2021-09-13 14:27:38,"Gail and Bret may be missing the forest for the trees. You can argue masks, mandates, big spending, taxing the wealthy and helping the poor until the cows come home. But it’s pretty much all academic.  Congress is evenly divided between the left and the right . And the lack of a consensus for much of anything is the rule of the day. 

I flew across the country and was told by flight attendants to wear my mask between each peanut I ate. Then I went to a football game with 100,000 fans who wore no masks at all, vaccinated or not. 

The subtleties of all the issues are argued on these pages. But they are largely removed from reality. Reality is that there are two Americas that are torn asunder, making most of politics an argument over what inevitably will not get done.

Private health insurers might also follow suit. 

I LOVE IT, in complete agreement until I start to realize that many if not most of these medical bills are going to not get paid.  Then what?  Hospitals etc. can't afford to absorb the costs, so it ends up as higher billing for everyone else.  One way or the other it ends up on the backs of those who have already made better decisions regarding vaccination."

He seems to be in denial of the fact that such programs are necessary for a country to be considered ""leading"".

This illustrates why a presidential directive is needed. We need policies that stretch across state borders because the irresponsibility of citizens and government in one state endanger the citizens in other states."

They are out spreading the virus to anyone and everyone who comes into contact with them, then filling hospitals in their own communities and OTHER communities and other states.  
I heard mealy mouthed Asa Hutchinson from Arkansas on Meet The Press complaining about Biden's federal overreach in vaccinating and masking mandates.  According to him State governments should be issuing the mandates, not the federal government.  WELL THEN DO IT.   
  This is an invisible virus and as such none of us can know who has it, who is spreading it,  who will be able to fight it off even with vaccinations.

The fact is no organized religion, including the Christian Science Church,  holds that any vaccination is against their religion.  The idea that a person can avoid vaccination by waving the Bible at governments and employers is testament to the unwillingness of government to put public health above the self-centered and opportunistic demands of those wrapping themselves in the cloak of mysticism."

When will his handlers come to realize that a large percentage of Federal employees are Black and that they make up a considerable percentage of those who haven't taken the vaccine.  How many of them will be fired, due to his new mandate?

A centrist is inclined to do what most of the public wants. They are not obliged to veer their policy decisions to strongly reflect whacko positions - and the GOP has a large portion of their base who've been encouraged for years to feel their whacko positions deserve support.  They do not.

When Civil Libertarian views are that people should have freedom to choose what happens to their bodies, fine. But they do not have the right to then allow their behavior to put other bodies at risk. 

So, don't want vaccine because ""freedom"" or just because someone said you should an you don't wanna (insert tantrum).

Fine. Don't expect you're going to be allowed to make that choice and still be treated like everyone else who realizes that the vaccines are to protect all of us, not just the one getting the shot.

The Donors Trust crowd, and whackos like anti-doctor-certification Rand Paul, have taken the ""I don't wanna"" part of the libertarian view to extremes, while handily discarding the fact that a true libertarian with morals would not let their choices harm others.

So Biden SHOULD be acting strongly on the safety net and on decarbonizing - most people want that and it does the most good, even though the GOP's leaders don't wanna.

The vaccine is incredibly well understood at this point to be safe and effective (see the proportion of deaths occurring are now 1 pct. vaccinated, 99 unvaccinated). So the administration is trying to force people to do something that's 1. safe, 2. for their own good, and 3. has a community benefit.

Your brilliant alternative is to let people choose to get sick, and when the chickens come home to roost be stuck with potentially bankrupting levels of medical debt. What a better way to serve the people. Truly Reagan's dream for America."

I’m in favor of mask mandates as long as the under 12 cannot be vaccinated and kids are tested regularly at school.  How is there any question about this."
2021-09-13 14:51:12,"Brett,
With all due respect, those of us who are vaccinated but still wear masks are not merely “busybodies and virtue-signalers.” We are not signaling our “virtue” but (as Gail suggests) we are reminding ourselves and everyone around us that we’re still in a pandemic. It is our social responsibility to take precautions for the health of everyone. If you see virtue in that, well, great.

Also, your comment about the effects of Covid-related hospitalizations suggests that it’s not a big deal if the “surgeries that are being put off are mainly elective.” Well, “elective” surgeries aren’t all nose jobs and tummy tucks. This category includes anything scheduled, such as surgery to remove a cancerous tumor or open a blocked artery. “Elective” doesn’t mean “not medically necessary,” FYI. 

While I agree that “people shouldn’t expect someone else to bail them out of their terrible health decisions,” this is exactly what our health care system does (cigarette, anyone?). 
What is inexcusable is when one person’s terrible health decision affects the health of others…like, second hand smoke or spreading a deadly infectious disease. There are rules to prevent this, and they should be enforced, for the good of everyone."
2021-09-13 14:52:07,"We too often forget that Freedom also carries Responsibility. If a person can get vaccinated and chooses not to, then they need to take responsibility for that freedom. If you get Covid and could have been vaccinated, please don't go to our hospitals. Your ""freedom"" is overwhelming the system. Your ""freedom"" is denying others in need.
I sometimes think that better than a vaccine mandate would be a ""hospital mandate."" Only a certain percentage of beds could be allocated to unvaccinated patients(not including those unable to be vaccinated, of course). Hospital staff wouldn't be so overwhelmed. Others who were responsible would be able to get the needed care.
If medicare and insurance stop paying for unvaccinated patients, then the hospitals pick up much of the bill. Smaller hospitals already struggle. We need our hospitals and we need our hospital workers.
Oh yeah, freedom also ends when it adversely effects the well being of others...but that's another story."

People who do not get the vaccine infect  others, they refuse to wear masks and and as a result are even more effective in infecting others. They tax the medical system to extremes and take a disproportionate amount of medical services resulting in others needing care for a variety of serious illnesses to be denied services.  This continues to be a national crisis and could easily escalate again with the possibility of new variants. We should stop the political nonsense and be unequivocal in insisting on vaccines, and work as a community to protect  one another. I wholeheartedly agree with Biden's actions."

 The next epidemic of Long Covid is rarely addressed in the media. There is a severe lack of data but the debilitating symptoms of Long Covid are numerous, chronic, and serious. 

 We have relatives who are young, healthy professionals with debilitating Long Covid conditions on medical leave now with an uncertain and painful future.  ( they contracted Covid before the vaccine)  They live in CA and are very lucky to have the best medical care money can buy but they cannot buy their way out of Long Covid.

Disability payments due to Long Covid will drain Social Security even more.   I wish our politicians and public health leaders would see the full picture and take the ""long"" view on this pending crisis.  Not likely though given the current state of affairs.   

 Our country as a whole won't even look at the real-world data in Israel in a timely and clear fashion.   The data has been there for months.  Israel has the highest vaccination rate in the world and is struggling with cases of Covid breakthrough.

Going unvaccinated impinges on the freedom of others by exposing them to the virus, is an unwarranted  cost upon  our economy, potentially leads to new variants that are resistant to the available vaccine, and is no different from vaccine requirements for children going to school."
2021-09-13 14:55:48,"Bret,  I don’t know where you are getting your sunny view of how well the health care system is doing, but Idaho is out of ICU beds and is shipping patients next door to Washington, which is already strained in the eastern part of the state in particular. People are dying of non-COVID condition because they are unable to get ICU care. Breakthrough infections of the vaccinated are on the rise, and while not usually life-threatening, can be serious, especially in vulnerable individuals. As Gail said, no one is being held down and forcibly vaccinated. But the unvaccinated will need to test frequently and may not be able to enjoy all the privileges of being in public spaces where they can infect others.  This is not just a matter deciding about one’s own health— it’s the fact that every unvaccinated person can be a reservoir for development of a new variant, can spread disease to others and threaten the community as a whole. Get a clue."
2021-09-13 14:57:06,"The notion that the only people the unvaccinated hurt are themselves is not true. The variants like Delta emerge from mutations of the virus. If we could shut down more transmission, we might save each other from more infectious and deadly variants."
2021-09-13 14:58:17,"Of course the pandemic is political, as is rightly the case.

Science can advise, but science cannot decide. The reason is that fighting the pandemic continues to require us to balance two good things that will always be in fundamental tension with each other:  minimizing the transmission of the virus versus producing the goods and services we all need for life.

Threading that needle is the role of politics, for at its roots, politics is about reconciling conflicting interests.

Our problem continues to stem from Donald J. Trump and the misinformation he trumpeted:  the pandemic would be over by Easter 2020; it's just the flu; bleach might help;  ultraviolet light kills the virus (no practical points on how to get the UV light inside you once you were infected).  Trump's lunacy still holds sway over much of the world.

Imagine an alternative history:  rational use of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as distancing and masking were widely understood and practiced; vaccines were embraced as a technological God-send; and people knew we were all in it for the long haul.

Imagine.
So,"
2021-09-13 11:43:22,"Please, please stop calling Biden's directive a vaccine mandate.  The most irksome part of this action to the unmasked, unvaccinated and frankly untethered Republicans is the requirement set by OSHA for employers of more than 100 people to TEST their employees weekly.

The employees may avoid swabs in noses weekly by getting vaccinated.  That's the choice in play.

And, BTW, I would have the employees pay for the testing by docking their wages.  Having the costs borne by the employer or, worse yet, passed through in higher prices for the customer makes the vaccinated pay for the dalliance of the holdouts."
2021-09-13 15:04:34,"I'd love to be able to tell the difference on the street between those who ""deserve"" to wear masks, according to Bret, and those who are ""virtue-signaling"" in some way that offends him.  The problem is, if you're offended by somebody wearing a mask, that's all it is.  You're literally offended by something which is actually a virtue.

Not something I'd be particularly proud of, but then again I'm not a Republican."
2021-09-13 15:05:29,"Bret's thinking about masking is emblematic of what's wrong with most of the mask- and vaccine-resisters: Considering only personal, individual benefits.

He's fine with immunocompromised folks wearing masks, but those of us who, like me, wear them to protect other people are  ""busybodies or virtue-signalers.""

Like far too many people, Bret completely misses a key point: A public health emergency requires community-level thinking and concern, not simply a calculation of individual risk."
2021-09-13 15:06:03,"""is to refuse to allow Medicare or Medicaid to pay their medical bills in the event they become seriously ill. Private health insurers might also follow suit.""

As a physician, we can not deny care.  If the hospital doesn't get paid, they go bankrupt and close as they have in many of the states that refused to expand Medicaid.

""I don’t see the latest Covid spike as the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago.""

The Covid spike now is more regional, with areas with lower vaccination rates having worse numbers that a year ago. And 1500 deaths per day is not a number you can ignore, especially since it is now happening in younger people.
 
""as anti-vaxxers are mostly putting themselves at serious risk of getting seriously ill, I don’t see the need for a presideyountial directive, including the renewed mask mandates""

Antivaxxers are putting those unable to get the vaccine and those with underlying conditions at risk.  

""people, particularly the immunocompromised, who have a solid medical or emotional need to take great precautions, including masks, and I totally respect them. The busybodies and virtue-signalers, not so much.""

The mask does not significantly reduce your risk of getting the disease (10-20% max) if you wear it.  It reduces your spread of the virus via aerosol droplets, if you are infected, by 74%.  Since vaccinated people can still get the disease and spread it even if they are asymptomatic, all should where masks.  

Very poor column from Bret."

He says they are o lay endangering themselves but that’s not true! I don’t want a mild break through and then long Covid. Why not just acknowledge that the anti Covid valets are doing this for some misguided political vision. Or worse, as Christians who see Covid, like climate change, as signs of the coming rapture. Start from there : they are ignorant and want to impose their beliefs on the rest of us. Then let’s hear the argument."

People aren’t wearing masks to “virtue signal”, Bret.  They want this pandemic to end sooner rather than later. Why you oppose that, or feel the need to project people’s motives, is beyond me."
2021-09-13 14:05:21,"The Republican Party agenda since Carter has been to delegitimize any Democratic president.  Clinton turned toward the middle and got himself impeached.  Obama was some sort of foreigner and a secret Muslim.  Biden didnt really win the election.  

Republicans will believe just about anything that makes Biden look bad.  They willingly believe that Democratic presidents are incompetents and diabolical plotters at the same time, which makes no sense.  Having contradictory attributes is a sign of evil, and assigning contradictory attributes to someone else is a sign of being out of touch with reality.  

Biden can pursue any course he wants; he will be demonized for something or other no matter what he does.  Republicans do not have a platform to stand on these days; their own victory is all they stand for.  

Bret does not consider global warming a serious problem, and wants it dealt with in a way that does not increase government power or reduce the power of the monied.  He is willfully out of touch with reality in this, but refuses to go whole hog and become a Trumpie.  Whether this refusal is a matter of real principle or a ploy to retain credibility with the NYT audience he writes for is not very important; either way he is helping divide the opposition to Trump."

I accept that people don’t want the government or their employer telling them what to do with their bodies. But these same people shouldn’t expect someone else to bail them out of their terrible health decisions.”

Picture this Bret - critically ill people lying on the sidewalk outside of hospitals because they are unvaccinated and can’t afford the estimated bill for treatment.  Not going to happen, of course.  
But, you say, let them in and have them pay for care.  Well, if they survive, that might work for those who can afford it.  Otherwise, the cost of “free” care is borne by the rest of us through taxes, increased insurance premiums and higher medical costs generally.  I thought you Repubs knew all this “economy stuff”."
2021-09-13 11:27:25,"Bret seems to be thinking in sound bites. 

If Medicare doesn't pay for the tens of thousands of willingly unvaccinated COVID patients, then who pays for their hospital stays? 

These are conservatives, Bret, from Red States. That means they are takers, not makers. They have no resources. The wealthy Red Staters are as vaccinated as we are. They just lie about it. 

I guess we could throw  these poor people out in the street, while chanting ""let them die"". What Republican debate did people start chanting that slogan at anyway? Whatever it was, Bret was a GOPer in good standing then. 

But that doesn't seem right either. 

BTW--this is still a real health crisis. Blue State Washington is taking Red State Idaho's COVID patients as we speak. Idaho can't handle them anymore. While Red State Mississippi denounces Biden for imposing mandates exactly like those imposed by Mississippi on its school children for decades--except Biden's vaccine mandates are much more limited. 

The only Republican justification for this seems to be ""our base is crazy so we have to pander"". No you don't. Man up and become patriots again. Get on the Biden bandwagon. Support the vaccine mandates.

Continuing the way we are, we are very susceptible to another Covid variant developing and what a catastrophe that would be. We have a way to beat this bug, so why shouldn't we follow the surest path and get herd immunity? 
I have no sympathy whatever for the anti-vaxers. I resent them for their selfishness and actually continuing to  endanger my life. I wonder how many of them will actually get a Flu shot?"

President George W.

New York Metro is a lot different than most of country. Subways, buses, elevators and crowded office's. They were hit faster. Where in the hinterlands it was more spread out leaving people to say what virus?  

DeBlasio ordered city workers back to the office. Right or wrong? Again not an easy call. But if you look at the top down power structure of the left. Don't those workers know their place? They don't think it's over but who are they to think in a perfect world.

DeBlasio is about as far left as you can get. New York is about as close to our dream of ""The Shining City on the Hill"", except for maybe cities like San Francisco. So how dare they question DeBlasio? Hasn't he consulted with best minds of science and medicine? Don't they know they're in good hands? Shouldn't they just obey?

Declaring the move “terrifying,” he wrote on Twitter: “This is still America, and we still believe in freedom from tyrants.”

There is a deep inconsistency in that argument. Mississippi has some of the strictest vaccine mandates in the nation, which have not drawn opposition from most of its elected officials. Not only does it require children to be vaccinated against measles, mumps and seven other diseases to attend school, but it goes a step further than most states by barring parents from claiming “religious, philosophical or conscientious” exemptions.

We are all frustrated and angry with people who refuse to get vaccinated, keep us from attaining herd immunity and increase the likelihood of a more virulent variant infecting us.  But denying them insurance coverage?  We are all concerned about high and rising insurance premiums, but denying coverage to people who get hurt when drunk?  For diabetics who don't engage in optimal management of their disease?  For people who don't follow health guidelines and get heart attacks?

About a quarter of PhDs are in the no-covid-vax-no-way group.

Writing from a land where free-at-point-of-service healthcare is a right, it is also dismaying to see Bret argue that a large share of the US population, and a quarter of American PhDs, should have their Medicare terminated for holding a view of Covid vaccines that is different from his.

I have a elderly friend who told me last Fall, when we met,  they didn't believe in masks. I was told he yesterday he might have COVID-19 now. When I mentioned that they may be unvaccinated to another person, I was told not to judge. This explains what we are up against as we try to get people to respond to the science and experts. 

Oddly, and I am Pro Life, it seems the ones not wanting to do the only three things we have as tools to beat this virus  are saying they should have control of their bodies. These are usually the same people wanting to limit access to abortion. Regarding any medical intervention, I am for informed consent. We live in a state of contradictions. 

Politically we also live in a state of contradictions as well. Many people who voted for Donal Trump would never tolerate his words and actions for their children or people with which they wanted to be around. I had to laugh when someone was critical of Joe Biden for swimming nude when we have recordings of Trump bragging about his thoughts on women and what he said about John McCain.

We are in the middle of a nationwide pandemic we should have been out of by now. The U.S. has fallen to the least-vaccinated country of the wealthy G7s… it's beyond inexcusable and embarrassing. I'm thrilled Biden issued mandates; I think he should have done it sooner. If the populace is going to act like children then they are going to be treated as such. 

Secondly, from almost everyone I talk to and every comment I read, this ""Afghanistan debacle"" is media-fueled. No one else thinks it's a debacle and everyone commends Biden for being the only president in 20 years to have the backbone to get us out of there.

""Failed Presidency"" headlines sell newspapers. No one in the real world thinks that."
2021-09-13 13:26:33,"Wow, I actually find myself agreeing with Bret on most of the stuff he's saying here.  No, Medicaid/Medicare should not be paying for nincompoopery, and neither should Blue Cross/Blue Shield.  They made their beds with their ridiculous refusal on vaccines; let them lie in them.  What are we up to?  177 million fully vaccinated?  Are the hospitals full of people with vaccine side effects?  No.

And as for the super big monster $3.5 Trillion with a really big T spending bill, yes, trim it down, if that's what it takes, break it up into a few smaller pieces, if those pieces can stand on their own merit (if they can't, they shouldn't be in there to begin with), and take the sticker shock out of this thing.  

But as for simply getting things done, I think the President and the Democratic leaders of Congress realize that their window is short, and if they don't get it done by the end of the year, it won't get done at all.  This means thinking big.  If it were me in the Oval Office, I would target Guantanamo Bay next, and dare Congress to do anything about it.  And then I would give it back to Cuba."
2021-09-13 13:29:40,"I think the anti-vaxers have to live more honestly. If they are against FDA approved life-saving vaccines, then they need to insist that children also will no longer get vaccinated against polio, measles, mumps, whooping cough, pneumonia, flu, etc. If they don't trust western medicine, then it seems foolish to go to doctors or a hospital when sick. They need to stay home when sick. With this new level of anti-vaxer honesty it would be an exciting time for schooling and education. In the interest of choice, we could establish separate anti-vaxer and pro-vaxer schools. Of course experimental schools would also be permitted, schools where the opposed-to-health-care and in-favor- of-health-care families mix freely. We missed a chance to pretty much wipe out the COVID virus when vaccines became available. Now thousands a day are contracting the virus and passing it on and creating the perfect climate for more and more mutations. But, we are resourceful Americans who believe in free choice, right! So let's go with free choice regardless of consequences and even expand on it. Separate schools, churches, festivals, community centers, sports teams, neighborhoods, etc. for  anti-vaxers and pro-vaxers. This way everyone gets to choose the society they want to live in and no one has to even think about the responsibilities that go with living in a free, democratic country. Enough with the idea of a social contract and responsibility.  Free choice for all regardless of consequences."

The point, for those scoring at home, is not merely to protect oneself; it's to prevent your spreading the virus to the vulnerable if you unknowingly get infected and have no symptoms.

Hospitals all around the country are at or beyond capacity. And healthcare workers are so burned out that they are leaving en masse. All of this means that care that we take for granted — from cancer care to orthopedics to basic prevention — is unavailable. The ramifications of all of this will last for at least a decade.

The idea that politics and politicians are only manipulative on the other side is absurd. Frankly it's shocking just how easily people are led into believing well, just about anything.

Whatever success we've had with vaccination has come precisely because of government intercession. 

Big Pharma is clearly an industry that has way more money than it knows what to do with and spends a huge portion of it monopolizing TV advertising, from the staid network news to channels that show faded reruns of the ""Beverly Hillbillies"". Not only are the ads relentless, they are disturbingly surreal in their cognitive dissonance. Gauzy, slow-motion vignettes of life's precious moments are accompanied by an endless litany of horrific side effects; they're beyond parody. Who can be pelted by these commercials on a daily basis and not think they're being sold snake oil by a bunch of charlatans?"

I have always thought that most humans I met were and are living in a fantasy world of cruelty.  They believe in magical things and they like to be mean to others. It's normal or, maybe more correctly, common. The common people live outside reality and like being cruel to each other. 

I think this is a great opportunity to show that those who deny reality are harming others and themselves. If one is rational, then that is the lesson of Covid. That many people will choose to suffer because their cult leaders want them to, just like they always have. Except this time the results are obvious and severe for those who deny the truth.  Although I see the republican pundits still spin this as a freedom issue. But, more correctly it could be called a free dumb issue."

Here in the real world, fully vaccinated people, many with pre-existing conditions or with well-founded concerns about the transmissibility of the Delta variant, are still unable to live their lives normally. And just on the other side of the NY Times website front page, one sees this story about how the abject failure to address Covid in Idaho is leading to massive spillover problems in the healthcare system in Washington state. That is why a federal vaccination mandate is important.

The entirety of Biden's policy decisions are due to one vote.  C'mon man.

As before, Stephens ignores changing circumstances and contexts.   Long range thinking is what he read yesterday.  Breadth of thinking?  Well, there isn't any.

Biden could do everything right and the Stephens would still find fault due to him being a partisan hack. President Biden implemented the mandate because there are some Americans who are acting like petulant  adolescents and somehow equate freedom with spreading a deadly virus.  The Republican party is of nihilist who would rather see Covid-19 spread through the nation then admit the a Democratic president is right. 

I suggest Bret familiarize himself  with Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), tin which the Supreme Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. The Court's decision articulated the view that individual liberty is not absolute and is subject to the police power of the state."

The world is reeling now due to Delta -- a mutation from original Covid.  And the more human bodies that process this virus, the more likely another, worse, mutation arrives, and erupts.

Covid-19 isn't ""the big one.""  The big one is Covid with a 17% mortality rate, and among healthy 30-year-olds.  That's not theoretical -- that's Hong Kong 2003.  The only reason we beat it is that symptoms showed up in 36 hours, not 14 days.  Shut everything down, and beat the virus.

And I think you need to define your concept of ""elective"" for everyone.  Follow up surgeries for serious operations?   Removal of painful gallstones?  Surgery for a problem that is not going to kill you now, but is getting worse and worse (and is likely to kill you if it keeps getting worse).  Just what to you mean by ""elective"", Bret?"

Think of Covid-19 infected folks as replicating glitter bombs. If you are vaccinated, it’s annoying to clean up at best with slight odds it’ll overwhelm you.

And sometimes the glitter changes so that potentially you can’t clean it up and it overwhelms you.

COVID-19, like glitter, can’t get cleaned up if we’re constantly introducing more of it and making versions more pernicious in avoiding the vacuum.

 For the anti-vaxxers, I don't think it is hyperbole to declare they now want their virus and spread it too.  By now, I believe virtually everyone in this country knows the virus is highly contagious and while they may not get sick, that is no guarantee those they infect couldn't  become extremely sick and die. But apparently the spreaders don't care. 

So perhaps they should slightly modify their actions since they seem totally unwilling to change their attitudes. Stay home. Don't expect to go to work. Your co-workers don't want you around. And if you go broke because you've lost your source of income, just remember the other old saying.

Also, the overcrowding of hospitals effects everyone. Let’s not forget about the potential impact of the Covid spike on the economy (jobs report last month fell way short of expectations).

2021-09-13 13:23:25,The only issue I have with the mandates that Biden announced is I do not think they go far enough.  I would suggest that Medicare not cover unvaccinated adults and that hospital be required to give vaccinated patients priority.  Why should the rest of us pay the huge unnecessary medical bills of those that refuse to be vaccinated.  Any Federal employee that refused to be vaccinated should be summarily terminated and banned from applying for Federal employment.  Those of us that did the right thing and got vaccinated have suffered enough.  People have lost jobs and had their lives turned upside down due to a minority of ignorant people.  Enough is enough.
2021-09-13 14:25:43,"Bret, these conversations are revealing an increasing incoherence in your stated positions.  Biden risks ""division"" (love this argument by the right!) by mandating vaccines/tests, but Medicare should not pay for anti-vaxxers who get sick?  That's a catastrophe.  Biden should be the ""unifier"" he promised, but you call millions of Americans ""nincompoops""?  I agree, but that doesn't sound like unity.  And you rattle off problems of California, which are large, complex, and widely shared nationally, and want Biden to be a ""moderate""?  You need to spend more time at the movies and then think this all through."

George Washington had a small pox vaccine mandate for the troops for goodness sake.

Every school child in every State is vaccinated by mandate against a half dozen or more diseases non of which are nearly as contagious or deadly as COVID 19. 

As to using OSHA and other agencies to compel vaccination... 

How do you think we got the drinking age to 21? Federal Government withheld all highway funds from any State that refused to raise their drinking age.

We did the same thing back when we had mandatory 55 national speed limit.

This is nothing new. 

It is nothing weird. 

It is NOT some Totalitarian Unconstitutional Infringement on Your Rights.

This is a matter of Public Health.

If you don't want to be vaccinated you need to work from home and buy your groceries on Amazon.

I'm a Bernie Bro, but Bret shakes my faith in the workability of Democratic governance, as intended, when he lists their glaring failures in California: a housing crisis, a homelessness crisis, an affordability crisis, an addiction crisis, a pension crisis, a schooling crisis, a power-outage crisis, a wildfires crisis, a water-shortage crisis. That is daunting, eye-opening even, when you stare at just those ugly existential problems.

Of course, Republicans' solutions would be to shrink government, to do even less, let capitalism solve any and all solvable problems, and let the devil take the hindmost: ""It's not government's job to provide everything that's needed to all the people, all the time."" Sink or swim is their overriding mentality. (Just feel that freedom as your family goes to bed hungry every night, if they have a bed to go.)

For those in other areas in the country where Delta hasn’t hit yet - just wait, you will be glad your state took the restrictions it did. Delta is taking down younger and healthier people.

As to adults:
1905 (Jacobson v. State of Massechusetts) - The Supreme Court ruled that Americans ""[M]ay be compelled, by force if needed, against his will and without regard, to his personal wishes or his pecuniary interests, or even his religious convictions, ..."" 

Further - ""It is not, therefore, true that the power of the public to guard itself against imminent danger depends in every case involving the control of one's body upon his willingness to submit to reasonable regulations established by the constituted authorities, under the sanction of the State, for the purpose of protecting the public collectively against such danger.”

Implication?  The exercise of an individual's right is not supported when that action harms or even kills another.  Example:  The 2nd Amendment is not unlimited, nor is its exercise free from accountability and responsibility.

As to children:
In 2002, (applying the 1922 Zucht v. King Supreme Court ruling) ""a federal district court declined to find an exemption to mandatory vaccinations laws for 'sincerely held religious beliefs' or a fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning medical procedures of their children."""

2021-09-13 12:08:22,"The origin of Federal Government mandating vaccines goes back to President George Washington.

2021-09-13 13:18:19,"I know it's a pose, but I like it when Stephens plays ""dumb.""  It doesn't really fit him.  He knows full well that there is little in the Western tradition that allows full, anarchic freedoms, without a consideration of harm to others or infringements or constraints on their freedom to make choices.  So, I don't vaccinate.  I may catch Covid.  I may spread to others.  I may show severe symptoms.  I may go to hospital.  I may take up scarce hospital beds.  Others may get sick and die. Let freedom ring.  No.  It's not civil libertarianism, Stephens.  Of course, these ""freedoms"" are solidly embedded in our economic thinking. We warn against them!  There are shirkers, free riders, defectors, all of whom engage in actions designed to enhance their welfare (or utility) while passing the costs to others.  There's a lot of that in 21st C. America.  And the point of the economic theory and the regulation that follows is how do you handle these whack jobs because they add grotesque inefficiencies and harm to our public lives.  I hate to break the news to Stephens, but if a manufacturer pollutes and kills people we sanction them by directing them to pay damages and agree not to pollute.  So, we won't compel someone to get the vaccine?  One more point.  Mr. Stephens is not up on an extensive literature in evolutionary biology.  Human groupings engage in ""altruistic punishment."" The group protects itself.  It is an adaptive evolutionary response to ensure survival."

OK, Bret.  FDR and Pearl Harbor: failed presidency?  W. and 9/11: failed presidency?  Reagan and Lebanon bombing: failed presidency?  Clinton and African embassy bombing: failed presidency?   12 service men killed by a terrorist attack: failed presidency, Biden?  Come on, that's silly.

As far as the vaccination plans are going, we were doing great as a country and then the (mostly) red states decided they weren't going to get vaccinated.  Biden's fault?  

And if it is his doing (or undoing), is it at least possible that disgusted Trump voters saw their lack of vaccination as a political choice to either stymie Biden's success or cling to the idea that the election was stolen from ""their guy""?"

There is a rising, changing tide, and things like child care and universal health care are going to happen. It's why the Republicans are so distraught.  
Right about Newsom's stupidity in having dinner unmasked at the French Laundry, but many of the problems on his watch are hardly his fault, such as wild fires and the homelessness crisis, which was caused by Prop 13, a similar populist proposition. There's sluggish turnover in homes in California because a newly purchased home is taxed at today's tax rate. New homeowners are paying inflated rates to support the needs of the older homeowners whose rate has remained steady for decades. When my grandson went for a sleepover in Hillsborough, one of the wealthier SF suburbs, he and his friend slept in the dining room. His friend decides each night where he's going to sleep, he doesn't have a bedroom. There are  three generations, including cousins, living in a single home, and they adapt.

2021-09-13 14:22:01,"It is within the right of government to protect its people from a virulent and potentially lethal spreading disease. It is perfectly reasonable to require those who choose to be present in public spaces show proof of vaccination.  No one is legally required to be vaccinated nor to get a drivers license, but failure to do so limits their public mobility under the law. It is still fundamentally a matter of individual choice:  public access when vaccinated, or quarantine upon rejection of the vaccine.

Furthermore, it must be pointed out to the public-at-large that the anti-vaxxer movement is in large measure a series of business enterprises driven by about 12 major operators. These operators are in the business of selling fake anti-COVID remedies. A recent study analyzed 812,000 posts extracted from Facebook and Twitter. Researchers found that 65 per cent of all posts could be traced back to 12 accounts representing major anti-vaccine personalities including Joseph Mercola, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Ty and Charlene Bollinger, among others, most of whom have a significant financial interest in the anit-vaccine effort.. 

Countless people have died and will die because they believe the profit-making lies being spread to every nook and cranny of this nation via social media.

WRONG! This isn't some cute affectation. This is virtue signaling and it's NOT a victimless act. It actively dissuades resistant people from getting vaxxed. Why get the shot if nothing changes? And post vax mask wearing is NOT based on science at all! Joe Biden: “Only 1 out of every 160,000 fully vaccinated Americans was hospitalized for COVID per day"". He further said that we are in an “epidemic of the unvaccinated”. Indeed, that is what all the data show. 99% of the hospitalizations and more than 99% of the deaths from the Delta variant are among the unvaccinated. If you have a reasonably healthy immune system and are vaccinated the pandemic is over. Moreover, unvaccinated kids in any given area represent a consistent low percentage of total Covid cases in that area. This has held steady since January and includes the Delta wave. Thus, there are very few young kids in high vaccination areas, like New York or Massachusetts, who are seriously ill or die. Vaccinated people 12 and up with healthy immune systems, and kids under 12 with healthy immune systems who live in high vaccination areas, must be allowed to resume a normal, mask free life."

The condescension in this comment is appalling: we're having 1600 deaths per day. Even if 90% of these deaths are unvaccinated, it's important to focus moral blame on those who are most responsible for this public health disaster: All those who confused and mislead the public into hesitation or resistance to the vaccine: All those who downplayed the danger from the virus, who politicized public health measures to slow the virus--often in service to a disastrous herd-immunity strategy--or who downplayed the vaccines or spread disinformation about the vaccines. (This disinformation included outlandish paranoia about microchips, but also more dangerous disinformation: that 'natural immunity' is better, that the vaccines are risky, that only the most vulnerable need the vaccines. Or simply the political message that the campaign to get everyone vaccinated is government overreach. Or simply that the government and public health authorities are lying or wrong about covid and the vaccines.)"

Consider it body infrastructure. 

One of the things many on the Right talk about whenever medical care in Canada is mentioned is that they have to wait in lines, whereas Americans get the care we need soon. Well, Bret, right now a lot of people who did the right thing, got vaccinated, keep a mask on in public places, are waiting in line that keeps getting jumped by the nincompoops. 

I practiced in a non-Covid era. Those who work in hospitals are exhausted, and even before this were often asked to work ungodly hours and shifts. Their service is remarkable. But they are burning out and will leave, not only because of Covid, but because we have a way to prevent Covid now and millions refuse to take the vaccine or even cover their face, while those outside medical campuses are partying away, many without a care. 

Reminds me sort of like our troops, Bret.  I was only a Navy shipboard doc, never in harm's way, but I was with those used to long family separations, long hours, putting their lives on the line and expected to do miracles, while people back home went about their business."

Those who refuse to be vaccinated are not merely harming themselves, they harm those around them.

And has she not taken up an ICU bed, thereby denying it to a stroke victim who has to be driven from hospital to hospital seeking care… and dies? These are real and not rare events. I am sure you know this. If so, why do you give good breath to these arguments? 
And if I politely ask, say, a maskless waiter or nurse if they are vaccinated, I am not being a “busybody?”"

Even in states with reasonably good vaccination rates, the medical system still isn’t back in working order. There’s still a backlog of non-urgent surgeries and procedures.

In the face of challenges like the pandemic, an economy millions of Americans have realized doesn’t work for them as much as for the 1%, and most of all the global threat of man-made climate change, to argue for moderation instead of transformation is to deny reality.

Especially so in the face of a Republican Party that has become radicalized into an authoritarian cult, brainwashing its followers into antivaxx fanaticism via Fox News.

Centrist moderation is not mealy compromise - socially liberal/fiscally conservative is the most consistent policy umbrella there is. It derives from Hobbes, Locke, and the Enlightenment and it can , by definition, unite. It is the former mantra of Wm Clinton, Al From, and Al Gore. It would allow us to focus on the pandemic and infrastructure without redefining, in a decidedly illiberal way, our economic system or the essentially restrained role of government.

A  responsible ""civil libertarian"" does not live in a vacuum; s/he lives among others with whom s/he interacts daily.

And interesting position from Bret Stephens: the 'libertarian' in him hesitates at mandating a public health measure, but is fine with withholding Medicare or Medicaid from the unvaccinated who get sick.

The unvaccinated with the resources to pay for care, the 'nincompoops of means,' are just fine taking up the beds and sucking up medical resources, denying others surgery and treatment that is often life-saving. Because the nincompoops can pay for it.

Just withhold the Medicaid. That'll teach the undeserving!

Rationing of medical care will be a fact because of scarcity of resources, especially as medical staff burns out, quits, and moves to other, less draining forms of service. That's a reality.

In addition, breakthrough cases are becoming more common and it is chilling economic activity even among the vaccinated. I no longer eat indoors, attend concerts, stay in hotels as frequently, etc. because of the risk of the unvaccinated who may be there. You may say I'm the crazy one for making such a choice when vaccinated, but even if I'm not worried so much about myself (I am youngish and pretty healthy) I wouldn't feel comfortable visiting elderly relatives, or my under 12 yr old nieces and nephews, if I may have been exposed.

First, children: Those under 12 years of age is unable to receive an approved COVID vaccination and at risk of contracting it. The risk increases exponentially if COVID is truly allowed to run rampant. I've got a three year old and am worried what would happen to him should he become infected. Not to mention that it could easily spread to his classmates, school staff, and (potentially immunocompromised) family members.

Secondly, hospital capacity: Once hospital bed space or ICU capacity becomes monopolized by COVID cases, other procedures, surgeries and health care services get delayed. Not to mention nursing or other health care worker burnout."

And Scripture tells us that when Satan took Jesus to the highest point of the temple and challenged Him to throw Himself off because God would send the angels to save him, Jesus responded, ""Do not put the Lord your God to the test."" (Matthew 4:7) Fellow Christians, please stop testing God and do the right thing."

2021-09-13 14:45:55,"Removing Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement for unvaccinated COVID patients is not an “elegant riposte.” 

Because we do not yet lack all humanism in this country, hospitals would still be required to treat these patients and they would still fill ICU beds. Some would still recover and require long periods of rehabilitative care. All Mr. Stephen’s solution would do is prevent hospitals and rehabs from being reimbursed for this care, and saddle them with crippling medical debt that would leave them dependent on more state services. Not to mention that the impact of this policy would of course be felt almost exclusively by poor (in wealth) vaccine-deniers. 

The obsession with bodily autonomy is so out of step with countless other laws and obligations that to hold this position not realize you have been corrupted by conspiracy and propaganda is incredibly naive, and should preclude you from considering yourself a rational intellectual, libertarian or not, as I’m sure Mr. Stephens would like to do."

2021-09-13 15:05:22,"Brett, the problem with people not getting vaccinated is twofold
1 - The delta variant is so virulent that unvaccinated people can pass it along to someone else more easily than a vaccinated person.  To be fair vaccinated people can pass it along too, and some even grasp at that straw to defend not getting vaccinated.  But the virus finds a much more hospitable host in an unvaccinated person, and can thrive much more easily in an unvaccinated nasal passage
2 - every time there is a successful transmission, the odds of a new mutation that can avoid the vaccine’s defenses gets higher.  The more unvaccinated people there are the more successful transmissions there are.  The more successful transmissions the higher the probability of a new variant that sends our vaccination program back to square zero.

It isn’t about personal choice, and like Gail, I want a president who is more than a cheerleader for vaccines.

It’s about the collective good that most “conservative” nincompoops, to use your word, just do not seem to get, or care about.  Plus the strain on the hospital system is incredible.

Broken government emboldens their party and depresses democrat leaning voters-- especially young ones -- and that helps the GOP.

What does the GOP do right away when they are in control? Assuage their supporters with tax cuts and judge ships. The Democrats need to do the same, but they can't coalesce around the vision of HELPING People because there are Senators and House members who fear the SOCIALIST label.

In fact, many of the jobs where increases will occur are related to dining out and taking care of the elderly.

Mr Stephens should know these things - we need green jobs to mitigate greenhouse gases, and the working class in this country deserve to be compensated for all the shortcomings brought on by excessive greed. Without Biden’s plan, the climate will get much worse, and much of the remaining opportunities for good jobs will go only to the children of the wealthy. Not a formula for success."
2021-09-13 15:38:18,"Sending a bunch of uninsured people to ERs already under enormous stress is not a helpful alternative to a vaccine mandate.  Hospitals will treat them. They will pay a reduced fee.  And maybe not pay if they already have bad credit.  We'll all pay for it in higher medical costs downstream, and even more over-worked front line responders and Drs. 

Also, a large reservoir of unvaccinated people is a society wide problem.  Viruses mutate - like Delta.  Next one could be worse.  The more people vaccinated now the less likely that happens.

Sorry to say it, but classic libertarian answers to complex social health problems are typically uninformed and/or naive"
2021-09-13 15:40:13,"I'll never understand why ""sophisticated libertarian"" anti-vaxxers like Bret don't understand that their failure to vaccinate themselves endangers lots of other people - like my asthmatic 4 year old grandson and my 89 year old great uncle who, although vaccinated, would almost surely succumb to a breakthrough infection.  Also, continuing to spread the disease as the non-vaccinated do,  just gives this virus more opportunity to replicate into a strain that overcomes the protection of current vaccines.  I suspect they do understand that, they just don't care.  So much of Bret's faux freedom mindset is simply, "" I could not care less about anyone other than me"" dressed up with nice words."

I’m a healthy 51 year-old with 1) a parent with rapidly advancing blood cancer, 2) a brother who teaches a class of unvaccinated third graders and 3) a best friend whose parent was diagnosed with a terminal/untreatable brain tumor two months ago.

2021-09-13 15:41:06,"Two problems with what Bret Stephens said. First, withdrawing health insurance from people who have refused the vaccine and end up hospitalized with COVID-19 is a sure bet hospitals  and some physicians will go bankrupt. The costs would be so high that most would not be able to afford them, and won’t pay for their care. You can’t get water from a stone, as they say. Second, stopping elective surgery because of the overwhelming demand to treat COVID patients is no trivial matter. Just because someone needs elective surgery does not mean they are not suffering. How would you like to wait indefinitely to have a joint replacement so you walk again, or cataract surgery so you could see again. Many surgeons’ practices specialize on doing elective surgery. Having to stop those surgeries would be economically catastrophic to them."
2021-09-13 15:42:44,"I am with Bret on this one. He captures the balance I feel between civil liberties and trying to get people to do the right thing.

As to Gail and getting rid of masks - my read on Delta is that the vaccine is necessary but not sufficient, so even though I am vaccinated I still wear a mask and will continue to do so for the near future. It is worth remembering that one out of ten vaccinated people are still capable of catching the bug and unknowingly spreading it due to lack of symptoms."

Had the bill been passed by the House this summer, Biden would have had a signature win just as he was confronting the Covid surge and the Taliban coup. If the House flops next year and Biden is a one-term President, much of the blame will be with Nancy Pelosi, who could have granted Biden a much-needed win. The wound to Biden is a deep one that has many wondering who is truly in charge. What is clear is that Pelosi is more fixed on maintaining her power than on supporting her President.

He sees nothing wrong with more preventable deaths occurring every two days than the total on 9-11.

He repeats the blatant partisan lies that the unvaccinated are basically only putting themselves at risk, that the immunocompromised of all ages just have an emotional need to protect themselves from dangerous oppositional defiant toddlers who won’t get vaccinated, and that mask wearing to protect oneself and others is merely virtue signaling.

He pretends to wish for a successful Biden administration, even as he ankle-bites and undercuts everything Biden says or does. Hint:  there are medications to help with that kind of wild mood swing.

He repeats the counterfactual, Party-approved, attack line that it is Biden, not Republicans’  pathological response to him, that is divisive.

It lingers for close to 2 weeks, and you do lose the sense of taste and smell and the malaise is unrelenting. Thats being vaccinated! I would hate to see how we would have felt if we were not vaccinated. Until it hits you, it's everyone else's issue. I've heard this argument over and over again from very smart people; If I get it, it won't be that bad as I'm vaccinated. Baloney. It is that bad, and my heart goes out to the families of those who lost loved ones to this, and the very sick who took a lot longer than 2 weeks to recover. At least we have a commander-in-chief who actually cares about people. He's trying his best to educate those who refuse to acknowledge the intensity of this little virus that does so much damage.

Doctors and nurses are breaking under the “lot of strain”. They did not sign up for daily work in a war zone that was self created through stupidity. And repeated every few months because state government, for political talking points, refuses to protect the health of their own constituents.
Mainly elective surgeries? Like the man who died making the 6pm national news because he had to search seven hospitals in three states before he found one able to accommodate his heart failure condition? Probably not the minimal number you suggest. He was just “lucky enough” to make the news. How many more don’t make the news?
The latest Covid spike is not the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago? Until the next variant is 90% vaccine resistant. Then the little pool of self centered science deniers can be the petri dish that voids all of the hard work getting to a vaccine that is safe & effective, and directly cause thousands more deaths. Based on the pleas from the Biden administration and directly from Joe himself, he will have every right to say, “I told you so.” But that’s not Joe Biden.

Or perhaps they should just stay be forced to stay at home or live in fear when they go out. I actually no longer have a problem with insurers, employers, hospitals not covering anti-vaxxers. Washington State can, as far as I'm concerned now (I would never have thought this before all this idiocy), say to Idaho'ans ""You chose not to take the vaccine? Then you chose to rely on your state's medical systems. You don't get to tax our own system and keep others out of our emergency rooms."" The utter hypocrisy of Republicans is astonishing except that it's becoming more and more their rule. Children have to have certain vaccinations to be allowed in school, but don't require COVID vaccines despite the clear proof now that they work. Stores can state ""No shirts, no shoes - no service"" but not keep out people without masks?!

All this virtual signaling about doing this for the community is nonsense. A person gets vaccinated for themselves. Those who choose not to know the risks. 
The authors of this opinion piece sound like an SNL skit trying to figure out new ways to punish people who have not vaccinated. Setting limits on their health insurance is absolutely stupid and if they are paying for it probably illegal. What about no insurance for illnesses due to smoking, obesity, drugs? In public health we have struggled to get attention to those behaviors because they contribute far more heavily to the top causes of death and healthcare costs than COVID.

The virus is using these people to keep evolving into more potent and deadly variants. If we keep on the current track, the virus will evolve into a variant that will make the current vaccine useless. Second, to call the end of the current war Biden’s Afghan debacle is as premature as calling his presidency failed. Not only did he manage to evacuate more people in the shortest amount of time ever accomplished by anyone, he is still evacuating people after the Trump/Taliban deadline. That is a miracle, not a debacle. Third, the current Republic Party has shown itself to be a danger to our life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.

Sorry Brett Medicare and Medicaid cannot should not do this. Private insurance, yes they can and should. M&M are social programs and everyone receiving the benefit must be treated the same. Would you suggest that the VA also decline treatment? 

Also, let's not judge Biden after 9 months. He was left with a mess on multiple fronts. 3 little words ""de-fund the police"" cost Dems big time in the last election and could give the majority back to both houses.

In our circumstance we are in a limited space environment and this individual spread the virus to around 25 people, all of whom were vaccinated. Even with the vaccination several of them have become very ill.  

It is our responsibility to our society to help to keep each other safe. Getting the vaccine is just not a huge ask considering the risk others face from those who carry very high viral loads.

2021-09-13 15:53:04,"The siren call of small government seems to cause many R’s to become disoriented and toss out foolish ideas that don’t correspond to the reality on the ground.

Covid safety measures are not a freedom issue, but are public health issues. By their nature, public health issues are anti-democratic because they constrain individuals from complete free-choice. If this were a smallpox epidemic engulfing the populace and people were dying in the streets like used to happen in the bad-old-days, I suspect that the anti-vax rhetoric would magically tone itself down into near non-existence except for those who are eagerly awaiting the rapture.

Instead lots of people are fooling themselves into believing that Covid is not a serious problem and that it is an easily survivable illness. While it is less serious than some contagions, it is plenty dangerous, and it is reasonable for society (i.e. government) to take measures to control it. This involves constraining normal levels of free choice. The truth is that Covid is serious enough that public health measures are warranted and that some moderate limits on absolute liberty are justified.

After all, we still feel obligated to limit our freedom by stopping at red lights, don’t we?"
2021-09-13 15:53:43,"I have thought the same thing, that Medicare, Medicaid, and perhaps even private insurers should not pay for hospital stays for those who could have been vaccinated but chose not to. This should be no problem for those in the ""party of personal responsibility"". If you knowingly assume the risk, yet can externalize much of the costs of a bad outcome, it's easier to assume the risk. Risk certain bankruptcy and it might help vaccine-decliners make the right decision for themselves. The rest of us would benefit from their wise decision as well. That's one that really should be made so."
2021-09-13 15:54:15,"How can a presidency be weak because a president tries to do something important and probably necessary?  That's not logical.  If ""the loyal opposition"" is way off center, then the president remains in the center without moving towards them.  He hasn't moved; he just sees that the means must change. 
 As to vaccine mandates, they'll surely work better than burdening the system with refusal to pay for caring for the unvaccinated.  If not for past mandates, we'd still have polio, smallpox . . . .  The unvaccinated do threaten all of us.  They endanger our children, drag down our economy, hurt our health via variants and overwhelmed hospitals, and keep many older people from getting back to living while they are still alive.

It is not a progressive wish list. It is precision spending for what the country needs to function at this time of demographic change, with Baby Boomers getting older and neglected parts of America, rural and urban, structurally locked out of the labor market.

For instance, the bill puts forth ideas like ACA subsidies, not a refashioning of health care. Similarly, the budget nips and tucks around areas where the health care system has inefficiencies, such as in Black maternal health, our lack of support for caregivers for the elderly and disabled, our lack of investment in community and home care and culturally competent health care. It provides for paid leave for medical crises.

Also the bill should appeal to conservatives, as it effectively offers ""housing choice"" by allowing people from poor areas to move to more economically dynamic areas. It strengthens Community Development Block Grants, allowing local areas to choose how to invest in themselves. It advances access to business loans for minority entrepreneurs and expands broadband access in rural areas. It funds workforce development and job training, which will address the skills gap. It champions education for preschoolers and middle-skilled community college students.

It also invests in new technology to repair the climate. What's not to like?"

The continued spread of the virus, even if it was just limited to the “nincompoops”, also poses the very serious risk of further mutation of the virus to one that is impervious to existing vaccines, putting us all at risk once again. This isn’t fiction, it’s real life, and real people are being seriously affected and killed by the “nincompoops”.

One further thing, Mr. Stephens; this isn’t a vaccine mandate. It’s a testing mandate. Get tested just once a week, OR, get vaccinated.

The biggest problem, though, is that the NYT and other big media who made tons of money off the Trump reign of terror feel the need to publish outrageous headlines like Bret's prior column.

First, isn't the point of Obamacare that every citizen is guaranteed healthcare coverage so that nobody ever again will lose their house and life savings because of illness?

I wasn't vaccinated for measles due to being born prior to the vaccine's creation in '63.  If I contract measles now, should insurance refuse to cover my medical expenses?  I can certainly go be vaccinated with the MMR, now mandatory for most all children and CDC recommended for adults.

Second, I have for all of my adult life - and I'm 65 - paid for top shelf health insurance.  In fact I've paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for those policies.  

I have never spent a single night in the hospital, been to an ER only twice (both times for laboratory related accidents). I use chiropractic and acupuncture which is not covered by even my expensive health insurance and I haven't taken a prescription drug in decades.  I have all my own teeth with no fillings or dental work.

I am an insurance company's dream.  My premiums subsidize other less healthy individuals.  That's how insurance works and I have NEVER complained about helping to fund cancer treatments for smokers, liver transplants for alcoholics or heart disease treatments for the obese.  All of those things are the result, with few exceptions, of poor lifestyle choices yet receive treatment without prejudice, paid by insurance."

They are also risking the lives of those who can't get vaccinated, not to mention children under 12. It isn't really that hard a concept to grasp: we get vaccinated partially for ourselves, but primarily for the strength of the herd. It is the same with masks. I continue to wear one not as virtue signaling, but.because in case I have covid and don't know it, I don't want to give it to anyone that isn't vaccinated (yes, even those who are too stupid to protect themselves deserve our protection). Lastly, please drop this ridiculous idea that we just have to make them ""pay the bill"" if they refuse the vaccine. This isn't how medical care works: Whether you like it or not we are all going to be paying the bill for these idiots through higher costs and premiums.

The only other recourse for the anti-vaxxers is to be clear that Covid is a Liberal/Socialist virus but the others diseases that vaccinations are required for are non-political. Perhaps someone with a strong enough microscope can detect an image of a donkey or hammer and sickle in a coronavirus. Sort of like the Face on Mars which proves .... something."

This mega lot of knuckleheads always seem to want to have things both ways - they scoff at the notion of an F.D.A. fully approved vaccination although many of them went off the rails and decided to believe that ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug treated in horses and cloroquine and hydroxycloroquine (an aquarium additive) were viable and acceptable treatments for Covid-19 but when they become so ill from this virus, they get hospitalized, continuing to put others, people risking their own lives to treat them, in harm's way.

One of the major financial fall outs of this utterly asinine and selfish thinking is that ALL of our insurance rates/premiums WILL increase down the road, if they have not already.  Insurance companies are NOT like the Red Cross, they operate to make a profit, they are not a non-profit organization.

""Otherwise, I don’t see the latest Covid spike as the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago. It’s gone from being a public-health crisis to a nincompoop-health crisis.""

The implication is that the current surge is not as big of a deal because the people getting sick kinda deserve it. But those patients (deserving or not) have overwhelmed an extremely fatigued health care system so that ERs are backed up, ICUs (and PICUs) are full, and some places like FL had ration water to make sure there was enough oxygen to keep the patients in their overflowing hospitals alive. 

Anecdotally at least, there has been quite a large amount of attrition amongst the hospital workers taking care of these sick people, meaning this ""nincompoop-health crisis"" will have some long lasting effects on our health care system."

As someone who HAD joint replacement surgery I can tell you that the pain is severe and destructive. No I would not have DIED without the surgery, but the longer I waited to do it the more damage to my joint and thus the more potentially complicated the surgery. Plus I was in terrible pain. 

The term “elective” does not mean “unnecessary”."

Stephens acknowledges that our ICUs are strained to the breaking point, as are the doctors and nurses who work in them, but he shrugs it off  like it's no big deal. He reminds me of Gen. Buck Turgidson in ""Dr. Strangelove"", who shrugs off the prospect of all-out nuclear war with the Soviet Union,  saying, ""I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed....""

He continues by blaming Gavin Newsom for the effects of global warming (""a power-outage crisis, a wildfires crisis, a water-shortage crisis""), brought to us by conservatives/Republicans who have spent decades denying it exists, then claiming ""We'll adapt!"" to a global disaster, then saying ""It's too late to do anything!""

He may despise Donald Trump, but he's a textbook reminder that ""old school"" conservatives are not our friends, unless we're rich and powerful."

Otherwise, I don’t see the latest Covid spike as the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago. It’s gone from being a public-health crisis to a nincompoop-health crisis.""

People have died due to lack of access to a hospital bed. Unvaccinated people were tying up all the beds. To hand-wave it away by saying the surgeries being put off are ""mainly elective"" is absurd. Also, he doesn't seem to understand that the more cases of COVID there are, the more opportunities there are for it to mutate.

Is it necessary that conservatives pander to the selfish anti-vaccine element in the Republican party? It seems so, based on Mr. Stephens' statements here."

Extrapolating from this, we can expect, as vaccinations rise, a new variant that is still more infectious and deadly to the unvaccinated.  Unless of course, those resisters stop resisting and both get the vaccine and start taking sensible precautions.

Which, from the viewpoint of a vaccinated person who believes in following the rules, means we have a self solving problem: either full vaccination of the population or the rapid demise of the remaining resisters.

How about California's many problems given their Democratic grip on government?  No mention of Texas' many problems or Florida's (under Republican ""leadership"").  

How about inflation?  Guess what?  Maybe a little inflation is good for the economy.  Pushes wages higher, especially when people who've been working for slave wages and uncertain hours suddenly refuse to to work that way any longer.  Or older folks suddenly are able to earn a bit more than .8% interest on their hard-fought for savings.  

Biden not moderate enough?  Progressives would argue vehemently against that assertion.

I don’t see the latest Covid spike as the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago. It’s gone from being a public-health crisis to a nincompoop-health crisis.""  The premise that the personal choice to refuse a vaccine has no consequences for others is false.  Breakthrough infections do occur at apparently somewhere around 10 to 20% of those infected.  Given that anti-vaccers frequently also refuse to mask in indoor public spaces, many of these breakthrough cases can undoubtedly be traced to them.  He downplays the strain on the overall medical system, ignoring today's story of an Alabama resident who suffered a heart attack, was turned away from numerous hospitals without space in their ICU's, transferred to a hospital over 200 miles away, and subsequently died.  Mr Stephen's himself suggests that Medicare/Medicaid should refuse to pay for treatment for the willingly unvaccinated, clearly recognizing their choice results in a significant societal cost.  He also assumes that the current peak, which may be declining, makes the public health situation less critical, ignoring that similar beliefs were expressed after the initial peaks.  There is no guarantee this is the end of mutations and outbreaks.  So, the willing choice not to vaccinate affects us all."
2021-09-13 16:33:47,"As America marks the 20 year anniversary of 9/11, I had one thought. On 9/11 over 3,000 United States citizens were killed. This caused all citizens of the U.S. to unite and work towards a common threat. We even started a war that lasted 20 years in hopes of eradicating the threat, safety and security of our country. 

Yet last year when 3,000 U.S. citizens a day were dying from an invading, microscopic virus, we couldn’t get people on the same page concerning how to fight and protect one another. 

Then, a miracle seemed to occur. A vaccine weapon that could completely and unequivocally wipe out this viral enemy, restoring the United States to a land where fear and anxiety no longer dominated.

Yet, that was not to happen. The Republican party decided not to unite behind a message of medical knowledge and vaccine efficacy. Instead they chose to work directly against the best interests of the health and wellbeing of the country. 

I look at the Republicans as those that would aid and abet a terrorist threat. Not in an invading foreign army but in the form of an invading foreign virus. They are a continued threat to the health, safety, and economy of the United States. They, and their followers, should be treated like the public health terrorists they are."

The failures in public discourse, in state and local governance, and in the grinding to a halt at the federal level, all come down to this, the GOP is no longer a participant in our two cylinder form of government.
We can only resume the 'experiment' if we replace that rotted fragment.  It has been done before, as the very history of the gop proves.

Oh, Brett, how understated. You are missing a big point- doctors, and more importantly nurses, are way beyond strained. Add all the Hospital staff - cleaners, lab techs, and all manner of support staff. They are burned out, disheartened and retiring in droves. They are seeing so many younger, previously healthy patients facing a preventable potentially lethal disease. The “let the nincompoops pay their own price” mentality ignores the price paid by others, especially our beleaguered front line health care workers. 

A friend who is an ER nurse at a nearby major medical center said they start most shifts with 15 fewer nurses than their staffing model calls for. Imagine and empathize with them. Sadly, I do not believe you can."

A mandate to require vaccinations by private businesses, say, airlines, or governments is still the law of the land:

The Supreme Court in 1905 ruled on the right of the state of Massachusetts to mandate and require smallpox vaccinations during an epidemic there.

The Court held that ""in every well ordered society charged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand"" and that ""real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own [liberty], whether in respect of his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be done to others.""

Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. The Court's decision articulated the view that individual liberty is not absolute and is subject to the police power of the state.

And,when (not if) a child becomes ill from COVID (because parents are confronted daily with the terror of their child becoming ill from this entirely preventable life threatening illness),will those same selfish, detestable miscreants be held accountable for causing needless suffering and death? 
Rejecting a vaccine is not a reflection of civil libertarian beliefs. Not when it impedes the rights of others. It's one thing to reject a vaccine for polio (which would be stupid but most likely only affect the refuser), refusing the covid vaccine is homicidal, depraved indifference, and ought to be prosecuted as such."

Surely he knows that in this context ""elective"" can mean addressing a painful and life-affecting but not fatal orthopedic issue, to pick just one example.

Being unable to pick something up off the floor without major pain is not a problem for you.  Nor is the fact that I can't walk or stand for any length of time.  These are of course, sacrifices that I'm required to make because ""freedom loving"" conservatives have decided to ignore science and avoid a safe, proven vaccination shot.  And you're apparently concerned Biden is going to hurt their feelings by calling them out.  They don't have to get the shot under his new mandate, they can get tested every week.  So who's the ""snowflake"" now?

And speaking of the ""behemoth"" infrastructure proposal your blinders are showing.  First, let's look at its ""net cost"" rather than toss around $3.5T.  Second, even it were totally unfunded that would be on average $350B/ year over 10 years. US GDP > $20T/year.  So tell me the problem with this size of the program again.  And you mention all the ""California crisis"" but neglect the fact that every Western US state (and many in the East) is facing the same set of problems save the Kardashians (thankfully).  Guess we should just ignore those because..."
2021-09-13 16:47:24,“It’s too early to say that the Biden presidency has failed. But people who wish the president success — and that includes me — need to grasp the extent to which he’s in deep political trouble.”  So we all agree your last article was click bait. Great. Keep it up. And here’s to Gail for keeping you honest.
2021-09-13 16:48:42,"Brett. You have a terrible habit of giving messages, most of them contradictory. I’m not clear on what you mean by a ""weak president"". For me a strong president is an experienced person who is not afraid of his popularity by making executive decisions when the safety and good of the people demand it and staying in the background at other times yet keep thinks running. These are the qualities of an effective CEO. People not wanting the government telling them what to do regarding their health or other matters which put the nation’s health and safety at risk are just being selfish and power hungry. There are many laws on the books which very few disagree with because they have been around for so long that even though the government is telling them what to do for their health, safety, and the safety of others. These include drunken driving restrictions, seatbelt mandates, children’s mandatory education and so on. Just because Republicans use government mandate opposition to safety measures for political purpose is a clear indication that the government in power is doing the right thing particularly when they have nothing constructive to replace them with for example Trump advocating using household disinfectants to cure Covid. It might serve you well to find someone to help you straighten out your thinking process"

I have 5 grandchildren too  young to be vaccinated. Your libertarians are doing their best to kill or maim them (long-covid). 

Normally, when armed stalkers wander around looking for a chance to kill or maim young children, we take away their weapons or lock them up or both. We do not glorify their opportunity to seek out and kill or maim children. 

Especially if the armed stalkers can be disarmed with a couple of injections that have no other effect on the stalkers except to limit their stalking behavior (and improve their health)."

Ridiculous. We need a better system. These Republican Recalls will continue until the system is fixed so that the Lt. Governor assumes office is the Governor is removed for any reason. Until then, the recall is  just a tool for people who can't win a legitimate election to try to steal power."
2021-09-13 16:55:55,"Stephen, Biden is a sane and decent man doing battle with the craziest and most craven GOP in modern times. Cut the guy some slack. And Gail, you're being way too nice this time to Stephen!! Hold his feet to the fire. Not literally,of course."
2021-09-13 16:56:01,"What you seem to be missing, Brett, is that anti vaxxers who get sick have not just endangered themselves but, by giving COVID more breeding ground are endangering all of us. Also consider the many people who are immunocompromised, for whom every one of the “nincompoops” is a threat."
2021-09-13 16:57:11,"Bret is wrong that the unvaxxed only present a risk to themselves. They place everyone at risk. First, the vaxxed can be infected too. While they are likely to have mild symptoms, recent research shows that they have viral loads in their nose and throat as high as unvaxxed infections for a week or longer, and can therefore infect unvaxxed kids and contacts. Second, as long as a significant proportion of the population is unvaxxed, the virus can find plenty of new hosts to infect and generate new mutations. As with Delta, some mutations will be highly contagious, and some may be able to overcome the antibodies induced by vaccine. Until 85-90% of people have antibodies from vaccine or infection, the virus will linger and we will go through repeated cycles like this past spring and summer. This why Biden's vaccine crackdown is justified, if late in the coming. We all want to move on with our lives, but we can't do that with much of the country refusing vaccine."
2021-09-13 10:33:25,"""Anyway, as anti-vaxxers are mostly putting themselves at serious risk of getting seriously ill, I don’t see the need for a presidential directive, including the renewed mask mandates, which only diminish the incentive to get vaccinated. No doubt I’m missing a few things ….""
------------

1.  The increased risk of another even more transmissible, more lethal variant the longer tens and tens of millions of Americans remain unvaccinated.

2.  The risk to individuals who are immunocomprised or otherwise less fully protected by the vaccine than most of us who are fully vaccinated.

3.  The impact on the overworked, over-stressed medical profession.

4.  The likely need to ratio access to care (e.g., ICU beds) impacting people whose need does not arise from COVID.

5.  The fact that there is a growing risk to children -- including those currently too young to be vaccinated; a risk that will likely increase further if another variant becomes dominant.

6.  The further erosion of confidence and belief in fact-based science.

7.  The further erosion of the notion of community -- replaced by a growing primacy of selfishness.

It is easy enough to add to the list but yes Bret, I think you are missing a few things."
2021-09-13 16:58:38,"Brett at least two people who had treatable health conditions that were not COVID have died because the hospitals were too full.  And those elective surgeries getting cancelled?  That’s cancer surgeries being delayed.  Elective doesn’t mean you really don’t need it (like a nose job), elective just means it can be scheduled beforehand.  Some of those surgeries are really, really necessary and delays could be disastrous."
2021-09-13 09:47:27,"Those who don't want the vaccines breathe the same air everyone else does, drink the same water, eat the same food, take the same pharmaceuticals and have most likely already had vaccinations before (e.g., for polio, measles, mumps and rubella).  All of these things are subject to government regulation.  And that's no problem for them - so apparently the government must be doing a great job.

But suddenly the idea of getting Covid vaccinations inspires concerns over vaccine safety and effectiveness along with questioning whether or not the government knows what it's doing in terms of properly assessing the true dangers of this pandemic.

That's simply irrational thinking.  And it's not confined to a small subset of people - we're talking about a third of the vaccine-eligible US population.

Biden is absolutely doing the right thing.  We need to get as many people vaccinated as possible.  Mandating vaccinations is the single best way to control the pandemic, save lives and get the economy back on track.

And we need to impose robust international travel restrictions until we can help get vaccines in ample quantities to the countries that are in desperate need of them.

If Biden wins on this issue, then Democrats have the best chance to retain control of Congress next year and the presidency in 2024.

Let's face it: we have no other viable option.  This is a serious pandemic.  A deadly serious one.

And we have no more time to lose."
2021-09-13 16:59:15,"Bret Stephens-Hardly a nincompoop crisis. Health care workers, particularly nursing staff, are leaving their jobs in significant numbers. Physicians are retiring early. The vaccinated and unvaccinated will feel the effects of this for years to come."
2021-09-13 17:01:57,"Covid is far from finished with us on any level.  The current variant is something like 1,000 times more contagious than the the original version of the virus.  Even though most new cases are among unvaccinated people, the people I know personally who have gotten the virus were fully vaccinated, and have gotten, and recovered from ""breakthrough"" infections.  This is because none of my friends are unvaccinated, and being retired I am not forced to come into contact with unvaccinated people.  I will continue worry about people who are flying again, even the fully vaccinated, until strict mandates are enforced.  I will not travel by air, eat inside any restaurant, attend any large gathering, etc. until such mandates exist.  Any thought that Covid is on the run, and things are somehow ""back to normal"" is crazy in my opinion."
2021-09-13 11:06:15,"The idea that insurance should refuse to pay for care for unvaccinated COVID patients, while tempting, is completely unworkable.  Few, if any, of those patients have a spare $200,000 lying around to pay the costs of a couple of weeks in the ICU.  All this would do is bankrupt hospitals, which are already under pressure from the cancellation of elective surgeries.  By the way, elective surgeries are not just nose jobs and tummy tucks-most are to relieve very painful and debilitating conditions.  Delaying them causes considerable suffering, and, in the case of some cancer or cardiac surgeries, can even cause death.

As for, ""forcing"" people to get vaccinated, OSHA ""forces"" all sorts of health and safety measures on employers and employees all the time-hard hats, safety glasses, vests and on and on.  Some are to protect the individual and some are to protect others.  Requiring vaccines will do both."
2021-09-13 17:04:03,"When Gail and Bret were discussing Dem electoral monopoly in California, I really thought the conversation would turn next to Texas, with its GOP electoral monopoly, and which monopoly is better for the health and welfare of the country and the planet.

2021-09-13 17:04:05,"ICUs in places like Fresno County here in California--not even one of the bad surge states!--are running at more than 90% capacity because of Covid.

Vaccination needs to be mandated universally (other than those with medical excuses of course) simply to save our medical system.  This is a basic infrastructure issue."
2021-09-13 17:05:15,"Bret is so blinded by his Republican roots, he has lost the ability to look at any political situation without placing his hand on the scales in the direction of the right.
Not only was the headline to his article audacious, his view on the major issues is skewed.  
The efforts Biden is focused on are clear winners with the majority of voters.  Withdrawing from Afghanistan had approvals in the sixty-plus percent range.  The infrastructure bills have seventy percent and fifty-eight percent approval respectively.  
The Republicans keep shouting about the $3.5 T price tag but fail to point out that this is spent over the next ten years.  No one is running out on a buying spree.  
The benefits of the big bill will provide most Americans with opportunities and the ability to advance their family's lives.  
The items in the bill are not socialist, but rather the benefits a country of our size and wealth should already provide. 
The 25%-30% of the Republican party that wants to risk their lives, rather than take a life-saving vaccine, are emblematic of the ignorance in the party.  Facts and science clearly show that anyone not taking the vaccine is adding substantial risk to their life and their family's lives. 
It is illogical, wreckless, and it adds risks to other people who have a right not to be exposed to the virus.  It seems these people believe that their rights are more expansive than anyone else's."

Why should a patient have to cede their lives to those selfish that they come first and the rest of us remain in pain while waiting for their recovery.  I am paying a premium for my health insurance and they delay my opportunity for a chance to better health , meanwhile my insurance premiums guarantee their care."

Bret! You still don't understand how masks work? The mask I wear protects me a LITTLE. It's intended to protect the people around me. Even though I'm vaccinated, I'm still capable of carrying and spreading the virus. I am wearing a mask to protect the immunocompromised people around me. Their masks won't protect them enough."
2021-09-13 17:08:26,"I'm puzzled by conservatives who rail against vaccine mandates. (First of all, many vaccines are already mandated! Example: school children must be vaccinated against measles, etc. prior to starting school). These same conservatives railing against vaccines usually also claim to LOVE the founding fathers. Okay. So, my question is: *how many of them are aware that George Washington - yes, THAT George Washington, REQUIRED his troops to be inoculated against smallpox?* That's right. So if it was okay for G. Washington, and he's the all-time best ever because he's a founding father, what's the problem with getting the Covid vaccine? The hypocrisy just astounds me."
2021-09-13 12:47:02,"I am tired of people misusing the term virtue-signal. Virtue signaling refers to an empty gesture that gives the illusion of positive action for personal benefit. Wearing a mask during a pandemic is not a virtue signal; it is a proven method of reducing contagion of a deadly virus. 

Conservatives call everything they find objectionable a virtue signal because they can't imagine why someone would do something for any reason other than pure selfishness."

We've enlisted community leaders religious leaders. We've had an army of healthcare workers go out into the filed and try and recruit the  hesitant with varying degrees of success. So, I reluctantly agree that Medicare should not cover the costs of hospitalization for those who chose to remain unvaccinated without a religious or medical exemption. 

For the others I'd offer cash. People like crisp hundred dollar bills. So, why not make a cash reward program that pays people to get the shots. Lines would be around the block."

And just last week, here in the great state of Minnesota, a friend of our had to spend the night in the ER because they didn't have any empty rooms. And others were 'stashed' where ever they could find room. These anti-vaxxers are causing us all to have problems. And not, it is not just a problem for themselves. It is a problem for all those who cannot get vaccinated, whether it be medical issues or age. The millions under age 12 have no option except for those of us who can get vaccinated actually do so.

A little social responsibility for those of who work or travel in public spaces."
2021-09-13 17:31:44,Small point here. Brett... But you dismiss elective surgery as unimportant. Elective surgery doesn't necessarily mean a face lift or a tummy tuck. It might mean a joint replacement which relieves awful pain or prevents permanent damage -- or other similar surgeries which may not be life or death situations but have a great deal to do with quality of life. People who get sick because they won't get vaccinated aren't making a choice for their life alone.  Their actions affect lots of other lives as well.

We as a country are ignoring the huge psychological damage we are causing the health care workers. They are helplessly dealing with ugly deaths daily that are easily avoided."
2021-09-13 17:36:09,"I find it really interesting that Biden apparently didn’t think those of us who worked at companies smaller than 100 workers evidently don’t deserve a safe workplace.

Everybody is always so sympathetic to our bosses we repeatedly get shortchanged on wages and benefits because they cut small business break after break.  If you want to give them a break, fine, but it shouldn’t come at the expense of their hardworking employees.  We suffer enough already."
2021-09-13 17:36:59,"The things Brett thinks are Biden’s “failures” are absurd. Withdrawal from Afghanistan was always going to be a debacle, regardless of who authorized it. Why do you think that Trump stalled the deadline until after the election? Because his advisors knew it was going to go poorly and they didn’t want Trump taking any more heat in 2020. He had already had a total failure with this administration’s response to COVID and they were worried that another one would utterly annihilate any chance of his reelection. As for inflation—that’s nobody’s fault except for the businesses that keep raising prices. Every business that raises prices kicks off a chain of price increases. Every commercial landlord that demands more rent kicks off the same cycle. Capitalists will always try to raise prices whenever they can, using whatever excuse they can find, because they are always chasing higher profits. The president cannot stop this — no one human being could, because no one person has control over any economy as a whole. Individuals and branches of the economy have only limited influence. The economy is a live beast that shifts in tandem with psychological factors and the emotions of the majority of humans who participate in it. And humans are notoriously irrational, especially when it comes to money. Inject oppositional politics into the economy, as Republicans are increasingly doing with their efforts to make Biden a failure, and it’s a recipe for even more chaos and less rationality."
2021-09-13 17:44:02,"I am appalled by the ignorance of what Columnist Stephens claims:  

""Anyway, as anti-vaxxers are mostly putting themselves at serious risk of getting seriously ill, I don’t see the need for a presidential directive, including the renewed mask mandates, which only diminish the incentive to get vaccinated.""

Apparently he doesn't regard children under 12 to be put at risk because of selfish American individualism."
2021-09-13 17:25:53,"It is a BIG problem for the headline of a NY Times column to have been written incorrectly. Bret Stephens writes in this opinion piece with Gail Collins today that ""In hindsight, the headline, “Another Failed Presidency at Hand,” probably took the argument a step farther than the column itself."" 

That HEADLINE leaves readers thinking that he feels Biden has failed. By his own admission today, he went to far with those words. 

Hey Bret.....words matter. I hope you have some idea of your influence and what you leave your readers believing/thinking....even if they did not read the rest of the column."
2021-09-13 17:28:32,I'm sharing my thoughts here - I choose not the read this column anymore. Always feels contrived.
2021-09-13 17:18:47,"The conversation between Bret Stephen and Gail Collins is refreshing...although it does not go into the reasoning of why anti-vaxxers, with brains that have been evolving for at least a million years, cannot accept the instant advantages of getting vaccinated not only to save themselves from expensive hospitalization, invasive and highly unpleasant ventilation with a pump, long-term disability, and possibly premature death, but also from becoming the vehicles for spreading the disease to their family and friends, and to fellow anti-vaxxers. Where is the benefit of refusal to be vaccinated? What is their logic? Presumably, a desire to endear themselves to Trump, the obnoxiously undemocratic American President in history. By blindly following him as their leader, with a passionate love of white supremacists, aren’t they showing a preference for someone similar to a twentieth-century fascist who triggered the second world war?

Bret, have you stretched your thinking to fathom the motivation of anti-vaxxers? Surely, it is not entirely related to a wish for extreme freedom of choice. The same people are unwilling to extend similar freedom of choice to women to be in charge of their own bodies."
2021-09-13 17:19:04,"One thing that conveniently gets omitted in the “presidential vaccination mandate” conversation is the fact that people are given a choice: if you do not vaxx, you test weekly. Seems reasonable."
2021-09-13 17:24:34,Is wearing a mask in public when you’re triple vaccinated “virtue-signaling” as Stephens would have it—or reminding others that there’s a pandemic?
2021-09-13 17:13:38,"no shorts, no shoes, no service.

Mr. Stephens, like most selfish Republicans, isn't concerned with doing what is right. He's just interested in messing with Democrats and maintaining the chaos Republicans told the nation they would promote during his Presidency. We are dealing with seriously demented people who put politics (and money) above peope's lives."

2021-09-13 17:30:58,"I guess Bret must have missed the article about the heart patient who had to ask for transfer to 43 hospitals before he found one out of state that could take him.  Or read that Idaho is now sending patients to Washington state because their hospitals are full.  On what planet is COVID on the wane?

I thought Republican were all about beefing up the economy.  Well, the way to accomplish that is to get the pandemic under control.  The administration has tried consideration and persuasion and it hasn't worked.  That ""we're all in this together"" post-9/11 feeling ain't there this time.  Time for some tough love!"

“I accept that people don’t want the government or their employer telling them what to do with their bodies. But these same people shouldn’t expect someone else to bail them out of their terrible health decisions.”

Question to anti-vaxxers: 
If you get sick from the Covid virus do you want to stay at home and tough if out on your own, or do you want the government and hospitals to help keep you alive? 

If it were me I would not want help from the same people I vilify and accuse of conspiracy."

2021-09-13 17:10:25,"Bret still seems to be taking the side of the anti-vaxxers by using terms like ""virtue signalling"".  Could it possibly be that people pushing for more vaccinations because they don't want to get sick, don't want their friends and family to get sick, don't want the economy to be mired in this mess?  Nope according to Bret, it's about feeling 'holier than thou""."
2021-09-13 17:12:00,"Deny health care or payments from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance (all probably illegal) to the willfully unvaccinated but heavens no to a government mandate. A mandate would force people to do the right thing. Rather, do the Republican thing and punish people under the guise of “you deserve the bad consequences for your terrible personal choice”  and if there are no sufficiently bad consequences we will invent some."
2021-09-13 17:13:58,"At this point I don’t care much if the purposefully unvaccinated get sick and die. What I do really care about are those persons making other people get sick. If we don’t stamp out this virus, no one is safe. Those that choose not to get vaccinated are putting all of the US at risk. That not libertarianism- that is murder."
2021-09-13 17:24:12,"My former nanny refused to get a vaccine, even though she was caring for my infant children who were ineligible for vaccination. She quit the job, moved to Florida, and got Covid within 2 weeks.

The strategy of Republicans is to create chaos during Biden's term, and that includes hospitals overwhelmed by COVID patients."
2021-09-13 17:34:31,"Bret, c'mon. All the states mandate vaccines for children who attend public schools, vaccines for measles, mumps, smallpox, Hepatitis B, chicken pox. This is nothing new, and, in fact, the state's authority to do so was confirmed in the Supreme Court decision of Jacobson vs. Massachussetts in 1905. Our freedoms are limited when it comes to public health and public safety. That's why we have stop signs, and speed limits, . . . and vaccine mandates."
2021-09-13 17:37:51,"Brett—just among my family and close friends, and just counting the past few weeks:
3 vaccinated cousins in a family of 4 came down with. Covid;
My son had to take his daughter out of preschool and miss work for 3 days, isolate the whole family and get his whole family, including an infant, tested because of exposure to said cousins;
A good friend’s son was in a serious accident, is in the neuro ICU in another state, and neither she, her husband, nor his wife can visit him;
My husband had an acute medical issue for which he was hospitalized and is on meds which make him immunocompromised, so neither of
Us can see anyone, again leaving my son without childcare;
Another friend’s pregnant daughter had to labor at home, only using hospital care at the last minute—we all know this could have been dangerous
And 12 more example i won’t list here.  
I don’t’ know what planet you live on, but no, this is not only a problem for the unvaccinated.  What about the concept of public health crisis do you not understand?"
2021-09-13 17:46:56,"I'm surprised more people haven't picked up on the financial argument for vaccination.  If you decide not to wear a motorcycle helmet because the constitution guarantees your freedom to crack your head open, you won't be turned away from the hospital if you're short on cash.  So it follows that Joe Manchin and the rest of the Republicans, who worry about the taxes needed to pay for fixing the roads, should be equally upset about taxpayers picking up the tab for the unvaccinated."
2021-09-13 17:20:13,"Brett…Uh…do you read your own paper?
Here is what you wrote…. “I understand that puts doctors and nurses under a lot of strain, though Covid hospitalizations seem to be declining and the surgeries that are being put off are mainly elective. Otherwise, I don’t see the latest Covid spike as the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago. It’s gone from being a public-health crisis to a nincompoop-health crisis.”

And yet the NYT just published an article on the horrible situation of hospitals in my state of Washington inundated by COVID patients from maskless, undervaxed Idaho. Sixteen hour work shifts for hospital staff. Postponed neccessary surgeries for Washington residents who did mask up, who did get vaccinated.

You have laid out the thinking of the dire problem and reason for exhaustion and deaths in my state. Pain and suffering have not stopped.

And don’t get me started with the comment that you have a problem with governments telling us what we can do with our bodies while the political values you align with are forcing women in Texas to flee to Mexico, MEXICO, if they can get there, to have reproductive care they need. 
Bah."
2021-09-13 17:47:52,"Bret seems to forget the filibuster. If the social program isn’t tied to infrastructure, moderate Democrats will take their victory and walk. Nothing will pass before 2022 where Democrats stand to lose ground. The only opportunity for the progressive agenda is budget reconciliation. If Republicans and moderates don’t like it, they can undo the same the next time they hold power.

The safe bet though is most of the social programs progressives want will be too popular to repeal once they’re in place. Unlike Trump’s tax cuts, you’re not going to find many people upset with federally paid daycare or prescription drug medicines. Conservatives fear the package not because the price tag but because they know the programs will stick.

As for Biden, pivoting to the center is a non-starter. He’ll just alienate everyone. The minority isn’t cutting him slack for moderating his agenda now. The only course forward is ensuring the budget passes. The only thing worse than a gigantic social program is a gigantic failed social program. Case in point: Hillary Clinton."

2021-09-13 17:41:35,"""the vast majority of Covid-related hospitalizations are happening among the unvaccinated"" - yeah Brett. Unfortunately this increasingly includes children who don't have a choice. Are they also ""nincompoops""? This is a war against a vicious foe. The virus is taking every opportunity to mutate and this could mean more potent strains which could be more contagious & / or deadly. It doesn't care about your political hesitancy.

2021-09-13 17:51:05,"I know two young adults who have recently gotten COVID, both of whom were vaccinated. Their symptoms have been generally mild and they didn't require hospitalization. Both of them were most concerned with telling everyone they saw in the prior two weeks that they could be infected. So far, neither of them knows of anyone who was infected in that period. 

Given that the pandemic is far from over, it's incumbent on all of us to do what little we can, including getting a vaccination and wearing a mask in public (at least indoors). That's a small price to pay for keeping everyone safe."
2021-09-13 17:52:21,"I take issue with Brett Stephen’s claim that not vaccinating hurts no one but yourself. It hurts vaccinated older immunocompromised as well as children to young to be vaccinated, snd provides the hosts for the virus to mutate.

Do we really believe, in our deranged mind, that getting vaccinated impinges on our individual freedom...while ignoring the people around us and whom we seem 'free' to infect and kill, and with no scruples, especially if republican and adamant in obstructing a democratic president, out of irrational spite? What is so difficult to understand...unless you are paid not to?"

2021-09-13 17:54:53,"There is absolutely no way that Americans who willfully refuse to get Covid vaccinations, thereby endangering many other Americans and overburdening our healthcare delivery teams, should get away with this behavior without any downside.

If we wait until these maleficent characters contract Covid and become deathly ill, it is not enough simply to say them, ""There, serves you right!"" By then, they already have harmed untold numbers of innocent men, women and children trying to the right thing.

Bret Stephens is way off base when he writes, ""the civil libertarian in me doesn't love the idea of this or another president using administrative powers to force vaccines on the people who refuse to get them.""

Let's see a show of hands of the people who are fed up with the right-wing, self-identified 'civil libertarians' who repeatedly get our nation in trouble on every conceivable issue."
2021-09-13 17:53:03,"Brett, be honest.  If this were Ronald Reagan mandating the vaccine you would call it the best thing since George Washington mandated smallpox inoculation for his troops.  If Joe Biden cured cancer you would fret about the damage to hard-working oncologists' careers."

The willfully unvaccinated covid adult should be at the back of the line for medical treatment. After all, they're only ill from a hoax or they're exercising their ""rights"" to get sick and die (like drunk driving, they have no ""rights"" to force others to get sick and die)."
2021-09-13 13:46:28,"Stephens seems to think delaying elective surgeries is no big deal.

Watching my mom, who needs a knee replacement, go downhill while she awaits this deferred surgery gives me plenty of ammunition to counter Stephens's shrug. When you can't walk or do other routine physical exercise, your overall health degenerates. Ditto when you can't sleep due to pain. And when you can't perform simple tasks like preparing dinner or driving your car, you become dependent on others--a significant blow to mental health as it drags on month after month.

""Elective surgery"" doesn't mean what Stephens seems to think it means. We're not talking about facelifts here. The fact that unvaccinated folks are directly responsible for delay of elective surgeries, leading to suffering and harm, is an outrage."

2021-09-13 17:59:26,"Mr. Stephens: ""I accept that people don’t want the government or their employer telling them what to do with their bodies.""

Why? Why do you accept that, Mr. Stephens? Listen: when it comes to getting a vaccine that will prevent a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease from continuing to spread and mutate, there is no personal freedom. We either do what is needed to protect others (in this case, get the vaccine), or we opt out of society altogether--not driving on public roads, entering other people's buildings, or allowing ourselves to pass within many feet of other people. 

Would Mr. Stephens write, ""I accept that people don't want the government telling them what side of the road to drive on""? If yes, would he be okay with driving down a dark highway at night with precious family aboard, not having any clue which side of the road an oncoming truck might be traveling on just around the next bend? And if no, then how can he possibly accept people opposing the government's mandates about vaccines? Try logic, Mr. Stephens. It does come in handy.

Note to the unvaccinated: Yes, you should be mandated to get a vaccine if you want to live in a society with other humans. Just grow up and deal with it--or permanently leave, please."
2021-09-13 11:32:04,"Have to say, I am weary of debating the masking issue. Pre-pandemic, I had a relative who was undergoing treatment for leukemia. When we visited her, we had to mask up. No one questioned or thought otherwise about it. We were doing it for her, not ourselves. It was the right thing to do. Didn't define me as a Republican or a Democrat. Just said I cared about her health and supported her quest to defeat her cancer. 
Why can't all of us support what we all embrace, to stay healthy in the face of this virus invasion, and do our part? Just doesn't seem that difficult to grasp and comply."
2021-09-13 11:17:33,"I favor stricter Federal mandates to force vaccinations such as a ban on interstate travel without a covid vaccination, like EU does.  Completely a Federal Government power, interstate travel whether my plane, train, bus or private vehicle should be limited to those who are vaccinated and CDC should provide IDs like EU does already to prove it.

Freedom is fine but it is always tempered by responsibility to the safety of other people.  We owe something to each other as Americans and getting a vaccine to prevent the death of others including children and those who cannot for medical reasons be vaccinated is the least thing we owe to other Americans.

As John Kenney famous once said, 'ask not what my country can do for me, ask what I can do for my country.'   Be kind to others, obey the law, pay your taxes, vote, and get vaccinated seems to be the least we all can do now for our fellow Americans."
2021-09-13 17:35:05,"Mr Stephens, It is inaccurate-- as well as indecent-- for you to  minimize the impact of having an elective surgery cancelled. People waiting to have, say--  a back fusion, their 3rd staged surgery for a complex leg fracture, or a gall bladder excision--are miserable, as well as at risk of becoming dangerously ill.
I have an 83 year old friend who needs another back fusion. How dare you tell her to suck it up as she is having to do, given Seattle hospitals are flooded with patients acutely ill with COVID, who are there because they have refused to vaccinate."

I am 64 (still working full-time), one sister is 66, and the oldest sister is 74. IF we can get together next summer--depending on your civil liberties, of course--it will be three years since I've seen them. 

But hey, your civil liberties outrank mine, apparently. And keep in mind that, as Gail commented, that no one is tying people up and injecting the vaccines by force. You don't have to get the vaccine, but live with the consequences, and stay home."

Not because the state cares whether an unbelted individual is killed in an accident, but because the consequences of not belting up taxes too many systems and we all pay for it in the end.  It's just common sense.  Likewise with the COVID vaccine.  This country of ours is a ""community"" and we have responsibilities to one another as a result.  In a nation of true adults, this, like seat belts, would be a non-issue, because everyone would do the obvious thing to protect the community.  We are not living in a nation of true adults.  We are living in a nation of cynical politicians, stoking the fears of the uneducated and the paranoid, for cheap political gain.  Frankly, that's a recipe for disaster and a call to action.  Biden did the right thing."
2021-09-13 18:09:59,"Speaking of vax politics, is Ms. Mandavilli going to decide on boosters from the conference room where the Times’s Editorial Board meets? I hope not. I’m tiring of the crusades, and given the steady climb of (unadjusted) hazard ratios for hospitalization from 0.03 early this year to about 0.2 now, the motives for President Biden’s plan to re-inoculate at 8 months, beginning with the nursing homes and proceeding in the same order the original campaign did, look obvious to me.

I suspect the FDA dissidents chose to leave primarily because they feel the US should be vaccinating Latin America and Africa for equity reasons, although they cite the Biden Administration’s turf intrusions and hurried timeline undercutting the FDA’s authority. I could be totally off base here, but equity has grown predominant as a theme at the general journals, especially Nature, and experts can be as opinionated as anyone else once the drumbeat starts.

The argument that most of our new strains are evolving in unvaccinated populations in the Global South omits our inability to export enough doses to stop that from happening; the donor effort will be lucky to reach the seniors facing the highest risks. Biden’s decision must come well ahead of need, as most of the boosters won’t go out until next year even if they’re ordered today, not to mention how protection from America’s apathetic unvaccinated also figures. We might have to reformulate the shots to cover different antigens by then."
2021-09-13 18:17:17,"The problem with the libertarian position (or the liberal one, for that matter) is the believe in an individual, discreet citizen (or subject).

The liberal subject of our democratic republic is a fiction in the leaky, interconnected, vector subjectivities of this pandemic."

But to define the anti-vax problem as a ""libertarian"" choice when he knows we are trying to strangle the virus before the emergence of more lethal variants -- that is irresponsible, Bret!  If Covid were  -- or evolves into -- a pox that leaves everyone who contracts it hideously scarred; or if it mutates to a paralytic agent consigning its victims to life in an iron lung?  How fast would the libertarians mutate into vaccine seekers, abandoning a ""principle"" predicated upon the fact that, so far, they can gamble that at least for the privileged like Mr. Stephens Covid appears rather low risk?"
2021-09-13 18:28:06,"Saying ""surgeries that are being put off are mainly elective"" makes it sound like they are frivolous or unnecessary.

I finally had it March 24 of this year."
2021-09-13 18:29:44,"Could Bret please try to keep in mind that viruses mutate, and that the mutations that persist (e.g. Delta) follow the 'survival of the fittest paradigm'. Delta is not going to be the last COVID variant. What follows it could be more infectious, more virulent, more vaccine resistant, or some combination of the three. The longer we wait to try to stamp the virus out completely, the more likely such variants become to take hold somewhere and spread from there. This is truly a situation where an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."

A friend who is immune compromised now has two kids sick with covid. Everyone who can be vaxxed in her family is vaxxed. Community spread is still a problem for everyone, and it is still hurting the economy. That is definitely the government's concern and it's about time we had stronger action. Look at the world ""hotspot"" map in today's Times. It is unacceptable that the US is in such dire shape."
2021-09-13 18:41:27,"Bret, what is so difficult about understanding that the vaccine does not provide lifelong protection against infection? Just like the flu shot, vaccine effectiveness will wain over time. The longer these clowns run around ignoring medical advice, the more likely responsible people will contract the disease on the tail end of their current shot's effectiveness. And the more likely  a variant will appear that the current vaccine cannot protect against. Yes, you're ""missing"" more than a few things."
2021-09-13 18:42:43,"It's hard to keep a straight face when many of the unvaccinated argue ""we don't know"" what's in the vaccine while  some are the same folks who rush to and defend the consumption of  horse de-wormer  to prevent  Covid .  The level of ignorance , selfishness and disinformation is astonishing.  So yes, after having tried and failed with the ""carrots"" of compassion, education, understanding and bribing  w/incentives it's time to try the ""stick"":  denial of hospital beds and medical treatments to the unvaccinated (unless they have proof of a legitimate medical exemption);  charge them for every test their employer must administer as well as docking their time;  no admission to public venues such as restaurants, theatres, airlines and more.  Without a host to attach to Covid will  eventiually die;    with hordes of unvaccinated Covid will  only continue to spread, duplicate and mutate."
2021-09-13 18:46:54,"Bret incorrectly concludes that anti-vaxxers are mostly harming themselves by refusing vaccination. Not so. At a minimum, they are clogging hospital ICUs and thus denying critical care to non-COVID critical care patients; they are contributing to breakthrough infections among the vaccinated; and they are facilitating further mutations of the virus, which may put all of us at risk from a more easily spread virus that can evade current vaccines. Their failure to vaccinate is costing all of us."
2021-09-13 18:49:45,"Personally I think that personal freedoms stop when they start to impose harm on others.

As for the social spending bill? This country has been shamelessly propping up the moneyed elite when they did not really need it. This generated record profits. As record profits continued they began to view that as status quo and their divine right.

Taxes are currently lower than they have ever been except for 1 period. Coincidentally the wealth inequality and sway by that moneyed elite has never been greater. Add in the amount of federal support that went, you guessed it, to the wealthy produced speculative trading raking in greater profits but forming a bit of a nasty bubble...

When this all bursts and we are in the midst of a new Great Deperssion, we're gonna need that bill..."

Does it maintain a stronger than might be needed (granted, no way to really know this) military to protect Israel from its a nihilistic neighbors, should that be needed, or is its primary purpose in the General Welfare, Pursuit of Happiness stuff.  I suspect you like Sen. Lieberman, are first and foremost one issue guys on the former.  Nothing wrong with that, as long as the military part assumes acting on good intelligence which includes knowing how to use diplomacy to preclude a military response.

But the rest of us in the Democratic world seems to be stuck on the latter, what's in the social spending bill--giving Americans what the rest of the Democratic world takes for granted. 

And it's affordable at a very low price in the bill, and paid for with only modest tax increases, and from those who have previously successfully spent millions to avoid billions in taxes. Making Stealing from the Treasury Legal, has been their motto.

And there's climate change.  It's in there but the Democrats are downplaying it.  In the great scheme of things, it's all that's really important in the bill--survival of the human race stuff.  And Joe Manchini (Italian hit man) is against it.  It's important that it pass now--already at least 20 years late.  You don't need a deceased McCain to stand up, but a living Republican.  And you are right about one thing:  Make sure the climate change part passes, even if it is decoupled from the bill to do it."

It was a given because that’s what my parents were taught and what parents in the neighborhood taught us all to do. Most but not all went to church so religion backed the actions of some but beyond that it was a matter of common decency, ethics if you will, for everyone to look out not only for themselves but for the community.

2021-09-13 19:06:28,"Once we start ""mandating"" treatments we enter a possible Twilight Zone moment.

Our debate over a vaccine mandate is very important and one that needs careful consideration. Once we start making people put things or not put things into ""their"" bodies we need to be insightful of its possible progression in the wrong direction in the name of ""community"" health. 

Humans do crazy things with their bodies all the time. For example; type 2 diabetes is a pandemic in the US.  Type 2 diabetes is primarily the result of two interrelated problems:

1. Cells in muscle, fat and the liver become resistant to insulin. Because these cells don't interact in a normal way with insulin, they don't take in enough sugar.

2.The pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels.

Exactly why this happens is unknown, but being overweight and inactive are key contributing factors.Type 2 diabetes drives up the cost of health insurance, burdens our healthcare providers and reduces life expectancy while significantly impacting our economy. Its a major cause of death in the US.

Treatment is well defined via diet control and exercise but yet the pandemic grows. Should we mandate treatment in this group of patients for the good of ""community"" health? In other words control what foods they eat, what amount of exercise they must do for ""their"" body. If not should we raise the cost of their health insurance or ask them to weigh in at work each week or pay higher insurance premiums?"

2021-09-13 19:16:29,"I haven't liked our nation's response to the virus outbreak since the beginning.  Trump and Cuomo fought for control over managing the outbreak in New York and Cuomo won.  Cuomo ran an interference campaign against the national response by appearing live on TV on a different channel at the same time Trump was advising the nation on the national response.

I blame the Democrats and the liberal media for destroying the public's trust in our government for the results we are getting today.  Delta variants, Trump supporters and the unvaccinated does not explain the deaths we are experiencing.

We are an international red zone for the outbreak.  Countries with less than 10% vaccination rates have less cases and less deaths than we do.  One year ago, no one was vaccinated in the US and we had half as many cases and deaths.

It is hard to tell what is happening.  The Director of the CDC, second in charge, resigned after Biden took office.  Both the FDA and the CDC have seen high level resignations over disputes with the Biden administration.  Saying Trump wasn't following the advice of scientists and Biden would turned out to be another hoax.

As hoax after hoax gets called to light against the Democrats, Biden and the liberal media, Biden's approval rating is in free fall."
2021-09-13 19:23:54,"Yes, Gail, I, too, am buying into big change - given where we were since 2016 and what we well might have become - an autocracy at the very least - had the wannabe dictator and his cronies won in 2020. Texas, enabled by an illegitimate Supreme Court, paints a grim and vivid forecast of what government control by the right wing minority looks like. The voter suppression laws recently enacted in not just a few states, if allowed to stand, will seal democracy's fate. Bret's fiscal worries ring hollow in the face of undeniable enormous fiscal inequities. It is time to right the ship - and, by the way, address the threat, the clear and present danger January 6 represents. That only a tiny handful of the GOP is willing to investigate and roundly condemn the perpetrators and at the same time refuses to show their unqualified support for the Capitol police who defended valiantly smacks of treason."
2021-09-13 19:27:48,"As for mandatory vaccines there is the law and a Supreme Court case which makes the point: from NPR

""There is, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, [a Supreme Court case from 1905]. The case itself was about a vaccination mandate.

In the early 1900s, smallpox outbreaks were fairly frequent and many people had been vaccinated earlier as children, but needed to be vaccinated as their immunity waned. The state of Massachusetts passed a law that gave authority to local boards of health to make a decision at any given moment in response to an outbreak that smallpox vaccination should be mandatory for all residents of their local area if — in the opinion of the medical experts who were serving on the board — it was necessary to protect the public's health.""

This is the basis for Biden's mandated vaccine requirements. Without vaccine shots for everyone many people will get Covid including those and especially those who claim religious exemption. And I won't go into why I think ANY religious exemption is absurd."
2021-09-13 19:37:50,"It is unfortunate and sad if those who choose not to get vaccinated get sick and/or die.  But at least it's a choice they made.  My niece and a friend are now resident doctors and both are immune compromised...one a cancer survivor and another suffers lupus. They are both dedicated professionals and continue to care for all who require their services. The way I see it, the civil libertarian argument is flawed.  If you refuse to get vaccinated and want to gamble with your own life, that's one thing.  When other lives are placed in great jeopardy because ""civil liberties"" defend your refusal to get vaccinated, then you've ceased being civil.  You've become totally self-centered and harmful."

This willful misunderstanding (there's been abundant genuine pandemic information available over the last year) has dogged public compliance with public health policy since January 2020.  It's not that difficult.  Every single infected person is a virus factory that spreads it around.  There is no such thing as ""decisions that affect only myself"" here.  Vaccinated people can be infected and die, though at much lower rates.  So the fact remains that so long as the reproduction rate of the virus remains above 1 WE ARE ALL endangered by the un-vaxed."

Is there any particular reason we're playing Russian Roulette with our children's lives? 

Things we know:

Delta is MORE infectious
Delta may be more deadly
Delta is now making children sick and hospitalizing them
Children under 12 cannot yet be vaccinated

Who looks at THAT list and decides it's a jolly good idea to ring the bell and pack the rooms? Who?!!

So what do we do? March the kids off to schools that have neither the time nor means nor money to provide social distancing, fresh air, or any of the things necessary to curb the spread of the disease. 

 Last year, through Herculean efforts, wealthy schools who ponied up millions were able to do a reasonable job of safeguarding lives but at tremendous cost. So what do we do while in the midst of a deadly surge? Throw open all doors, cram kids into rooms that STILL don't have ventilation systems that work, windows that open, or enough room, don't require masks and vaccines, don't provide hand gel. 

Every smart thing my school did last year? We did away with it this year for reasons no one will explain. 

2020. The year rational thinking died in this country. If we get very very lucky we may resurrect some semblance of a ghost of a country when this is all over, but all signs point to our decline and fall. Why? Because we REFUSED to behave like rational beings capable of being proactive and of implementing life-saving measures.

So, the overall common perception of the ravages of COVID-19 is that we’ve only lost over 650,000 weak in the survival of our species struggle. In fact, in the long run, such “culling” might actually save us billions in health care expenses?

Of course, if it had been over 650,000, say, young children through 30-something’s in prime health dead or permanently disabled, the public concern would have been dramatically raised. 

In our communal heart of hearts, one might sincerely wonder if this explains some of these current political deliberations?

Joe Biden has stepped up to the plate and even in the midst of spiking of the weird Covid pandemic has continued to push the importance of the U.S. using its technological, research capability, and wealth to take on the challenge of decarbonizing the global economy.  

This is no small task. it is economically wrenching because our standard of living is very closely tied to oil, coal, and natural gas.  Our daily lives are tuned to carbon-fueled transportation and electricity for our homes, factories, agriculture.  This is the U.S. economy so we will need to work our butts off to achieve zero global carbon emissions by mid-century.

In the midst of these two huge existential issues, we still have the social and economic problems associated with the inequality gap in this country. Bret's litany of crises doesn't just apply to California. They are nationwide.

I don't expect the very wealthy 1 percenters to vote for Democrats but I know that until we get a handle on the global pandemic and global warming if you love your family and want greater economic and financial stability, better health access, better education, and greater opportunity, you will vote for the Biden Build Back Better plan."

Second,  Stephens should be reminded every time he trims on the subject of vaccination that 660,000 have died (and counting) because of the politicization of public health by his party.

By standing on a virtual soap box and declaring respect for their base by saying that vaccines are a matter of choice and no one should force them to get vaccinated (or masked), it is the proof their base needs that SOMEONE sees them as worthy of making their own decisions.

It is the very worst form of gas-lighting; it is disingenuous and hypocritical, but it works for the politicians who do this, because even though they are killing off their base they have lost none of the remaining one's loyalty.

I would like to hear someone with a very large bullhorn scream this out in the hopes that the message will get out.  I don't think that is going to happen, but I also don't know how to undo the harm done to the country, both with getting COVID in the rear-view, but also the antagonism that exists between the GOP base and everyone else.  

I wish I knew what would fix both these problems.  Maybe someone here has an idea or two."
2021-09-13 19:26:33,"I don't think the hundreds of healtcare workers and hospitals that have been stretched to total breakdown would view this as a ""nincompoop-health crisis"" the way Bret seems to see it.

I don't count myself as being a fan of either Democrats or Republicans...but I usually vote Democratic. I would vote for any of the 5 Republicans...they each have a functioning brain. Bret, I clicked on the Gazelles, couldn't watch the whole thing...such innocence.

Thank you for doing this column...keep at it...I love it."

This is one of the latter. Bret toddles down several aisles he shouldn’t, with the peak being  his statement that “No doubt I’m missing a few things”.

Others have already enumerated the things Bret missed. Bret needs to grasp that awareness that a few things are being missed generally indicates that only the tip of the iceberg has been detected, and there are in fact a plethora of errors that have accrued.

I’m praying for patience for Gail."
2021-09-13 20:19:22,"Dear Gail, Brett no longer merits sharing this forum with you after his recent attacks on President Biden especially regarding ending the Afghanistan war. While I admire your willingness to tolerate his divergent views, you’re far too polite with your collegiality. His caustic dismissal of the President’s careful character and decisiveness, after years of Trump’s outright attacks on our institutions, besmirches your own. Don’t allow him to further taint you. Please!"

I guess that means Stephens doesn't have a kid under 12.

What I dislike so much about the NYTimes conservative crew of Stephens, Douthat, Brooks -- especially of late -- is that their argumentation is so plainly built on finding some way of critiquing Democratic politicians. That is intellectually dishonest in the extreme, and as such ethically reprehensible. IMO."
2021-09-13 19:07:19,"There you go again, Bret.  Anti-vaxers are NOT ""mostly a risk to themselves.""  They are a risk to everyone including the vaccinated (perhaps you've heard of breakthrough infections), the overall health of the public (by giving the virus more room to grow and mutate into God knows what); the education of our children (because schools in semi-pandemic mode indefinitely are destined to damage the next generation) and the economy (other than the stock market - which might be your only concern).

You were seemingly somewhat rational when Trump was in office.  Now that we have President Biden you are spouting the same nonsense that Republicans and the right wing media disseminated for 30 years - teeing up the anti-democratic monster to enter the WH.

For the sake of our country how about telling the truth - consistently?"

2021-09-13 20:22:32,"I wish we would stop conflating mask issues with vaccination issues. Yet, every single article or discussion seems to focus on both of them as if they were one, or at least co-equal, matters. They are not.
As a result, so many times, a discussion on what should be the overwhelmingly overriding issue-vaccinations-gets obscured in debates about masking.
I fault the CDC for that. In its July guidelines  it communicated the Provincetown situation as an alarming development compelling universal indoor masking.  It could instead have been communicated in a positive manner, as an example of how well vaccines work- out of hundreds of infections, there were only a handful of hospitalizations, and no fatalities ! What a great message. Instead, the CDC led with the retraction  of its previous masking recommendation. The good news about vaccine efficacy was lost in the masking change.
I am fully vaccinated, and I have little tolerance for those who won't get vaccinated. I do have a problem with the way masking recommendations are communicated. 
Most people wear poorly fitting cloth masks which are virtually useless, except perhaps for optics.  But, they don't realize this. That false impression could create a false sense of security and actually contribute to the spread of infection. Sometimes, doing something is not better than not doing anything.
Focus on vaccinations, vaccinations, vaccinations. Masking is a distracting issue and will never prevent the ultimate spread of COVID."
2021-09-13 18:28:25,"Bret's comment about prohibiting Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance payment for the unvaccinated demonstrates why libertarianism is a dead end - it isn't consistent with how people behave. Hospitals won't turn away the unvaccinated, and Covid patients won't pay the horrendous treatment bills out of pocket. I guess he was just trolling, but I expect better from a NYT columnist. And his comment that Covid hospitalizations are no big deal isn't consistent with the facts, which are that some areas are exporting patients they don't have room for."
2021-09-13 18:56:02,"This notion the US government cannot compel it citizens to do something simply needs to be put to rest. 

The government can and does. The example of men aged 18 and older being legally required to register with Selective Service is a good one. The government requires it; it's been doing so for more than 40 years, and prior to that, the government drafted -- compelled young men into military service, lest they face prosecution in the absence of a viable reason to be excepted. 

The covid pandemic represents as much of a national security emergency as any armed conflict, or another 9/11 attack.

Anyone who thinks the government cannot compel you to do something is a complete fool and oblivious to history. 

Also, that Republicans would champion imminent domain to build a border wall, then turn around and insist that Biden has wiped his feet on the Constitution with a vaccine mandate are likewise fools. What they really intended to say is that the government is their henchman, their means to an end, not anyone else's."

2021-09-13 19:26:06,"Bret: There are people, particularly the immunocompromised, who have a solid medical or emotional need to take great precautions, including masks, and I totally respect them. The busybodies and virtue-signalers, not so much.

this is ridiculous.

hey Bret - how can you tell who the immunocompromised are? you can't, right? and how can you tell if you're infected, especially if you've been vaccinated and probably are not showing symptoms? again, you can't, right?

THAT is why you should wear a mask. come on. we've been doing this 18 months now. keep up."

2021-09-13 19:23:27,"Great idea that insurance shouldn’t pay for unvaccinated people who get sick. I’m sure Bret would also agree we should extend that to anyone who is overweight, abusing substances, doesn’t exercise, smokes, eats foods that are shown to cause cancer, has unprotected sex, or engages in any other lifestyle choices that have a negative impact on health.

It's time for our nations collective responsibilty and well-being to take precedent over the selfish notion of ""my freedoms."""
2021-09-13 18:01:28,"So, Bret, your claim of the nincompoop health crisis leaves out one very important consideration.  The more active cases, of longer duration, the more likely a new variant will emerge.  No bets on what it will be but I don't like the odds.  Add that to the seemingly willful disregard of my fellow citizens for the weaker and unimunizable amongst us and mandates are the way to go.  We have to collectively put all of our shoulders to the proverbial wheel and get this pandemic to some minimally tolerable level that minimizes the chances of yet another new variant having the opportunity to emerge and force us back to square one."

It is that the Republicans haven't yet finished messing with covid and pushing it in the wrong direction--unfortunately for hundreds of thousands of people, for our economy still flattened by covid and waiting to open up again, and for the good of our country.  

How arrogant do you have to be to campaign on beating Mother Nature and science by defying them at every turn?

It was telling that the GOP did not even have a platform when Trump ran for president. 

About all the party really stands for now is being against anything the Democrats are for; against anything that helps, rather than hurts our environment (including safe drinking water and clean air); and against anything that helps working or poor Americans, their children, and this country and the planet's future.

No platform, no plans except to defeat the Democrats and aggrandize the rich and powerful corporations--running on empty essentially.   

So no wonder Republican campaigning, such as it is, relies on nothing but lies, disinformation, propaganda and political stunts.

Because none of us have ever done anything stupid, or with bad optics. The other side -- that most every single governor in the United States (putting aside people like Abbott or DeSantis) has been guessing on Covid because information changes daily -- is that Gavin Newsom has been a great governor when it comes to the pandemic. That people have objected to some of his policies, hey, you can't have it both ways. He made decisions that he felt were for the best, and pretty much saved a lot of lives.

Yet he had dinner at a French restaurant once against regulations. That's what counts. Sometimes I hate the pundit press."

That might be true among elite New Yorkers who don't have to mingle with the unvaccinated and have enough hospital space to go around, but in places like the rural South even the vaccinated are still suffering from the choices of the unvaxxed.

Bret should do a little research.
Supreme Court 1905 Jacobson v. Massachusetts ruling, upheld some five times in succeeding cases, gives the government authority for such mandates.
That is the law of the land.
Bret can argue with the rulings, but the law is on President Biden's side.
The stance of several GOP state governors is that President Biden's order is overreach.
It is not.
Evidence:  state governors all mandate vaccination for several diseases in their states.
This include South Dakota Gov Kristi Noem, who objects to vaccination mandate even while she herself has such state mandates for vaccination in her state.  That appears to be hypocritical, and her argument that President Biden cannot do what he did doesn't hold a thimble of water.
Bret Stephens should update his opinion after studying Supreme Court cases to wipe off the pie in his face."

However, to the extent every infected person, vaccinated or otherwise, becomes a host for the virus to potentially mutate into a variant resistant to the current vaccines, the recommendations are supported by science. Every potential infection needs to be systematically avoided regardless of its chance of resulting in hospitalization or long Covid or death."

2021-09-13 21:07:20,"Bret misses one important point about the virus spreading among the ""nincompoops"". If only that were the whole story. But every time the virus infects someone, it replicates many *trillions* of times. Each person can infect many others, leading to trillions more replications. And each time there's a chance that the copy will have some random variation. The vast majority of those will be harmless, but once in while there will be a variant that's worse than the original - more easily spread, or more destructive. The more people there are who get infected, the greater the chance of a dangerous new variant emerging. That affects everyone, not just the anti-vaxxers. It really is true that we're all in this together."

2021-09-13 21:40:39,"Bret and Gail,

I discussed  ""The Conversation"" with my wife at lunch and she joins with me in believing that Joe Biden is the best President we have had since we became a member of the Washington community in Jimmy Carter's term.  We were never that political because we were retired Navy and in the military our training was to be public servants for whoever was elected.

At lunch we went over the record of Presidents that we were acquainted with as we play by play went through the records of all including President Carter and came away with the agreement that Joe Biden is perfectly suited for the challenge of our time.  We don't believe his decisioning is being fully recognized by the people of the U.S. and the news media.  

We think the Covid pandemic has demonstrated that the Trump followers including many of the red state governors have been irrational in their failure to join the intelligent people of the country to get vaccinated and wear a mask.  The ineptness as leaders is documented in the resurgence of the Covid infection rate, hospitalizations, and death rates in those Red States -- the correlations is stunning.

The Senate is back today and I note that the Republican speakers are seizing the moment to criticize President's decision to get out of Afghanistan, which was a good decision.

We must move on and begin to address the real urgent crises that you both know well.  These crises will require a strong national commitment to future proofing the U.S. economy."
2021-09-13 21:51:35,"Bret, no one is forcing anyone to get vaccinated. Requiring people who chose not to get vaccinated to pick their noses once a week to ensure the safety of others is not a tall ask. Our kids have been getting tested once every other week for almost a year."
2021-09-13 22:01:57,"Let's make this a Republican market driven solution.  Charge those who aren't fully vaccinated full cost of their covid19 care. Like Texas on abortions, let vaccinated and other healthcare patients who get covid19 or are denied or delayed treatment sue states that don't have covid19 vaccination mandates."
2021-09-13 22:43:15,"I found its extremely disappointing to discuss covid vaccine mandates. Does Bret have his right to speak up, of course! But this conversation wouldn't be so dividing if certain politicians and news media are not spreading non sense and misinformation. In the end, if pandemic keep rolling, we are all going to pay. Biden is right, the unvaccinated is cost us all!"
2021-09-13 23:08:06,"I am surprised that our fearless columnists, Gail and Bret, have missed one of the most bizarre way the  Covid will be ""messing with politics"".

This Friday there will be another far right demonstration in Washington at Capitol Hill.  On the paper, the demonstration is in support of those who were arrested on January 6.  The organizers claim that those arrested were simply exercising their first amendment rights; hence, convicting them of anything turns them into ""political prisoners"".

At the same time, those behind Arizona election audit are getting ready to release their audit result.  We should expect the following:

1.  The audit results will be released very close to the time of the demonstration, to turn into battle cry. It could be either on Thursday afternoon or early on Friday morning; and,

2. The audit will claim discovery of a major election ""fraud"" in the form of votes casted by ""dead"" individuals.

According to CDC, in 2019 the no. of deaths in the US from all causes was just under 3 million.  Because of Covid, that no. is well above 3 million for 2020 and 2021.  That means by the time of the audit an atypical no. of 2020 election voters had passed.  So, the Arizona audit organizers could claim - with straight face - that an unusually large number of votes had been casted by dead people.

Of course, don't expect them to make any reference to the lag time between the election date and the time of their audit or the impact of Covid on the number of dead voters."
2021-09-13 23:15:22,"Bret continues to engage in Susan Collinesque levles of denial about what the real problem is here - the pathlogical hatred and mistrust of gov't, cultivated in no small measure by very wealthy people with big megaphones (in all kinds of media) and deep pockets who just hate, hate, hate paying taxes. 
I am tired of hearing never Trump Republicans who refuse to connect the dots between their ""gov't is the problem, not the solution"" rhetoric and the election of the former bozo-in-chief,  with zero understanding of gov't, but perceived as a successful businessman because of his wealth - achieved via inheritance, with the help of business scams and tax evasion that went largely unremarked on - perhaps because for people in Trump's position, such behavior is unremarkable. 
I am tired of having them blame backlash to gov't initiatives as the fault of the initiatives themselves, as opposed to the mistrust his side has been cultivating for decades. 
When is Bret going to admit that it is time for him to recalibrate his political worldview and stop hiding behind the reactions of people who clearly don't recognize a con man when they see one - but mistrust everything Joe Biden does."

And that even the vaccinated can contract and spread the virus?  Stephens’s comment seems  irresponsible and surprisingly ill-informed."

2021-09-13 23:24:57,"There are already a variety of so-called refusal rules/laws based primarily on religious or moral  exemptions. For example, a hospital could very well refuse to provide an abortion to a woman whose life is at risk. So --- we've already decided that we can limit healthcare based on certain criteria. However, the core issue is denying critical and often life-saving treatment for others who need medical attention for an existing condition or emergency event. 

There are a growing number of cases were hospitals have had to make a difficult triage decision to free up a scarce bed for an unvaccinated patient requiring intubation, for example, by discharging a non-COVID-19 patient before it would have previously been medically indicated. They are taking a chance with one life to possibly save another. 

If we can't in all good conscience deny medical care to the willfully unvaccinated, we can certainly make some tough, necessary triage decisions in terms of when they receive that care relative to others."

Another reason, however, is something that Bret and his like need to own up to: Proposition 13, which has caused much higher sales and income taxes and decreased housing mobility. It has also starved the schools of revenue. And as for our environmental issues, here is a man and a party who has historically been opposed to measures to combat climate change. So who is exactly at fault here? The ""elites""...or the Republicans?"
2021-09-13 20:04:25,"On walk yesterday and this analogy came to mind:

We all share from the same punchbowl.
It's really good punch and it keeps the party going.

But some people decided to foul the punch bowl, they dropped a you know what into the bowl because they had the ""freedom"" to do so.
 
Now no one can drink the punch.

Until everyone agrees to get you know what out of the punchbowl it is spoiled for everyone. But some people find amusement watching the others complain about the problem.

So amusing they are willing to die for it."
2021-09-13 20:33:02,"In many ways Biden has tried the ""civil libertarian"" approach.  He has mostly let the states decide for themselves on vaccine and mask mandates.  Even though that approach has merits )The number of vaccinated rose as the number of infections and deaths spiked).  It's been less than an overwhelming success to say the least.  At the current pace, it could take months or longer to get new infections low enough to drop all restrictions.  Biden doesn't have the time.  He's in a damned if you do damned if you don't box.  If folks don't like the federal mandates they can always move to Brazil."
2021-09-13 20:34:40,"Wow Brett, I can’t even finish reading your inane opinion piece…, I will tell you as a primary care physician this spike affects MANY more than those who choose not to be vaccinated.  The hundreds of dead, sick or just burned out medical providers come to mind."
2021-09-13 21:06:15,"Hey Bret. Your “nincompoop” health crisis killed 1,648 Americans yesterday. That’s a 9/11 death toll every two days. Doesn’t sound too “nincompoopy” to me."
2021-09-13 22:11:34,"You may have a good point, Mr. Bret, with your opposition to a vaccine mandate: since unvaccinateds do harm to themselves (mostly), there should NOT be an external intervention to defend them against the negative effects (such as death) of their own inaction. To put it cynically, you are suggesting to let irresponsible people kill themselves !  as long as innocents do not die. Yes, the government has the duty to protect everyone, no matter how irresponsible, but you suggest that Biden should make an exception to that duty.
As for your criticism that Biden is not the unifying-mollifying president that you think his mandate demanded, well ... these are not quite the good times for which that kind of presidency would be appropriate. We are in a little bit of a hell, Mr. Bret, and that requires a pushier president. Let him try a couple of things. To quote the great trump: ""what do you have to lose?"" sanity, dignity, life ? None of the above.
Freedom ? It is still there, don't worry."

2021-09-13 19:50:44,"Hey Bret Stephens, you’ve got it backwards. COVID is not messing with politics, Republicans and “libertarians” are making very real and very critical public health issues political! And they’re endangering innocent and less educated people doing so.

You write that your inner “civil libertarian” “ doesn’t love the idea of this or any president using administrative powers to force vaccines on the people who refuse to get them.”
How do your inner civil libertarian feel about seat belt laws? Or the fact that it’s illegal to drive while drunk or while texting? Or are you uncomfortable with the fact that you can’t carry a gun onto a plane? Or that you have to be security screened?

A huge number of the 650,000 + Americans that have have died of COVID died because because selfish people believe conspiracy theories about vaccines or masks that Republican politicians are pushing and quacks like Rand Paul are spreading.
Please grow up."

And by the way..it's the economy stupid..get a vaccine."
2021-09-13 20:14:19,"Bret
I'd just like to remain that your that your last column, headline aside, was pretty awful.  Mean and Iinsulting.  If you want a moderate, as you would define one, go find someone.  You've got  platform.  By the way, I don't think Biden look tired or aged or any of the other agist insults you've been tossing around."
2021-09-13 21:09:38,"Where were these people when they were vaccinated for measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, diptheria, tetanus, pertussis, varicella, and zoster? Where was all the outrage when you needed to show proof of these vaccinations to go to elementary school all the way through college? ""well the mRNA vaccine is different, they pushed it out too fast, do your own research, it changes your genes, blah blah blah.""

When you ask them to explain how an mRNA vaccine is different from growing a virus in a cell culture for traditional vaccines, they have no idea. When you ask them what FDA approval entails, a typical timeline for approval and why it was expedited, they have no idea. When you ask them to explain the ""research"" they did on their own, and how it compares to the comprehensive scientific effort published from Pfizer and Moderna and vetted by the scientific community (microbiologists, pathologists, infectious disease specialists, PhD researchers, public health experts, pharmacologists, chemists, biomedical engineers), they have no idea.

They know nothing about microbiology, genetics, molecular biology, critical thinking, sources of evidence, or the scientific method. Instead, they know Fox News, deep state distrust, NewsMax, OANN, Facebook posts, Youtube videos, random wackos and grifters spouting off Ivermectin/bleach/whatever drug to ward off Covid, and an inability to come to terms with reality and truth. Ignorance that knows no bounds. Truly sad."
2021-09-13 21:16:34,"Blah....the headline was so much more interesting than the article. 

This time is different, kids who don't have a choice to take the vaccine or not are getting sick.  There isn't even a vaccine for their parents to choose to give them.  Kids are 26% of the covid cases right now.  So yes if the anti-vaxxers wnt to kill themselfs okay....but do it somehow else.  It is every American adults responsibility to make sure kids are given the best lives possible.  Contaminating them because you are too weak and selfish to be considerate for those who cant protect themselves is what a patriot looks like.  A true patriot anyway..."
2021-09-13 20:38:29,"""Nincompoop crisis"" has a nice ring to it--and it's true. But it's also true that nincompoops who refuse the vaccine are getting other people sick and some of those people are dying, like a 4 year old this week whose parents refused the vaccine and who didn't take her to the doctor immediately when she got sick. She died in her sleep that night through no fault of her own.  Now her mother says, "" I wish I got the shot.""  Too little, too late.  I understand regret after a child dies, because I lost one, but he died due to an accident when he was driving, not because I failed him as a little one. This child deserved more of a shot at life. Line up, nincompoops, and get your shots. The life you save may be your own."
2021-09-13 20:52:48,"Brett, I'm surprised you're so clueless about masks and vaccines. Sure they may protect us, but the big idea is they protect others from us. And if you're so worried about people being forced to vaccinate or test, how about the rest of us, the majority, forced to be at risk because of anti-vaxxers? The coercion cuts one way or another, and you seem to favor those who would risk the well-being of all the rest of us for no good reason."
2021-09-13 21:12:37,"Unfortunately you have politicians like DeSantis, Abbott, and others playing politics with the health of children to please a certain ex-president and no matter what will not get on board with the rest of us who want this thing to be over yesterday.

Add to that our ""alternative facts"" world, where everyone is suddenly an epidemiologist, constitutional law scholar, or both. And worse yet, you have public servants elected to serve the public health and the public good, often with stellar academic credentials and who know better, playing stupid...again, for political advantage. 

No wonder the president is at the end of his rope. A majority of the country is as well. 

And as others have pointed out here, no one is being tied to a chair and stuck with a needle. But if you aren't willing to do your part and no compelling reason exists for you not to, then prepare to live with the consequences. We all make choices.

It's not that complicated."
2021-09-13 21:18:40,"Bret: Even George Washington recognized he needed to mandate getting his troops inoculated against smallpox. ""Buoyed by the success of the mandate, Washington wrote to his brother in June 1777 that he was upset by a Virginia law restricting inoculations.

2021-09-13 20:43:57,"Politics and politicians have been messing with COVID and not the other way round. That is 1 of the reasons why In a new Sep. review, some F.D.A. scientists and others say boosters aren’t needed for the general population contrary to the position of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). My publication in July suggesting need for more studies on boosters was met with the resistance from the top brass of the NIAID. I was asked to publish a disclaimer indicating what the NIAID position is. The Disclaimer which will appear in the amended version of the publication basically is as follows 

Delaying vaccination by individuals who were naturally infected 
with SARS-CoV-2 in order to follow antibody levels does not reflect the opinion of a distinguished NIAID investigator and  to my knowledge that of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). 

The sole purpose of vaccinating an individual who cleared the COVID infection would be to boost immunity and therefore it is an attempt to ignore the immunity acquired through natural infection. The natural immunity acquired maybe variable and some may have not acquired immunity quantitatively better than the immunity acquired by average vaccinated person and I get it and therefore I advocate for testing of antibody levels before considering a booster. Certainly those with genetic or acquired immunodeficiencies need not be tested and could be given boosters but most DO NOT need boosters."
2021-09-13 20:50:13,"Bret,  FYI- from your own news station...

Their Crisis’ Is ‘Our Problem’: Washington Grapples With Idaho Covid Cases
Hospitals in Washington State, already strained, are taking on an influx of Covid patients from Idaho, where the governor has refused to require masks or vaccinations."
2021-09-13 21:04:12,Republicans and others who are all up in arms about mandatory covid vaccines don't seem to have any problem requiring employees or recipients of any kind of meager public assistance to be tested for drugs.
2021-09-13 21:09:14,"Over and over, seeming intelligent people like Bret get masks backwards. We don’t wear masks to protect ourselves, we wear masks to protect others. “There are people, particularly the immunocompromised, (for whom we need) to take great precautions, including (wearing) masks”. Stop letting Republicans flip this issue! The GOP plays silly games by claiming “it should be up to concerned parents to decide if their kids wear masks”. If it was up to concerned parents, they’d insist that everyone else wear a mask. That’s what protects their kids!"
2021-09-13 21:30:32,"If your actions spread disease and make other people ill, then it isn't about free choice."
2021-09-13 21:59:00,"Bret, you are wrong, wrong, wrong. We are in the middle of a global pandemic emergency, the consequences of which may kill you if you are not vaccinated. The President, any President has the moral obligation to protect their nation. Vaccines have proven worthwhile at saving lives. They should be mandated. No one objects to having their children vaccinated in order to attend school, yet those who choose not to be vaccinated are showing a selfish disregard to their fellow citizens. Their right to not be vaccinated ends where my right to have a safe life begins."
2021-09-13 20:32:36,These Republican governors are hypocrites. They are vaccinated and want to oppose vaccine mandates. How long do they want the pandemic to last? The anti-vaxxers are also hypocrites. They'll put hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin in their bodies instead of a vaccine. When will the insanity end?
2021-09-13 20:45:47,"A man and his family was looking for an ICU bed this weekend.  It was in Alabama and they called 43 hospitals. Finally, they found a bed 200 miles away.  He was 71.  He died because he got to that ICU bed too late."

2021-09-13 21:28:05,Trying to use reason and logic on the anti-vaxxers is a complete waste of time.  It would be like trying to convince QAnon that the government wasn't out to get them.
2021-09-13 21:49:42,"No, I don't understand the reasoning of Republican ""civil libertarians."" According to Bret, it's up to individuals to decide what goes into or onto their bodies when it comes to this vaccine and wearing a mask in public. They don't seem to understand that the protective measures are not just for their own benefit. Yet these same individualists claim the right to tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies, in the case of unwanted pregnancies (under any conditions), although it's none of their business--can't catch pregnancy. All I'm hearing at this point are mega-reasons to get rid of the whole ""states rights"" idiocy."
2021-09-13 20:47:35,Vaccines are for self-protection.  Masks are for self-protection and the protection of others.  Simple enough?

2021-09-13 22:26:38,"""refuse to allow Medicare or Medicaid to pay their medical bills in the event they become seriously ill. Private health insurers might also follow suit. ""
Why not? This is what pet insurance companies do. If you don't get your cat vaccinated, they won't pay the bills if he gets sick!"
2021-09-13 20:47:16,"Looking purely at the statistics, it's easy to think that Republicans would rather kill off their electorate than have them vaccinated...or wear a mask, even if it means saving their children under 12 years of age.
It's also no surprise that these largely Red-leaning states, who mainly give creedence to conservative right-wing media (and Donald Trump), are also experiencing some of the highest infection and mortality rates -- as they continue to rant against ""big government"" while depending on federal assistance, by way of military mobile units to treat the infected and refrigerated trucks to contain the dead.
Apparently there's no end to their hypocrisy or worse, this pandemic."
2021-09-13 20:51:32,Shouldn’t the title read: Politics ( and politicians) aren’t done messing with Covid??
2021-09-13 21:10:11,"Brett: ""Otherwise, I don’t see the latest Covid spike as the same kind of issue it was a year or so ago. It’s gone from being a public-health crisis to a nincompoop-health crisis.""

This ""nincompoop"" crisis is starting to affect people who need emergency care who do not have COVID. Every day there's another story about someone who had a heart attack or the like and couldn't get in because the hospital didn't have room.

And Washington State is now taking COVID overflow from Northern Idaho because Idaho has been so lax about vaccines and masks.

I'm not saying nincompoops shouldn't get treated...I just want them to realize it's not all about them. We are a society of many people and we should all take some responsibility for each other."
2021-09-13 21:16:19,"""It’s too early to say that the Biden presidency has failed. But people who wish the president success — and that includes me — need to grasp the extent to which he’s in deep political trouble......I think he has misread his political mandate, which was to be a moderate, unifying leader in the mold of George Bush Sr., not a transformational one in the mold of Lyndon Johnson.""  The mandate was to be sane, to make the best decisions for the good of the country as a whole, in short, to do everything the other dude wasn't doing.  By that measure, Biden has not just done well, he'd been courageous.  He's making very difficult, politically risky decisions because he feels strongly that it's for the greater good.  Whether or not he's correct, we'll find out, but I for one am glad he's leading bravely, not hiding in a corner trying to be inoffensive moderate during times that demand courage and action."
2021-09-13 21:40:11,"So Bret thinks that Biden is a failed president because he yanked us out of a costly and nearly interminable GOP Neocon boon-doggle, is responsible for the inflation caused by Trump’s tariffs that are the cause of significant price increases on thousands of consumer goods and must also take the blame for not ending a pandemic that is getting worse by the day precisely because Bret’s party’s nihilistic adherents refuse to get a simple vaccination?
Wheeew! That’s quite a stretch, even for a giraffe!"
2021-09-13 20:28:51,More un-vaccinated people means more chances for mutations.  This puts us all at risk. Not vaccinating is more than just a personal choice. It's not just the 'nincompoops' in danger. Why is this so difficult to follow?
2021-09-13 21:06:06,"My grand-kids can get infected by another student, teacher or bus driver or cafeteria worker and become very ill or even die. You do not have the right to impose that on my grand-kids Bret. Of course living in Iowa, their school is rural and my grand-kids get mocked for wearing their masks at school. Your disgust with trump and all that he stood for, which led you to vote for Biden and even embrace some Liberal Policies has waned more and more the further out we get from the Election. I am really sick of the right claiming they know anything about debt and deficits and the ever popular ""personal responsibility"". Instead of implying ""The busybodies and virtue-signalers"" are just too much for you to handle or actually make up the bulk of people that are vaccinated. You should exert some personal responsibility and applaud any kind of mandate that will ""make"" people get vaccinated even if they don't want to in order to slow the infection and killing of our fellow citizens. Then the worst part is the anti-vaxxers suddenly willing to listen to doctors and nurses as they overflow hospitals across the country you don't seem to believe is the main issue, it is. I could go on about how you continue to return back to the old, stale mantra of the right, even though it has been exposed for what it really stands for but no doubt, you are missing more than a few things."

Typhoid Mary traveled around spreading typhoid and many died because she did not do the social responsible actions NOT to infect others. Pres. Biden is taking the same approach. Those that do not vaccinate need to be vaccinate because they are not being socially responsible."
2021-09-13 20:35:27,"Re: Vaccines -- Biden and the left need to change their messaging. It's not ""Do it for America"" or ""Do it so we can all go back to normal"" or the implied by the right ""Do it so I look good as president"", it's ""Do it for yourself (and maybe) your family."""
2021-09-13 21:25:04,"I think Gail is too passive in this ""conversation"" and let Brett got away with all sorts of false/semi-truth claims. Gail, if this supposes to be a conversation, then there needs to be back and forth, push-back, and arguments. Not just let what Brett said go unchallenged and slid by. If the conversation is so tame, we might as well read individual columns from both of you."
2021-09-13 21:18:31,"So, please Brett, call me a busybody and ""virtue signaler"" for wearing a mask when out and about! Fact is, I'm at high risk, vaccinated, and just careful. But no, Brett has to get his silly Libertarian digs in. In the midst of raising infection rates in so many states, he has to go the ""virtue signaling"" route regarding the folks who are still just being responsible. I find Brett to be increasingly petulant and testy. How can Gail restrain herself when he goes off, as he so often does?"
2021-09-13 22:05:46,"i like the GOP argument they dont want the goverment to go against their choice, the sanctity of their body. 

are they pro choice?

2021-09-13 21:48:58,"While I probably agree more with Gail, than you, Bret, thank you for speaking out in a more liberal paper. I like to hear different opinions to get a broader insight into things.

And that's the problem. There are many conservative Biden voters who feel that way, but also many progressive Biden voters who feel the exact opposite. No matter what he does, it's not going to be possible to please everyone. But to defeat Donald Trump in '24, people from both wings have to vote for him."
2021-09-13 23:56:59,"Politics Isn't Finished Messing with Covid

TFTFY

In fact, politics would mess with a grain of sand if the politician(s) involved thought they could gain an advantage, no matter how small.

Speaking of small, doesn't the average politician of either party strike you as being quite a bit smaller than the average politician of 40-60 years ago? Average pols certainly present themselves that way to me.

For quite some time now, potential politicians with something meaningful to offer have been driven away by the spectacle of contemporary politics, not to mention the fact that, year after year, so little of lasting value actually gets done. As a nation, we are dumbing ourselves down while electing politicians who are more than happy to take advantage of the fact."
2021-09-13 23:39:40,"Maybe the wrong forum to advertise other opinions, but since Bret Stevens was mentioned, perhaps relevant.  In a piece titled ""Forget About Biden's 'Cruel Summer' - He's Doing Big Things"", David Rothkopf and Bernard Schwartz try to put a little perspective down.  Noting where we were just a few months ago, in public health, economic and political crisis, topped off with an unprecedented attack on our country by our own leader and the fascist mobs he provoked in an attempted autogolpe, they laid down the facts of where we are now:
An actual vaccine distribution plan, 200 million vaccinated and a new bold push to crush the new variants.
The American Rescue Plan cut poverty in half.
More jobs created in 8 months than 12 years of Bush and Trump combined, economic growth at 'remarkable' 6.5%.
Re-prioritizing climate change.
Appointing judges faster than his predecessors.
The most diverse cabinet in history.
Ending the 'forever war' in Afghanistan.
Swift aid for Americans beset by fires, floods and hurricanes.
Finally investing in infrastructure with bipartisan agreement, plus the BBB plan that together represent the biggest investment in America in almost a century.
And more.
And yet, they note, here is the NYT publishing a 'divorced from reality' headline (by Bret Stevens) about Biden's failed presidency, among other mainstream outlets questioning his competency and trumpeting his 'mistakes'.
I am glad Mr. Stevens walked it back a little bit here.  More would be better."
2021-09-13 23:42:42,"Right on Gail. Accentuate the positive. 

Bret? You talk about opening your mind but I think it would be prudent to open it...a bit further. For instance, I know if we were discussing polio you wouldn't hesitate to join the mandate bandwagon.  It only one life were saved this would be worth mandates...but we're not talking about one life we're talking thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives saved. 

Meanwhile, Joe Biden plows on. Thinking only of how to best save lives. That's the great thing about this president. He takes the hits for doing what's right. We all know Biden's his all for us. Bret too. Only he won't admit it."

The unvaxxed crowd makes lots of others pay for their “freedom.” Imagine having surgery for your brain tumor delayed because some “nincompoop” from another state couldn’t be bothered to get a vaccine."
2021-09-13 23:49:50,"Bret - back in the late 40’s and 1950s we children lined up to be vaccinated for mumps, rubella, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, and never made a squawk. Mom and dad did not protest, but we’re pleased that we got protected from illnesses that in their childhood killed. Sissy."
2021-09-13 22:54:56,Rephrasing... Politics isn't finished messing with COVID.
2021-09-13 22:57:52,I   wonder if Brett knows or even reads Charles Blow .
2021-09-13 22:34:32,"Why does it seem that Republicans are such hypocrites? That’s easy, just look at Bret’s comments here. Regarding Covid, Republicans don’t want the government telling Americans what they can and can’t do with their bodies. OK.

But when it comes to outawing abortion, Republicans are ALL FOR the government telling American women what they can and can’t do with their bodies. They are so easy to troll with the obvious it’s not even the slightest fun!"
2021-09-14 00:21:05,"I'm growing weary of the Bret and Gail show.  Bret and Gail, having a folksy little cutesy little argument across the proverbial aisle about Covid and politics and vaccinations.  Friends, this is not cute and it's not funny.  People are dying in the thousands and thousands, in our country alone.  As folks have attested in these comments, serious surgeries are being delayed and health care resources are stretched thin.  And the biological, economic, psychological, environmental, etc. health of our society is at stake.  The reader comments on societal selfishness are spot on.  Bret Stephens won a Pulitzer Prize?  This is the best we can do in terms of measured debate?  We're supposed to chuckle when the term ""nincompoop"" is used by an ""intellectual libertarian,"" apparently for some kind of comic relief?  I find it appalling, embarrassing and pathetic.  And truly sad."
2021-09-14 00:55:44,"Rather than policies to directly prod people into getting vaccinated, Bret would prefer to prolong the crisis and expose more vulnerable people to the risk of infection by pursuing a policy of denying coverage to sick people who make the wrong choice... because it's more ""elegant."" 

Thank goodness Biden has the courage to pursue an inelegant solution."
2021-09-14 01:31:55,"I'm just staring at the comment about how the latest C19 spike isn't a public health crisis and wondering if the writer has managed to miss stories of full hospitals and ICUs not only meaning elective (AKA won't immediately die if not right this minute, NOT cosmetic surgery) surgeries are being postponed, and things like someone dying after 43 hospitals are asked and don't have room to deal with that person's cardiac  event, or the guy who died of gallstones for want of ICU space. 

Northern Idaho went to crisis care standards a few days back.

This is absolutely a public health crisis.  Not all states are slammed right now, but the ones who are, you don't want to risk a car accident or a heart attack.  Or cancer."
2021-09-13 18:54:49,"Good god, Brett. A nincompoop crisis? Really?

I feel like I should hardly have to remind anyone that those nincompoops are not merely endangering themselves but costing others their lives and their livelihoods. We could have avoided all this by issuing vaccine mandates months ago, except that people like Bret insisted that Biden not do anything so divisive.

Speaking of divisive, how would we describe a columnist who is calling the Biden presidency ""failed"" a little more than half a year into it?

Biden is doing everything he can to fight the pandemic, but he's being undermined by Republicans who see it as being to their political advantage. He's taking the blame for the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations' mistakes in Afghanistan. He's governing in a way that is not liberal enough for some, too activist for others: in other words, from the middle.

You want to call that failure? Biden's been underestimated his whole career, and you're doing it again."
2021-09-14 01:21:22,"To the collective shame of the Republican Party COVID is most assuredly not done with politics, and they'd have it no other way. Whether it's Republican members of congress or Republican state officials barking about mask mandates, vaccine mandates or vaccine passports, they just couldn't be less credible or more silly if they were paid to be. The only reason they are on the wrong side of COVID is because they know that is ground being ceded by Democrats so what better way to take the wrong side and hope like hell that the three legged mule wins an upset at the Kentucky Derby."
2021-09-14 01:04:54,"My polls show Liz Cheney's star rising in the Philly metro area 'cause I seem to be seeing more and more professional, suburban women sporting the Liz Cheney 'look'."
2021-09-14 01:14:04,"Bret - First- What planet are you on?  Covid's ""gone from being a public-health crisis to a nincompoop-health crisis'??? Hospitals and doctors will treat patients - even if they are stupid or arrogant  - but we are all paying the cost of stupid and arrogant these days. Go to Idaho - Kootenai Hospital up North is on triage care - selective care.  They are not doing surgeries for brain cancer - (sure that's an elective Bret) and hospitals in the nice masking state next door (Washington) are being overwhelmed taking these Idaho maskless sick fools.  19 months and counting Docs and Nurses and experts are leaving in droves because they are exhausted, AND fed up with risking their lives in treating arrogant and selfish deniers of science or the common good!  

You write, ""I understand doctors and nurses under a lot of strain.""  That's the most tragic understatement of the year. I dare you to sit next to a person struggling to breathe for 5 minutes, or 5 hours or 16 hours as some dedicated professionals are doing and not scream in the hallways or develop PTSD.  This is crazy-making - we've asked these professionals to fix something BIG - that a SMALL act of personal responsibility could fix and WE ARE ALL PAYING.  

Frankly, I'm tired of the democrats cleaning up the Rpub created messes and then getting blamed when it's costly.  Trump and his GOP are the real crisis - a clear and present ""danger to democracy and national sanity"" - and that's not nincompoop. It's criminal sedition."
2021-09-14 00:41:23,"Sorry, Bret, but Prop 187 was NOT, in any way, shape or form, an ""anti-immigrant"" stance.  It was specifically, and narrowly, and anti-ILLEGAL-immigrant stance.

There's a humongous difference when you add the word ""illegal.""  And yes, immigrants can be illegal.  As in, they don't have permission to enter the US.

This is the biggest lie the Democrats tell.  No person has the unlimited right to enter the US and live here.  No other western democracy allows it, either, for those of you that idolize Europe.

Try moving to Canada...or Australia....or England.....ain't gonna happen.

This, along with demonizing wealth, is where the Democrats lose me.  I can't abide your jealousy and your inability to understand that citizenship is important, and meaningful."
2021-09-14 00:43:43,"Gail and Bret...

Reading your column is like seeing Mike Nichols & Elaine May in action...beautifully witty and entertains yet thought provoking...

I agree with the Medicare / Medicaid approach.  It is not unreasonable.  Life insurance  companies “rate” certain policies, that is, require additional premium where risk is present in the proposed insured...heart disease, etc.  Years ago, policies were rated over “morals”!

I’m fully vaccinated and still wear a mask.  My wish is that my fellow citizens who are hesitant...think positively and get vaccinated.  And whether or not you do, be safe not sick!"
2021-09-14 00:53:15,Bret seems unaware that elective surgery includes almost all surgical procedures for cancer? Why? Because the definition of elective surgery is merely any procedure that is scheduled in advance. There have been untold numbers of cancer patients who have had to wait for their elective surgeries (and hope their cancers don't spread) because of the selfishness of the unvaccinated.  Many cancer patients will no doubt die. A national disgrace. Shame on the unvaccinated!!
2021-09-14 01:03:20,"Bret's last suggestion is beyond hilarious, but right on the mark!"
2021-09-14 00:39:15,"Err, Bret, anti-vaxxers are putting more than themselves at serious risk. They're the reason the virus doesn't move on. Covid is still hanging around and replicating in all those vulnerable people--and, inevitably, mutating. This pandemic should have been over by now."
2021-09-14 00:34:54,"just another fight in the endless 'culture war'.
when will it end? 
when there are no more fighters left. 
think about that."
2021-09-14 00:34:48,"30% of new infections in heavily vaccinated Massachusetts are among the vaccinated (breakthrough). Of those people, about 1 in 50 are hospitalized, and 1 in 250 die. 

Although those numbers are much smaller than the unvaccinated, this isn't just about saving the nincompoops. This is still a significant risk to people who have done the right thing by getting vaccinated. I wouldn't care one bit if the vaccine gave me 100% immunity forever, but it does not, so those nincompoops are directly affecting my health in addition to theirs."
2021-09-14 00:57:34,Problem is some folks drive drunk without a seatbelt. Both actions are against the law. Both could kill the driver and others. Sadly this is being done in the name of freedom.
2021-09-14 00:34:54,"I expected more comments to say, “but actually Biden even gave anti-vaxxers a loophole to get tested a mere once a week to continue coming to work.” Doctors on CNN etc disagree with the loophole, and I think it should be at least more frequent and mask mandates for the unvaccinated, but people don’t seem to have picked up on the fact that it’s not much of a mandate really."
2021-09-02 10:21:29,"The insurance companies finally almost have it right. If a person can get vaccinated, but refuses for non-medical reasons, they should pay full costs for testing and hospitalization; while we are free to break the social contract, we are also free to pay the costs of doing so. 
But for people who cannot get vaccinated, or for vaccinated people who get breakthrough infections that require treatment, there should be complete coverage; follow the rules to protect yourself and others, and society should have your back, not kick you in the gut."
2021-09-02 10:33:12,"""The new policies generally apply to all patients, including the vaccinated; people who get sick with a breakthrough infection; and children under 12, who are not yet eligible for the vaccine.""

It seems the Sackler Family--and/or their ilk--have taken their seats at the medical insurance table. 

It's one thing to bill those who refuse the vaccine, but it is entirely different to bill those who cannot be vaccinated as well as those who have been vaccinated."
2021-09-02 11:02:17,Healthcare is a commodity traded in the market. The USA needs a universal healthcare system. Medicare for all.
2021-09-02 11:41:50,"""The new policies generally apply to all patients, including the vaccinated; people who get sick with a breakthrough infection; and children under 12, who are not yet eligible for the vaccine.""

I believe that people who are willfully unvaccinated should pay higher insurance premiums. The right to choose to refuse the vaccine (now fully FDA approved) comes with responsibilities.

I am a smoker. I pay over $100 extra for my employer health insurance plan. That is fair."
2021-09-02 12:03:18,"i am curious what has happened to all of the hospital bills that have been waived up to this point.

Did the hospitals or insurers absorb the cost or share it? With 20 million unemployed at the early stages, there were certainly many who either migrated to subsidized ACA plans and maybe some who continued paying big premiums for COBRA. 

In any case, it seems likely that health insurance  open enrollment this winter might come with premium sticker shock."
2021-09-02 11:36:41,"You can walk into one of hundreds of pharmacies here in Rome and get a rapid Covid test for 22 euros--price set by law. And you can be sure they are making a profit. One can only imagine the price gouging in the U.S. with its Darwinian healthcare system, pedaled by lobbyists and their captured politicians as ""freedom."" $200 for a Covid test! Land of suckers..."
2021-09-02 10:25:03,What are the red  state governors and the Retrumplican Party to do without money from the federal government being pumped in to help insurance companies pay for COVID?  Now the great vaccination sabotage  by the Retrumplican Party will have to face the consequences of their insanity.   They will have to reckon with the insurance companies themselves.
2021-09-02 10:40:02,"Can someone please explain to me how someone with halfway decent /legitimate health insurance would suffer financially by getting Covid? Legitimate treatment for Covid-19 is standard and should be 100% covered. Unless maybe someone is opting for some wacky off-label use of livestock meds or drinking bleach, their treatment should be covered. Indeed, I believe even people stupid enough to drink bleach to treat Covid would have their injuries from doing so covered. So what's the problem?"
2021-09-02 10:31:12,"It's going to get to the point that if you don't get vaccinated, it's going to cost you, in one way or the other.  That's good too!"
2021-09-02 12:13:17,"It is more then reasonable for insurance companies to no longer cover COVID treatment.  In those states where emergency rooms are overflowing with unvaccinated patients there should be an additional fee added to admission fee for the cost that the government paid for the vaccine doses the patient refused to accept to cover their full vaccination.  That amount is  anywhere from  $30 to $40, which seems like nothing but at the end of a month could add up to a substantial amount when it comes to maintaining an overwhelmed hospital."
2021-09-02 12:11:30,"Anti-vaxxers should have remembered the old sayings.

""You snooze. You lose."" For some it will be ever worse. ""He who hesitates is lost."""
2021-09-02 12:11:59,"“But more of the tests sought now don’t meet the definition of “medical reason” and are instead for monitoring.”

I was hoping that all the Covidiocy would end with Trump’s exit, but allowing the private insurers who have benefited greatly from new government subsidies to begin charging for the testing and treatment during the Delta variant surge is so reminiscent of Trump’s mishandling of the crisis."
2021-09-02 10:44:33,"It is so unjust and financially devastating for these people who have been hospitalised with COVID-19 or require testing to be hit with very large bills for their medical care.
COVID-19 is still a world pandemic and case numbers are growing rapidly throughout the world with the Delta variant. There are still break through infections in vaccinated people, which may require medical care or hospitalisation in some cases.
US citizens should not be treated as a unit of profit by private hospitals and private healthcare insurers.
This shameful treatment of COVID-19 patients and the payments demanded for COVID-19 testing, demonstrates the desperate need for tax payer funded universal healthcare for everyone, like the NHS. This is not socialism, it is just plain common sense."
2021-09-02 12:31:03,"In my primary care office, many patients test prior to travel, particularly to overseas destinations, where a negative PCR test within 72 hours is required by many countries.  Others test prior to family gatherings (in the era of Delta, somewhat risky).  Previously, such routine testing has been covered by insurance under the waivers introduced at the beginning of the pandemic.  Now, this is an uncovered benefit.  Patients are surprised when we ask them to pay (our fee is a very reasonable $90, not $200 or more charged by other facilities)."
2021-09-02 12:51:24,"I am 100% fine with insurers no longer covering for free the costs of hospitalization for COVID patients.  We have a very effective, safe and 100% FREE medication that helps to prevent severe illness and hospitalization.  Is it the way out of this pandemic.  Those that don't take it are making a choice.  If their choice has financial consequences, that is on them."
2021-09-02 12:55:10,"Of the 33 developed nations, only one refuses to adopt universal healthcare - the US.

I used to say this made the US look like a third world country. Hard to say that these days. Since 2000 (as part of the Millennium Development project aimed at eradicating poverty) the UN / WHO has been helping nations establish universal healthcare, so now roughly half the nations of the world have universal healthcare.

The UN’s success of the rollout has made them issue a new target: all nations should have universal healthcare by 2035. 

Will the US become the last country to implement it?"
2021-09-02 13:07:57,"At this point the unvaccinated should be held fully accountable for the full cost of their ""freedom"".  No insurance reimbursement whatsoever, no life insurance benefits."
2021-09-02 13:19:58,"If I was vaccinated and my kid was hospitalized after being exposed to Covid in a school system that didn’t require masking for kids or vaccination for eligible adults, I’d sue that system for my share of the costs. Or in the case of a system in a state where the governor had forbidden such mandates, I’d sue the governor.

Unvaccinated adults, however, should absolutely bear a portion—or all, if uninsured— of the cost of their treatment in the same way that they would for anything else."
2021-09-02 13:23:51,So we get the vaccine. Fantastic. What about the millions of other diseases that can bankrupt us in just one bill? Even having insurance isn't a guarantee. All it takes is a billing error and the patient's financial standing is over. United Healthcare once billed me $224 for an approved tetanus vaccine! It took me months of wrangling to get the charge removed. Our for-profit healthcare system must be abolished.
2021-09-02 13:41:51,"I don’t see why insurers should keep picking up the whole tab for people who refuse to get vaccinated, and I don’t see why it’s so out there to expect the insured to pay a fraction of what it cost to save their life.

I do look forward to hearing the likes of Ron de Santis explain the bills."
2021-09-02 13:58:48,"If someone's child is eligible for vaccination but is not vaccinated, of course the cost of testing should not be covered by insurance.  But if the child has been vaccinated, is symptom free and is only tested because of school requirements, then the school (and ultimately the taxpayers in the community), not the child's parents or their medical insurance company should foot the bill."
2021-09-02 14:04:05,Covid testing should continue to be performed without cost but at this point it's only fair to have unvaccinated adults pay for all Covid-related treatment in hospitals and elsewhere.  Those costs should never be passed along in the form of higher insurance premiums to those of us who've been vaccinated.
2021-09-02 14:54:53,"Insurance must cover all COVID test and should not require prior authorization as this is the duty of the healthcare system and a basic right of the patients. However, People who refuse COVID vaccination for no medical reason may have to pay for medical care as they are putting themselves and others at risk."
2021-09-02 15:05:25,"ALL expenses have been getting bigger since COVID.

The cost of rent, food, insurance, gas, medicine and medical care only continues to increase.  And if the rise in price isn't bad enough, there continues to be shortages upon shortages.

I keep thinking that the almost 50% of this country who still refuses to get vaccinated only added to this virus growing almost out of control since this past spring.  That little piece of ""freedom of choice"" has resulted in price hikes across the board, for EVERYONE.  And we all know - the moment something costs more, that cost rarely goes back down.   

In the meantime, my wages haven't increased in over three years . . . 

I doubt I am alone in this financial raft, trying to hang on."
2021-09-02 15:23:30,"As a European transplant I've found American health insurance very generous on prevention (often fully covered), acceptable on non-emergencies but problematic in emergencies especially when it involves an ambulance taking one to the nearest hospital. 

Vaccines greatly reduce the risk of ending up in the latter scenario. I shed no tears for recalcitrant anti-vaxxers, but I fear for communities of color who have not gotten the vaccine because of rightful (e.g. financial) distrust in the healthcare system."
2021-09-02 15:50:27,"Passing on the costs to those who could have gotten vaccinated, but chose not to, seems fair. They made a choice. They should be prepared for the consequences of their choice.

Charging covid19 hospital costs for those who cannot get vaccinated or have serious break-through infections seems cruel and unreasonable.  There is a huge population of essential-learners aged 6-12 who have no access to the vaccine yet. Their health is already at risk.  It seems cruel to add the risk that they could bankrupt their families."
2021-09-02 16:17:19,"With hospitals around the country at the breaking point, unvaccinated patients are choosing to add to their burden. It is only right that they should pay up. Maybe that will change their minds, but I'm not hopeful."
2021-09-02 16:24:24,"Freedom always comes at a price. Those that elect not to get vaccinated for other than medical reasons as advised by their physician should pay for any Covid treatments, hospitalization and or testing. When the disease is raging as a result of the unvaccinated they need to bear the burden and responsibility for their decision."
2021-09-02 16:38:53,People who engage in risky behaviors pay more for insurance....whether it's multiple speeding tickets or smoking.  People who refuse vaccinations should also expect to pay higher insurance costs. It's their choice.
2021-09-02 17:34:13,The Governor of Florida should pay the covid-19 hospitalization bills out of his own pocket.
2021-09-02 11:43:09,"So, the American healthcare system is back to the full on grift. 

Honestly, it was weird knowing that if I got sick from COVID, the medical costs would be covered (aside from the inevitable attempts, some documented in the Times, to “doctor” the bill to get me to pay more somehow- pun intended).

During a pandemic, Democrats voted in their primaries to pick the guy who promised to veto Medicare for all. 

And the Republics? trump’s “very best” healthcare plan to replace Obamacare should be available any week now.

With the vaccines and new treatments, it seems we can finally, mostly fix COVID. 

But we still can’t fix stupid."
2021-09-02 15:35:22,The survivors of long COVID may just try to get help at the local ER. What is the legal situation?
2021-09-02 17:37:57,"Qanoon, Republican governors need to get the medical bill invoices for their victims of Covid-19."
2021-09-02 17:00:42,"I remember when the NY Times dropped its paywall for coronavirus coverage for the public good. At some point, the NYT, too, decided that it's fair to go back to business as usual."
2021-09-02 13:30:45,"Not a thought as much as a question:

How are you folks enjoying Your Great American health system today?"
2021-09-02 17:19:19,"Yes. Surely now the people who oppose vaccines and supposedly want small government will expect the government to give them a handout and pay their medical bills. These people are not naive, they are duplicitous, selfish, and greedy and deserve to be treated as such."
2021-09-02 13:10:17,"If you elect to not get vaccinated, you should have to cover your own costs, that may be the only way for us to reach herd immunity and the vaccinated should not have to pay for their foolish actions.  For those who are stuck with these enormous medical bills because they were just too ""smart"" to get vaccinated, remember you reap what you sow."
2021-09-02 13:26:34,"Let' go over it again for the umpteenth time imo.

Let us get a national, affordable, quality health care system like just about all our peer countries have instead of the de facto criminal one (pre ACA) we have now.

Democrats, eschew identity/social engineering and make this the number one issue in the next elections. It is even popular in purple and some red states. 

It is a winner."
2021-09-02 13:28:49,Good Smokers pay more insurance and these people should too.
2021-09-02 14:42:05,Those trillions of borrowed dollars spent on The War About Nothing in Iraq and The Forever War in Afghanistan would sure coming in handy now.
2021-09-02 15:06:55,"Unlike tests - which should be kept low cost - the treatment for  infected anti-vaxxers (not breakthrough cases) should be sky high. Indeed, those people - if adults - shouldn't even be treated. just made to self-quarantine to avoid killing other people."
2021-09-02 17:37:26,"if this goes to it's logical conclusion, then unvaccinated people who get sick  and survive are going to be on the hook for 6 figure hospital bills, unfortunately.

Better to get the free vaccine and save your life"
2021-09-02 13:51:42,"Yes. For profit insurance companies are going to want to recoup their loses just like any other company having to answer to Wall St. & their investors.  Those unvaccinated should certainly pay for their treatment and not impact those within their 'insurance pool.'  This is a smokers vs. non-smokers issue and insurance companies already have the rate structure in place for that as well as for 'young drivers' for those who are too young to be vaccinated.  

However, what's not mentioned is the amount of money we are ALL paying for the unvaxed Medicare/Medicaid group in the ICUs.  You can GUARANTEE, a certain group of political candidates and party are going to have a platform which berates the other side for the excessive increase in costs & how THEY would have saved money, even though they're the ones pushing the $1,500 a shot Regeneron.  Although according to 2020 NYT article: ""In November, the federal government waived co-payments for the cost of administering the treatment for people covered by Medicare.""   ---- As my late Mother used to say: ""Even the ladies of the street don't give it away for free darlin'. SOMEONE always pays."" ----- That someone would be YOU if you pay taxes."
2021-09-02 17:28:36,"Our jacked up health care system is breaking apart. One reason so many refuse to get vaccinated, insured, wear a mask etc is because of their experience with this system. Outrageous costs for meds or procedures, bankruptcies, a byzantine system of billing, incompetent practitioners, you name it. Big pharma and the opiate tragedy in our country is only one example of how much contempt people have for our health care system. Not for profit is the only cure."
2021-09-02 16:40:07,Feel so sorry for my US friends.   They have been duped into believing people don't deserve universal healthcare - unlike the rest of the civilized world. Makes you wonder if the US is civilized.  So sad. Prayers are with you folks.
2021-09-02 12:53:52,The way to influence most people is through their wallets.
2021-09-02 16:33:37,I would charge non vaccinated the full cost of their case.  Their “freedom” comes at a price
2021-09-02 19:00:33,I would like to see free care continue for vaccinated people and the kids who are not yet allowed to vaccinate.
2021-09-02 12:52:22,"With one exception, the anti-vaxx spreadnecks that I know are on Medicare/Medicaid, so their medical costs will be substantially underwritten by taxpayers. I must admit to amusement, though, when contemplating the “I got my rights” crowd opening their medical bills. Explanation of billing: “Consequences of your actions.”"
2021-09-02 16:17:16,"Always remember this before you wade out without a mask on. Preventing this is about $10-$30. Treating it may knock you out of a lifetime of savings or even your house. So choose wisely.

Lots of ""leaders"" right now just telling you to go ahead and get sick and let their expensive treatments take care of it. Bad advice."
2021-09-02 14:43:05,The voluntarily unvaccinated (Anti-Vaccinators) should incur a surcharge for their medical insurance or be denied coverage for Covid-19 treatment. It was their free choice to remain unvaccinated and accept the risk of a serious illness that not only affects them but but those around them.
2021-09-02 13:13:44,"It's about time.  This fourth wave has been caused by the unvaccinated.  Let them pay for it.  Their decision, their liability.

It's not fair to not cover the under children under 12 since we don't have a vaccine yet.  But maybe that will be the impetus to stop these anti masking mandates.  Masks are highly effective at stopping the spread of Covid.  But then, if all adults who come into contact with kids were vaccinated, the danger to the kids would be eliminated.  

The insurance companies should stop paying for Regeneron for the unvaccinated.  DeSantis wants to set up Regeneron clinics as some kind of anti-vaccination policy.  Let the unvaccinated people have to pay for that and see how far it goes.  Get the shot."
2021-09-02 18:20:47,The unvaccinated should definitely pay more for their health insurance so those expenses are not passed on to those of us who got vaccinated.  They chose their freedom which means they are free to pay more for insurance and to die from COVID if that is what happens.

Surcharges for the willfully unvaccinated, by all means. But testing should remain free."
2021-09-02 19:30:53,I'm vaccinated.  I am a retired school teacher and educational supervisor.  Worked in education beginning in 1973 and retired in 2006.  It breaks my heart to see all these people putting their trust in fake treatments and a strange belief about the shot.  It feels to me that it is and was a monumental failure of the educational system.  This failure was not driven by professional educators but by elected school boards.  They often are too sensitive to some people and have their sights on higher office.
2021-09-02 19:33:09,"If you are able to get vaccinated and are not vaccinated, ALL costs should be yours to bear: Testing, hospitalization, including deductibles.

Under 12, unable to get vaccinated due to health, should be only exceptions.

If you are vaccinated, then testing and hospitalization should be covered. 

The U.S. insurance industry, businesses, and higher education schools, need to make life extremely expensive and inconvenient for the unvaccinated. 

Stop catering to these people."

2021-09-02 23:22:28,"Hardly seems an improvement in the insurance fairness factor.  

What would be fair is to increase premiums to those who simply refuse to be vaccinated.  The cost of treatment would be born by all those who put themselves at increased risk - not just the ones who get sick.  That's pretty much the objective of insurance: members of a group experience the average health-care cost for the group.

Instead, it seems, insurers are increasing the out-of-pocket cost for everyone, vaccinated or not.  It's no longer insurance, its punishment."

Insurance and any rate increase be decided by the insurance company?  Or is Delta so flush with assets that it self-insures (in which case maybe they ought lower ticket prices if they have so much money)?

Delta ought be very careful that it discerns, accurately, which employees are choosing to remain unvaccinated and which are unvaccinated due to contraindications presentes by a health condition, healthcare treatment, or a disability.  If Delta and similar companies fail to do that, they run a serious risk of being afoul of the ADA and state anti-discrimination laws.

I'd speculate that many of those refusing the vaccine are uninsured so charging them doesn't even enter into the picture.  It's just a complete loss for the hospital and any one else who offers aid. Small hospitals in rural areas that were already struggling will probably end up closing their doors over this. 

And those who use them lacking in critical thinking skills will question why."

The fear of massive backlash is the only thing that kept these companies from punishing whichever insured people they wanted.  Giving them the freedom to punish certain insureds will likely backfire on all of us.

2021-09-04 15:42:36,"According to Vanderbilt, the following are the only organised religions that refuse vaccination:

    Dutch Reformed Congregations - This denomination has a tradition of declining immunizations. Some members decline vaccination on the basis that it interferes with divine providence. However, others within the faith accept immunization as a gift from God to be used with gratitude.
    Faith healing denominations including:
    Faith Tabernacle
    Church of the First Born
    Faith Assembly
    End Time Ministrie
    Church of Christ, Scientist -  One of the basic teachings of this denomination is that disease can be cured or prevented by focused prayer and members will often request exemptions when available. However, there are not strict rules against vaccination and members can receive required vaccinations.

So, let's just not wave around 'religious exemptions' as much of a thing.  It's pretty much ""I don't wanna"" rather than ""G_d forbids me"".  As for the claim that there is an allergic reaction which everyone can claim to avoid - unless you have a history of anaphylaxis you do not risk an allergic reaction.  Even with that history, if you are going to react you will do so within 4 hours, and the reaction will be roughly equivalent to a bee sting.  So - sit in the doctor's office until it's clear you're either going to react - in which case the reaction will be treated before becoming threatening - or not react.  Pretty simple."
2021-09-05 13:10:01,"Reading the comments --there is understandable anger and call for insurers to not cover or charge higher rates for vaccine refusal. Part of that is I think a necessary emotional discharge for individuals who are rightfully enraged that vaccine-refusal has impacted their lives as well. Have not read any substantial actual movement happening to do so (Delta excepted), however.

The other side is a specious argument that somehow since insurance is instituting essentially usual costs for Covid care-- that other conditions that might involve behavior should be punished in some way. 

The truth is that medical costs are the largest driver for bankruptcy in the U.S. Insurance companies just charging usual and customary rates will continue to have significant impact on all individuals--statistics suggest that this will be highest for vaccine refusers all things being equal."

2021-09-06 00:45:18,"Do not know if the recent FDA Full Approval for Comirnaty on 8/23/21 has anything to do with this, but have written about the cost not being covered by insurance in the near future.
Comirnaty. If this is the same vaccine you received from Pfizer under the EUA, why is the FDA stating this:""Comirnaty has the same formulation as the FDA-authorized Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and can be used interchangeably to provide the COVID-19 vaccination series without presenting any safety or effectiveness concerns. The products are legally distinct with certain differences that do not impact safety or effectiveness.

There are no data available on the interchangeability of Comirnaty with either Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine or Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.

Individuals who have received one dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine should receive a second dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to complete the vaccination series."" 
We were told we could and it would be interchangeable  with these other products and some saying beneficial .

Please note: ""The products are legally distinct with certain differences that do not impact safety or effectiveness.""
So how can you then state: "" Comirnaty has the same formulation as the EUA vaccine.""

So why is Pfizer being given a 'Full Approval' on vaccination that many of us took on an EUA, that as the FDA states has 'differences' now?

Go to Reuters article and click on all the 'here's' and read what is stated. And the new releases stated after the previous."
2021-09-02 12:40:26,"While many here are celebrating this change as a punitive measure against the willfully unvaxxxed, it will cause plenty of people to avoid testing. This will help the virus to spread especially among the asymptomatic. Testing is necessary to stop uncontrolled spread.  

Not covering treatments and hospital care will cause people to defer treatment thus continuing to spread the virus. Since the most severe cases are among the unvaxxed, they will turn to “cures” like ivermectin. That will cause more deaths. I am frustrated by the willfully ignorant who are foiling our best attempts at ending this pandemic. I’m tired of all of it but these changes will not help, except helping insurance companies’ bottom lines."

2021-09-02 13:02:31,"When it comes to healthcare, Americans pay vastly more for everything, compared to the rest of the world, so why should covid be an exception? 

And if Americans don’t mind paying ridiculous prices for healthcare, which clearly they don’t otherwise they would have moved to a UHC system, then why would they mind paying extortionate prices for covid treatment? It’s just another affliction that can result in personal bankruptcy."
2021-09-02 20:04:42,"The healthcare industry has never subordinated profits to the health and well-being of society.  That's a given.  The blame on the private sector is misplaced.  The first target should be our elected representatives to act and ensure responsible members of an organized society are not punished along with those who feel no obligation of safeguarding their neighbors.  The taxpayers financed the university research that developed the mRNA procedure as well as the full cost for pharmaceuticals to apply that procedure to develop an effective vaccine. Responsible people should not be charged for the consequences of a vaccine that falls short of its original goal of complete immunity.  Also, this is a catastrophic event that his killed millions of people and not some run of the mill virus that inconveniences you with a runny nose and fever.  If the insurance companies want to pass the buck for consequential costs of a defective product (vaccine) then each of those bucks should first come out of the public funds received by the pharmaceuticals."
2021-09-06 03:29:01,"The vaccinated should not have to pay for testing or treatment, especially in areas where non vaccinated dominate. The vaxxed have done what we can to stop the spread. Unvaccinated, unmasked individuals need to pay for the burden they are passing around. Exceptions for those unvaccinated for medical reasons."
2021-09-06 05:28:18,"For the vaccinated some cost sharing will eventually need to be included.  It is rare than any illness is completely the fault of the patient rather than bad luck or bad genes. We pay for healthcare and insurance spreads the risk of high cost procedures.

But for the unvaccinated they have clearly made a decision. Insurance policies should provide notification that going unvaccinated represents an unacceptable risk and therefore coverage will be severely limited for illness likely resulting from going unvaccinated.  Driving Formula one racecars, skydiving, entering war zones.. these nullify your standard insurance coverage and require supplemental insurance. The same should be true for the unvaccinated."
2021-09-06 17:45:47,"Having read through a number of comments, I noticed two threads.  the first one is that a significant majority of us are fed up with the recalcitrance of the antivaxxers  and the second is that we want to punish them but haven't found a way to do it that accomplishes that goal.
Literally forcing them to undergo quarantine as I and my family had to do when I contracted the usual childhood illnesses is not feasible given the huge resistance to vaccination, masking and social distancing.
Chances are that most medical personnel will continue to treat all patients who show up until facilities become overwhelmed and the staffs will then go to triage.  We will all suffer.  Those of us who are vaccinated but succumb to the Delta variant of a future variant that can skirt some of the vaccine's protection will suffer as will those with heart attacks, strokes or severe injuries.
If I could make the decision I would opt for setting up tent hospitals to isolate all Covid patients and as those who have been vaccinated are discovered and moved to regular ICU, then the rest will have to accept whatever treatment is left.
Heart, stroke, and severe injury patients will get preference."
2021-09-06 18:59:03,"An unvaccinated acquaintance told me that vaccinations are a personal issue.  I said I would agree with him if and only if the virus were not contagious.  But, because it is highly contagious, it is a public health issue and requires public health mandates.  It's no more complicated than that."
2021-09-07 00:04:55,"Glad to see a sense of fairness by having those who won't get vaccinated pay all or most of their costs.

But people who did the right thing and got vaccinated and children who can't be vaccinated shouldn't have to pay any costs. Insurance companies can use some of their obscene profits to cover those costs. There's no reason they should make a killing off of covid."
2021-09-07 09:37:59,"Those who were not vaccinated without medical reasons should not be entitled to any waivers for the cost of their hospitalizations. This is the same principle when arsonists who burnt their own house down cannot collect home insurance money with one distinction. Their regulation health insurance remains in force but the waiver is extra. 

On the other hand, insurance companies and the U.S. government can certainly give those have vaccinated but suffered the breakthrough infection a break since the insured have done their part.

I see no contradiction in trying to differentiate the two groups of patients"
2021-09-07 13:22:53,"Just as cigarette smokers pay more for health insurance, so should those refusing to be vaccinated for Covid. Why should those knowingly increasingly their chances of needing medical care not pay more for their decision?

Then again, I feel strongly the country needs a sugar tax, taxing every gram of 'added' sugar, given that obesity related illnesses are the major cause of hospitalization and death in the US (including with Covid -- 80% of people hospitalized and dying from Covid are obese). So, if you want a Coke with 38 grams of added sugar, you'll pay 38 cents more for it; a chocolate bar with 22 grams of sugar, you'll pay 22 cents more. This tax would not only serve to disincentivize eating sugary foods, but would raise money for the healthcare system from the people that are burdening it and raising the healthcare costs for society."
2021-09-07 10:50:43,Of course we’ll all pay the price for those who refuse to mask or get vaccinated.  We’ve paid by getting sick now it’ll hit the pocketbooks.

And I shouldn’t have to pay for any of your care through MY increased insurance premiums."
2021-09-07 15:39:36,"It's not right that irresponsible people all along have been getting a free ride, and now that waivers are expiring even break-through case patients will have to pay because of the irresponsible people.  WHY should patients who did everything they were supposed to do - and still suffered a breakthrough case of COVID-19 - have to pay for treatment the same as the unwilling to be vaccinated crowd?  And why should children under the age of 12 who as yet cannot get vaccinated, have their parents/guardians charged for their treatment if they get COVID-19?  This needs to be fixed.  Don't penalize the people who did the right things!"
2021-09-07 16:50:36,"Gee, insurance companies making a profit. Wow, what a surprise. And yet I see nothing in the comments about the need for universal health care. Hmm. Not a surprise either, alas."

No appointment.
No cost.
No excuse.

Just get the vaccine!"
2021-09-07 18:13:29,"This would not even be a topic of concern if we had what most civilized ""modern"" countries have: Universal affordable  access to healthcare for all: paid for by all based on income and available to all based on need, not wealth or employment at selected employers who offer good insurance.  It could even have affordable supplemental private insurance to cover any holes, gaps and deductibles of the basic plan.  Sounds just like Medicare for all just,  like we have for all the old folks today.  Works for them. Probably cheaper overall per capita than the most expensive and incomplete per capita medical insurance system in the world today that we currently have.  What a quaint thought."
2021-09-07 22:13:30,"Of course the big losers in this will be the hospitals who must care for critically ill COVID patients, vaccinated or not, who will not get full reimbursement because few people will have thousands of dollars to cover those deductibles and co-pays.  Granted that is no different from the situation with other illnesses -- people with cancer get big bills for copays and deductibles that they often can't pay, and the hospitals try to cover that by passing their costs along to everyone else.  

But COVID is different, first because it's contagious, and if people don't go for testing and treatment because they fear the bills, then they will be more likely to spread it.  Second, the crush of COVID patients crowds out other patients the hospitals would usually make their money on, such as joint replacements.  So hospitals will be both losing money on COVID patients who can't pay their share of the bill, and on the opportunity cost of other patients whose elective surgeries would have been more profitable.  Nobody weeps for insurance companies losing profits, nor should they, but they should be concerned about hospitals because hospitals that can't pay their bills often close.  Closed hospitals equals no medical care for those who need it, for any reason."
2021-09-07 21:43:07,"Even though I’m as angry about people who refuse to get vaccinated as many people here, I hesitate to deny them care when they get sick.  As a matter of principle, medical care should be given to all who need it, without judgement or prejudice, and should be available to everyone in our community, if we want to have a community rather than a loosely-connected group of rugged individualists.  It is America’s shame that we have allowed profiteering insurance companies to run our health care system, causing bankruptcies and denying care.  Let’s turn our wrath on them, not on people who are sick, even if they bear some fault."
2021-09-07 19:30:03,"Excellent.  No-Vaxxers Should absolutely pay for their treatment, as much as the Insurance Companies can get away with charging them. And normally I loathe Insurance Companies.

2021-09-07 23:53:01,"They should make a distinction between those who got vaxed and those who didn't.  

The vaxed should have lower prices for these treatments than the unvaxed.  The vaxxed people should get the beds in the real ICU; the unvaxed end up on cots in the parking garage - they're the reason the hospital is overflowing, after all.  The vaxed should get lower health insurance rates."
2021-09-08 00:08:22,"I think anyone who just decides to not get vaccinated should not get admitted in the first place.  If they don’t trust the medical profession when they advise vaccines, then I guess they don’t trust them at all.  Kick them out."
2021-09-07 21:56:42,"I know national healthcare is imperfect but if people can't even afford to see a doctor in our system, then what's the point? Congress got rid of F and C plans in Medicare so that people will be less likely to use their plan because they have to pay the deductible. What? For profit healthcare is just evil. People are not guinea pig banks that have to lose everything to try to stay alive. At what point will we say enough is enough? I have seen too many people living with relatives or in their cars because they went bankrupt over medical bills. For profit healthcare if a national shame."
2021-09-07 18:15:06,"How about voiding all insurance policies, including life insurance for the unvaccinated, all except for the immune compromised or other heath issues.

They have no right to kill my family and friends."
2021-09-08 11:43:30,"Wait a sec: Higher premiums insurance premiums for those who don't get the shot? My immune system is in fine shape. I have easily delt with COVID months ago. My immunity to any variant is much better than those that got the shot. How about we increase the insurance premiums of those that don't eat well (you can tell by their oversized guts!) or have other ""bad"" habbits that lead to poor health. 
Getting a shot shouldn't be a lock on cheaper insurane rates. Those who get the shot still can carry the virus & spread it (that is a FACT, not a theory)."

No vaccine is perfect, people have been told this and advised that even if you're vaccinated, you still have to exercise caution and good sense: mask up, avoid crowds and wash hands. Life is about risk assessments - we are fortunate to have the vaccine option. None of this is hard. It gets hard when people want the Burger King approach to life - having it my way all the time."
2021-09-08 20:53:26,Just like all our health costs in this country.  You pay huge monthly premiums for an insurance card you can’t afford to use due to large deductibles.

Someone with a breakthrough case is just very unlucky."
2021-09-15 10:55:41,"Our minds aren't built for assessing probabilities. We can't do the math. And, even when we can, it is hard to know what to do with it.

But on the other hand, we can't spend the rest of our lives listening to idiot newscasters or political appointees either. 

The only answer is to push on, learn the math, and learn how to assess the odds."
2021-09-15 12:10:10,"Thank you for this. After sparring with my spouse and 8 year old about her Covid spit test sample this morning, (re)re-evaluating attendance at my sister’s upcoming wedding reboot, and drafting 5 versions of a text message to the first non-family guests we are inviting for cookout play date (should I tell them we’re vaxx’d, is that weird? Do they want us to mask up in our house?) — I needed to see this! I loved, “Psychic numbing sounds much more poetic than “dead inside,” and I appreciate that I’m not the only one who feels this way, because I no longer trust my emotions to guide me properly.” So true. So over it."
2021-09-15 13:32:07,"I feel for & with this author.

But I’m also really angry at the US media and public health authorities who have made things much harder than they need to be for US parents by completely failing to adequately contextualize COVID risk to children.

From the very beginning, COVID has been known to be an incredibly low-risk virus for young children - less risky than many other respiratory viruses that we accept without a second thought (RSV & flu).

European authorities have clearly communicated this to their citizens from the very beginning, and as a result, children in most other parts of the world have benefited from much more normal life, education, and socialization than kids in the US.

US parents are understandably fearful.  Attention-grabbing scary headlines from media outlets like the Times further this anxiety.  But our fear is disproportionate to the actual level of threat.

I hope we can somehow turn this ship around - and soon! - before we do more unnecessary collateral damage to America’s children."
2021-09-15 13:38:47,"""I no longer trust my emotions to guide me properly.""

That's been our problem throughout this whole pandemic - people trusting their emotions to guide them instead of looking at data and making thoughtful risk assessments. Less emotion-guidance, please."
2021-09-15 13:40:53,"Oh wow! Thank you for this one! You made me laugh and hit on many of the crazy decisions parents are repeatedly hit with these days.

Will forward this one to my mom friends!"
2021-09-15 13:42:11,"The last part is important: with COVID overwhelming headlines, many forget that there are many other risks we face every day. The risk assessment process existed before the pandemic: car accidents (do we really need to do this 8-hour drive?), bicycle accident, scooter accident, drowning, food safety (plastic and cancer correlation), etc. 
Anecdotally, I have seen parents go hysterical over COVID risk and have no qualms about not having a car seat for their 6-year old."
2021-09-15 13:47:03,It’s actually pretty rational to not be 2x as upset about there being 4 COVID cases in your child’s school as opposed 2 COVID cases. COVID spread is exponential. One person can easily give it to 19 other people. It makes much more sense to be twice as upset if there are 20 COVID cases in the school.
2021-09-15 14:05:34,"This sees to miss a more important point: children have become pawns in the game of Trumpism: a certain group of parents are using their children, unvaccinated and unmasked, into symbols of their fealty to the former President's movement.  The parents have turned their children's well being into a Republican litmus test, and nothing, not even the prospect of a child's death, can stear them away from thier one true path."
2021-09-15 14:13:14,"Good article, but there's one other piece of information that comes into play: novelty of the risk. So far, only slightly more children have died of Covid since the start of the pandemic than did in the 2018/19 flu season. But we're used to living with the flu and have a framework for understanding it, and can therefore more accurately assess risk at an intuitive level rather than pore through reams of data at the start of each flu season. 
The hysteria whipped up by the media also hasn't helped encourage a sober analysis of the data (and when it comes to our kids, the stakes are so much higher anyway). But hopefully we're moving to a point in the pandemic where it will be easier to incorporate covid into our risk matrix."
2021-09-15 14:21:55,"Deaths and hospitalization among children are still very, very low.   There were 2 kids at the local hospital last week.  This week there are 4, so the headline is ""Child Hospitalizations Rise 100%,""  which is technically true but still deceptive fear mongering."
2021-09-15 14:47:23,"Thank you for giving a term to describe my feelings, or lack thereof. ""Psychic numbing"" is me, as a teacher, with a small child. Day in and day out. Name it to tame it, as they say..."
2021-09-15 15:05:40,"People have a very hard time coming to grips with the basic fact about this pandemic: it spreads easily where people gather indoors if no precautions are taken, and taking some precautions reduces but does not eliminate the spread. It spreads less outdoors as long as people aren't put in close quarters, such as at sporting events or campaign rallies. Vaccinations help a  lot, but we don't have those for children yet. Saying that indoor spaces for children are ""very safe"" is more public relations than useful  (Very safe compared to what? Compared to catching TB or diptheria in that classroom? Compared to a classroom when there's not an airborne  pandemic?) We could indeed make classrooms safe for children, even with the Delta variant  if we were willing to spend enough money on halving class size and spreading kids out, along with MERV-13 ventilation in every classroom, but most people prefer tor rely on hope and slogans (""very safe"") instead. We've also managed to do this inversion between how much Covid, or seeing loved ones die of Covid, is for children versus the temporary crumminess of ""online instruction"" in a society that takes zero responsibility for who will watch the children during it. In-person instruction as it's done  during an airborne pandemic is much better for the parents' employers than it is for the children."
2021-09-15 15:33:55,"Our household used ""slow"" thinking to come up with a few conservative guidelines in line with our values months ago. I rarely have to re-evaluate things and have no fatigue:

- Outside: most activities, playdates, etc are ok, wear a mask
- Inside, not at school: Just don't do it. If necessary (e.g., medical care), wear a mask
- No unvaccinated people in our house. Vaccinated people with high exposure risks, wear a mask
- School's important: go and wear a mask (our community is generally good with precautions, I would feel differently about this in the south)

The angst comes from trying to maximize ""what's allowed"" and minimize mask wearing, under whatever guidelines and data and are out there. That is an exhausting endeavor, but better to question the premise of embarking on it than to ""give up"".  This is a lengthy, but still temporary, situation. Once our kids can be vaxxed we'll re-evaluate."
2021-09-15 15:43:38,"I don't know how much more parents of young kids can take.  It's just overwhelming and I don't even have any grandkids yet.

As Covid rate amongst kids has climbed by 2,000%, these GOP Covid lovers are encouraging gullible parents to defy masks and vaccines and just let their kids get sick or perhaps die. 


What is wrong with these people?  Have they no conscience?  When did their moral compass and plain ole common sense go so haywire?"
2021-09-15 17:00:00,"I do wonder if we were kidding ourselves a bit in 2020 about our ability to evade a novel inhaled respiratory virus that spreads asymptomatically? The only thing that really saved us -- quickly available vaccines for the adult population that is actually vulnerable to covid -- still feels like an absolute miracle, despite it being a payoff of massive public investment. At this point, for my kids, we take some precautions but don't overthink every choice: we've made self-executing decisions, prioritizing school and socialization (yes to school and outdoor playdates, no to retail and restaurants). But we don't sweat each minor variation on the decision tree, because it seems pretty clear that our kids getting covid would be crummy and unpleasant but really not that much different from other childhood illnesses we've weathered."
2021-09-15 14:16:36,"So glad my children are grown and we have not, as yet, been blessed with grandchildren.  I feel, deeply, for parents out there negotiating COVID.  I'm an analytical thinker by nature and, at this point, I find trying to parse data to make decisions extremely difficult.  With the addition of unvaccinated children and their safety vs mental and emotional well being vs Delta vs deliberately unvaccinated people, God bless.  Ourside is safer than inside.  Any interactions with other humans should be outside.  If that is not possible, I really don't have anything to add other than yes, ask about the vaccination status of the adults.  Do not be shy.  Its a virus not a political statement."
2021-09-15 14:44:34,"For me, my thoughts on my own kids relaxed when I no longer expected the situation to change a lot.  Both are under 12.

I don't think vaccines will drastically change my kids' risk, since it's already quite low.  And if I don't let them do something now, when will I start letting them again?

So I pretty much let them do anything.  If I'm nervous, I get them to mask up.

I watch the infection trends, and I'd probably change my thinking if I saw another true surge.  Otherwise, I've switched out of emergency mode and into long-term cost-benefit analysis."
2021-09-15 17:40:46,"We've had it way too easy for too long, so this perceived increase in risk just seems more shocking to some. Seems. Most people don't have to worry about grizzly bears or tigers or marauding murderous savages. Humans have gradually made life easier and safer over the past decades and centuries, but now the dangers are returning. 

Kids especially are getting too soft, so this experience should harden them. 

Embrace the risk. Embrace the fact that you may die tomorrow. Just live every moment as fully as possible."
2021-09-15 18:18:02,"I'd feel a lot better if we could get the kids vaccinated already.  We shouldn't have to wait for the FDA; there's mountains of evidence that the vaccine is safe and effective for those 12 and up, it's a calculated but reasonable risk to give it to a 10-year-old now."
2021-09-15 19:28:55,"The problem with all of the ""well the children didn't really get that sick last year"" frame of thinking is that yeah we knew that the children didn't get very sick what we were really worried about where the teachers and the family members at home who could get sick and die. Everyone seems to have forgotten that little teeny bit of the debate."
2021-09-15 19:42:16,"This is where media and public health officials can cause great harm, by researching and broadcasting every little nuance of risk and mitigation. Perhaps all true for someone somewhere but certainly not the majority. It becomes information overload."
2021-09-15 19:46:38,"Yes. In my case there's also the confusing detail that we live in a very high-vaccination area, but low-vaccination areas are close enough that the case counts people see for the region are very high which has a lot of people feeling freaked out.

I have decided to stay on high-alert mode, with some exceptions primarily having my kid in school (masked as much as possible), until 2 or 3 weeks after the holidays. Hopefully by then the kids can be vaccinated anyway. And if not at least we will know where we stand in indoor season. I figure that while Covid risks for kids are low, they aren't zero, plus people are overlooking that other viruses could behave differently this year than usual (either better or worse) in reaction to a year of lockdown, and our hospitals are still strained.

And then just on a personal level, I've realized that my and my spouse's health anxiety is higher this year (not -entirely- irrationally due to the unpredictability of other viruses) and now that it's been so long since we had a real illness in the family, even a normal but difficult illness seems scarier than it used to."
2021-09-15 20:33:02,"""How can I prevent my family from getting Covid?"" is the wrong question. We're all going to get Covid eventually based on the behavior and the history other coronaviruses.

Instead we should be asking ""how can we prevent harm from Covid?"" For adults that means getting vaccinated to prevent the worst outcomes. But for kids the risk of harm from Covid is so low (not zero, but very low) that I'm not sure the benefits of distancing, canceling activities, and even masking makes a difference in bad outcomes.

If we cared about public health we would be better off enforcing vaccinate mandates to coerce adult holdouts to get their shot and reduce the chance of a bad outcome."
2021-09-15 20:45:09,"The risk of catching COVID for children under 12, who are unable to get vaccinated yet, are much higher in areas with low vaccination rates. I live in one of these anti-vax areas, so I know that if I let my toddler have totally normal activities (indoor playdates, daycare, no mask in stores), there is an almost 100% chance she will catch COVID-19 within days. How bad will the case be? Probably not bad. Will there be long-term effects? Possibly. And, will she spread to others? Definitely.
We will continue to mask her up and limit truly risky activities until the vaccine is approved."
2021-09-15 20:45:24,"I identify with all of this 100%. People are quick to dismiss these feelings and experience as outsized because the risk of Covid's worst effects are low in children. 

BUT the risks associated with our children children being quarantined for long periods of time, missing school for several weeks, not having access to childcare, deleterious impacts on our employment... all of this risks are known and real. To the extent that I still stress about my kids and covid, it's because I'm afraid of no school (again), of losing my job (again), of being forcibly cut-off from family (again) It's not because I'm overly worried about them contracting covid, it's because of everything else associated with the pandemic continuing to rampage in this country. So no, my kid doesn't go to indoor playdates unmasked. Not because I'm so worried he'll get sick on and end up on a ventilator, but because I'm trying to do my part to get all of us to be able to move forward. He started school on Monday in Brooklyn and an entire grade has already been quarantined. if someone had said no to an unmasked indoor playdate, maybe a huge group of kids would still be able to go to school and their parents to work, you know?"

2021-09-15 22:13:53,"As a parent of a ten year old and a high school science teacher, I'm very frustrated that vaccines are not ready for the under 12 children, that less than 50% of my students chose to get vaccinated, and that there are fewer mitigation strategies at school than there were last year with a more contagious variant this year.  We told both our children that they were not allowed to eat in the cafeteria. Their schools are not doing outdoor lunches.  Community transmission has skyrocketed beyond anything we saw last winter and unvaccinated 40-60 year olds in my county are dying - as many in the past six weeks as the total from March 2020 to July 2021.

I feel like all policy-makers at the state level down are playing a giant game of Make Believe that having no mitigation strategies other than masks and indoor lunch and windows up on school buses is going to work. Maybe it would work in an urban school district where the rate of vaccination in my state tends to be higher for 12+ and community spread appears to be lower, but I see heading into the school year with so many unvaccinated people as a recipe for Year 3 of disruption.

We didn't let either daughter participate in sports, Girl Scouts, or hybrid education last year. We haven't been to a restaurant or a movie theater or a gym since February 2020.  I traveled out of county four times total during all of 2020, for medical appointments and a emergency with our cat.

I am truly exhausted. Yet happier to have my students in class."
2021-09-15 22:15:57,"I have only one child, and she turned 12 and 13 during the pandemic. We are fully vaccinated. I had no problems with risk assessment But I experienced (and still do) a great deal of anger and frustration with my child’s small school—district staff and board—who preferred to take the least precautions possible. The assistant superintendent makes 200K . She argued with me, saying wearing a mask exposes a person to greater risk of COVID-19. Thank goodness the state has stepped in and removed some decision-making about the pandemic from school districts. It has been exhausting."
2021-09-15 21:54:31,"It really doesn't! I'm not broken! I worry when my kid is in a car and the pool and when she tilts her chair back so I'm sure her her skill will break. I worry a little that her mask will cause bad breath. Otherwise, she's fine! Free the kids from your anxiety."
2021-09-16 01:25:35,Wow thank you for this article! I am right there with you. I feel paralyzed. We had 1/6 of our elementary school quarantined in the first two weeks of school starting (105 kids quarantined). Now I just feel like I want to close my eyes and maybe take a little nap for a couple months until the vaccine for kids is here. I'm so tired. And angry. And then tired. And then angry again. Because this stupid surge was so avoidable if all the adults had been vaccinated.
2021-09-16 01:28:39,"Meh, maybe not so hard. New pal? No one vaccinated? Only play outside & maybe with masks. Delta is a clear & present danger for unvaxxed kids (long covid perhaps most of all). We should absolutely stay on our toes, as if it was smallpox or the Spanish Flu & be as fierce and guarded for as long as needed, no matter how difficult and, yes, it is difficult, very difficult, but worth extreme caution in the face of the danger."
2021-09-16 01:52:20,"The only COVID ""risk"" I'm concerned about for my kids is that if they are exposed they will quarantine and have to miss ten days of school and social interaction.  And unfortunately this ""risk"" is not really a byproduct of COVID, but of the neuroses of people like the author of this article.  Children are not at high risk from COVID, *even with Delta*.   I'm appropriately more afraid of things that are actually higher risk for them, like car accidents, or drowning, or trampoline injuries.  And that doesn't stop me from letting them ride in cars, swim, or bounce."
2021-09-16 02:34:12,"This article and the author resonanted with me.  I am not in the same boat since my son is 16 and fully vaccinated - but the decision fatigue has totally set in.  Can he go to the climbing gym - can he go to the movie with friends.  They are all masked and vaccinated so that helps but I am tired of weighing the risk factor of each scenario - who is going - what's their state - what's the state of our state.  AUGH!  So having the vaccine obviously helps - but as an anxious parent, it doesn't stop the constant questioning."
2021-09-16 09:06:26,It's like people trying to ridiculously demonstrate their morals by showing how much they protect their kid from covid. Kids are okay. Climate change will destroy them and their children.What are you doing about that?

My children (9 and 10 years old) have N95 masks, most often keep careful distance, and we limit interactions with unvaccinated people. Here in California the schools are good about masks (none of that Florida nonsense).

As if this wasn’t hard enough for most (especially in a culture with a romanticized notion about gut decisions), the second issue is that we struggle to translate what a 1 in 100 or 1 in 1000 risk means while having become overly cautious.

This weekend I left a store because two ladies were shopping with several unmasked children. One was obviously sick with a loud productive cough and after finishing a long bout of coughing mom said “good job.”One of those women could have stayed home or outside with the sick child, or at minimum put a mask on the child. I am so sick of seeing unmasked children under 12 in stores, especially now that some are coughing. It is so inconsiderate to others and it is such a small act to have kids wear a mask. Mine never mind it. We share our society with people who are elderly, immune suppressed or have other health issues. These are people we care about and rely on-  family members, teachers, cashiers in grocery stores, etc., and they should be able to go in public without fear for their lives."
2021-09-16 13:37:46,"Risk, aka Fate.  The probable of the improbable.  Just because it indicates something is unlikely to happen, it also means something can happen.  And its one thing to take risk when you  drive your car, its another when it strikes without warning, without seeing, without reacting at the moment...in fact without knowing and feeling that you've been struck...its post fact is the worse part."
2021-09-16 11:05:17,"I fully agree that people's' ability to assess risk has been completely broken by COVID. The drive to and from the playdate, not worthy of mention, was far riskier than the playdate itself to the child. 412 pediatric deaths from COVID since the beginning of the pandemic, the majority of which had co-morbidities. I understood the abundance of caution at the beginning of the pandemic in the face of the unknown.  But we now know COVID is not a meaningful risk to children yet we continue to inflict enormous damage on their social and emotional development."
2021-09-16 12:53:32,"The fatigue of risk analysis is real.  While our children are old enough to be vaccinated we still worry about breakthrough covid.   I just started going to the gym off hours and wearing a  mask (I'm the only one in a mask btw).  Can my son do an escape room with just his three friends?  ""No"", says my husband, ""not enough ventilation."" ""But they will be masked and require vaccinations?"" I respond.  We arent doing it.  Too much spousal strife.  
Finding the balance between reasonable caution and some degree of normalcy is exhausting.  To compound the situation, everyone seems to have a different opinion on what constitutes acceptable risk.  For some the subway is a hard ""no"". My 13 year old takes it daily and knows to move down the car if there is an unmasked commuter.  But he wears a mask on indoor playdates with friends which we avoid as much as possible. Masking with friends inside may seems crazy to many but that is what we have decided makes sense for our family right now. 

 It is exhausting and the stakes are high."
2021-09-16 15:45:30,Risk assessment was dead long before Covid.  Remember helicopter parents?
2021-09-16 17:58:04,"I think the most important thing is to be reasonable about these things. Life is full of risk and our children are always at risk but we take reasonable measures to prevent harm such as seatbelts and making sure we know the parents of their friends. I think there’s enough data to say that outdoor activities are low risk and transmission from surface contact is low. So school is not only ok but the benefits outweigh the risk by a long shot. I would also say that playing on a playground is also ok and has tremendous benefit for kids. Close friends who you know are vaccinated? Then a play date is probably low risk. I’m also looking forward to apple and pumpkin picking. 
And get that flu shot! There is enough evidence that the flu shot also gives some protection against covid. So my 5 year old is scheduled for her flu shot next week. 
Thanksgiving with MAGA family will off the list for this year. So nice to have a reason!"
2021-09-17 00:46:44,"Three quick thoughts:
1) Intuition is just half-remembered experience. Not to be ignored.
2) Statistical probability analyses might not be the best way to make important decisions. In any statistical sample only a few data points sit right on the median/average. The rest of us are, to one degree or another, outliers. (Sorry to complicate things, further.)
3) There's not much information out there about the benefits of some exposure to the virus. The human immune system, especially among the young, is very effective. Keeping your children completely isolated from the virus might be a Pyrrhic victory.

But then I don't have any children."
2021-09-17 02:44:47,"I worry very little about my kids getting really sick or dying from Covid. I worry a lot about my kid picking up Covid, bringing it to school and being “that family” who makes everyone quarantine. I worry about missing 2-5 weeks work while Covid cycles through my 5 member family (this happened to a friend of mine). For me, taking precautions right now isn’t really out of paranoia for my kids but consideration for how inconvenient it would make life for us if we got Covid."
2021-09-15 16:23:32,"I will start this post off with saying that both my husband, I, and our two older kids, ages 22 and 19, are vaccinated. My daughter had COVID in January, before she was vaccinated. No symptoms other than loss of taste and smell.  In July, she got some kind of an RSV, which lasted for 3 weeks, with a slight fever and a non-stop cough.  Nothing helped till I urged the pediatrician to finally give her antibiotics because my next step would have been to ask for a chest X-ray.  This RSV was much more long-lasting and scarier than her case of COVID, so go figure.  Our 11 year old says that he wants to get vaccinated as part of his 12th birthday present.  We shall see about that.  I am not anti-vaccine, but the credible news on various heart effects of the vaccine on young boys is troubling."
2021-09-23 10:56:48,"As to listening to the experts, you should really really try it.  Go to the CDC page - it’s easy to navigate - and look up the hospitalization rate by age for Covid.  You will see that the rate for your child is .002 percent.  The mortality rate is far smaller than that.  The chance of your young children dying or being hospitalized from Covid are teeny tiny.  I hope these numbers give you comfort.  Of course, I don’t know how to protect them or you from the headlines that leave that number out."
2021-09-14 10:27:32,"""Patients with critical conditions besides Covid, like heart attacks or strokes, can also have worse health outcomes when most beds are full.""

An excellent point that can't be made often enough.  A sizable number of commentators, usually conservative, have been arguing that vaccination should be a matter of personal choice because it is the unvaccinated, rather than the vaccinated, who make up the vast majority of hospitalizations and deaths due to covid.  Even assuming that to be true, that argument fails to account for the harm done to people who suffer other emergencies like strokes, heart attacks, or automobile accidents.  It also fails to take into account the harm done to cancer patients and others whose treatment is postponed because of crowding in hospitals, even though prompt treatment is critical to the outcome.  When the health care system is overwhelmed, we are all in great danger, even those who are unlikely to get a serious case of covid."
2021-09-14 10:42:27,"This analysis is great but incomplete. What happens when you overlay the map with congressional districts and correlate it with party affiliation, either with registered voters or representatives? It should also be overlaid with a map of policies regarding masking and vaccination.

We all know the answer. So the last step would be to survey people and their representatives about their reactions to the correlation. Could people learn from it or is the predisposition not to believe in masking and vaccinations so strong they can't accept the facts?"

2021-09-14 10:51:00,"Insurance companies should consider denying coverage for covid related hospital admissions to those who choose not to get vaccinated absent exemptions for certain verifiable reasons.  Medicare and Medicaid should as well.  While that might not cover all of the unvaccinated, many of whom finally see the light regarding vaccinations when they’re in the hospital with covid, it sure would serve as a powerful incentive in having people reconsider whether they get vaccinated or not.  You have the “freedom” to not get vaccinated, and I have the “freedom” to not have to pay for your decision not to get vaccinated through higher insurance rates and hospitals passing on the costs to me for those of you who are not insured.  

When faced with a crisis in resources and ability to care for patients, maybe hospitals should consider triaging patients based on vaccination status. Should someone who has had a heart attack and needs immediate and skilled care upon admittance to the hospital have to suffer because the hospital is overrun with covid patients, many of whom chose not to get vaccinated?  

These measures are not likely, and somewhat draconian, but this is apparently where we are at today.   We are in for a long road with covid and I, for one, am sick of the politics and misinformation and outright defiance of a significant segment of people who make decisions that perpetuate this pandemic for the rest of us."
2021-09-14 10:20:52,"It is very peculiar that the Governors of many states are protesting programs for masks and vaccines on claims that they want to protect their freedom. They are forgetting that they are prisoners of the COVID virus which has its own agenda.

The reality is that they will gain their freedom when they will wear masks and become vaccinated."
2021-09-14 10:45:05,"If an ICU  in any hospital is fully occupied because of COVID patients when a non-COVID patient has a life-threatening emergency, a COVID patient shold be taken out of the ICU so the life-threatening emergency paient can be treated.

What is not mentioned is that the North has many more smaller facilities spread over a larger area. So... the larger red cirles are not the most important, the larger number of smaller circles shows a different picture. Along the coast of Florida it is no better or worse than any other area of the country. Orlando? New York? Los Angeles? Of course they will look worse. The picture is much better now than it was a year ago... and the media reporting will continue to paint a more positive picture until November 2022 when the virus is obviously in the final stages of stabilizing and the election becomes the story."

Will the remaining hospitals have the resources to maintain power during and after the hurricanes?

2021-09-14 11:15:54,"The quickest way to incentivize everyone to be vaccinated it to pass the cost of care from the insurance companies, to the non-vaccinated individual who chooses to put himself at risk.

While it may be unpopular to say, the vaccinated should be prioritized with ICU beds."
2021-09-14 11:07:50,"Looking from the outside, it seems this is a great weakness of the United States. The comparison with China is interesting. One way to look at China would be to see it as a totalitarian system where citizens are forced to do things against their will. Another way could be to see it as a manifestation of strong social consciousness where individuals are putting the greater good of the society above their own preferences. Of-course the latter way of thinking is fraught with all kinds of dangers but one suspects the truth lies somewhere in the middle. In the United States on the other hand, society seems broken - where a strain of anti-social beliefs rooted in some kind of deep selfishness is hollowing out a country."

2021-09-14 10:57:35,"I think that hospitals should segment off a fixed portion of their capacity for Covid patients, and reserve resources for other ICU-needing patients who arrive due to normal non-Covid reasons.   If a Covid patient has to wait, then he/she has to wait.   

The idea at this point that people who chose not to get vaccinated are causing someone who had a stroke or heart attack to lose out on care is ridiculous.  

In what other country do we have to go to such lengths to convince and pay people to take a free, lifesaving medical treatment?  People around the world are dying without vaccines available, and we have to literally threaten people to take it.   My sympathy for such people is exhausted."

And the Covid patients start cramming in from nursing homes.  Many of them, I am sure,  DNR patients.   And then they no longer need to be in the hospital.  And the hospitals were trying to tell their 'regular', well insured, patients to still come for that knee replacement.   What would you do?  What do you think Abbott would do then? Tell the hospitals to keep those nursing home patients until they were Covid negative?  I don't think so."

Even though she's only Fox's weather lady, Fox didn't mind putting her on camera to tell her personal story about her in-laws dying of Covid in a NY nursing home. She and Fox went after Governor Cuomo for his inept handling of the hospital/nursing home situation which caused their deaths. Her  righteous fury was understandable.

But now, other governors are causing ten of thousands of preventable deaths in nursing homes and hospitals in  states across the country and no criticism. If I didn't know better, I'd say it was because these are Republican governors.

(I obviously can't monitor Fox News 24/7, so if she has said something I apologize.)"
2021-09-14 11:51:38,"COVID did not create the flaws in our broken, for-profit health care system.  It just exposed them.  Available ICU space is based on a profit/loss model like everything else in the system - supply and demand.  Don’t try to put a human face on it.  There’s not one.  Over-demand and under-supply creates scarcity.  Lumber, ICU beds, they’re pretty much the same."

Do they think it will just go away on its own?"

2021-09-14 11:47:19,"Time to pull the kid gloves off.

If I were President Biden, my next two Executive Orders would look a lot like this:

1. All hospitals are directed to triage other patients ahead of Covid patients who willingly decided to not get vaccinated. If they continue to ignore the science of vaccinations, they cannot also demand front-row treatment over patients battling cancer, etc. 

2. All insurance companies are to immediately drop Covid treatment coverage for those who decided to not get vaccinated. If the vaccine is already paid for by the government, why are our insurance companies (and then by extension, the insurance payers) forced to pay for infinitely more costly ventilators when a patient rejected the free option? 

Those of us who did the responsible thing and the shots months ago have officially run out of patience with the stupidity and selfishness of the deliberately unvaccinated. If conservatives are really willing to die for their cause of 'freedom,' prove it."

In some cases, they're even speaking out against mandatory testing.  They stand outside of hospitals and clinics, waving American flags and bragging that due to the shortages in their profession, they hold all the ""power"" and will get their way. Never do they speak of the health of their patients or of those who must work alongside them.  I am urging my fellow NH citizens to fight this selfish wilful ignorance by telling their providers they only want to be treated by vaccinated professionals.  And I'm hoping this group will be stripped of their right to practice.  ""First do no harm"" indeed."
2021-09-14 11:35:35,"Lots of talk of denying care to the unvaccinated among the reader comments.  That really isn't the answer, but the herd goes where the article leads them as a rule on this board.

The failure to do better with vaccination rates is the failure to effectively intervene upstream.  By the time a person arrives at the ER there is nothing left to do but treat them as best as we can.  

The unvaccinated are not bad people.  They are simply betting that that either Covid will pass them by completely or be no worse than the seasonal flu.  When they arrive at the ER, it is clear they have lost the bet. 

The best tools we have are education and mandates at school and the workplace.  We are just getting starting with the mandates.  The education has been a failure in many places and with many people. 

Autumn and winter are fast approaching and we have to do better."
2021-09-14 11:47:49,"Clearly, those who refuse to remain unvaccinated are causing harm to others. This is not about their personal freedom.

This is not about income or class or race or gender. This is about theft of our valuable resources, Namely, brave doctors, nurses and health care professionals who are desperately trying to do their sworn duties. 

There must be penalties for refusing free vaccination.

No hospital admission if certain capacity level is breached, would be a good place to start.

2021-09-14 11:45:00,"You have this story only partially correct. In reality, an ICU is ""Full"" at about 65% capacity utilization due to the high variability in the arrival rate of its patients. Over 65 % leads to wait times exploding exponentially, something we call Little's Law in throughput modeling. Moreover, you have to understand that the average length of stay of a Covid patient is about 6 to 7x the average length of stay of a non Covid patient, so in effect. the problem of ICU capacity is exponentially worse than you describe, leading to significant cancellation of elective surgeries and no capacity for the usual, non Covid related critical care patients who are competing for those beds.

2021-09-14 11:43:18,"A conservative argument often heard is that one of the few valid reasons for government expenditure and compulsory citizen contribution is the common defense.

A pandemic is exactly that scenario, except the invaders are disease.

The defense of the country is a good immune system of all of its citizens, and thus, according to the conservative thinking, everyone should mask up and get vaccinated. And the government is allowed to make such a defense compulsory, again, according to conservative thinking.

The filling of hospitals is exactly as if an enemy were bombing our cities and creating casualties. COVID is bombing our cities. Conservatives: you are required to act in the country's defense, according to your ethos.

I am sure many Americans in World War 2 did not necessarily understand how Radar systems worked, even as many Radar stations were manned and relied upon to save lives.

Not understanding, or not trusting, technology and science, is not a valid reason to abandon your post in defense of your country. Mask up and get vaccinated Americans, in defense of your country.

Loose lips sink ships. Loose masks sinks ICUs. Keep calm and carry on. Get vaccinated and carry on."

Believe me, if those people in Tennessee or Bammy had to be vaccinated to sit in the stands at a high school or college football game, you'd hear a ton of screaming but you'd see those ""vaccinated"" numbers go up fast. 

Want to fly? Get vaccinated. Want to ride a bus? Get vaccinated. Want to shop in your favorite department store? Get vaccinated. Call me naive, but I assumed that my proof of vaccination would be needed for something by now. In my neck of the woods, nobody has even asked. What a lunatic system (or lack of system) we have in this country."
2021-09-14 11:55:48,"Problem with ICU beds when they are not being used is they generate no revenue for the system, and when they are being used they strain the system.

If they choose to play the equivalent of Russian roulette everyday, that is their choice. I no longer have any sympathy for them. Nor do I have the stomach acid to continue being angry. I do have sympathy for their children and exhausted healthcare professionals (now quitting in droves).

It seems many in the North like to condescend and be hyper-critical, but the reality is people learn when they start hearing about friends and colleagues who are sick and dyeing.  That really never happened like it did in NY.  NY's first wave (in terms of per capita death) was 6 times where Texas is now, and NY even let the second wave get to a higher death rate--after such a horrible first wave.  They will learn, just like we learned, but just like us, it takes the numbers to increase, which is just happening now.

Unrelated to the above, as a liberal person, I am somewhat surprised by the number of people (who I assume are liberal-progressive) who believe that people should be denied care based on their decisions.  I believe historically that is an ultra-right policy!"

I have my doubts about the intentions of some of the puppet masters on Fox News, in Congress and governor’s mansions. They seem to have made the calculation that the damage done to the economy and society by extending the pandemic benefits the in the mid terms and therefore justifies sacrificing a few hundred thousand of their supporters.

2021-09-14 12:29:42,"Insurance companies can factor health habits of the applicants into the determination of whether to issue policies and/or whether to charge higher premiums for those who make high risk choices. Policies can contain exclusions from coverage for high risk sporting activities, for instance, and smokers routinely pay more for various kinds of insurance coverage than non smokers. Insurance companies could justifiably apply the same eligibility and rating logic to people who refuse to become vaccinated. If insurers notified policy holders that after a certain date, Covid treatment and hospitalization costs would be excluded from coverage or require a premium increase for the unvaccinated,  that might provide enough incentive to some holdouts to get inoculated. And for those who continue to refuse to get vaccinated, they would be making their risky choice conscious of the fact that they were also exposing themselves to the possibility of incurring substantial financial liability. That way, vaccinated policy holders would not be financially subsidizing others’ poor choices, or at least not to the same extent that the costs are currently being shared by vaccinated and unvaccinated alike."

2021-09-14 12:17:22,"At this point, saying ""get vaccinated"" is obviously not enough. Southern leaders are letting Covid burn through the population. What the un-vaccinated don't know, is that decision-makers are resisting other protections like mask mandates in restaurants, in favor of urging vaccination only, sacrificing the un-vaccinated. 

Many republican voters are looking at the actions of their politicians and business leaders and deciding this pandemic can't be that bad because their leaders are not only not re-instating any mitigation strategies (except for half-heartedly and belatedly saying ""get vaccinated""), but are also fighting battles (often in court) to prevent schools from requiring masks or teaching virtually. When people die, leaders are implicitly washing their hands of responsibility because most people who die are un-vaccinated and they could have gotten vaccinated, but chose not to.

Republican leaders and media people deserve the blame for a large proportion of preventable Covid deaths for making vaccination and masking political. But Democrats and the media should be doing more, and are guilty of not taking a proper stand. The media sleep-walked into this current crisis, which is worse than the worst time last winter, but, except for the rare article like this, there is almost no coverage.

If he has a heart attack and dies because the hospitals are too busy treating jerks who won’t get vaccinated for Covid, I will fully support a vigilante law allowing me to sue any person that does not get vaccinated and the doctors that allowed them to “have a choice.”"
2021-09-14 12:29:55,"This is terrible.

People with and without covid will suffer.  Some vulnerable and very elderly who have been vaccinated will die.

I wish the GOP leadership and their media arm would unite behind the message that this is a public health crisis.  It used to be during wars and pandemics, the country would unite to face the enemy."

We have a vaccination requirement for all (students and others). And it does not hurt one bit! Acknowledging truth and living by it, is the obligation of any college or university. 

Do we, as a nation, hold ignorance and arrogance as greater virtues than understanding and reason? Have we really stooped this low?"
2021-09-14 12:45:21,"Is there any other country in the world in the same predicament as the United States - where vaccinations are widely available, but large numbers of people refuse to take them and end up in hospital, or dying, as a result?  Americans talk about ""exceptionalism"", but I never thought about it in the context of being ""exceptionally irrational""."
2021-09-14 12:36:14,"Willful ignorance and intransigent opposition to a safe and effective vaccine seems to be pandemic among people who voted for Trump.
They just are more concentrated in the Old South and in rural America.
I would be indifferent to their fates but their behavior affects anyone who needs surgery, a procedure or an ICU bed.
In addition they are causing unnecessary stress and ambivalence to health care workers.
Biden is doing all he can to increase the number of vaccinated but I fear excepting Federal employees and the military his pleas will fall on deaf ears.
Trump has exposed a fault line in American society that was always there."

2021-09-14 12:50:19,How can hospitals take in the unvaccinated over those arriving with heart attacks or other life threatening issues?  In my opinion if you choose not to care for yourself then it’s the back of the line for you. Those who do not consider their lives important should not jeopardize the rest of us.
2021-09-14 12:59:10,"Pollsters need to ask the anti-vaxxers if their resistance is politically motivated, whether it's part of an effort to derail Biden's  agenda, whether it's tied to their belief that the election was stolen. Ten months since the vaccines first became available, it certainly looks like it."
2021-09-14 12:53:51,"Pediatric hospital ICU beds are near capacity in the Washington D.C. Metro area.

Maybe if we laid out the shorties in white body bags in line on blocks of ice in front of the hospitals some parents would get the message. 

No visitations allowed in the hospitals without a vaccination card. In our bizzaroland today that is considered a radical position. And that people would use a fake card to do so should get them hauled off to a cruise ship.

How will people be able to live with the idea that their irresponsibility lead to the death of their child, and other family members?

No government assistance funds without a vax card. Let's stop playing and get serious."
2021-09-14 13:01:22,"The schadenfreude in many comments is the flipside of what we were hearing about denying emergency funding for NYC after our first wave, because somehow we were responsible for it. The calls to deny care, or to force punitive measures like denying insurance claims, are functionally equivalent to calls not to treat AIDS patients, or victims of gun violence--if you start making value judgments about who deserves treatment in a hospital, it will get ugly fast.

Ultimately our situation in this country will end in one of two ways: 1) through a political separation or decentralization; or 2) through people on both sides deciding to be better, bigger, than the worst people on the other side. Betting on #1 going smoothly is a big risk."
2021-09-14 12:59:37,"Healthcare workers need to judiciously exercise their freedom of choice in deciding who get limited services.  If that puts unvaccinated freedom lovers at the end of the line they, more than anyone, should be able to understand how freedom of choice works."

The unvaccinated adult population are a public menace, plain and simple."
2021-09-14 13:00:00,"It's time to have some consequences for those unvaccinated. Raise their insurance rates, deny them access to restaurants, anything to force them to get the vaccine.

The students come from 11 different countries and every single one has been vaccinated, either here or in their home country.  We don’t have to wear masks in class and everyone is still social distancing.  They can’t understand why this is happening in America.  The ones from Zimbabwe and Egypt are especially confused and disgusted.  Why would anyone refuse a free vaccine?   It saves lives, they all told me.  Don’t Americans know that?  Then I tried to explain about the horse deworming medicine.  They laughed, thinking I was joking.  I had to pull up NYT articles to convince them.  TFG may not be in the White House, but he certainly did ensure that his followers would continue to make the USA a laughingstock."
2021-09-14 13:09:18,"Problem:  people choosing to not get vaccinated are continuing to infect kids, the elderly, the compromised, filling our ICU beds,  and yet they go about their lives and claim “freedom”!  
Freedom  to infect!

In the meanwhile those of us whose COVID vaccination effect is waning are getting more and more scared, more and more isolated, and desperate to find a way to get a booster before eight months!  We’re not immunocompromised, but old, and Pfizer is getting ineffective.  

While our government is begging people to get a first vaccination, those of us who have been careful, have played by the rules, have gotten vaccinated, are now left behind by even our CDC!  Give us a booster before 8 months!"
2021-09-14 13:08:12,"The crisis in hospitalization rates in southern red states is the result of a failure to mandate mask wearing and vaccinations in those states. The world is a small place akin to the cabin of a jet liner and after 9/11 we mandated that every person go through an inspection to rule out guns in the confined spaces of an airliner.  The unvaccinated population mirrors that of those who oppose mandates of any kind especially the control of guns so when the government proposes vaccine mandates the real fear among this group is that vaccine mandates will begin a process that will control and take away guns.  This explains the violent reaction to vaccine mandates that would threaten gun ownership.  This may seem a stretch, but mandates of any kind especially gun ownership sets off alarm bells that are not restricted to vaccine mandates.  Only in America do we see such a violent anti vaccine reaction against mandates and only in America do we see the violent obsession with gun ownership rooted in fear ."
2021-09-14 13:09:42,"Clearly, by now, Covid-19 has shown it won't magically go away. The highly contagious and lethal Delta variant has led to overloaded ICU's, overflowing refrigerated morgue-like trucks, and overwhelmed health care workers--which simply isn't sustainable. 

Yet I don't see the anti-vaccination stance of such a large chunk of our population changing. Biden's mandates aren't making one bit of difference. If the non-mask-wearing, anti-vaxxer crowd doesn't get it by now, they never will. 

So how do we prevent their reckless behavior from dragging down the rest of us? Heart attack, stroke, and cancer patients face delays in their treatment. Key first-line workers, whether it be ER and ICU staff, or teachers, restaurant and grocery store workers, place their lives at risk by simply going to work. 

I fear for our future. It's getting uglier and uglier."
2021-09-14 13:13:55,"A sad situation, and you know what? Those who are unvaccinated should come *last* when it comes to priority for these intensive care beds. First priority should go to those who have been vaccinated and those who have other conditions."
2021-09-14 13:14:11,I understand from talking to local physicians that vaccine mandates for staff have caused some number of nurses to leave their jobs. I also understand there are quite a few empty beds with no staff to attend them. I'd be interested to know how these numbers play into the ICU bed shortage. I'm a little disappointed not to see this discussed already.
2021-09-14 13:05:50,"No sympathy at all for people who don't get vaccinated or wear a mask. None.

I only have sympathy for the healthcare workers forced to take care of them. 

If southern hospitals are full, COVID patients should not be allowed to seek help in neighboring states. But they will.  That's what conservatives do.  They don't want to pay taxes, and they don't like government. But when disaster strikes they go crying to neighbors or to the federal government. They take, take, take.  It's all about them. About their freedom.  But they will never talk about their responsibility.

They act like children.  But for a society to be successful, adults need to be in charge. I'm tired of paying for the behavior of children."
2021-09-14 13:05:48,"The South lives it's daily life, and its multiple lives, in denial. The personal freedoms they celebrate have denial at their heart. Racism, anti-outsider tribalism, glorification of the Lost Cause at losing the Civil War are all denial. Occasionally that set of easily provoked views elevates to anger. It's a form of self delusion that has become a way of life and elevated to the level of belief. Ergo the role of organized religion in perpetuating it all. 
The Kubler-Ross model suggests a healthy next step might be bargaining but sadly, not for them. I was born there.  I left decades ago. 
On the other hand all the fractional splinter tribes in the rest of the nation are less well aligned and cohesive. I predict the Southern separateness will continue to be more durable than any of the other oddly aligned regional tribes, and as a result, the denial will continue"

2021-09-14 13:25:20,"There has to be a triage system implemented.  Unvaccinated people infected with Covid are sent to field hospitals, but not to regular hospitals or ICUs.  

It is simply unfair to the vaccinated if an unvaccinated person with Covid takes the ICU bed from a vaccinated patient with or without Covid or from an unvaccinated person with a non-Covid emergency.

Implement that triage and the problem will go away quickly."

By the way, if my vaccinated relative dies of COVID in Texas after being coughed on by his unvaccinated neighbors, can I send a vigilante after them to collect a $10,000 bounty? Or does that not apply to all lives?"

One of the principal purposes of government is to protect public health.  Texas, Florida, and other states with high positivity rates but low vaccination rates are failing their citizens and the rest of the country.

2021-09-14 13:31:44,"The cultural fault line of our times is independence vs interdependence.

The Red tribe leans strongly toward independence. They prefer not to share risk or resources. They label their independence as ""freedom"".  Their circle of affinity and compassion has a short radius. Their loyalty to people inside this circle is strong. They view people outside this radius as either resources to exploit or enemies to be defeated.

The Blue tribe leans strongly toward interdependence. They prefer to share risk and resources. Their circle of affinity and compassion has a much longer radius, and their sense of duty to those inside this circle is more diffuse. 

The fabric of society is based largely on the intrinsic values of how we share risk and resources.

Either tribe would be happy to live in a society modeled on their core values. 

I keep wondering if their is some way to allow people to choose their preferred model while preserving the union.

Perhaps this points to a weakening of the federal government, or a dissolution allowing all states to become sovereign nations or form confederations of choice.

Red states can move more strongly toward independence and Blue states can move more strongly toward interdependence. 

People can migrate to those models which speak to them."

Prevent unvaccinated from getting care!! Trumpsters are terrible people!! If only things had been different. Woe is me!

Wasted breath.

What would finally (maybe) save us -- if only the US had the gumption -- would be sweeping restrictions on where the unvaccinated can go -- like nowhere.

I, vaccinated, and someone who has always taken care of my health and spent an awful year isolated, had been looking forward to so many beloved activities.

Live music, hospital volunteering, teaching literacy classes, the gym.

Every day now I am watching one more (that was prepped for in-person) get trashed again. Cancelled, postponed 'til 2022. My animus is useless because it only hurts me. But the US could finally bar access to all unvaccinated who decided they were more special than I.

President Biden has taken some steps. But overall those who stepped up to get dosed for themselves and for community are seeing opportunities fade because daily access to so much is wide open.

This soft do-gooder country now suffers from its galling permissiveness. Everyone gets an A in class and a medal on the playing field no matter what. It stinks.   

I feel entirely hopeless about this winter. Those who will really be hurt are people who need medical care and will again find it inaccessible as Covid takes beds."
2021-09-14 13:34:31,"Retired healthcare provider.

Grateful that I no longer have to deliver care to people who couldn't care less about my health and safety.  That includes some people in NY, BTW.

At this point, we cannot depend on others to show concern for anyone vulnerable.  Learn everything you can about keeping yourself safe.  Try hard to stay out of facilities, because even the ones in the north are getting stretched.  

I know what critical care looks like when staff is exhausted and short a few key people.  

Not safe.  

You won't realize it until you see nursing students on the unit and floaters that cannot operate complex monitors (or interpret the data).  By then, your safety is at risk. Your hip fracture and pneumonia, your gastric surgery and your stroke...let's just say that you should be trying hard not to need care right now."

Those who are alone when this happens do not fare well. But the unvaccinated do not care! I don’t think anything will make them care because too many in the media have distorted the meaning of freedom. 

Honestly I feel like if we were attacked by a foreign country today like we were 20 years ago, we wouldn’t be able to come together. It’s so depressing."

2021-09-14 13:39:09,"full approval of vaccines is not going to change anti-vaxx minds. that was just one of the excuses used to ""justify"" their refusal .  they will use other ""reasons"" to continue their ""crusade"".  these people are selfish , not even willing to protect the youngsters, who are not eligible for vaccination yet. ( saw interview of a lady in Arkansas, with an 8-year-old, very sick in hospital, and another younger one at home; she still won't take vaccination to protect her own sons).  people do not realize they are not arguing with CDC, FDA, Dr. Fauci or even US gov, but  with the virus, of which, viruses have 100% control the outcome.  these people should be sent to some less developed countries,where people are begging for vaccine to survive. may be then , they would appreciate what we have in US."
2021-09-14 13:38:55,"I am a New Yorker who witnessed the horrendous outcome of the first big Covid-19 wave here in the City first hand; living close to a hospital, seeing reefers (refrigerated trailers) pulling up to the loading dock to store the many dead bodies that an overflowing morgue couldn't handle anymore is a sight that is hard to forget.  We did lose a lot of people last year. One aspect of an overwhelmed intensive care system that contributed greatly to that high death toll is that once an ICU and ventilator beds are at and beyond capacity, the quality of care goes down a lot.  Every hospital only has that many trained intensivists - physicians, respiratory therapists, technicians and IC-trained nurses.  Once you press medical personnel from other areas - so not trained in critical cardiopulmonary care- into service in the ICUs, mortality rates skyrocket. As we found out the hard way. 

With that experience, it is beyond frustrating to see so many places in the South simply ignoring the learnings of that disaster.   We didn't have vaccines in 2020, we do now.  We didn't know just how much masking and social distancing can slow or stop the spread, we do now. Not learning from the calamity that befell your neighbors in the Northeast is not a sign of intelligence; it's hubris mixed with stupidity.  I guess we'll soon find out how many of you end up paying the ultimate price for this. Oh, and even ""just"" getting really sick from COVID-19 isn't a lot of fun, either."
2021-09-14 13:38:08,"Tracking excess deaths over long term averages is not a perfect metric, but it should be done.  Many have died at home because they were afraid to go to the hospital, or they felt they wouldn't be able to get care if they went. Some of these were due to Covid, some were other disorders, and still others were Covid-causing disorders like chronic Afib leading to stroke or long haul Covid leading to suicide. 

It's also time newspaper reports of deaths stop mentioning ""they had contributing conditions,"" without ever mentioning vaccination status.  It's like reporting auto accident deaths without mentioning seat belts or motorcycle accident deaths without mentioning helmets."
2021-09-14 13:44:55,This report should have included a link to all the data which would indicate what areas and hospitals were most at risk. We may be a sound byte society but no one can make an informed decision without sufficient information.
2021-09-14 13:57:59,"The healthcare facilities are throwing every trick in the playbook they have to manage the surge. At this point, they know how to monitor people at home until they become sick enough to be admitted, they have treatment protocols to lessen the severity of the symptoms when given early, they have refined their discharge protocols, they have established their surge plans, and they are monitoring other patients with non-covid related conditions at home. All of these things optimize capacity for incoming patients. Yet...in some areas of the country, they can't keep up with the influx. It would be REALLY nice if the residents of this country would step up to the plate and get vaccinated and/or wear their masks. After 911, many people came together, stood in line and gave blood. Why can't we do a similar thing now?"
2021-09-14 13:59:06,"Vaccinations are going to be the only way out of this but unfortunately there will always be those who don't want it. There is a little hope since some major employers are requiring proof of vaccination (or weekly testing) and the President has issued a similar mandate that covers many employers. But the ardent anti-vaccination crowd will simply use bogus cards. I was fully vaccinated back in February and have the card as well as a record on my iPhone using an Application called Clear. The card could be a problem; it is very easy to scan the card, to erase any data on it and create a bogus card using any photo editing software. OK - this would be illegal but I don't think anyone making a quick buck doing this would really care because it is so easy to do."
2021-09-14 13:40:50,"The response to COVID is entitely political. The Republican party literally stands for nothing now except to oppose anything liberals are for. If liberals are for increasing the minimum wage, Republicans are against it. Liberals want to expand health care, Republicans oppose it. Liberals are in favor of vaccination and masking, republicans oppose it. It doesn't matter if the facts are clear, it doesn't matter that their arguments supporting their position make them sound like they are crazy, it doesn't matter if they are acting against their own best interests. Owning the libs is the only thing that matters. Thanks Fox News for dividing the country for your own financial profit!"

2021-09-14 13:52:39,"Should there be consequences for willful ignorance and reckless disregard for public safety?  Yes, of course there should be, but I'm not willing to let tens of thousands more Americans die.  We are dismantling the field hospitals that were set up here in the Northeast during the height of the pandemic.  Surely, they can be reconstructed in Florida, Texas, Louisiana and throughout the rest of the ignorance belt.  Probably the the best locations are on the various state capitol grounds for all to see."
2021-09-14 13:52:08,"Let's get something straight, only 55 percent of all Americans are fully vaccinated.  While one shot has some efficacy, it's not until both doses are taken is full vaccination complete.  Understand that the second dosage can be taken three weeks after the first has be administered.  So when the government tells us that America is 73 percent vaccinated against the Covid-19 virus, they're not being truthful.  

With regard to hospital beds it's correct thinking for hospitals to keep dedicated units and resources for non-Covid emergencies.  Those who choose not to get the vaccine need to understand that their choice carries with it potentially dire consequences should they contract the virus.  Mandating works well in theory but has many long lasting and irreversable consequences and the majority of those who are fully vaccinated isn't large enough to make such demands without consequence somewhere down the road."
2021-09-14 13:48:26,"This is even worse than it seems, because many of the areas hardest hit were already underserved, poverty stricken, rural areas.  Look at the Black Belt of AL, for instance.  One thing that happens is that cities with vaccine and mask mandates like New Orleans, are receiving patients from over run areas that do not have such restrictions and are maxing out as well."
2021-09-14 13:42:01,"From The Atlantic*, which scratches below the surface of Covid ICU cases to find that many are not as dire as believed:

""The federal government requires hospitals to report every patient who tests positive for COVID, yet the overall tallies of COVID hospitalizations, made available on various state and federal dashboards and widely reported on by the media, do not differentiate based on severity of illness. 

Some patients need extensive medical intervention, such as getting intubated. Others require supplemental oxygen or administration of the steroid dexamethasone. 

But there are many COVID patients in the hospital with fairly mild symptoms, too, who have been admitted for further observation on account of their comorbidities, or because they reported feeling short of breath.""

2021-09-14 14:07:20,It may be unintentional but the unvaccinated are killing us.
2021-09-14 13:57:53,The strings on my tiny violin are getting very frayed from overuse.
2021-09-14 13:56:30,Unvaccinated Covid patients should go straight to hospice care and leave the ICUs for those who are 'really' sick.
2021-09-14 14:07:00,"This is what Republican ""personal freedom"" looks like in action.

This is what Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Greg Abbott, Tucker Carlson, and the rest of them have been fighting so hard for over the last 18 months.

They've been fighting tooth and nail for your right to die a painful and agonizing death from an easily preventable disease in a hospital parking lot.

And not only are all the hospital beds full, so are the freezers in the morgue.

So, be sure to cast your vote for more of this in 2022 and 2024. Because the GOP will be there to give it to you. Assuming there are any of you left that is."
2021-09-14 13:55:55,"How do you publicly shame the Governor's of these states?  After all, it is their refusal to abide by mask mandates which have helped keep this pandemic heightened.  It would be powerful to hear doctors and nurses make a statement in the media about these Governor's?  Public service announcements from doctors and nurses?"
2021-09-14 13:50:59,"Some of these unvaccinated people are so very selfish.

I had a conversation on Facebook yesterday with one. He said ""don't worry about me.""  I replied, ""I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about the healthcare workers who are overworked and overwhelmed.""

He replied ""That (sic) there (sic) job. Many ppl work in jobs where they are overworked and underpaid. I used to work in retail during Christmas.""

I replied, ""You're seriously comparing working in retail during Christmas with what the nurses and doctors are going through right now?  With that ""that there job"" logic, fire fighters took a difficult job, so I guess it's okay for people to go start some arson fires.""

""Deplorable"" is an apt description for some of these people."
2021-09-14 13:56:13,"There is a reason insurance companies will not pay out life insurance claims for high risk adventure seekers such as base jumping, sky diving, rock climbing, kayaking over waterfalls. 

Refusing health care access and reimbursement for those, who play a game of probability in their choice of unvaccination and  of needing hospitalization, is similar.   Responsibility front and center!"
2021-09-14 14:02:28,"Questions:
When someone is hospitalized for Covid, is there a check that they were vaccinated, is it the honor system, or is it medically clear if they were or were not?

Is there any data on hospitalizations for each type of vax?"
2021-09-14 14:06:26,"As the non-overrun states show, this crisis was wholly preventable. The blood is on the hands of Trump and his anti-science enablers, especially Republicans who are in effect outlawing health care."
2021-09-14 14:05:20,"And these folks pushing disinformation, refusing to enact life affirming policies and/or crowding out other patients needing essential care call themselves Pro-Life."
2021-09-14 14:12:46,"If vaccines could be self-administered in the privacy and confidentiality of one's home, would vaccination rates increase?"
2021-09-14 13:58:51,"Unvaccinated people who show up at hospital with Covid-19 should be placed in a special wing. They should receive medical care but go on a waiting list for ICU beds. If a patient arrives at the hospital due to a heart attack or stroke, these patients should get priority for ICU beds. If the result is an unvaccinated Covid-19 does not get an ICU bed and dies as a result, so be it. They made their choice. They decided not to get the Covid-19 vaccine. Poor choices have consequences."
2021-09-14 14:11:59,"The Covid catastrophe in India occurred because the government did not plan ahead for vaccines. There were simply no vaccines to go around when the second wave hit with a vengeance. People were dying like flies. With the vast majority of the country still not double-vaccinated, this could easily happen again.

In the US, the irony is that there is no shortage of vaccine. Only a shortage of common-sense."
2021-09-14 14:22:47,"As a former Nurse Practitioner and ICU nurse, please do not use the term beds available.  You can have available hospital beds, what patients need is trained critical care nurses, intensivist doctors and respiratory therapists.  Those trained people are exhausted and in short supply.  Care suffers when you use less trained or student nurses."
2021-09-14 14:05:49,"If The NY Times will allow this comment…

Covid 19 is the first truly invading army to the USA since the British in 1812. We have suffered about 700,000 dead Americans and climbing.

The frontline of battle in this war is the nose of every single American.

The ammunition to kill this invader is a shot in the arm. A mask is the helmet to protect from stray projectiles.

The unwillingness of the American Citizen soldier to put on the mask provides Aid and Comfort to the Enemy.

The unwillingness of the American  Citizen Soldier to take a shot in the Arm is showing Cowardice In The Face Of The Enemy.

The historical consequences for this is firing squads on the front lines. 

These anti-vaccination so-called Patriots are just little cowards hiding behind the Flag.  All the real Patriots who took a bullet are rolling in their graves.

Our human enemies are taking note. We have a big group of cowards and the solders who did take a shots are letting them off the hook. The lesson for the future is America is a failed state."
2021-09-14 13:59:32,"Let's face it: Covid-19 in America right now is a red-state disease. If they want to stubbornly fight for their right to die unnecessarily, well, God bless them."
2021-09-14 14:06:05,And now entire states are in the E.R. after shooting themselves in the foot.
2021-09-14 14:08:03,"The unvaccinated can have their medical freedom. When they get sick, don’t ask for taxpayer handouts or help paying your hospital bills. That’s for the lazy who want socialized medicine. 

Pay your COVID related bills on your own. You wanted to make your own choices. Now pay for them."
2021-09-14 14:10:12,"Bury the dead on the grounds of the Republican governor's mansions. General Robert E. Lee's property became Arlington National Cemetery. DeSantis, Abbott and other Republican mask banning, virus belittling GOP heroes deserve the same sacred honor. The governors could could lay a wreath annually at the 'Tomb of the Unknown Anti-Vaxxer and Anti-Masker'."
2021-09-14 14:10:14,"No question, no unvaccinated person should be allocated an ICU bed at this point. Let them lay on a stretcher in a hallway, on oxygen and sedated so they are not aware of oxygen starvation while they live or die."
2021-09-14 14:14:37,"I guess this is what ""Freedom"" looks like."
2021-09-14 14:15:01,"Pretty much all Republican governors are decrying vaccination mandates. It is so stunningly obvious why they are doing this. It is their cultish devotion to their party to the end that they are against everything the Democrats want to enact. Everything.

It’s simple, really. When they go on blabbering their nonsense about “tyranny” in front of those microphones, shouldn’t there be one, at least just one, reporter asking them, ”Well, what do YOU have in mind to end the pandemic?”

The silence will either be deafening, or the non-answer will be simply more nonsense."
2021-09-14 14:18:21,"At what point can we simply say:

""If you are able to be vaccinated but refuse to do so and/or if you refuse to wear a mask indoors while being unvaccinated, you forego your right to healthcare and insurance coverage for Covid-related illnesses. And assume liability for harm in spreading the disease.""

Put your money where your mouth is, anti-vaxxers."
2021-09-14 14:23:16,"If people willfully refuse the COVID-19 vaccine out a concern for ""personal freedom"" then taxpayers who are doling out dollars for their health care should seek ""freedom"" from paying their hospital bills."
2021-09-14 14:18:28,"If anti-vaxxers don't care about saving their own health or life with a vaccine and mask, why should personnel working heroically in ICUs care to care for them? Indeed, who knows what these anti-vaxxers will be injected with during their lifesaving care as a covid contaminated patient."
2021-09-14 14:23:27,This seems to be such old news.  75 million voters confirmed that they would rather die than follow orders from a Democratic administration.  Governors in their states declared Covid over a year ago.  These governors’ popularity continues to improve.  At this point we need to accept an increased level of ICU utilization and staff/ equip hospitals to cover this for the next 5-10 years.  Of course this won’t  happen because 50% of the population refuses to fund an hoax.
2021-09-14 14:20:51,Proof of Vaccination should be required for all voters.
2021-09-14 14:24:27,Ron DeSantis and the other anti-mask/anti-vaccination governors certainly know that the vast majority of covid fatalities were not vaccinated and that the prevalence of anti-masking and anti-vaccination is far greater among republicans than among democrats. Accordingly the covid death rate is higher among republicans than among democrats. By prohibiting mask and vaccination mandates he is preferentially promoting the deaths of his own political supporters. Why is he doing this?
2021-09-14 14:29:54,"Each time I see news like this, I am frustrated that our great country does not educate its folks well. There is no critical/analytical thinking. The supply chain for the cynical GOP will continue. Sigh..!"
2021-09-14 14:31:29,"A great irony is that if you get fully vaccinated, you do not give up your right to remain unvaccinated. If you remain unvaccinated, everyone is going to lose that right. It is a classic example of cutting your nose off to spite your face. As a progressive liberal Democrat, half of the country sees me as being more dangerous than COVID-19. Rational though has flown the coop. (Pardon my metaphors)"
2021-09-14 14:25:40,"There has been a news report of an Alabama man who died of a heart attack after being turned away from 43 hospitals due to lack of ICU availability. This makes brings up a thorny ethical dilemma. 

Are we at the point where hospitals must preemptively turn away some unvaccinated COVID cases in order to leave ICU beds available for patients with other conditions? It's a tragedy for any patient to die, but more tragic for a patient to die because all the ICU beds were filled with patients suffering from an easily preventable condition."
2021-09-14 14:48:11,"I find it interesting the many southern states have strict vaccinate mandates for school children.  In fact, Mississippi has the highest rate of vaccination in the US.   Yet, they are one of the states that are against mandated Covid vaccines. 

Adults know communicable diseases spread.  They know vaccines work.  They allow their children to be vaccinated.  

A greater proportion of unvaccinated people will continue to get Covid.  They will continue to put other people at risk, and place undue burdens on hospitals.  And, they are more likely to die than people  who received the vaccination.  

So, if states and their constituents don't comply with being vaccinated, then, we shouldn't be surprised that hospitals will ""ration"" medical care, or companies (like Delta Airlines) will instigate a ""medical surcharge"" for those who refuse the vaccine.   

Time has come to say, enough is enough."
2021-09-14 14:37:25,"You're just one code away from needing an ICU bed. As a physician, this is scary."
2021-09-14 14:41:34,"They made their bed; let them lie in it. My sympathy limit has been exceeded,"
2021-09-14 14:46:35,What if hospitals/clinics set controls on admitting/treating COVID infected unvaccinated people? So that there would  be beds available when needed?
2021-09-14 14:33:54,The willfully unvaccinated need to placed at the end of the line. Others shouldn’t suffer for their poor choices.
2021-09-14 14:36:16,"In Canada the average stay in ICU for covid patient is approx. 14 days and the cost of that care is about the same as a kidney transplant.

<a href=""https://www.cihi.ca/en/covid-19-hospital-stays-cost-3-times-more-than-a-stay-for-heart-attack"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cihi.ca/en/covid-19-hospital-stays-cost-3-times-more-than-a-stay-for-heart-attack</a>

In the US the cost of treatment may be different than it is here but it's still going to be very costly and logically the time a patient spends in ICU is not going to vary much from the 14 day duration. 

So this problem of backing up ICU facilities and the knock on effect is only going to get worse while patients continue to need treatment. Those parts of the US with low vaccination rates are going to have a terrible, terrible winter."
2021-09-14 14:33:41,Time for the hospitals to severely triage.  If you're not vaccinated you're not admitted period.
2021-09-14 14:43:50,"I'm literally almost afraid to leave the house. Thank God I work remotely as a writer.

Even scarier, this ICU issue seems to be spreading across the country in states like California, Washington, South Dakota, and Michigan. Upstate New York and Pennsylvania also have pockets. Will it never end!

I'm just hoping we can all get boosters to protect us against the unvaccinated and new variants."
2021-09-14 14:36:55,"My biggest fear, my worst nightmare is if something were to happen to my husband in which he needed emergency medical care ASAP requiring hospitalization, there would be no hospital in which he could go to because they have zero beds available, and he would end up dying.

THAT scenario keeps me up at night.

We both have been fully vaccinated since spring.  The past few months my husband has been dealing with some very major life threatening issues.

Just this past weekend he asked me to come into his study because he wanted to discuss something.  He had created a quick reference cheat sheet of all of our finances.  I have always known where everything is, but he felt compelled to create this document ""just in case.""  

My husband has NEVER been one of those ""just in case"" kind of guys but yet, he said he didn't know why, but he felt he needed to create this document for me.

It's one thing for someone to die after one's cracker jack medical team did they best to save him or her.  But if something were to happen to my beloved husband and yet could not get into a hospital, well, that scenario would have devastating results, across the board."
2021-09-14 14:40:08,"And both the college and pro football seasons are just getting going. The huge crowds in the stands, unmasked, and in many cases in these same geographic locations that are struggling..."
2021-09-14 14:41:53,"""Virtually all of our [Covid] deaths are people who are unvaccinated.""  What else do state and county leaders need to know?  Where's the leadership from these people?"
2021-09-14 14:48:36,"Anti-vaxxers prattle about “freedom”.  But …

Freedom *to* what?  Freedom to infect others?
How generous of them!

Why aren’t people talking about freedom *from* –
freedom from careless, heedless covid spreaders?"
2021-09-14 14:49:15,People who don't trust science enough to get vaccinated are rushing to the hospital asking science to save their lives. Do they have any awareness of how crazy that is??
2021-09-14 15:17:47,"Less than one hundred years ago, people primarily died in their homes, with their loved ones as their caregivers. My grandparents experienced sickness, injury and disease from a front-row seat at rather young ages. They, and most from their generation, welcomed medical technologies and advances in disease prevention.

Distancing ourselves from suffering and letting hospitals take the brunt of caregiving has made a lot of people immune to how vulnerable the human body really is. I'd argue that any adult over 18 (or perhaps 25 cause teens are notoriously unwise) who is unvaccinated and presents with COVID at a medical facility should be sent home."
2021-09-14 15:16:11,Double health insurance costs for the un-vaccinated.
2021-09-14 15:16:15,"I live in Houston which has the largest medical center in the United States. The ICU beds are packed with people who refused to get vaccinated for whatever illogical reasons they may have.

A recent news story explained that the dying have been,  at the last minute.  begging for the vaccine and the doctors and nurses can only tell them, ""It's too late for that"".

It's your right to refuse the vaccine, but that is your choice, you should be the last priority for an ICU bed when people sick for other reasons or injured in accidents need them as well."
2021-09-14 15:11:38,"If everyone were vaccinated, the Covid epidemic in this country would be over and we could all go back to normal. As wonderful as that would be, the R's wouldn't like that because they want the Biden program to fail so they can get back into power. The FL governor has said exactly that: to paraphrase, Biden is angering people with his unconstitutional vax mandates but is doing nothing to stop the epidemic and getting the country back to normal. He has T shirts printed saying, ""Don't Fouci Florida."" The fact that the D's are mostly vaccinated and the R's only half vaccinated demonstrates the political motivation behind denialism of the Covid vaccine and mask wearing. It's interesting that besides the R politicians with powerful positions acting to thwart vaccinations and mask wearing they are being bolstered by grass roots R's refusing to go along with vaccination and mask mandates. Thousands of LA PD and LAFD personnel have expressed outrage at being required to be vaccinated or get regular Covid tests. Amazing, the people sworn to help keep the city safe are actively trying to undermine its safety."
2021-09-14 15:14:18,Imagine if the vaccination mandate was applied to hospital admissions nationwide.
2021-09-14 15:13:01,"As little sympathy as I have for anti-vaxxers, they are probably not the only cause of these maps. The shortage of medical facilities in swaths of America as hospitals have failed or been consolidated. 

The Covid crisis will exacerbate the problem, not merely by increasing patient load but by forcing hospitals to cut bad on the procedures that create most of their profit.
Add to that the cost of caring for the underinsured and many hospitals are on the brink.

I wonder when we will start seeing charts showing the number of hospitals killed by Covid?"
2021-09-14 15:00:18,"Vaccines have saved our world from many diseases; why did the covid vaccine change this? 

Politics and Trump...that's how!"
2021-09-14 15:07:11,I think it's time to start prioritizing health care for people who have gotten their immunizations and need ICU beds because of heart attacks or car crashes or some other reason than refusing to get their Covid shot.
2021-09-14 15:09:13,The selfishness of the unvaccinated is beyond anything I have ever seen in America. So heart attack and stroke victims can't get good care well they fill up the beds in hospitals because oh well they don't believe in medicine?  Completely insane.
2021-09-14 15:08:08,"The GOP plan is to continue the pandemic until elections in 2022.  
Then blame it on POTUS Biden.  
Of course their potential voters are dying all the while."
2021-09-14 15:01:42,"This is the longest, saddest, and least satisfying ""I told you so"" ever.

So much sickness and death for what?  To make a political point?  Sour grapes?  Here in SC, 1/3 of all varsity football games have been canceled due to COVID.  Is ruining the Southern tradition of high school football worth it?

This can all be over quickly and easily.  Get your shots."

2021-09-14 15:19:58,The tragedy is that the current surge of Covid-19 cases were mostly avoidable. It’s remarkable that there are some people who let politics come in the way of common sense sometimes leading to disastrous health consequences.
2021-09-14 15:24:12,"Many of the Southern states rejected the Medicaid Expansion option, a move that led to the closure of many rural community hospitals and the ICUs that went with them.   

The bill has come due for denying healthcare access for millions of patients."
2021-09-14 15:21:58,"I was a small child in the 1950's when polio was going around the world, crippling and killing people. It was 1955 when Dr. Salk introduced his famous vaccine and parents raced their children to the doctor for the injection and later for boosters. That was over 60 years ago.

A story was just published that with the exception of some tiny village in Pakistan, polio has been eradicated from the face of the earth. And so it is with smallpox.

Get the vaccine. What do you have to lose? Only your life."

2021-09-14 15:27:00,"I am an MD as well as a person with a chronic disease.

The current Health Care System in the US is based on privatizing, profitizing, and keeping government out. This becomes a huge problem when a stress gets put on the system (e.g like a pandemic, or if the country is under attack like on 9/11).

Privately run hospitals care about making profits, and this can come at the cost of public health. Outside of a stressful period, ICUs occupancy is kept at a high rate to maximize profit (an empty ICU room is expensive to maintain). Many of these cases are elective surgeries (which may include organ transplants, chemo patients, and others who do not need emergency care). If a stress gets put onto the system, these cases get pushed off."
2021-09-14 15:41:25,These un-vaccinated CV-19 people who are filling ICU beds and crowding out others who need care for non-covid reasons should be sued. Science and reason don't matter to those people but a hard hit to their pocket book might.

2021-09-14 15:49:59,"Perhaps so much of ""science"" of the past has been proven mistaken may have an influence here. While not medical examples, one might note that such brilliant stars as Galileo, Kepler, and, decades later, Newton made (basically the same) serious errors in the motions of the planets (read ""Principia""). It took 200 years for the errors to be ""corrected"" by  Einstein (who called Newton ""the smartest man who ever lived"").  Yet even Newton and Einstein, like all of us, were wrong at times, as Einstein admitted his ""first mistake"" as  “I refuse to believe in a beginning of the universe.""  Of course there are plenty of medical and drug disasters one might use (or should not have used). Take (or rather, never take) Cerivastatin (Baycol) from Bayer, which took more than 30 years and more than an estimated 100,000 deaths to recall.  Or more recently. Pfizer's Valdecoxib (Bextra). Over $1.8 billion in damages, plus one of the largest criminal fines ever imposed on Pfizer's and its subsidiary Pharamcia & UpJohn,  admitting to criminal wrongdoing with ‘intent to defraud or mislead’.).  Might make some wary? That said, I ran as fast as I could to get both vaccinations and told everyone I could to do the same.  I would have done so even if Newton said it was ok."
2021-09-14 15:50:06,"NW Georgia, Greene's district, unfortunately. 

We have already had one healthy five-year-old dead from covid. We just had a pregnant woman in her 20s who delivered and the baby died from covid before she died a few days later. Two of my high school classmates in their mid-40s died last week. A high school classmate's mom who was undergoing chemo for colon cancer and wasn't eligible for vaccination died last weekend. 

Our city was declared to be in a State of Emergency a few weeks ago. Off-duty police officers & firefighters are working as support staff in the hospital for the past month or more. I'm a QA Manager in a 911 center here. Our 911 medical calls went up about 40% from July-August, entirely from covid. August call volume compared to February for total calls is up 80%. 

My staff is exhausted from overtime and we're short-staffed (which is really nothing new in this field). The ambulance crews are exhausted (ditto). First responders from our fire departments are exhausted. And I can't imagine how those poor souls working the hospital feel right now. 

It's entirely unnecessary."

Wouldn't it be better to show us what percent of the geographic areas have available ICUs within a reasonable distance of the residents and which do not?"
2021-09-14 16:14:57,"At what point in time, and by whom, was the decision made that the lives and health of unvaccinated COVID patients are more valuable than those of others?

I ask this question as a person who recently had to make a trip to the emergency room and found myself in a waiting room having been informed that I wouldn't be seen for 16 - 20 hours at a minimum.  For exactly the same reasons as cited in this article.  Fortunately, although in severe pain, I wasn't in a life-threatening position and I decided to leave (despite severe pain) after 4 1/2 hours.

The hospitals are full or almost there. The daily, Florida, avoidable death rate, for example, is now north of 350. That works out to an annual, Florida, avoidable death rate of over 100,000."

Penalizing those who are unvaccinated if they wind up in the hospital will just drive them further underground, making them more likely to avoid testing and to spread the virus after infection. It will also feed their perception that supporters of vaccination are their enemies with no regard for their lives."

On Friday, I wrote an order for one of those patients to be transferred to intermediate level care, and within minutes I got a call from a hospital 90 miles away to get the bed before my patient had even physically been moved. Not a good sign.

To those Americans who have been vaccinated and supported my nurses and respiratory therapists, I say thank you!  Unfortunately, the other 35% have betrayed us, stabbed us in the back. We will not forget, and many of us will not be put through this ever again."

2021-09-14 16:27:50,"I have never viewed vaccination as a ""Get out of Jail Free"" card, but rather as insurance.  In a properly operating world, vaccination rates would drop as more and more people got vaccinated.  This would in turn allow vaccinated people, with underlying conditions, the freedom to live more of a normal life. The vaccine would probably not be needed (i.e. one would not meet an infected person) but in the unlikely event of a virus encounter it would likely provide protection.

Unvaccinated people are keeping the virus circulating at a high level.  That leads to more breakthrough infections amongst responsible citizens who have done the right thing but whose immune system is not the strongest.   

I understand that some may choose not to get vaccinated.  I think they are badly mistaken, but if they make that choice, they should understand that they are making an additional choice - they are giving up their freedom to circulate in the public sphere.  We need to get the rampant virus tamed.  If it can't be done by ""herd immunity"" it needs to be done by isolating those who won't get vaccinated.  Proof of vaccination should be required for virtually all social activities."
2021-09-14 17:07:35,"What do people have against children?

Adults who wish to defer vacination will take responsibility for their own actions with their personal health. Children are our collective responsibility. Since we cannot vaccinate them, our collective responsibility requires we use masks, social distance and vaccinate.

As a hospital based physician seeing some COVID patients, 
the tragedy of our failure to protect children has very scary downstream effects. Children losing parent(s), increased burden to elderly care givers (who may then pass away further damaging a child) etc. 

Medicine is not political. We have the best science in the world. Unvaccinated adults need to trust medicine as the potential outcomes to the future generations may well be devastating."

2021-09-14 16:36:17,"To quantify the magnitude of this problem, I would be interested in two pieces of data:

1) How many people died of due to maladies other than Covid-19 because they could not get an ICU bed?  I hear individual stories about deaths of a veteran in TX who needed pancreatic surgery and a Alabama man who had a heart attack, but I would like more than anecdotes.
2) What is the relation between percent of ICU capacity and the death rate for patients in ICU's who die from causes other than covid? Crowded ICU's (especially over 100 percent) mean that patients with heart attacks, etc. do not get the usual level of care and are more likely to die.

These data are two more reasons why the irrational decision to not get vaccinated are more than an individual choice."

Choosing to not be vaccinated, assuming one is able to be, is choosing to take advantage of medical practitioners and the hippocratic oath that they abide by. Despite the calls for hospitals to not serve the unvaxxed, that is not how it works and patients will continue to be treated as they come in, assuming resources are available.

To those who have chosen to not be vaxxed because Covid has a low death rate, it's time to acknowledge why that's the case! It's a direct result of the healthcare workers that you're burning out. Don't be so selfish and naive to not realize that when ICUs are filled with Covid patients, hospitals are forced to turn away people suffering from other health emergencies - heart attacks, strokes, accidents, etc. Sure, an unvaxxed Covid patient may ultimately go home but what if it's at the cost of a car accident victim's life? How could you sleep at night knowing that your decision to not get a simple vaccination led the another person's untimely death?

If Covid opens our eyes to nothing else, there are some serious disparities in the quality of education provided across this country. A basic understanding of science and math is lacking. Critical thinking skills are missing. The ability to have humility and acknowledge one's own strengths and trust experts in areas of one's own weaknesses or lack of knowledge is something that a significant number of people would benefit from."
2021-09-14 16:44:41,"I want to dispel the stereotype that seems to be used here a lot, that people who are not getting vaccinated are all right-wing Trumpies.

More importantly, it shows the consequences of all those Republican politicians and political pundits out there who, despite being vaccinated themselves and knowing better, have exploited their supporters willingness to indulge in their own ignorance and self-righteous arrogance in order to further their own selfish political and financial goals.

The fact is, people like Trump, DeSantis, Abbott, Carlson and the rest don't care whether or not you die from Covid. And it's obvious they don't. If they did, they wouldn't be telling you that continuing to act in such a way that's going to increase your likelihood of dying from it is a ""good thing"".

The only thing these people care about is themselves. Period.

And if telling you a bunch of lies, or standing up for other peoples self-destructive behavior is going to get them what they want, then so be it - no matter how many people end up dying because of it.

And right now, that number is around 45,000 Americans a month. Unfortunately, a lot of those deaths are going to be innocent children. And I can say, with 100% certainty, that these various self-serving Republican liars out there couldn't care less. Because, if they did, they would have stopped doing what they've been doing for the last 18 months now, a long time ago.

According to CDC data, the recent peak in Florida cases was August 26, yet deaths peaked two days earlier, and it seems that COVID-19 has miraculously stopped being so lethal in that state!  A miracle!

Every day I had to wait for surgery, the nerve would take more damage and recovery would become harder. After surgery, I required 3 months to relearn walking from scratch. I was lucky. You can suffer from a slipped disk at a different position on the spine where your nerve controlling your bladder function gets squeezed. If that issue is not addressed within hours, you will need to wear diapers for the rest of your life.

Why am I telling you this? Because here in in Washington State, hospitals have stopped to perform these kind of procedures as they get overrun by unvaccinated COVID patients that take up all the capacity in ICUs.

It doesn't matter how well insured you are right now. If I injure my back again and require surgery within a certain time period to avoid lasting damage, resulting in massive loss of quality of life, I will not get it right now. And why?

Without adjusting for the number of people served by these  hospital service areas (or referral regions) these patterns can be VERY misleading, as evidenced by reader comments. (I saw no column/parameter in the data set for these graphics that measured population size or density; I didn't look at their raw data, but it seems they didn't adjust for population at all.)

So, my take on this is that this paper, once again, is using patterns from incomplete data sets to support incorrect interpretations that are in-line with their political narratives.  It seems that it's challenging for even NYT readers to use data sets and graphics like these to draw independent, objective conclusions. (As a NYT readers myself, I feel pretty safe in drawing this conclusion.)  IMO, a better interpretation of these data patterns suggest that there are regions of our country with low hospital and/or ICU (bed) densities and that they are, in fact, under-served (rather than zones of social irresponsibility)."

""Mean hourly occupancy across ICUs was 68.2% SD ± 21.3, and was substantially higher in ICUs with fewer beds (mean 75.8% (± 16.5) for 5–14 beds versus 60.9% (± 22.1) for 20+ beds, P = 0.001), and in academic hospitals (78.7% (± 15.9) versus 65.3% (± 21.3) for community not-for profit hospitals, P < 0.001)""

DeSantis was flying around the state promoting a monoclonal antibody treatment sold by Regeneron, which was used on then-President Donald Trump after he tested positive for COVID-19. The governor first began talking about it as a treatment last year.

Citadel, a Chicago-based hedge fund, has $15.9 million in shares of Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc., according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Citadel CEO Ken Griffin donated $10.75 million to a political committee that supports DeSantis — $5.75 million in 2018 and $5 million last April.

Emergencies like these require round the clock critical care in an ICU setting in order that the patient survive an otherwise rather ordinary hospital case.

This took less than a week, for thousands to get on board with the vaccine card. There were no exceptions anywhere for entry. This will soon be in place through out Canada and the United States."
2021-09-14 22:33:09,"Frankly we need to have the herd of unbelievers ""culled"" from the herd of pachyderms. I got my mask and booster shot and I am old. Why is everyone SO up in arms??  This is the process of natural selection --Mother nature at her best balancing out the planet with virus and pandemics. Humans only can kill each other or die from a virus or old age.  Every other animal on the planet has a predator that might kill them. We have the latest : Covid/Delta/ Moo. Let Mama do her work..survival of the fittest."
2021-09-15 00:15:59,This is what happens when information (science) and disinformation (ignorance) have the same constitutional right.
2021-09-15 00:19:31,"How is this ANY different from a host of other mandated vaccines? Now that full approval has been granted to the Pfizer vaccine, they don't even have the ""experimental"" excuse.

You'd better believe I blame Trump and Fox and other enabling right wing media for politicizing this one. Turns out having narcissistic clown as President is a really bad idea during a pandemic (or any other crisis.)"
2021-09-15 01:01:38,Great topic for future research: a test to measure the “strength” of one’s immune system.  Then scientists can shred this excuse at the next pandemic.
2021-09-15 00:00:04,Is it OK to say I have the personal freedom to purposely risk other peoples lives? I think not.... and what about the people who really need the ICU but are prevented by the hospitalized anti-vaxers.
2021-09-15 00:07:50,"I feel sorry for those who can't access the ICU for a heart condition, stroke, car accident, and for all kids under the age of 12. This situation is grossly unfair. But the unvaccinated adults who get sick? Sorry, no - they made a choice that is killing other people and they need to live or die with it. They shouldn't get air-lifted to another state with responsible leadership and they shouldn't get a ventilator. They should get what they asked for - the ""freedom"" to skip out on the best medical science currently available for COVID. Horse dewormer at home for you!"
2021-09-15 00:31:02,"NYT commenters are in agreement in every article about vaccines and how the unvaccinated are destroying life for the rest of us and creating new mutations that endanger all of us and endangering the children that cannot be vaccinated, and how the unvaccinated should be treated (raising insurance rates or making them pay for cost of care, treating them last when beds are full, etc.).  So what happens next - What can be done other than complain on social media?  Who is doing anything about it?"
2021-09-15 00:41:23,"Its a no brainer to get a vaccine if you have any pre existing conditions. Which is most of unhealthy, uneducated and poorer southern states.

Wonder why California and Eastern states with 80% or more vaccination are up here. They should also include number of people who were vaccinated to get an idea of efficacy in US. Times should follow these and share the death numbers too instead of just cases."
2021-09-15 00:56:21,What is the correlation between legislatures who think vaccines interfere with freedom and those who vote against affordable healthcare.   Vaccines are free and involve minimal paperwork.  Do they not want their constituents to sample how great affordable health care can be with their straw man of freedom?
2021-09-15 00:36:33,"I'm not actually very proud of our 67% fully vaccinated. This doesn't seem that different from States say like Washington or Oregon. I think we might be in for some surprises, because there are just not enough people fully vaccinated so the virus is still out there spreading to others, kids, and even a few people who are vaccinated. Let's not look at this in political terms...but in a broader human empathy. If your neighbor's house is on fire, you better help to put it out."
2021-09-15 01:35:39,"Okay. Second passionate post of the day re this topic
""Memo from Governor Newsp,""
1. As of Sept 30th, all unused vax in our state will be shipped to Mexico (Can you hear me Gavin????) . We respect your ""my body my choice"" meme and because of that....in 3 weeks there is #nomorevax available. Ados. Bub bye! 
2. All payer-provider leaders will be quietly invited to the Gov mansion (ie Kaiser, Sutter, The Blues, UC, Dignit, Scripps etdc )for a little come to Jesus shake down, Luca Brasi style. The message to the payors is : ""No vax...then the $350K icu bill for Uncle Carls intubation is on you... so knock yourself out....""
3. Since every 100 unvaccinated who ultimately get Covi cost the hospital system over 1,000.000 bucks in hospital utilization charges, just pay everyone who is unvaccinated 100$ twice a week to get tested and they get the payout if they stay negative but lose it the minute they turn positive. Lets see how that might change human behavior....
And that's all I got

2021-09-15 01:14:10,Ahhhh the bible belt. A place where people are dying to get Darwin's autograph.
2021-09-15 00:15:54,"When I was twelve years old, I woke up abruptly at about 2 am   because I suddenly could not inhale any air into my lungs.  It literally felt like I was trying to breathe through a clogged straw. Every breathe I took sounded like an asthmatic in the midst of a severe attack. It was very strange because I am not asthmatic. I woke up my mom. She poured some very hot water into a large bowl and added a big wad of Vick's Vapor rub. She sat me down on the couch, put my head directly over the bowl, covered my head with a towel, and told me not to move from that position for 10 minutes. The steam and Vick's vapor rub did their job because about 5 minutes after that, I coughed up what turned out to be a big mucous plug that was blocking my main airway. Thankfully, my breathing returned to normal. My mom took me to the doctor the next day and he told her I had the flu. That incident of not being able to breathe is etched into my memory forever. It is why I do not smoke. It is why I always get my annual flu vaccine. It is why I am fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and why I also wear my mask. I don't play with the health of my lungs...EVER!"
2021-09-14 23:54:04,"And this in the US which invented not one but two polio vaccines, Sabin and Salk! And vaccinated everyone with them! Cry, beloved country!"
2021-09-15 00:09:13,"If you scan the top newspapers in Alabama, Florida and Texas Covid barely is on the front page and nothing about ICU beds.
Complete denial."
2021-09-15 02:09:53,"Not vaccinating  children yet is a huge and avoidable mistake.
 They have had over a year to do trials of children with the vaccines.
 More proof positive that children are completely expendable in our society."
2021-09-15 02:05:39,"these unvaccinated people not only are killing themselves, they also kill those who become sick and need ICU care. 

This is an act of endangering the public, and they should be prosecuted..."
