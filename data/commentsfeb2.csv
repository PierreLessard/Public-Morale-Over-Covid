Watching the spread of illnesses (including but not limited to the Wuhan coronavirus) on cruise ships is a microcosm of a possible contagion among the residents of Hong Kong.  Both Hong Kong and cruise ships are densely packed living spaces and both have hundreds of nano or micro cabins and apartments (‘gnat flats’) between 100 to 200 square feet.   How the coronavirus infects passengers on cruise ships might also predict what might happen in Hong Kong (7.4 million people mostly living in very dense high-rise buildings).  Sealing off Hong Kong from China and quarantining cruise ships are necessary.  Protecting the people of Hong Kong also protects the rest of the world."

*Population: are males/females equally vulnerable? Any sign of genetics of a given population making it more/less vulnerable?
*Do existing anti-virals, either given post-infection or as prophylactic seem to be effective? If so, which ones and dosed how/when?
*Aside from “high fever”, by what mechanism does this virus kill. Which systems are affected?
Sorry, but I don’t think I’ve seen these kinds of questions addressed by any media. There’s lots of panic, but, aside from suggestions we avoid sites where there have been outbreaks, contaminated food or individuals exposed themselves, there’s been little information.
Real data reminds me of the nonsense guesswork from allegedly informed sources during the early days of AIDS (at first, amyl nitrate, a recreational inhaled drug popular in the gay community was blamed), or total ignorance being pedaled as fact - the “demon” theory that encouraged mass cat slaughters during the Plague outbreak of the mid-1300s, an act that helped the disease spread when flea-carrying rats were left unchecked.

Suspicion or fear of carrying a communicable infection is not the same thing as thinking someone is up to no good.   You can't blame someone for carrying a virus.  However, sorry to say, there is no equal protection clause or civil rights to a virus or the person carrying it.   Quarantine is a form of martial law in a time of public health emergency, which is where we are. Political correctness may not apply with the same obvious logic in matters of any new virus, no matter the source or the carrier.

Respiratory viruses are undoubtedly spread from person to person by either direct person to person contact, or aerosol spray when someone coughs or sneezes spraying droplets through the air to those within a small area near the infected person, and through FOMITES. If an infected person touches a coin or an elevator button or a handrail or anything else he can leave behind infectious virions which can be picked up by the next person to touch that fomite. Face masks may reduce the chance of spreading viruses by aerosol spray, but most infections are probably acquired by touching contaminated ""Fomites"" like money or door handles or anything else. Handwashing is probably more important than anything else. We must assume everywhere our hand touches in the public domain is contaminated with corona-virus. Spraying disinfectant around is about as effective as the incense used to keep away the black plague in the Middle Ages. The minute you walk into your home you need to wash your hands before touching any object or surface and above all never touch your face, eyes, nose, mouth before washing thoroughly with soap. Now, what do we do about the objects we buy and bring home which may have been placed on the store shelves by human hands which have not been washed."

If 1016 +/- deaths in a nearly six-week period seem alarming, they really are not.  So far, the numbers aren't any worse than the average flu season toll of most westernized industrial nations.  And as officials corral and isolate potential victims, and the incubation waiting-period passes (they believe, 2 weeks), we'll start to see a diminishing in the infection and subsequent mortality rate.

The patient, one of 167 passengers on a State Department-arranged flight, has since returned to the hospital near Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego.""

This is tucked into a piece filled with disturbing facts. Testing procedures are ineffective if a person can be cleared yet be infected. How many of the 4 people in direct contact on the flight became infected? How many of those infected individuals also tested negative because they were asymptomatic? If this infected individual was cleared, (as the others on the plane were), how many have they now infected when placed into Federal quarantine with all who were not infected? 

There's no ability to control the spread of this virus, just slow the spread. Each person infected with this pathogen can remain asymptomatic for 14 days yet readily transmit the disease, and transmit it through a building. Testing via symptomatology is not working. A vaccine is a long way down the road, but there needs to be a way to quickly develop a test for anti-bodies.

In the current season, half over, it is estimated there have been at least 22 million flu illnesses, 210,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 deaths from flu.

While we appropriately pay serious attention to the evolution of Wuhan coronavirus, let us not let it cloud out the ongoing risks from flu and the need to act accordingly. If quarantining cities in China, cruise ships, and others is sensible and legitimate, maybe we should consider the same for anti-vaxxers here in America.

As with the 40,000 annual deaths in vehicle crashes, the flu is not a ""sexy"" news story, so does not get nearly the coverage deserved. On the other hand, the Wuhan coronavirus, makes for excellent clickbait. That is not to deny the legitimate stories, many hooked to the unknown elements.

Hypothesis:  “The heat, generally speaking, kills this kind of virus,” Trump said in the State Dining Room.

Why wait until the heat comes in April.  Bring on the heat 

Tests:

1.  Require indoor temperature to be set to 75F (24C) or above.  

2.  Get cruise ships sailing to warmer ports or ocean spots where air temperatures exceed 75F.  Refueling/stocking can be done by submarines and/or ships.

Thesis 2:  higher  humidity limits virus survival - April showers bring May flowers, higher humidity and less flu too.

Tests:

1.  Keep mucous membranes hydrated -  require 8 or more glasses of water a day; require saline nose spray 2 times a day.

2.  Require indoor humidity above 35% and below 60%.  Educate public on proper use of home humidifiers.

So the best case scenario is that it’s no worse than Flu. The Flu doesn’t go away so we now have twice as many hospitalizations and deaths — this would strain any health system.

I hesitate to think of the worst case, but perhaps the most likely case is that it’s about 10x worse than the flu (CFR 1 percent), and now we have 11x as many hospitalizations and deaths than usual.

Still, it is reassuring that W.H.O. is on the job! Maybe they should use multicolored protective suits instead of white ones?"

And so, the World Health Organisation re-brands Coronavirus.  Henceforth, we muppets must call it Covid-19.  

By dissociating it with any person, place or animal, we will not stigmatize the virus.

2020-02-11 20:08:08,Get a timeline of recent diseases in China. I highly doubt it is from bats or snakes. Most likely insects. A few months ago about 120 million pigs were put down or killed in China. However knowing how corruption exists in China most likely 20% we’re not put down. Corruption is widespread in China. Scientist should study weather pigs are still infected and if any insects may have spread to different regions and this is the cause of the current virus.
2020-02-11 20:11:48,"The spread of the virus to patients and doctors in a Wuhan hospital has made it clear this is as an airborne respiratory virus like SARs. It is much more contagious than the flu and people on a cruise ship are infecting each other despite being isolated. In Hong Kong a resident was infected through a “pipe”. Was “air vent” lost in translation? 

If Indonesia, Africa, and India do not report a surge in cases despite having many tourists then is R_0 < 1 those countries?

It is likely the water droplets loaded with viruses quickly evaporate in hotter climates. The sun is out longer and is more intense and quickly destroys the exposed viruses with UV light. Many poorer countries are tropical and do not have central heat and AC. Their air conditioners are single room units that do not share duct work with other rooms. That may be enough to reduce the number of new people each infected person infects to less than one. 

Hopefully, the virus will not burn through poorer countries. Unfortunately malaria, dengue, and zika are primarily spread through mosquitos in hot climates instead of being airborne."
2020-02-11 20:38:36,"What's wrong with calling it what it is? It's the Wuhan virus and China really does need to ""clean up its act"" with regard to allowing the mixing of animals and people in close quarters.

2020-02-11 21:54:48,"Another reader has asked key questions about the virus.  The best summary in a major medical journal so far is in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.  That study and two others are readily available online.  

Epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists and virologists are still working out the transmission characteristics of this virus.  Other key questions include:  How many people can have COVID-19 infections and have minimal symptoms?  Does the virus affect children differently than adults?  For people who eventually develop symptoms, when in the prodrome do they shed virus?  And when seemingly better, do they continue to shed virus?  

I am not a public health officer, but I think it is safe to assure the public that this situation, international in scope, is not receiving the type of ""it can't happen here"" dismissal that we saw in 1981 at the advent of HIV.  Scientists learned much from SARS, and that knowledge seems to be translating to the management of COVID-19.  I was in practice and in a role to formulate some local plans for SARS when it was a threat, and the current response seems to be faster and more comprehensive than was the case previously.  

Initially, the response in China seemed to be influenced by local politics.  I hope that politicians around the world will get out of the way, let the experts do their jobs to bring this under control."
2020-02-11 21:35:49,The pattern emerges. Name change...blame local officials....all that is happening here is that Xi is protecting Xi. I bet that his minders made sure that those around him in the photo op were flunkies. Someone so important cannot actually show real leadership and visit the real centre of the outbreak. What a third rate performance. I still think that the knives will be out for him from many powerful people that he has removed from office over the last few years. He can pretend that he is the all powerful leader...but he is politically wounded maybe fatally especially after the long running Honk Kong debacle. Leader for life...do not bet on it.

As xenophobic as Trump is toward Hispanics with his crazed obsession over a senseless wall on the southern border, this should serve as an ironic wakeup call.  By myopically promoting his wall, Trump has failed to grasp the big picture which could have lent assistance to California and New York in dealing humanely with their share of immigrants--some of whom may carry the virus."

2020-02-11 22:31:23,"Today on NPR, I heard a report China is asking that countries pare back travel bans because of the economic fallout. When WHO delayed declaring a global emergency a short two weeks ago, it seemed China's economic interests were part of the equation. Will efforts to contain this virus bow to economic pressure? Is that good epidemiology? 

In todays Upshot, Dr. Carroll tells us we can wash our hands well, get flu shots, clean our phones, computers etc.and hope our employers allow those with illness to stay home. That was NOT reassuring, nor is the call to lower travel restrictions at this time. Should we be concerned that China is beginning to consider containment a failure and now pushing economics ahead of safety? 

WHO feels compelled to play political semantics with the very name of the virus. China certainly will be appreciative if they are not in fact the one's to stipulate it. I was hoping to hear much more substantive info from WHO as was portended by yesterdays op-ed by a top Hong Kong epidemiologist. 

Todays WHO release reminds me of that scene in Lord of the Rings where the Ents engage at great length in a discussion our little hobbits believe to be a resolution to war but, hours later, turns out to have been only their ponderous Entish greeting. Please, WHO, give us the info you are convened to piece together, not semantics. And do tell us if you and the powers that be are throwing us under the bus in favor of economics. I need time to stock up on soap."

All of us are advised to stay in home, it can help to protect us from the risk.

Nice to know that the world is focused on IMPORTANT things.

2020-02-12 00:03:20,"For layman's purposes, I think this virus will always be thought of as Wuhan coronavirus. If WHO and China are so concerned with stigma does that suggest that there is some expectation that this outbreak is going to leave a strong dark mark on our collective consciousness? Their action may unintentionally decrease confidence this can be defeated, given the apparent tint of propaganda. I understand they don't want to stigmatize the region, but pretending we don't know where this originated seems a little pointless and may reduce the impetus to change the animal husbandry and cuisine practices that led to this outbreak in the first place as well as the bureaucratic structures that delayed response.

2020-02-11 23:32:16,"Hopefully, explanation for the Amoy Gardens (Hong Kong/Toronto) cluster in the SARS epidemic 17 years ago, will help public understanding of virus transmission. It was discovered that a sewer line draining sewage from a high-rise apartment building was damaged by utility workers. The result was a seemingly minor water leak that emerged from  the adjacent lawn and flowed slowly across the sidewalk near the building entrance. The pedestrian traffic picked up the contamination on the soles of their shoes and tracked the virus into the apartment tower. This created a cluster of infections that mystified investigators. With the population densities, the exponential increeases in the volume, speed & range of travel, the complexity of infrastrupture combined with the political imperative to avoid responsibility in the Chinese political system, the outcome of this epidemic is self-evident."

Should we all wear masks in public and, if so, what kind? Where are they available?

This country is full of garden-variety flu cases. At what point should anyone worry about flu-like symptoms? Do we visit the doctor, the ER, or stay home and isolate?

Should anyone with cold-like symptoms be staying home now or is that over-reaction?

China must’ve spent a lot of money lobbying the WHO for the name devoid of reference to Wuhan, which would have not been any more “stigmatizing” than the examples I mentioned above (note, most of which are in underdeveloped countries).

Chill out and calm down politicians bureaucrats and technocrats who know nothing about viruses leave alone a clever complex contagious virus like COVID-19. Panic, political correctness, wild speculation will not make the virus disappear into thin air from our planet. The stock market seems unconcerned about the Corona threat. In fact China throwing 10 billion dollars at the problem will boost the Chinese economy in certain sectors such as construction of hospitals/quarantine facilities, supplies needed for hospitals and transportation for distribution of food and supplies. 

Let the proper trained virologists, infectious disease specialists and pulmonologists teams be the educators and the first responders."
2020-02-11 16:03:42,"What comes to mind is the shortage in the USA of scientists and doctors. 
I picture a poor Mexican, Black American, Puerto Rican, Muslim and white children etc  being given the opportunity for higher education from K-12 on to College in this richest nation on earth. 
Brilliance is everywhere to blossom - given a chance. I wonder if the germaphobe in the White House has ever thought about this."
2020-02-11 15:05:11,"It is curious that the virus is terrible in places where people have been forced to stay together in close quarters, but not in other places. Obviously it’s convenient to propagate the infection when people are clustered together as bats in a cave. Cold temperatures, lack of exposure to sun. No wonder the Corona feels at home. Would that they could take people to warmer, sunnier places. At least those ships should dock in warmer countries. For us, folks please get some sunshine and Vit D. 
 I wonder if the antivirals being used to treat people in China are causing adverse reactions. Or maybe in desperation they are using drugs which are not as well researched. Or the fact many might be resorting to strange home made remedies. I really wish the CDC would tell us what exactly is causing all these poor people to suffer. Because I am getting the distinct feeling Corona is a virus that is getting blamed for a whole load of other things leading to death."
2020-02-11 14:42:20,"Two things.

1. 12,000 people visiting a ""shopping center"" ""in late January"" means it was either a very small center or they're understating the numbers. While the end of January was Chinese New Year, and many Tianjin residents may have returned to their villages for reunion, the city does have 15 million inhabitants, so 12,000 over a week+ still seems low. An average Starbucks alone probably does 1,000+ pax/day.

2. The port cities of Northern China send many (~thousands, if not tens of thousands) sex workers abroad to the major and minor cities of Asia. If they went home for CNY and are able to return to where they work (CNY just ended Sunday), that could spread the virus widely.

Some are hollering ""xenophobia"" because other countries are keeping out mainlanders. That's ridiculous. The fact is the virus originated in China and China has tens of thousands of infections we know about so far. Any ban will be temporary. To succumb to political correctness and not ban travel to one's country from the mainland would be dereliction of duty by one's leaders. There's nothing racist or xenophobic about taking temporary precautions based on what we know and, more, what we don't know about the virus. Better safe than sorry makes a lot of sense here."
2020-02-21 12:51:53,Bravo Mr. Zhang for your fortitude and creativity in terrifying times. May you and your family be blessed with good health and love.
2020-02-21 14:01:54,It is so fascinating to get a glimpse into what this is like - it is so hard to imagine a city of 11 million under quarantine!  Seems impossible but it is happening.  Good luck Mr. Zhang and I hope you and your family stay healthy.
2020-02-21 14:08:24,"At first I thought, this is a story of ""everyday heroism"", though I suppose the deliveryman's heroism is really more a simple sense of responsibility to his family. But it's still also a story of a nearly heroic human decency.

So as the first commenter said, ""Bravo Mr. Zhang"".  Bravo Ms. Wang, too, for a beautiful story. Your account proves, in microcosm, that people will still look out for total strangers -- at their own risk, and in the worst situations.

Just the other day I was reading that among Silicon Valley billionaires the latest status symbol is a secure getaway in New Zealand. The idea being that when upheaval (or pandemic) arrives, they'll helicopter out of Mountainview, hop a private jet to the antipodes, and wait it out in some luxurious 8,000 sq. ft. 'bomb shelter' breathing filtered air.

Meanwhile guys like this courier will deliver food to strangers.

I know who deserves to survive."
2020-02-21 14:30:48,"There is no evidence that the corona virus is any worse than a normal influenza. Evidence is a thing made up of facts. Facts are things that are true because they are reality. 

There will be no stopping the spread of this virus. All of the effort to do so will be for naught. Governments do not have the ability to do anything about it. They are not protecting us and they never have. They are more like shepherds that drive the sheep towards the wolves. They also disseminate the propaganda that helps keep the sheep sheep."

2020-02-20 17:52:59,"Unless a cowboy hat or the majority of what sells on Amazon is of an emergency life and death matter we will somehow survive this retail crisis.
 Less nonessential items being consumed by the world’s consumers, imagine that."
2020-02-20 18:08:18,"Like with Amazon, products that I anticipate buying may be brought forward just in case supply disruption is worse than anticipated.  An unmentioned side effect of Amazon buy ahead is that if the supply chain impact is less than anticipated, the glut of supply may drive down prices locally, and cause disruption for the manufacturers who have to slow production while the surplus is worked through."
2020-02-20 18:14:52,"Amazon has already jumped the shark. They had plenty of trouble with meeting demand and upholding their Prime agreement over the holidays, even before this happened, and thanks to their 'lean' inventory, you can't depend on them to have what you want in stock in the middle of July either. Essentially you pay for Prime and they decide when you get your merchandise.

There are other retailers online who do have things in stock, ship just as quickly, and have prices just as competitive, because they're trying to beat the Amazon that used to be. I've systematically moved all of my purchases elsewhere. Other companies are more human, shipments arrive undamaged and on time, and everybody is happy."
2020-02-20 18:29:16,"Lean inventories started with most retailers years ago.  I remember when Walmart's computer system for the maintenance of inventories and shipping was touted as being as powerful as the Pentagon's. For a long time now, I've seen unstocked shelves and  ""item inventory"" cards displayed there and the shelves of other retailers.  For the malls, this particularly, has been their demise.  Better to see it not available online than to have driven to the store to find out."
2020-02-20 18:36:53,"It’s really not about whether any of us “like” Amazon or not. There are issues here that impact everyone. Amazon is one of the biggest companies in the country and contributes to our economy and workforce. Also, all the folks who use Amazon Pantry, order their batteries from amazon, etc will have to use other stores if amazon’s supplies dwindle. Other stores might not have enough supplies to keep up with the extra business.

It’s like dominoes. Nothing is separate from anything else. The ripple effect. It’s all connected. We’re all connected."
2020-02-20 17:52:10,"I am really enjoying the news that Amazon is sweating.. finally there will be a stoppage to real ""contraband's"" from China.   but it could be more !

No I am not enjoying  people are hurting!

But given the fact that Amazon does not have any control of what product comes to me after being a a prime member for over 11 years I have up on my prime membership  to stop to a end of spurious items flowing to me .. 


Some times its getting mixed  with items ""ship and sold by Amazon""  and no way to catch that my  shower gel has way more soda than the one from Target purchased next day !

I hope Amazon makes sure its using vetted sources of the products  next time they get their shipments from China !

Hope this man made virus crisis ends soon for us as a human race and I can become prime member again after the cleanup of the shelves in Amazon :)"

2020-02-20 19:40:54,"It won't be just Amazon that it is affected by the Coronavirus if it gets much worse. China controls the world's commerce by making vast numbers of pieces, parts and finished products. While someone might not be able get a notebook or smart speaker there will also be HVAC vendors who can't get a switch to complete their product. Another product will be automobile parts (both new and aftermarket). GM suffered a shortage this summer due to a strike and it was no pretty for those needing their cars repaired. There are many more companies who are highly concerned about this and many of them make and sell products that we need."
2020-02-20 20:01:16,Lean inventories and the Just in Time management approach to inventory control have been the pinnacle of good manufacturing practices for over 20 years now. The current problems evidenced by the coronavirus have always been understood as a weak point of this approach.
2020-02-20 20:35:37,"Early last week I was shopping at Walmart and noticed a severe shortage of toothpaste that I had never seen before. According to P&G the manufacturer of Crest some of their key ingredients for a lot of products are sourced in China. 

Wondering if I should load up on some of the basics like hand sanitizers and Clorox wipes."
2020-02-20 21:11:58,"Since some viruses can live up to a week in the right conditions, is it possible that items shipped from China to the rest of the world may harbor the Corona virus? Be careful what you order from Amazon!"
2020-02-20 21:23:34,"This is classic shortcomings on just-in-time production and logistics. Really classic.

//Natural and man-made disasters will disrupt the flow of energy, goods and services. The down-stream customers of those goods and services will, in turn, not be able to produce their product or render their service because they were counting on incoming deliveries ""just in time"" and so have little or no inventory to work with. The disruption to the economic system will cascade to some degree depending on the nature and severity of the original disaster.//"
2020-02-20 21:33:52,"It's probably good that we finally appreciate how much we depend on China. The supply chain is invisible to most of us so now is as good a time to find out as any.

As for lean inventories and disruptions, companies that practice this, most famously Toyota, learn how to manage when things go wrong. Small disruptions occur all the time and these should be used as learning opportunities for the time when the Big One occurs. Maybe Amazon will get better as it works through this. Its supply chains are a lot bigger and more complex than Toyota's.

As for Amazon-bashing, let's not forget when we all bashed Microsoft, and before that IBM, and before that the Telephone Company, and before that Standard Oil. Bashing is fun but those who do it do not face the challenges that the bashed ones face or deliver the service or products."
2020-02-20 21:56:53,"I ordered two (essentialy identical) items from the same company, based in England at the same time, mid-January.  One that came from England came in the posted international period predicted.  The one shipped from China took an extra two weeks to arrive and be delivered in the USA.  Even the supplier noted that the coronavirus virus's disruption may have been the cause."
2020-02-20 22:06:29,Why don't we all pay what it should cost to produce items here in the US? Nearly everything Target and Walmart sell are made in China.
2020-02-20 22:18:13,"Is there anything Amazon can't be blamed for?  Lean inventory has been around for decades.  It drove every company I worked for, under various names, one of which the acronym was actually LEAN.  Another was called Just In Time, which meant materials were ordered to arrive ""just in time"" to manufacture the products ordered as the orders came in. It was Wall Street-driven then and continues to be.  Stock ratings go up and down depending on how much inventory a company has on hand."
2020-02-20 22:18:36,"On your title:

Actually, all one has to do is walk into a now-Amazon-owned Whole Foods store to see some of the weakness on their the Amazon system.

Perhaps it avoids some level of food waste, but it also results in frequently-empty shelves, customers driving all the way there only to find that they are out of stock or too low on stock on an item.  This situation then just adds to Amazon’s already-over-the-top carbon- and traffic-footprint, as shoppers then drive to a competitor for the item or order it online, which then requires added packaging, shipping, and round-trip driver delivery with all the layers of carbon footprint there.  Even if they started using drones (not!!!) the adverse impacts on the physical and social environment would likely be substantial.

All the tech bros get off on the “move fast and break things” motto, but most people, including most really smart people, still see the wisdom in the older adage, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”"
2020-02-20 22:26:13,"The ability of Amazon to make a lot of money and to diversify with it is fundamentally dependent upon not keeping big inventories. Big inventories like well stocked store shelves tie up vast amounts of money, capital, which is depreciating in value the longer that the merchandise sits on those shelves. Keeping minimal inventory to satisfy quick turnover of goods is what gives on-line sellers the greatest advantage over brick and mortar stores. The only trick is knowing how much to keep on hand to keep the stock moving."
2020-02-20 23:03:44,Might there be a silver lining in the epidemic? Help people realize that they don't really need the junk that Amazon sells?
2020-02-20 23:08:24,"Important question:

Can we trust that Amazon and its Chinese and other suppliers will know how to, and be certain to, prevent the spread of the virus via products or packaging, shipping and delivery methods?  How can we consumers be sure that material coming from or through areas where the virus has migrated will be free of virus material still active?  There are so many different kinds and texture and porousness of material and shipping conditions.  What is the life-span or half-life of the virus under both ideal conditions for its vitality and conditions less hospitable?  If it is a novel virus, how can we be sure of that information?  Is the credible scientific certainty that the virus isn’t infectious when dried or dead?

Might be helpful and interesting for NYT to report to readers answers to these and related questions."
2020-02-20 23:09:21,"Was wondering if just in time inventory developed when materials were available closer to home rather than in China? Sadly, this story is a rude reminder of how consumer-dependent we are on such a complex delivery system. Making a list of wants versus needs right now."
2020-02-20 22:35:37,"Much of your story seems to be sourced to e-mail traffic between Amazon and its vendors and suppliers. Why are you confident that traffic is real? 
Your first example: ""“Hello!” read one recent email from Amazon to a seller, which The New York Times reviewed"", ""effect"" is used incorrectly (presumably that's stet, and your editors didn't change it). Unlikely Amazon would make that mistake."

The same goes for their customers.Maybe is time to try an alternative."
2020-02-20 21:09:05,Would be ironic (and scary) if the virus spreads significantly more globally and all those Chinese coronavirus masks are stuck in warehouses.  Speaks to the futility of depending on China for too much.
2020-02-21 01:41:12,"Has anyone else noticed that Whole Foods has a *huge* inventory supply problem since Amazon purchased them? Who runs out of rice, all the rice? No lentils for weeks at at time. A store with zero bananas... What's the story, Amazon? You can't blame China. I wish my regular grocery store weren't so filthy and pathetic. I'd love to find a new place that has decent food and one-stop shopping."
2020-02-21 07:01:38,Amazon’s lean inventory comes at the expense of its suppliers’ stocking up to meet demand uncertainties. This pushes the costs away from retailers to suppliers and their next vendors. Any disruption to supply chain will be exacerbated once current inventory in the pipeline is depleted and July Prime day starts looking shaky quickly.
2020-02-21 11:30:25,"This holds true for other companies such as Walmart as well, which rely upon ""just in time"" delivery. Our local Walmart is often poorly stocked as it is and has large numbers of bare shelves on a good day. I often have to order online and pick it up at the store in order to get the product. If I can I'll just order from Amazon and skip the trip to Walmart. And yeah, I'd rather buy local but that's just not so easy here in rural America. 

As for those commenters who proclaim that this is good and we'll buy less junk, while that is indeed true, there are also so many products that we rely on that are manufactured in China or dependent on parts from China. So not only will we have to forgo things that we may depend on but the reduced sales will harm businesses and put employees out of work. 

There's a good list at the ""Organic Prepper"" website which focuses on products that come from China; everything from many of our medications to food to auto parts. There's also a book, ""A Year Without Made in China"" which I recommend reading to get a feel for our current state of affairs. We have invited disaster on ourselves by shifting manufacture of so many things overseas to where it can be done cheaper with lax environmental regs. We may well dearly pay for this hubris."
2020-02-21 12:54:51,"No, you don't have to raise prices. Any company that does that is gouging the customer."
2020-02-21 14:41:11,"Maybe it's time to bring manufacturing back to the United States.  
Yes, products will probably be more expensive but that is a small price to pay for avoiding this virus and bringing more jobs to Americans."
2020-02-21 10:27:33,"One has to realize that Amazon is really nothing more than the mall gone digital.  It makes almost none of what is purchased through its portals.  It merely facilitates the transaction and, like all middle men, extracts their cut of the proceeds.  

This is not to be critical; we American's do love our malls don't we?  The ascension in the ubiquity of the 'Net and the concomitant rise in Amazon's equity price is the physical proof of that love isn't it?  

But as this article makes clear the desire to be lean and mean, as evinced by their systemic processes, does leave them open to random acts, natural or otherwise.  It's the chink in their armor; one they can never entirely eliminate because, as middle men, they never entirely control those that actually produce the goods.  

It's the woes all physical mall owners would understand.

I hope the U.S. will immediately implement stringent quarantine procedures for all arrivals from Japan as well as Cambodia and China.
There are still too many unanswered questions about how transmittal opportunities and incubation periods for the world to relax its vigilance, especially when there are procedures at hand to limit unnecessary exposure."
2020-02-19 16:37:02,"Viruses have a large variation in development of symptoms. Rabies, for example, can take anywhere between a couple of weeks to two months from time of infection.

Two months incubation. Hmmm."
2020-02-19 16:54:31,"This is about the most non-sensical decision ever made!

Japan is supposed to hold the Summer Olympics.  

We already know a person can test negative and be symptom free, while passing along the virus.

Is this the time to experiment?  

The Law of Unintended Consequences now has hundreds of people testing how far the virus can spread from just this one sample of people who’ve been trapped on a virus incubator for 2 weeks."
2020-02-19 16:57:44,"We seem to be witnessing more and more normalization of deviance in this outbreak. 

It’s a term used largely in aerospace and industry to describe the circumstances when those in charge of operational matters chafe under the paranoia of those who set the original standards (which can often be the same person). Over time, allowances are made for greater and greater deviance from the correct way of doing things and the expedient way becomes the new norm. 

Most of the time there’s no immediate sign this was a bad idea, which only encourages more deviance, until something goes horribly, but predictably wrong.

Challenger, Columbia and the entire Chemical Safety Board channel on YouTube are excellent examples of this in action. I fear the coronavirus outbreak will provide a few more case studies."

Who knows, for example, to what degree the virus has mutated?On a ship which provided the ideal incubating conditions for both the mutation and spread of a new pathogen?  To unsuspecting victims?  Who will now become unwitting experimental subjects in an Experiment they never agreed to take part in?

Events have set in motion which are completely predictable - but with unpredictable consequences."
2020-02-19 17:14:00,"The virus has already spread far and wide to be contained. The passengers from the ship that disembarked in Cambodia have flown around the world. It is likely that the planes they flew in will carry the infection for days and so will their co-passengers and staff. The permutations from that one incident  itself are mind-boggling. There are many others which no-one knows about. It is like putting the genie back in the bottle it came out of, it cannot be done."
2020-02-19 17:14:28,"“They want to handle the case based on a successful plot that the bureaucrats created, and they just want to follow it,” 

It became painfully evident during the aftermath of earthquake and tsunami in 2011.  Government elites who hold key positions as well as those who are in the chain of command are products of Japanese elite academic education - a system whose sole purpose is to send students through top universities and career track in public and private sector entities.  As such, they have received education that emphasizes excellence in test scores but low on imagination and creativity.  In addition, those who have received top marks (and thus likely to hold highest positions) have had little experience in facing adversity and failures while growing up. 
The resulting elites in Japan lack leadership skills and imagination, fragile when met with challenge. The quote at the beginning summarizes the symptomatic weakness and ineffectiveness of the Japanese government in the face of crisis."
2020-02-19 18:05:58,"I say it is the best move ever. Please note, when Bats are stressed, that is when they shed the Coronavirus. Why not work on the assumption that it may be the same case in humans? I say, this virus has been roaming world wide since it first started in Wuhan, lord only knows exactly when. It is obviously not a very dangerous virus. What it has succeeded in doing is expose the vulnerability of political bodies to strategize and plan for a pandemic disease that is not so kind. The WHO seems to be as ineffectual as any governmental organization. I say there should be a non-governmental association of the leading epidemiologists formed through billionaire money answerable to no government and completely (at least as much as can be hoped) independent. They should be allowed freely into any country worldwide and consult with any government without hindrance. Also this whole mad rush to make vaccines, is like encouraging gun manufacturers to make more guns to keep America safe. Look where that has got us. I say we need a fresh look at immunity. A fresh look at organisms that co-habit this earth with us. Nothing is  bad or good. It is about what maintains a certain balance that contributes to a positive outcome vs a negative one. I say we refresh our outlook on what constitutes a diseased situation and a different perspective on the why. Perhaps a peek into history far back in time would be a great start."

There are going to be many more incidents requiring tough decision making especially as the virus gains a foothold worldwide. What is WHO doing during all this? And let's hope our CDC and NIH are ready.
2020-02-19 16:36:13,Is it safe to let people who have been confined in a ship overwhelmed with a deadly virus to leave if they have a negative test? Of course its not.  They should have been taken off the ship 14 days ago and put in hospitals or flown back to their own countries to be quarantined. That is what needs to happen NOW. All of them need to be quarantined again for 14 days and only then if they are still negative should they be allowed to travel freely.
2020-02-19 16:44:54,Looks like Japan is helping the spread of the coronavirus since they have no clue is some of the people are just coming down with the virus.  Now it can spread around as they fly home.  It seems pretty negligent to me.
2020-02-19 17:00:31,"I would hope that people will start boycotting Princess Cruise Line for they have handled this crisis on their ship so very poorly and now they are allowing disembarkation without demanding more protocols and quarantines to be put in place to make sure the people leaving will not be taking the virus to all of their home countries. 

By allowing these people to leave their ship under these circumstances is abhorrent.  It makes me feel like they just want to end any more financial responsibility as a result of more passengers showing signs of infection while on board so instead they just want to send them on their way. 

Another good reason to boycott Princess Cruises is, well,  just imagine what is going to happen when all the crew members finish their mandatory  sterilization of the ship and are then dispersed to other Princess Cruise Line ships? Will they be fully tested and quarantined after cleaning the ship? Myself, I doubt it very much. Not after seeing how they handled this debacle. 

I for one will be boycotting Princess Cruises and I will never step foot on one of their ships again."
2020-02-19 16:48:37,"Each time there is a new case of Coronavirus, the 14 day quarantine resets to zero. This did not happen on the Island Princess. Japan appears to have misunderstood how to effectively quarantine the people on the Cruise ship and just counted fourteen days.
Even though those released tested negative for Coronavirus, this does not mean that they will not get the virus later. They were just exposed to the virus this week.
Japan may have spread the virus around the globe."
2020-02-19 17:31:54,"‘He acknowledged, though, that after three health ministry officials who had tended to passengers on the ship tested positive for the virus, “I cannot say that things are being controlled completely.”’

‘“The lack of a coordinated response in which genuine experts are responsible for decision making is problematic,” he said,” because what happens instead is that you have political functionaries who are placed in roles of authority beyond their competency. For me, the echoes and analogies with Fukushima are just really disturbing.”’

These two statements say everything about the cruise ship quarantine. We humans never know everything, but clearly some of us are more expert than others. And when non-experts try to manage an epidemic, potentially horrible and probably unnecessary consequences are likely to result."

Who pays for the costs of housing the passengers on cruise ship under quarantine? The govt that orders the quarantine or the cruise line ?

Who pays for the the chartered planes cost that brings passengers/ tourists back from Japan/ China? The govt of the country they are evacuating to or the passengers themselves?

Who pays for the 2 week quarantine at the Air Force bases in the US? And lost wages for the persons that are under the quarantine order ?

None of the news articles I could find seem to address these questions."
2020-02-19 16:57:46,"Most of the people I know are indifferent to what's going on in China (and now other countries in Asia albeit on a much smaller scale). It's just not real to them. I've noticed there have been fewer comments on the Times' articles about COVID-19 recently. A lot of people seem to be getting bored.

Soothing assurances from experts notwithstanding, everything I've read tells me that we're in the land of what Donald Rumsfeld once called ""unknown unknowns"".

I postponed a long standing trip to California that at the end of the month until the late summer -- and I'm staying out of airplanes and other public transportation until (a) we understand this virus better and/or (b) we're sure that the US is going to be spared. 

My guess the US will dodge the bullet this time. But if the virus does hit us, we're simply not prepared for a Chinese style response. 

The tragic Diamond Princess saga  also seems to confirm (a) longer than expected incubation periods, (b) a high probability for transmission in a confined space and (c) general chaos in the official handling of this crisis. 

I am scared."
2020-02-19 18:00:06,"Wow.  The ""chaotic"" and downright irrational handling of the cruise ship quarantine echoes in some ways the behind-the-scenes mishandling of things in the early days of the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster.  What's going on with Japan's disaster management?  This is far from reassuring, especially with the Japanese Olympics looming."
2020-02-19 17:12:36,"It appears that the virus has been circulated in China since November 2019.  Now with the virus outbreak(s) on the cruise ships in Asia, it is becoming more obvious the proverbial cat is out of the bag.  

Is it time to move from containment to mitigation or are we too afraid of the economical impacts that such move would create?"
2020-02-19 17:56:13,"I must say that the Japanese have a terrible record of dealing with emergencies such as this!  Allowing  bureaucrats rather than medical professionals to organize the quarantine on that ship and thereby spread the virus among the passengers the way they did is an outrage.  When the Japanese doctor boarded the ship and was so horrified by the conditions on board, saying that nothing was organized properly to contain the spread of the virus among the passengers, I couldn't believe it.  Seems like the main focus was keeping the passengers off Japanese soil, ramifications for the passengers themselves be damned.  Now Japan is the world's third largest economy - there is simply no excuse for the way they handled this situation and the treatment of the passengers for 2 weeks on board what amounted to a prison ship full of infected passengers is just shocking in every way.  I'm so disappointed and angry at the Japanese government for having dropped the ball as they did, there's no excuse."
2020-02-19 17:36:16,"China: *Seals off cities.
Rest of the world: this is gross overreaction.
Japan: *Lets people off the boat after two week quarantine.
Rest of the world: this is reckless.

There's just no satisfying some people."
2020-02-19 16:41:02,"The stupidity of the bureaucrats is matched only by the courage of the health care workers, like Kentaro Iwata."
2020-02-19 18:17:39,"Nothing about this was safe. While it was reported on, the media seemed oddly reserved with respect to expressing concern until now. Even as the number of infected increased daily on that ship, the world seems to shrug. All the focus was on China bashing and highlighting every potential Chinese misstep. I fear that everyone has become so eager to see enemies fail that we are not learning from one another. I fear that there is not enough collaboration. But my greatest fear is that misplaced pride might result in  not following a successful approach because an enemy or rival did it first."
2020-02-19 18:42:26,"Is it safe?

Yes, if no pandemic develops and this is all just another mild flu.  

No, if a pandemic develops (many millions around the world catch it, some millions need hospitalization, and ~5% of those die).

The trouble is, we can't yet predict which way this will go and therefore it's a reckless move by Japan, Cambodia, and even the US for helping to spread the potential carriers."
2020-02-19 18:17:04,"All things considered, it is really hard not to see this development as stupid and dangerous.
China is locking up millions, Japan is apparently lax towards a bunch on the luxurious cruise which is a totally obvious breeding ground for covid-19.  What were they thinking?

Fortunately, internationally, the 'freed' people will have to be quarantined again."
2020-02-19 18:51:50,The irony of it all is that the one country in Asia that will  probably remained unscathed by the virus will be North Korea.
2020-02-19 18:12:18,I will forget about going there for the Olympics now.  Big mistake on the part of Japan.  Imagine going to the Olympics and getting this bug!!

2020-02-19 18:30:56,People are commenting without really knowing or understanding all the facts. There’s more to this than simply on/off.
2020-02-19 18:58:25,I hope the cruise ship owners are prepared for lawsuits.
2020-02-19 18:36:46,Another indication this event has exposed global and national infrastructures as a Potemkin Village is that every article written and published on this topic has raised more questions than they have answered.
2020-02-19 18:37:47,"""443 people had satisfied the terms of a two-week quarantine and let them walk free.""
     This is a very bad decision and does not make sense. To be on the safer side these 443 people should be on quarantine for another two weeks in a Japanese facility before they are discharged to the outside world.
    The Infectious disease specialist from Kobe University had visited the ship and he was describing the conditions in the ship as "" completely chaotic"". He was afraid that he himself might contract the coronavirus while on the ship. 
  Experts have expressed alarm over the quarantine protocols in the ship. 
   The Infectious disease specialist from Australia does not believe that things are being controlled completely and that these passengers should be put in another two weeks quarantine
    Many countries who have their citizens on this ship are not confident that the shipboard quarantine worked, and that more people could later test positive.
    The number of confirmed infections on the ship has reached 621 on Wednesday and 79 new cases have been added.
       In my opinion, the Japanese government is making a rash decision, these people are not safe enough to ride public transport and go home to their families without going through another quarantine."
2020-02-19 18:45:32,"The passengers should have been allowed to disembark immediately and moved to a quarantine facility in their country.  Given enough time, everyone on the ship would have gotten sick.  That didn’t seem to occur to anyone in authority.

Now passengers are being released who could very well be carrying the virus.  I would not want to be anywhere near them, on a city street - or on an airplane where the interior air is recirculated.

This was a huge mistake by the Japanese.  I fear we will be seeing the deadly results in the weeks to come."
2020-02-19 18:59:14,Too many of us on this planet now? Pandemic nature will decide.
2020-02-19 18:25:40,"I'm going to accuse the United States of a political gamesmanship too. The Trump administration is deeply afraid American citizens to dying on a cruise ship in Japan. The passengers might die anyway. However, you can't control the narrative of their death from a quarantined ship somewhere across the world. Bringing the passengers home was almost certainly the wrong decision. However, the Trump administration doesn't want bad optics during an election season. In all likelihood, we are all less safe as a result.

This virus is going to spread. However, the quicker it spreads, the more people will die. The idea is to limit the spread as much as humanly possible. Beginning with Cambodia, world leaders have apparently thrown in the towel. The US and Japan are right there on the same list."
2020-02-19 18:19:36,"The mistakes were made Day 1: no matter where they had to be moved, the passengers should have been taken off the ship immediately. A cruise ship is not a quarantine environment, not matter what you call it. The fact that hundreds on the ship have become infected was totally predictable.

It's hard to imagine the effects if this were a super-deadly virus like Ebola instead of Coronavirus."
2020-02-19 16:56:12,So today Japan let cruise passengers from Coronavirus cruise ship Diamond Princess walk free in Yolohama? How safe is that?  We don't have any idea yet how safe we are from the novel Covid-19 virus here in the US.  No point worrying about something we can't control! We're far more worried about the uncontrolled virus of our dangerous presidency in coming months.
2020-02-19 19:34:20,"I would like to see a graphic showing the cabins/areas where passengers became ill and tested positive.  There could be a lot to learn about transmission from this ship.

also have any of the ill been transferred to ICU care as seen in China?  I don’t recall reading that any passengers required that kind of response.  

clearly the ship was an incubator but it may be  less virulent than Wuhan.  It’s scary but too early to judge the true impact of how this situation was handled."
2020-02-19 20:13:42,"I lived in rural Japan years ago. I was impressed by how orderly and compliant everyone was. Everybody followed the rules.  It was amazing but also excessive. 

The problem for the Japanese comes when a situation arises which requires innovation.  I was appalled, for example, by the trash on the beaches. When I asked a local teacher why they weren't educating the kids to keep the beaches cleaner, the teacher looked offended: 

""That's not my job,"" he said."
2020-02-19 20:15:25,"Based on the skyrocketing infection rate on the ship, it is reasonable to assume that perhaps ~25% of the 443 released passengers could be carriers."
2020-02-19 19:41:28,Sounds like they are ready for Tokyo Olympic
2020-02-19 19:16:55,"Thought we had figured out a quarter of a century ago that cruise ships are not good quarantine locations. <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)91137-X/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)91137-X/fulltext</a>"
2020-02-19 19:47:46,"The way the Japanese handles the coronavirus spread on the cruise ship is very concerning.  What happens there is unbelievable and alarming!  All the countries should shut off the air travel out of Japan immediately, as they are doing to China, to stop the virus from spreading further and becoming a true global pandemic.  The US government, please, do it NOW to protect us in the US."
2020-02-19 20:13:48,"At the risk of angering others in the Infectious Disease world. This is, not to sound unscientific, but absolutely stupid. This is what happens when politics and politicians run science. That ship is Petri dish. You have to show no new infections within a quarantine period for it to be effective. If not you assume continued transmission. This virus is going to start spreading worldwide, by mid April we will see what policies like this and Cambodia have caused. Prime ministers are not Infectious Disease experts. None should be politically appointed. The WHO and CDC are broken. Who is the adult in the room???"
2020-02-19 19:27:38,"????

I'm looking to Trump to take necessary actions. It's great to have someone in the WH not beholden to making other countries feel good."
2020-02-19 20:00:35,"Clearly, this is insane.
We know this is a crafty highly contagious virus that is without doubt about to spread some more from letting people, and their stuff, just waltz off the ship. There have been many who test negative a few times and then test positive. What are the Japanese thinking and where is the WHO with some clear & stringent guidelines??"
2020-02-19 19:38:22,"Although China's response to the coronavirus was drastic, I strongly prefer an overcautious response to Japan's disorganized quarantine.  The only people the Japanese government seemed to be caring about were its citizens not on-board the cruise ship."
2020-02-19 19:52:21,"I thought of Japan as a highly competent nation, yet their handling of this crises was so unbelievably inept that my perception has dramatically changed. Telling the passengers out of quarantine that they're now safe to take public transportation???? Truly, truly shocked at Japan's complete lack of even common sense."
2020-02-19 20:06:45,"I am surprised Japan has no disease control agency.  How can that be in the modern world?  I believe Japan prides itself on having an orderly homogeneous society but that is no defense against biological ""weapons"" such as this coronavirus.

It is good that other countries are requiring the DP passengers to undergo quarantine before entry but there also should have been a quarantine upon disembarkation.  I listened to Mr (Dr?) Iwata's  account of the minimal to no infection control procedures aboard the Diamond Princess and I now understand why the disease spread so widely among the passengers, crew, and Japanese authorities.  Holland America  has a chief medical officer,  Dr Grant Tarling, who had to know what went on aboard DP was wrong.  Why didn't he speak up?"
2020-02-19 20:11:29,"You left out the part about the ship cutting the passengers out of the internet.  The TVs worked.  The crew was using cell phones;  but the passengers were told the internet is ""down"".  Friends of a friend were on the ship."
2020-02-19 19:30:10,"I wish there was some kind of international treaty that said that if the WHO determined something to be a pandemic, they would get called in to manage the whole process. This DIY method from country to country isn’t working."
2020-02-19 19:30:29,"The Japanese government doesn’t have an agency that deals with infectious diseases?

I have been reading that they have cases popping up with no connection to China and now all these cruise ship passengers are walking their streets. This does not bode well for the rest of the world. Wish they would have moved that ship back to China and they could have quarantined everyone there. There may be no Olympics this year.

Please Carnival do the world a favor: Give refunds and cancel cruises. Disinfect and park those boats for the time being."
2020-02-19 20:08:03,"Seems to me that the Japanese government ran a calculation and decided that the on-going PR nightmare of a ""disease ship"" parked in Yokohama Harbor was worse than the fallout from sending potentially infectious individuals back to their home countries...  They want that ship and the media attention gone."
2020-02-19 20:17:13,"Well-intentioned mistakes are still mistakes. The fact is that quarantines are hard to execute... people get antsy, and foreign governments breathe down your neck about their citizens. Biological agents do not forgive. We may be seeing the beginning of a massive and out-of-control worldwide pandemic."
2020-02-19 19:59:59,"I am glad that people won’t be trapped on the ship, with more and more getting sick, soon. But why does the CDC still say our US cases are 15? Surely with 14 Diamond Princess cases added on, the number should have gone up to 29? And I heard on the radio last night there was at least 1 more. But I don’t see any news of this? Also, some articles indicated the tests sent to states might be flawed and had to be returned? Are reporters asking the CDC questions about all this?"
2020-02-19 19:32:40,"Why does it take special expertise to understand that you aren’t cleared of suspicion of carrying a virus until you have been isolated from exposure to it for longer than the incubation period?
People on the cruise ship could have been exposed yesterday. And judging from the report from the doctor in this article, they probably were. And now they go about their business, touching fruit at the grocery store, sneezing in line at the bank..."
2020-02-19 19:55:43,"I fear the real reason is we are not being told the whole story . An infectious viral outbreak is difficult to control no matter what . People will disobey or break quarantine protocols either thru ignorance or a sense of self preservation . We will see more cases here in the U.S. and around the world , just a matter of time ."
2020-02-19 20:34:14,"Looks like, due to these choices, Japan will be the next big outbreak center.  Are they willing to take the same economy-crushing steps at containment that Wuhan is?
Every day, a new list of delayed test results will come back (like happened with the US evacuees), and they'll realize a new bunch of 20-50 per day of the released cruise passengers thought healthy were actually infected within the last few days, then scramble to try to find who've they've infected since riding the subway home."
2020-02-19 20:39:36,"Based on the German experience published the New England Journal of Medicine this is clearly not safe. Approximately 10 of them will test positive using a 2 week quarantine period in a high risk exposure conditions such as those existing on that cruise ship. Of course, these are tangential interpretations of limited data available."
2020-02-19 20:29:10,"So, what would you do with thousands of folks who are mostly foreigners, likely to get infected if not already infected, and will inundate your medical system with little or no compensation?  

Declare them ""safe"" and send them on their way out of your country."
2020-02-19 20:30:26,"My question is to NYT? You reported about China in  great  detail and its missteps, and why you  did not report about Japan  and its missteps in this virus  containment with same rigor. Japan needs  to account  for its mistakes."
2020-02-19 20:32:54,""" Japan declared on Wednesday that 443 people had satisfied the terms of a two-week quarantine and let them walk free.""
     The coronavirus infection should be taken seriously and these 443 people should be kept on quarantine for an additional two weeks in a facility in Japan before being released.
     The coronavirus is spreading at an alarming rate in China much more quickly than the SARS. Dr. W.Ian Lipkin known as a ""master virus hunter"" who helped fight the SARS outbreak in an interview with Anderson Cooper of CNN was saying that the coronavirus is highly transmissible than the flu virus or SARS.
     The lab test for COVID-19 is also new. There are deep concerns laboratory tests are incorrectly telling people they are free of the coronavirus. Stories in several countries suggest people are having up to six negative results before finally being diagnosed
       A study in the Journal of Radiology ( Radiological Society of North America) published recently showed five out of 167 patients tested negative for the disease by the lab tests despite lung scans showing they were ill. They then tested positive for the virus at a later date. What more can be done? CT scans,? they are expensive with radiation hazards.
    We know very little about COVID-19 because it's so new. This means COVID-19 is something of a wild card in terms of how far it will spread and how many deaths it will cause. This illness should be taken seriously."
2020-02-19 20:28:03,"There is no one at the helm in America and apparently in Japan who is attempting to stop this utter horrific incompetence and its deadly consequences.  

Where are the adults who are supposed ""leaders"" in our world?

Every person who walked off that ship needs to immediately be tracked down, quarantined and interrogated as to where they've been, who they were with and so forth since they walked off that ship!!"
2020-02-19 20:30:25,"You'd think that the way to do a quarantine would be that none leaves the ship until no new cases have been reported for the full incubation duration (14 days).
Harsh, but if you're doing a quarantine it is worse to do it halfway since you end up not controlling the infection but still impose significant hardship on the quarantined."
2020-02-19 20:41:06,"The Diamond Princess has been an incubating Petrie dish for the coronavirus for the last 14 days, and Japanese officials are solely responsible for 620 of the 621 confirmed infections on board the ship. If my recollection serves me correctly, a single passenger with the virus was removed from the ship two weeks ago and since then 620 other cases have developed.

To make matters exponentially worse, those same officials are now releasing 443 people from the ship based on the results of tests which may or may not be definitive at the moment.

I am appalled by the utter stupidity and recklessness of those officials, who represent a country I once thought to be unquestionably sophisticated and of sound judgment."
2020-02-19 21:01:07,"Wouldn’t it have been better to quarantine the passengers separately, rather than together on a ship? Expensive, but considering the stakes, it seems worth it."
2020-02-19 16:45:55,"This seems short-sighted of the Japanese and reflects a potential lack of understanding about how viruses, quarantines, and incubation periods work.

The biggest issue: The virus seems to be spreading on the cruise ship. As such, there could be people who were infected *less than* 14 days ago who haven't developed the infection yet. There could also be people who have it but are asymptomatic but still contagious.

The reality: A true quarantine can't really happen on a cruise ship. The passengers need to be isolated from the general population and also from each other -- no shared air, and serious thought to not spreading disease when delivering food and other necessities from room to room."
2020-02-19 16:43:54,"I, too, am an infectious diseases physician, and the description in the article convinces me that not only were the workers on the ship disseminating the virus, the so-called experts were doing the same. It sounds like a completely chaotic horror show.

There are strict protocols for donning and doffing protective gear. Done incorrectly, it is easy to self-contaminate. And it seems that the ship's staff were not in fully protective gear anyway, which would include, full body suit, booties, face protection, and head protection.  In addition, it seems from a just-published paper that asymptomatic individuals are capable of spreading infection. The end of this virus is nowhere in sight, in my opinion."
2020-02-19 19:28:54,"Hmm...

On a ship that had ONE infected passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong over two weeks ago, nearly one in six people are now known to be infected. All of them presumably being exposed directly and indirectly over the past two weeks, from that one initial person.

And now Japan has somehow determined it's safe to turn loose thousands of people who could've been infected at any point over the past two weeks but are yet to show signs of the virus' presence. Those people will be on buses, trains, and planes as well as in stores and restaurants and if even ONE caries the disease, they have the potential to expand the infected population exponentially among the public they come in contact with. After all, this entire cruise's mess started with just that one person.

I try not to be an alarmist, but geez. This just seems like it could be unleashing a disaster on the world that will be far more widespread than it is currently. Astonishing!"
2020-02-19 18:04:56,"Is that safe? Simple math provides the answer. No. The initial outbreak started with a very small number of people infected with a virus that (according to the best, current intelligence) originated with a species of bat, spread to a transfer host - possibly a pangolin - and then on to humans. If the early diagnosis had been acted upon properly we would not be currently talking about thousands dead, many more sick, and hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses.

At every step along the way a combination of perceived short-term interests and stupidity blocked a prudent response. Keeping thousands of people cooped up in a confined area such as cruise ships and then letting them wander away (as in Cambodia and, now, Japan) is an expression of that insanity. 

Why weren't these populations broken up into much smaller, manageable quarantine units where the risk of spreading the infection within the quarantined group was reduced to something close to zero? Keeping them on the cruise ships has been crazy. Letting them now wander off is even crazier.

Merely because the incubation period is two weeks that doesn't prevent someone who has spent the last two weeks on the Diamond Princess from having acquired the infection yesterday, showing no symptoms today, and spreading the disease in two weeks time as they now move without restrictions among unprotected populations.

How hard is that to figure out? People are now paying for this idiocy with their lives."
2020-02-19 18:01:50,"I don't envy the people quarantined, the crew members, or the officials in charge of containing the virus. One need only look at all the differing opinions and perspectives of the experts to realize that a universally agreed upon protocol doesn't exist. Obviously an amateur here, but the ship just seemed like a worsening situation. I wish they could have removed them from the start to an isolated military base. Get them out of that environment and provide support in a more controlled location with trained staff and a sterile (if that's possible) start. The news about the virus is scary...I think a lot of us are just waiting for confirmation it has jumped."
2020-02-19 19:21:55,"Cruise ships are closed floating temporary housing where the same air circulates unless you are on the open decks. Whose fault is it that there were passengers who were allowed in with Corona infection to spread it to other passengers? Once inside  a cruise ship whose fault is it to contain the infection from spreading to uninfected passengers? How long is an infected person exposing others to the infection? How meaningful is a 2 -week quarantine in a closed environment? Not much if within a 2-week period uninfected persons are continually infected. 

So what is my answer to loaded question about Japan letting passengers walk free after a 2-week quarantine. Japan was confronted by a very complex situation. Thankfully it did a humanitarian step that allowed the cruise ship to stay docked in its port and allowed those not infected to leave the ship knowing that they could be positive  in the future. Freedom to walk free from a ship with Corona virus infected passengers was certainly risky but with so many unknowns they did the right thing and any one faulting the Japanese authorities don't have valid reasons to be critical of a situation they are not in a position to judge. 

CDC experts from ATL are expressing alarm over the protocols on the ship. My question to CDC is are you going to evacuate the 621 confirmed cases of which 12 persons could die and treat them optimally in hospitals? Can the CDC say for sure that those who walked free may or may not be carrying the virus?"
2020-02-19 21:12:19,Did anybody become critically ill or die of Covid-19 on any of the luxury liners?
2020-02-19 20:55:09,"My simple thoughts, the olympics are now at risk, tragic"
2020-02-19 20:55:13,"Japan is clearly following China's initial response; ""not our problem""."
2020-02-19 21:13:50,"I read about one woman who self quarantined  and it was like wow how amazing she is! Is it really that hard for people to understand the situation, quarantine themselves and protect others?"
2020-02-19 21:23:55,Are the Japanese just giving up on containment? The Germans found that 2 of 114 people that initially screened negative later tested positive for the virus and their samples tested as infectious in caco cell assay. So they were without symptoms and were infectious. Very worrisome that there is reportedly community transmission ongoing in Japan before this news. It is very unlikely that the released passengers have zero infectious people in the group.
2020-02-19 21:06:50,Two questions I don't see much on.  First I see all kinds of cruise ads on tv and social media.  Is anyone at all booking now and are all the people with refundable trips on cruises canceling?  Second are people cancelling reservations for the Tokyo Olympics yet or were the reservations all nonrefundable?
2020-02-19 21:08:11,"Quite simply the Japanese government is making a bet that the virus detection procedure has a 0% false negative rate. Not being an epidemiologist I cannot judge how good a bet that is, but it is a daring one for a virus that was unknown to the medical community about two months ago.  It is apparent that the quarantine procedures aboard ship were a shambles. This seems to be the real purpose of releasing ostensibly virus-free persons to roam the country. Keeping them on board no longer was protecting them."
2020-02-19 21:21:00,"On a serious note; in the matter of so many testing positive but are asymptomatic, are we fully certain of the test? I don't wish to interject a lack of confidence, but perhaps the protocols and science should be peer reviewed extensively in light of the extraordinary circumstances this disease is presenting.

More specifically about the cruise ships; I'm reminded of the scene in the movie ""Jaws"" in which the marketing minded mayor of Amity Island roams the beach trying to assure the sunbathers it's safe to go back in the water."
2020-02-19 21:38:32,"Besides Japan, I'm also shocked by the lack of authority and action by WHO.  If the WHO is not ready and capable of taking charge and methodically organizing activities in a situation like this, then it speaks to a failure of one of its core missions as a world governing body.  When the crises is over (one can only hope), lessons should be learned and changes should be made asap."
2020-02-19 22:20:05,My father passed away in the hospital during the sars epidemic. Not directly from the virus but from the isolation. No visits were allowed. Unforseen casualty! He lost the will to live.
2020-02-19 22:46:53,"It makes very little difference what anyone does. It seems that it is quite contagious, and thus it is unlikely to be stopped. However, there is actually no evidence that it is any more deadly than a typical influenza. At this moment people are a bit hyper aware of the deaths but totally lost on just how many people have contracted it. It is my contention that the numbers of ill are way higher in China because most people there would not seek a doctors help. They would ride it out like most generally healthy people do with a flu. If I catch it I will take some tylenol and drink lots of liquids, and maybe be cognizant of whether I develop any breathing/lung issues, and if so, at that point would seek medical attention. Just like any old generally healthy person should."
2020-02-19 21:57:46,"Along with everything else stated here about the obvious insane decision to let people off without further quarantine...I keep coming back to the 14 days that everyone seems to be in agreement upon as the right amount of time in a more general manner. Is it? Do we know this for certain? Is this merely an educated guess as so much is? If so, many more warnings need to be in place for those getting off quarantine and possibly longer quarantines. This virus is a monster, one we must do everything in our powers to keep at bay. The WHO should be offering up stringent wise guidelines to everyone, say cruise ship owners and governments, and yet, so much is lacking in good advice it seems. Everyone is more concerned about the economy, about China, about sowing panic....Let us please keep public health - the desire to keep people worldwide from getting very sick and dying - at the front of all decision making. Everything else is secondary."
2020-02-19 22:29:25,"Are you watching this drama unfold, Stephen King? This would make a great fiction novel, a real horror story. Getting stuck on a cruise ship is bad enough, but this is stranger than life."
2020-02-19 22:37:39,"It's about time for NY Times to get ready to compare the COVID-19 to the H1N1 outbreak, trace the development, how governments deal differently with the spread, the fatality, etc. Already several reputable news outlets are doing it. Let's shine the light on how governments around the world should be prepared to deal with the next one."
2020-02-19 21:35:55,"With the deaths in Iran and the dispersal of passengers from the cruise ship fiascos in Japan and Cambodia, it is quite possible that COVID-19 is already circulating in the populations here and in Europe, or is about to. With that in mind, five days ago the CDC announced a surveillance program for COVID-19. In five cities (LA, SF, Seattle, Chicago and NY), any patients with respiratory disease who tested negative for flu (officially at near-epidemic levels) would now be tested for this coronavirus. Surely some results for that surveillance should now be available. Will they be publicized? In the face of a possible pandemic, will information be shared with the public or kept from us to avoid causing panic? Are there any restrictions now applying on the NYT and other media that were triggered by this public health event? I assume such restrictions would be unconstitutional but I know that, as in the case of shouting ""fire"" in a crowded theater, free speech has some limits to protect public health."
2020-02-19 21:47:01,"Remember how the Japanese Government mishandled the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011?  Does that give you a lot of confidence in their ability to safely and competently handle the quarantine of this deadly virus?

All too often, the Japanese Government has shown itself to be more intent on saving face than in saving lives . . ."
2020-02-19 22:14:35,"I have family living in Japan and I am distressed to see that the authorities have seemingly opened the floodgates releasing these cruise ship passengers. 
Just a few people with infections can quite literally start an epidemic where there was none. 
I fear for my family but I fear for all the folks in Japan. I have been to Japan twice and observed how clean the country is and really thought it would be a leader in the coronavirus fight. 
Extremely disappointed, to say the least. 
Wish my daughter and family would come back to the states until this virus is in hand on the continent of Asia. I don't care if I seem overzealous. I am worried."
2020-02-19 22:45:21,"There have been outbreaks of migratory communicable illnesses before -- SARS, Ebola... This is no one's first rodeo, as they say. 

I'm incredulous that the W.H.O. (who look like nothing more than a bunch of ineffective bureaucrats) doesn't publish and disseminate protocols for situations like this. Right now, every country is developing its own guidelines, often on the fly. There's no uniformity of action, which can only end badly. 

Infectious disease experts should take the lead on communicating best practices. I recall the C.D.C.'s dogged work during the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. Though their Director spoke recently, I know from a cousin who used to work there that a lot of high-caliber personnel left during an era of de-funding. This is the logical result -- a global health emergency, and no one in charge."
2020-02-19 22:19:08,Not looking good for Tokyo Olympic that’s coming up in a few months
2020-02-19 22:03:56,"First: This is about class! With the Cruise Ship Company being forced to maintain responsibility for something they couldn't handle. So the rich passengers were confined — the poor crew were made to keep WORKING! Circulating around the ship and interacting with each other and the passengers!

But at the beginning if the ship was the isolation site then BOTH passengers and crew should have been confined with a haz-mat equipped team from off the ship delivering food and medicine. 

Better still everyone on the ship should have been taken off the ship and quarantined immediately upon arrival in a place similar to the places in California where the Wuhan evacuees were kept, large, spacious, comfortable, isolated and observed by professionals.

Second it's about the OLYMPICS! Japanese bureaucrats wanted to keep the number of infected in Japan in the low double digits so they refused to allow anyone of the ship and in every press conference kept insisting that the ships numbers be kept separate from the Japanese numbers. They made decisions based on appearances and technicalities and not science or medical practice!

They kept headlines world wide on this ship and have now unleashed infected tourists to travel through the Tokyo transportation hubs. The results are obvious. They incubated the virus and then turned it loose.

No one will want to travel to the Olympics now because of the way these foreign travelers were treated by the Japanese government."
2020-02-19 21:34:30,"Did the Japanese make a mistake?
The Japan Times English newspaper reports:
""The evacuation began Wednesday of a cruise ship quarantined after an outbreak of new coronavirus COVID-19, with several hundred passengers who had tested negative being allowed to leave the ship.
 About 500 individuals, most of them elderly, disembarked from the Diamond Princess on Wednesday. Many of them took chartered buses provided by the city to Yokohama Station, while others hailed taxis or were collected by family members.""
"" At the Diet, policymakers continued to debate whether the quarantine should have been lifted and if passengers should have been isolated after they disembarked.""
During a Lower House Budget Committee meeting Wednesday, opposition party members criticized the health ministry for lifting the quarantine even as cases of infection continue to be reported aboard the ship almost every day.
  Kazunori Yamanoi, an opposition party member, questioned whether passengers should be allowed to return home, go shopping and go about with their lives.  “If any of those 500 individuals are infected, we won’t be able to contain it,”"
2020-02-19 23:07:58,"Given the high rate of transmission in such a tightly controlled environment as Diamond Princess, we might just accept the fact that COVID-19 will become endemic. Even if the staff of the ship didn't take highest level of precautions when distributing meals, they were clearly more vigilant than ordinary food servers in regions that are heavily impacted by the virus. With any luck, the virus will maintain its relatively light lethality until a vaccine gets developed. It seems totally unrealistic to keep millions of people in quarantine for an indefinite period of time. 

In the meantime, the Chinese authorities should use all their might to make sure that wet markets will never spread another novel virus."
2020-02-19 23:09:43,"Successfully managing new and extraordinarily challenging situations such as Coronavirus on a cruise ship - i.e. amped up crisis management - requires strong leadership, technical experts and some smart creative thinkers who have the ear of the leader & who the technical experts know are as valuable as they to devising an optimal solution."

2020-02-19 23:21:53,"I am going to Japan for the Olympics - which I have been attending for several years.

I think, I will still go to Japan for the Olympics but simply avoid Tokyo and the crowds.

There is a lot to do and see in Japan.  The NYT had carried a story about Fukushima advertising it as a tourist destination.

Having been to Chernobyl - with nuclear contamination - hard to believe Wuhan virus will thrive in Fukushima.

Might be the safest place to go during the Olympics.

As an aside, I have never liked cruises - the last one to Antarctica - a 21 day cruise - made me decide - never again on a cruise.

Wuhan virus and these stories has hit the final nail in that coffin."
2020-02-19 23:56:35,"Safe?  Obviously not.  We will now see a significant spread of the disease well beyond what we've seen so far. This includes South East Asia, Japan and the United States. It's a good thing that mortality is limited to 2%."
2020-02-19 23:58:37,"What seems to be missing from this article is a statement by of the protocol recommended by experts where passengers have the virus. contracted. If the experts differ, the article should compare and contrast how they differ. Then the experts' recommendations should be contrasted with what is actually happening onboard the cruise ship under consideration. Absent the establishment of a benchmark by experts, we are are left to mere conjecture and speculation as whether the procedures actually being followed are proper or harmful."
2020-02-19 22:58:04,"I Admire Japan and its people in so many ways. Really. But in this most unfortunate episode this great nation looks like some Standup Comedian, who realizes its own most miserable performance over a full two week on a very visible stage and then - in total Panik- starts to insult its audiance. It looks like some form of political Seppuku on TV. Should predictions come true and the virus spread from this ship  further into Tokyo, Japan and the World...PM Shinzo Abe might have to resign."
2020-02-19 23:20:08,"As a Tokyo resident this is a scary situation. News interviewed a Japanese couple who left the ship and returned to Kyoto. They said that they don’t want to be a burden on society and would do two weeks self-quarantine at home. That is great news.

Then on Twitter an American on board the Diamond Princess says he is leaving the ship today and will spend the next two weeks exploring Tokyo. 

All we can do is be careful of washing our hands, try not to touch our face, and try to eat healthful foods to help our immune system."
2020-02-19 23:56:29,"As an infectious diseases physician I must add my recommendation to that already made by my colleages;  let the Carnival Cruise Line, the Holland-American Line, and their sister cruise ship lines, which own over 50% of the world's cruise ships, re-name their palatial ships. What about the ""Coronavirus"", the ""Norovirus"", the ""COVID-19"", the ""Wuhan"", etc? And let us not forget the most clever name of all: the ""Asymptomatic Princess"". 

With these new names, I believe the cruise industry will gain a new sense of adventure, perhaps in the sense of Russian Roulette."

It could have been simply isolated but that would have forced the Chinese government to admit they had a problem.  The FACT that we are exporting the potentially ill back in to gen pop, is the best vector for the Kung Flu."
2020-02-19 23:56:47,Pretty serious stuff. I am wondering how many people had the virus and returned home before it was identified as such figuring they only had a cold.
2020-02-19 23:13:49,"In addition to the tragic health consequences for people impacted by the incompetent approach of Japanese authorities to this crisis, it has the very real possibility of derailing their ability to host a successful summer Olympics.  Perhaps that will finally get them to stop depending on bureaucrats and let experts take charge.  For one thing, Japan needs to establish a disease control agency now."
2020-02-19 23:42:22,"As stated previously, no nations is adequately prepared for a pandemic and all war game scenarios result in failed containments as political leadership focuses on individual civil rights rather than the existential pandemic threat to  national security.  Containment always fails as does quarentine.  Japan just stabbed itself in the neck by releasing so many asymptomatic carriers into the home islands.  The US is always incredibly naive and foolish in regard to how it is handling quarentines of 100s of people.  The absence of clinical symptoms is not necessarily proof that the individuals are not contagious."
2020-02-19 23:45:42,"Trust the Japanese government and business bureaucracy to manage this threat as well as they managed Fukushima. Well, actually. Don’t!"

The overreaction outside Hubei have caused more harm than good. Case in point, remember the cruise ship that was under quarantine in Italy but eventually let everyone go after giving the all clear? What made you think a 2-days quarantine and checking a single couple is good enough for all clear? Well, you aren’t worrying about it until I bring it up.

And notice how this is tied into American and European’s dislike of the Olympics. Athens, Beijing, London, Sochi, Rio, and PyeongChang all have overwhelmingly negative coverage leading to the game."

2020-02-20 00:39:03,"As a physician, I am appalled at Japan’s decision. The virus has up to a two week incubation period, so anyone aboard the ship could have contracted the virus very recently, not tested positive yet, and be released to roam. That person could easily spread the virus far and wide. Just wait and see..."
2020-02-20 00:50:29,"In all likelihood, Japan has already a self-sustained spread of the virus. Chances are, it is going to go around the planet, only matter of time."
2020-02-20 00:18:40,Japan should have built a large quarantine facility starting on day one of this ship's docking. Then move everyone to individual quarantine facilities on land where they cannot interact with anyone but the people that were in their own ship cabin from the beginning. Then wait 14 days and test everyone and release the negatives. These folks could have gotten infected in the 3 days between testing and release. Japan should feel shame at their approach to this. The home countries should refuse to accept these people into anything other than another 14 days of quarantine.
2020-02-20 00:24:45,"I guess Japan cannot afford to create quarantine facilities off ship.
Maybe Japan does not want to spend the money. But they will sell far fewer Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Subaru cars to countries that experience epidemics. Maybe Japan should wise up."
2020-02-20 00:45:09,"The worst isn't over with yet.  Cruise ships aren't the best places if people get diseases that can spread easy.  Nor are Airplanes.  Time will tell how bad this is going to get.  Though people got to leave, I'd not have let them into the general population just yet."
2020-02-20 00:31:32,"How many times have we heard of illnesses on cruise ships? It's an ideal breeding ground with thousands on one ship. I'm reminded of the TV show ""The Love Boat"". I'll bet it was on A.B.C."
2020-02-20 00:40:24,"I dont know if its safe to let them go, but it's definitely right. These people arent prisoners. To expose them to a closed ventilation system is to almost guarantee that they all will become infected. If more quarantine were needed, they should be sent to a hospital for observation. Contrast this with the outrage against public officials who wanted to restrict the travel of people exposed to Ebola, a far more lethal and infectious illness. Oh, but cruise passengers are privileged westerners, so that makes detention ok."
2020-02-20 00:41:44,"I understand that Japan does have people with the expertise to manage the problem. 

And I am shocked that they didn't use it in this case to manage the passengers during the the quarantine. Essentially, they didn't create a quarantine. You do not release a quarantine when there is evidence of active illness on a ship."

2020-02-20 00:31:47,"The Princess Line should rename the Diamond Princess the ""Petri Princess."""
2020-02-20 00:38:57,"Let me clarify something, Diamond Princess’ port of registry is London and the owner is Carnival Corporation & plc of Doral, Florida. This means the ship operates under British law at sea and the management is American.

The ship was in Japanese water on Feb 4th when 10 passengers was diagnosed with COVID-19 and the ship was put into quarantine in Yokohama. 

If you want to play the blame game as so many people are doing, the management is American and they did not handle the quarantine correctly as evidenced."
2020-02-20 01:21:51,"I cannot help but ask the previous commenters, those who I am assuming are reacting out of fear for their own health and would prefer that infected and uninfected passengers alike remain in this unsanitary, arguably dehumanizing environment, why does your life, your comfort and privilege matter more than others'? Does contracting or becoming exposed to a disease render a person less than human? Should said people be punished and exiled? Historically, many people, including those suffering from leprosy, HIV, and AIDS have been treated with less humanity than the Japanese government has so graciously been willing to extend to these coronavirus victims, not villains."
2020-02-20 01:24:10,"I have compassion for those who might be exposed or infected by the coronavirus.  



As perspective, however, many of those evacuated have arrived here in San Antonio at Lackland AFB,

I note that many local politicians and citizens seem to have more fear and anxiety about this “caravan” of travelers arriving by air than any putative caravan crossing the Rio Grande.  These “visitors” to Lackland are potential carriers of disease who are being released from “custody” without assurance they are benign to the rest of the population.  

And those who have such fear note that a wall won’t protect us from those with diseases at the AFB."
2020-02-20 01:25:20,This was the wrong decision.  It will come back to haunt them!
2020-02-20 01:24:59,"Most folks are worried of the cases we know, like the ones on the cruise ship. But what about the thousands who left Wuhan or other infected places via other modes before the lockdown?

I think the horse has bolted and its no use closing the barn door now. The best you can hope for is that you don't catch the bug this year and get a vaccine shot for next."
2020-02-20 01:33:37,"Who is responsible for the health and well being of the passengers legally? Is it the US government, the boat owner, or the Japanese government? The Japanese epidemiologist who entered the ship yesterday or the day before claimed that it was very poorly handled inside -that it wasn't clear where was a safe space and where infected passengers had been and he said therefore he was terrified to be there. But who has control over that situation? Is it the Japanese or the owner or the US. My wife is Japanese and I live in Japan. I was ready to put the blame on the Japanese but she suggested that Abe is weak these days and also has poor communication with the US government via Trump and thus things did not get done correctly. Is this more evidence of the impairment of US relations with its allies and further is the situation inside the ship the responsibility of the ship owner or the Japanese government or the US government legally? My guess is that Trump more or less ignored the situation after closing the borders to visitors arriving from China (which I applaud). My guess is that if Obama had been president the situation would have been far more organized and the outcomes better."
2020-02-20 01:39:21,"Given that there is no aspect of Japanese life is free of bureaucratic interference, and that most bureaucrats graduate from the departments of law at select, elite universities and go directly into the ministries without specialist training, knowledge, or experience, it's not surprising at all that they are responsible for creating what was essentially a disease incubator. Their primary concern was to limit the spread of disease to the Tokyo region, home to 30-odd million people - which they managed to do. Thus passengers were quarantined in place largely without regard to their individual or collective welfare, while protocols that should have been followed to stop the spread of the disease to those on shore were flouted out of ignorance."
2020-02-20 01:32:21,The handling of this situation by the Japanese bureaucracy confirms to me that former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn made the right decision to extract himself from systemic incompetence.
2020-02-20 01:34:23,"It's almost like the goal of keeping everyone prisoner on that cruise ship in Japan, was to wait until all of them were sick. They couldn't have planned it better, anyway. Somebody must have finally realized the utter futility of confining a large group of people together, while a new virus spreads....There are many reasons to avoid cruise ships, and this is just one more."
2020-02-20 01:43:27,"Based on my own experience living in Japan and having observed their bureaucrats operating, I can say they are very bad at improvising when circumstances demand it. What we have observed here seems to confirm that mindset and approach as has been stated by others, including experts outside officialdom. We can only hope the consequences of this will not be severe."
2020-02-20 01:49:05,"I'm puzzled why Japan didn't find facilities to take the passengers off the cruise ship and quarantine them at the outset.  Asking cruise ship crews, which consist to some extent of barely literate workers from world's poorest nations, to care for passengers without spreading the virus is nuts.  They are one of the most advanced nations on Earth, and keep their cities immaculate compared to ours, but it seems like they whiffed on how to handle these passengers."
2020-02-20 01:56:53,The people on the ship have been living in a disease incubator that could not have been designed better to support continuous contagion. Some people who walked off the ship will be infected. Living on a cruise ship is in no way a quarantine where people are effectively separated from each other for a period of time.
2020-02-20 02:12:26,Why were they let out?
2020-02-20 02:31:51,"I've been on a half dozen cruises or so and never been sick on one, though I can tell you that it would be hideous to be confined to one of the tiny rooms for even one day.  It's obviously a risk, but there's also a risk of getting sick riding in planes, trains, or buses, but you don't hear about those because you're off the plane, train, or bus before you've properly incubated your newly acquired infection.  Then there's school, work or going to the store.  Thankfully, if you acquire the corona virus in any of those venues, you won't be tortured onboard a ship at least."
2020-02-20 02:51:22,"We have a novel virus that spreads easily and can be asymptomatic.  ""Novel"" means theoretically no one can escape becoming ill.  

Of course quarantine needed to restart every time a new infection was identified.  Add to that, having a crew in close living quarters preparing and serving food was a ridiculous recipe for failure, since they would naturally be more likely to become ill and infect more passengers.

There was never any perfect way to handle this.  Getting people separated into smaller groups and having each group serve as its own quarantine group would have allowed at least a proportion of those on board to be properly vetted and released.  Between this and the boat that docked in Cambodia I suspect the time for shutting the barn door is long past.

In a situation like this, quarantine really serves to protect those not already exposed.  I'd expect that the best we can really hope for globally is to slow the rate of infection so as not to overwhelm medical facilities - that's the only way to reduce fatalities."
2020-02-20 03:01:16,"So we know that asymptomatic people can transmit the virus. This means that all these people leaving the ship are potential carriers of the virus and may in turn transmit the virus to anyone they come in contact with. How would you like to be on a plane across the Pacific with one of these people? 

What hasn’t been answered: how effective are the tests? Will the tests catch an asymptomatic carrier? Are the tests easy to accurately administer?"
2020-02-20 02:58:29,"We have now had people from this ship taken to an infectious disease hospital in San Antonio, 24 hours or so, after they arrived at Lackland AF Base.

I long for the days of real leadership and people who put science first."
2020-02-20 03:10:17,"I always learn new facts when I read the NYT comments section! But how disappointing to read that Japanese bureaucrats were in charge of the Diamond Princess cruise ship's ""quarantine"" of COVID-19 patients rather than medical experts.  Even accepting that diseases spread quickly in a ship's confined quarters e.g. the norovirus diarrhoea, it is alarming that appropriate medical expertise was not employed in this instance.  Also where was the British and US owners/managers' input into the management of this issue and duty of care to their passengers?

Australians that have been evacuated by our government from Wuhan and the ship have had to undergo a further 14 days quarantine period in either an off-shore detention facility or an unused miners village on the mainland before being allowed to return home.  The result is positive cases in Australia are under 15. 

It just shows that even a seemingly sophisticated and highly developed nation such as Japan is hamstrung by its culture (bureaucratic pre-eminence) rather than edified by science."
2020-02-20 05:50:58,"I live in Yokosuka, not too far from Yokohama, and am appalled at the fact infectious disease experts haven't been handling this dangerous situation. To let people off the ship after testing them several days before is insane. However, this isn't surprising to me, having lived and worked in this country for more than three years now. As was stated in the article, there are many examples of Japan's poor handling of natural disasters. I had a glimpse of that after experiencing several typhoons.  I'm heading back to the States in the Spring. It can't happen soon enough. I just hope I can stay free of Coronavirus before I leave."
2020-02-20 06:11:58,"It appears most western media rely on limited information on the situation in Japan, taking one YouTube post that went viral at face value. The person who criticized the handling of the Diamond Princess is indeed an infection specialist, but is also someone who tends to exaggerate things, had grunts for not being asked to be part of the control team, and spent only two hours on the ship and was asked to leave as he was confusing people offering his opinions that was not his role. There have been quite strong argument against the post (some facts but not realistic and others factual mistakes such as the situation is not dealt by experts.) The government, including another infection specialist in charge of the control acknowledge that the measures were not perfect, however, pointed out that perfect control is not possible in the midst of emergency with almost 4000 people on board and the need to deal with the situation in the given set up, against a virus we do not fully understand yet. The post was removed by the owner as was acknowledged in his own press conference."
2020-02-20 06:20:30,"I thought the way a quarantine should work is that everybody gets to leave when everybody on board was virus free for at least 14 days.  With the virus apparently raging freely thru the ship it would seem that every day of the past 14 there was a dozen or two new cases.  I’m also not sure why everyone wasn’t taken off the ship and quarantined  in separate rooms.  Group quarantine, with all support from untrained ship crew seems a total mistake."
2020-02-20 06:42:45,"Unfortunately this has been very badly mishandled and allowing hundreds of potentially infected people to scatter, was a grave error. Given that Dr. Fauci and other experts have concluded the entire ship was a hot spot as bad as Wuhan, means that containment is now probably lost. If it was not already. If China has actually contained the epidemic there, highly improbable, but if so, then soon they will be closing their borders to prevent it coming back."
2020-02-20 07:31:19,"If you want to get deathly ill, take a cruise especially with Princess Cruise Lines. My mother and I took a cruise to Hawaii from San Francisco on Princess and we paid hundreds of dollars for extra insurance. We both came down with bacterial infections, norovirus and ended up in the hospital. The infection spread to my appendix and it had to be removed with emergency surgery. In the hospital the nurse told me they get people from the cruise ships all the time. The cherry on top was when the cruise insurance refused to pay the bills we received on board and were supposed to be covered. Never again."
2020-02-20 08:19:09,"I went on my first cruise ever this past summer and loved it.   I've been on a few others since then (Caribbean and Panama Canal) and was excited to do more.  Oh well, it was good while it lasted.   Time to try something else."
2020-02-20 10:14:34,"I was born in Yokohama, spending the first 20 years of my life there. so I am more than a little astonished as the laxity of quarantine.  It was not always thus.  I remember well the case of a  Canadian cruise ship quarantined and not allowed to dock (it stayed just inside Tokyo Harbor for almost a month) when a passenger aboard contracted Cholera and died.  To my knowledge not a single passenger or crew member was allowed to leave the ship the entire time.  Because the dead passenger was buried at sea, no swimming in the sea was also permitted the entire time."
2020-02-20 03:58:29,My initial question is why did individuals choose to leave on this cruise when they were aware of the global situation already evident?
2020-02-20 06:08:29,"If anything good can come of this is that it serves as a wake-up call for all nations to have a plan.  With the right conditions and/or nefarious intentions, it could be so much worse."
2020-02-20 07:57:19,"Huge mistake the Japanese government are making. With the infections clearly occurring during the “quarantine” period, and early stage infections not being picked up by tests, this is a huge blunder by Japan. Thankfully most countries are imposing their own more stringent and tightly controlled quarantine arrangements. Japan however will be hit especially hard, considering the effect Covid-19 is having on the elderly. Very sad."
2020-02-20 08:24:23,"This situation revealed that Japan's Abe government cannot consider about worst case. besides,they often deceive society or world to make situation show optimistic and to conceal lack of their ability.
They dominate bureaucrats including judges or prosecutors through personnel affair, this self-righteous government's failure is directly linked to lost of whole country. 
but present Abe government never take responsibility whatever they cause.
They have learned nothing from failure of themselves or Chinese authorities,and exploits social unrest to try to build autocratic authority.
It destroy independence between administration and judicature,and can build autocratic situation that person of government and ruling party are never arrested and never punished whatever they do anything.

China, and Japan,
overconfident regime who cling to strengthen authority worsen situation."
2020-02-20 05:30:22,"I have just read the transcript from a Japanese infection control specialist who barely managed to get on that ship (they kept finding excuses not to let him aboard) before being kicked off again.

The conditions he found were horrendous in that there was no quarantine whatsoever, no separation between the sick and the healthy, no precautions taken  with surface virus transmission as items were passed around, masks and gloves rendered useless due to improper procedure, crew itself sick with fever, and the medical staff was no better protected.

The specialist, who had worked with diseases like Ebola without fear because he knew what safety measures to take,  was terrified during this brief inspection
due to the total chaos on board, and is now self-quarantining himself in case he has picked up the virus."
2020-02-20 10:24:57,"This is an international failure to prevent the spread of this illness. The passengers on this ship should have been quarantined effectively off the ship from the get go. Now, after the failed quarantine they should not be released to spread this dangerous disease. They should now be put in an  effective quarantine. I fear this will be be seen as the most significant failure to stop the spread of this disease."
2020-02-20 04:04:13,"Japan has proven the Cruise ship had been a good incubator for the virus which had infected 1/3 of passengers and crews. In addition, there are many none symptomatic flu carrier will be spread around the world for additional round of new infection."
2020-02-20 06:26:26,"We have been on four fabulous cruises on Regents.
I was ill on every cruise at some time on all of them.
Just being close to folks, and having our butler ill and he
gave me his cold or flu...I will never ever do a cruise again. 
Ever ever again."
2020-02-20 07:21:52,It is difficult to know what to think about this disease.  No cases in Africa despite 1 million Chinese Belt & Road and other workers.  Virtually no cases in India.  Only two known cases in Iran both of whom died whereas a mortality rate of 2% suggests another 100 or so are undiagnosed.  Really odd
2020-02-20 10:45:03,"Japan does “... not have a government agency that specializes in disease control”, but they have a Vice-health Minister?
Sounds like a contradiction."
2020-02-20 05:09:21,"Japanese Abe Govt increased foreign travelers but had lacked enough preparations against infection disease.
They spend immense tax and political resource to buy costly military equipment,on the other hand,they had reduced budget of staff about countermeasure against infection disease.

Japanese conceit prime minister and arrogant chief cabinet secretary repeat that ""our behavior is always proper"".
Japanese health minister and ministry still try to make risk or spread of infection show small.
They prioritize to defend the face of prime minister than health of people,could not change policy about Corona virus,and had increased latent infected people.
Japanese Abe Govt who want autocratic power have repeated failure like China.
Japan became second epicenter of Corona virus clearly.
Even ""official"" number of domestic patients except cruise ship passenger in Japan is largest next to China.

Japanese Abe Govt don't say clearly what they can or cannot,what is possible or impossible.
They still repeat ""proper"" about everything of their behavior to Corona virus But Canada,US,South Korea,Hong Kong,Australia have re-quarantined passengers more 14 days in their countries.
it show that Japan's countermeasure is not enough."
2020-02-20 06:18:20,"Japanese Abe Govt had prioritized revenue from Chinese travelers and consideration to Chinese Govt than citizen's health and safety.
Until a few days before,Such Govt of host country of Olympics 2020 had restricted range of Corona virus inspection with considering influence to tourism and Olympics.
It is only ""person who came from Wuhan"" and ""person who spent hours with person who came from Wuhan"".
This policy had increased many latent patients in Japanese society.
Even people who feel subjective symptom could not inspect that they are Corona virus carrier or not by Abe Govt's policy.
it delayed treatment and had caused first victim.
therefore,""official"" number of Corona virus patients in Japan is understated.

Countermeasures of Abe Govt of Japan against Corona virus are still haphazard and sloppy and insufficient and too late.

Japanese Abe Govt repeat that ""Japanese Govt's action is proper"" despite many infected persons,they never admit defects.
They are like Chinese authorities."
2020-02-20 06:34:56,I would not trust the declining number that China had reported. Anything coming from China is never to be trusted.
2020-02-20 03:25:51,So is the U.S. testing all passengers coming to the U.S. from Japan? Seems like they should be. They could have been infected anywhere while in Japan based on this news.
2020-02-20 07:34:17,These enormous cruise ships are an abomination for many document ecological reasons.  I personally hope that their role in spreading this pandemic will eventually lead to their failure as a continued industry.
2020-02-20 13:35:36,"I am by far no expert on this topic at all; nevertheless, I think that it may not have been the best idea to release hundreds of passengers from a ship infected with Coronavirus. I understand that the passengers that were released had no symptoms of the virus, but they were quarantined on a ship that had hundreds of other people that did show symptoms. They could have easily been infected with the virus. We also do not know how long it has been since they were last tested. The uninfected passengers could have gone multiple days being exposed to the virus after testing negative. This could change the results of their test. I am glad that the uninfected passengers could be released from their quarantine on the ship; however, was it really the right decision to let them go back into the world without being retested?"
2020-02-18 16:01:56,I know it's not funny but I have to bitterly laugh at the fecklessness of the Chinese dictatorship.  I wouldn't be surprised if this started at the Wuhan pathogen research facility.  I certainly don'[t believe a word that comes from the dictatorship.
2020-02-18 16:34:30,"I haven't been a fan of using this epidemic as an excuse to throw barbs at Beijing... but Ms. Li's article points out something important. Xi's biggest promise to the Chinese people was to stamp out corruption... but corruption is alive and thriving. Yes, we have plenty of corruption in the US, with our president giving it a new aura of legitimacy, but corruption is endemic on all levels of life in China. People who migrate from China to the US often say that the thing they like most about the US is being free of the petty everyday corruption that pervades life in China. 

Xi has never made promises about 'freedom', but he has talked a great deal about ending endemic corruption. If corruption is now costing lives in this epidemic, let's see if Xi can make good on his promise. 

Thanks for your reporting Ms. Li."
2020-02-18 16:37:05,"The initial ideological ineffective management by CCP apparatchiks  made the Chinese governmental bureaucracy look too political to efficiently manage this crisis. But to be fair, Americans need only look to the incompetence of our own government's mis-management by political appointees. (George W.Bush's ""great job Brownie"" or Trump's FEMA responses in Texas and Puerto Rico.) Unforeseen natural disasters are always shockers even for reasonably competent administrations. When the ignorant take charge of what they know so little about the problem is usually worsened. How would Trump, this Congress, and our current bureaucracy have reacted if this virus first appeared in Houston or Washington?"
2020-02-18 16:40:24,"Surely if we in the US had an executive branch which had maintained alliances and had a strong, compassionate concern for the welfare of our entire planet, that President would be right now calling world leaders and organizing a worldwide response to this virus, based upon scientific information and the best practices of the WHO and CDC.

There would be calls for each nation to pledge what it could to fight the virus.  Not just on their own shores but across the world.

Such a President would ask that the UN hold a special session to deal with this.  

Such a President would pledge billions to assist other nations, especially poor nations with little healthcare infrastructure.  

Neglecting to use every tool available to the White House and Congress as well as calling on world leaders, the UN, world organizations to respond to this virus as we have responded to world catastrophes, like earthquakes and tsunamis and famines.

We have the tools.  We need to use them."
2020-02-18 16:54:11,"I'm not sure what to make of this article really. It brings up a lot of points but frames them with a lot more commentary than facts. Maybe the author doesn't have the resources to do any better than list random, partial facts tinged with opinion or just doesn't have to because the American public is conditioned for ideological critique? I can't say but from what I've seen of US emergency organisation I'm not convinced it's in a position to pass judgement."
2020-02-18 17:09:28,"extraordinary that the Chinese government, the CCP, seems to handling this as a public relations problem followed by a respond and control drill first, rather than an all hands on deck medical emergency.  That they are set up as an authoritarian dictatorship to protect themselves, rather than the Chinese people, has never been plainer."
2020-02-18 17:14:43,"The basic logic behind the Govt’s response to self-organised relief measures is that, there shouldn’t be more than one Chef in the kitchen. To a certain extent, it makes sense because without a central command to coordinate, there could be chaos and confusion. The only problem is that the Chef insists on doing everything by itself that it is not utilising all the help that is available. 

The other problem the author identified is that with the centralised command structure, nothing gets done at the local level without approval from higher up. That essentially paralyses the response in the face of a crisis. Xi’s centralization of power has significantly  worsened this problem."
2020-02-18 17:30:53,"Laurie Garrett, the former Newsday reporter who covered the SARS and Ebola outbreaks, probably knows as much about emerging virus threats as anyone. 

I heard a couple of her videos  
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nSlHKcEnIQ"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nSlHKcEnIQ</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lJvr5UL2pQ"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lJvr5UL2pQ</a> 

Garrett said that the international emergency organizations performed training exercises to see what would happen if they had to deal with a new viral outbreak. 

The main lesson they learned, and the main problem they discovered, was lack of coordination. In an outbreak like this, you need a panel of experts with an overview of the entire operation, seeing problems come up and figuring out how to solve them. It's like D-Day. 

Instead, nobody was in control. In the US federal government, different agencies assumed control of different aspects of the problem -- the NSA handled ""security"" issues, the CDC handled other issues, but in general nobody knew what to do and different organizations worked at cross purposes. Shut down factories and people can't get masks. 

Who decides whether to shut down schools, workplaces, or transportation? In the training exercises, sometimes federal agencies, local agencies, mayors of towns, police chiefs. People just assumed authority. 

So the answer to this article is: Yes, there are problems with central control. But there are problems with decentralized control. The Chinese made a reasonable decision. They had problems, but that doesn't mean it  wrong."
2020-02-18 18:09:18,"China needs to address the cause of this outbreak - the eating and handling of exotic animals needs to be re evaluated.

“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”"

That said, it seems that the current epidemic could take place only there, unlikely anywhere else ..."

Both Covid19 and the US2016 elections show us  globalization absolutely cannot continue with corrupt, brutal, anti-liberal, authoritarian partners like China and Russia. 

Those countries must modernize and relinquish their totalitarian governments, lest they destroy tens of thousands of their own people with willful incompetence, or, more ominously, infect the globe via their greed-driven policies  which deliberately underfund medical and hygiene infrastructure."

Anyone selling anyone else any other story at the very least, is just kidding themselves."
2020-02-18 19:05:39,"This could be Communist China's equivalent of the Chernobyl disaster that revealed the inabilities of the USSR. Gorbachev claimed later, that was one of the factors that broke the ordinary Russian's trust of the system. Mao could handle the failures of the Great Leap Forward through sheer violence and Xiaoping could crush the student protests 1989 by running them over tanks. But I believe that Xi Jinpeng -as Gorbachev - both of them of a younger cadre than the old school die hards cadres, will find it difficult to put the genie back in the bottle when the system has exposed it weakness to a younger generation of Chineses. So maybe a good side effect of the disaster could be the collapse of the Communist rule"

2020-02-18 21:05:18,Why have we not heard that the virus is a US backed biological warfare attack? We have the capability. We have the motive. And it is working. And it would be an excuse to cover the Dictators poor performance. Maybe it is??
2020-02-18 21:34:16,"Based on press reports, the spread of COVID-19 is a major challenge to control in China.  However, the Chinese effort has actually brought the world time to develop plans and hopefully medical treatments to prevent this from becoming a full blown 
pandemic. In the short term, world governments should invest the resources needed by the Chinese to combat the virus there.

Meanwhile, the U.S. government, need to engage in a robust information campaign to ensure that the public is aware of  efforts underway to prevent the spread of the virus here; and how the 
  people can protect themseves. 

At this time, the nation does not need propoganda, misinformation or wishful thinking, but truth about what we are dealing with.  We are all able to see, through various information sources,  how bad the virus is impacting the population of China;and it is naive to have the allusion that is can not get that bad here.

We need to demand that the Trump administration reinstate the funding for the very science, including pandemic response teams, needed  keep us safe from viruses expected to emerge in the future.  Also, there should a major outcry for our government to expend the resources necessary to address the climate crisis before the world is out of time. 

 The source of COVID-19  appears to be a scientific hypothesis at best.  Science can not even make an  educated guess regarding yet unknown viruses waiting to be released as a result of melting ice caps."
2020-02-18 21:37:34,"No doubt, it’s fair to criticize Chinese leadership, but our own authorities allowed passengers on a cruise ship to get off in Cambodia and board planes for the U.S only to discover that one of their fellow passengers had the virus.  It is unclear at this point whether or not authorities kept any record of where these travelers were headed or what airlines they were flying or if the authorities simply sent them merrily on their way and are now scrambling to track them down.  We will see in the coming weeks how well our government handles this crisis, but given that we’re in the hands of a man who doesn’t trust experts and whose administration already suffers from chaos, it’s easy to imagine things can get out of control quickly in the U.S., too."
2020-02-18 22:07:56,Alright already. Stop the criticism of the Chinese system and efforts to control the virus. It's no longer news. We will know more in a year or two when this difficulty is systematically studied. That is the time we can learn from it.

The government is fearful of the people and the people are fearful of the government.  The government tries to do everything to control the people and their thoughts.  

The article actually accurately reflects my sentiment / the reality.  Just the title doesn’t make sense.  The government has not been an ally of the people since the 1950’s, 10 years after the popular movement brought the communist into power.  Making the title “China Sidelines a potential ally” would be more accurate."

2020-02-19 00:12:41,"Democracy and transparency is not appropriate for every country especially not for the world's most populated country that became communist after world war II. China has been rising after it became a capitalist country with communist rule and is today the 2nd most strongest economy. China is self sufficient in food production and housing. Are there poor in China today? Yes there are but most have essentials and I never saw more than a few homeless beggars while walking along the great wall and hardly any in the 10 cities, I visited. As Bob Tonnor from Australia has commented, China has lifted millions out of poverty.  and has several millionaires. 

China is not perfect and neither is any other country in the world. The closest to perfection in my humble opinion is Switzerland. It minds its own business, it is an ideal neighbor to 7 surrounding countries and has no enemies. Every citizen serves the country in meaningful way and takes responsibility for keeping their surroundings clean and its air clean. Switzerland is a true democracy where citizens not only elect their representatives but also have a direct referendum on how the budget is divided. Imagine if we the people had an opportunity to have a say in our budget instead of representatives who play dirty politics and Kow tow to lobbyists. You don't have to be a billionaire to run for elected office or to have a fighting chance to be elected.

They have impressed their friends and families with their happy wealthy life. Now this unexpected epidemic causes them a lot of trouble and inconvenience. And once all these masks arrive in their depots, of course they must consider where to direct them: to those doctors and nurses who they may never have to deal with in their future lives, or to the local government, who will show gratitude by protecting and spoiling them in the future.

Although China is the 2nd largest economy, but it is still a developing country simply because 1.4 billion people is tough to deal with.   Just like Ohio State or U. of Michigan, which could be the biggest school in US, but it doesn't mean it is the best school.  It will take time to nurture and educate  Chinese to the level in par with the developed world.

Chinese government is doing an incredible job to lock down cities over 33 million people.  It essentially traps the Coronavirus patients in Hubei province and not let them going out and spreading the problem.

2020-02-20 14:03:28,"The Diamond Princess quarantine strategy was a disaster from the get go.

Mixing a growing number of infected passengers with previously heathy passengers, made no sense.

Now, everyone is a potential carrier when they leave the ship, and most if not all must enter another quarantine period. On shore.

Instead of keeping everyone on the ship for 14 miserable days, they should have categorized people into smaller groups and brought them onshore for quarantine. From the start."
2020-02-20 13:59:11,"It boggles the mind that the Chinese government changed the criteria for counting Coroniavirus cases yet again! This makes it even harder to tell whether we are turning the tide on the virus or not! I don’t even work in health care, and even I can figure that out! 

The Chinese Communist Party is beyond inept. The only thing they care about is making sure they look good so they retain a grip on power. Meanwhile, the health of the world is at stake and they will have the blood of thousands on their hands."

A short time later a passenger from the ship who had flown to Malaysia was found to be infected by the virus. Holland American Lines insisted she be retested, and she was _again_ found to be infected. Physicians believe it is possible she might have infected other passengers.

After the initial infection was confirmed, an American man who had worked on the Westerdam and was confined to his hotel in Cambodia, bragged on YouTube that he sneaked out of Cambodia and returned to the USA. The story was verified by a Washington State news source. He claims to have been ""cleared by the CDC"" and insists that he has no symptoms. 

This is how epidemics spread and become pandemics."
2020-02-20 15:03:28,"Now that the Diamond Princess situation has led to loss of life, it is going to be hard to escape a liability situation of some sort or other.  I feel that Princess Cruises is not 100% blameless in this because they learned of the first cases diagnosis sometime between 30 Jan and 1 Feb, but chose to continue cruising as normal till arrival in Yokohama, instead of limiting passenger contact at that point to curb spread. The minute crew members were found to be infected, there would also be a need to isolate not just the other crew sharing their sleeping quarters but also the passengers served by the crew who had fallen ill.  Granted there isn't a lot of real estate on board but the public rooms aren't in use so they could be converted to temporary crew quarters. Japan should also have mobilized local caterers to provide the food in order to minimize sick crew handling food that becomes a vector throughout the ship. Keeping people feeling ""on vacation"" in an emergency like this has been costly in the toll of not just deaths but the 29 serious cases from the ship"
2020-02-20 16:27:34,"Japan did not consult an infectious disease expert to investigate the cruise ship quarantine protocols prior to releasing the passengers. 
An infectious disease dr from Kobe voluntarily went on-board and found many problems and said the quarantine system was chaotic. When he returned home he put himself in isolation away from his family and coworkers. 
He warned of the dangerous decision to allow the untested passengers to go free into the Japanese population. 
Japan respects the chain of command in their bureaucracy to a fault. Decisions are made by people who don't know what they are doing simply because they are the next person in line, the boss. 
I think this is a perfect example of a bureaucrat who was in charge and made a terrible, rash decision."
2020-02-20 16:53:50,"Why is the CDC reporting the cases in the U.S. only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday?  Why are there only 52 cases pending, and a total of only 427 tests done since January 21, 2020?  The CDC keeps saying transmission is not occurring in the USA, but how can they say that when they are not looking? At this point I’m concerned that American health care workers with pneumonia of unclear etiology are not being tested for SARS-CoV19. I keep hoping the press will start looking at what we are doing and not doing. I think the concerns about causing panic exceed the damage caused by lack of transparency. 

I understand the current test has many false negatives, especially when throat swabs are used and not nasal swabs. I understand home isolation of suspect cases is a solid public health procedure. I worry public health officials are being overconfident in their approach. The death toll is not the only issue, the 20% who get really sick is the terrible part. Our health care system will be overwhelmed leaving heart attack and stroke victims waiting. Health insurance companies are being awfully quiet about their plans."

Chinese meat markets and international smuggling of numerous wild and often endangered animals is at the root of this outbreak. Without stopping this criminal activity, unknown viruses will appear in regular intervals. China has to finally take efficient measures to stop the repetitive initiation of pandemics after 20 years of inertia. Prevention means abandoning some pseudo-traditional food habits for the sake of world health. We have to make this clear to the Chinese government and tie it to trade-relations."
2020-02-20 21:13:45,"2 of the cruise ship passengers who were infected and let off the ship  said the coronavirus response was blown out of proportion and that the flu kills more people than this virus does.  Correct on that matter but its many times more deadly  and is even more contagious than the flu and to think one of the two commenting is a nurse.  I suggest that this person go back to nursing school and study harder,  this type of lackadaisical attitude is what will cause a world wide pandemic.  Stupid fools.  The U.S. is ripe for a massive pandemic.  Just think,  the low percentage of people not even washing their hands after using the bathroom guarantees  a pandemic.  Wash your hands; don't wear a mask is the mantra pushed by medical professionals.

They were included on the map for a hot second and now they've mysteriously vanished. Everyone keeps claiming and reporting that China is trying to minimize the # of infections by changing the way cases are counted. Isn't America doing exactly the same thing by keeping those Americans classified as part of the ""Other"" category instead of including them in the general American count of cases?

With so much expertise and journalists, what unfolds in Daegu will teach us a lot about what strategies work and whether if the virus can be contained once it spreads into the population. It may just be that we're going to see a pandemic, and we'll have to live with the virus and pivot towards treatment and vaccine."
2020-02-21 00:46:09,"Western resistance to quarantine is based on historical abuses, some of which were racist while others simply reflected the likelihood of transmission within sequestered communities and the crowded living quarters of sojourners who understandably lived with maximum economy.  But guilt is not science.  Quarantines have been used and useful for centuries, and can now be conducted with the aid of informed science instead of just fear.  Hand washing is effective but mostly voluntary and creates vulnerability through non-compliance.  Isolation is effective until latency outruns it.

And some may show that all this quarantine was over done.

And if response to it was similar - and more, crucially, not panicky -  to a flu epidemic might have been more effective.

Also, earlier reports have shown that Wuhan virus is most effective in cold weather or environment.

What does that even mean.  I am relatively certain, also, it is not the case that fewer infections by this virus occur in people whose immune systems are more ‘exuberant’.  Is this the kind of science explanations we can expect from the experts, that there is a genie in certain people who thereby spew more germs; a genie that makes some people’s immunity stronger?  Are we to believe of all the data from thousands of cases globally, that the so call experts cannot identify the patterns of transmission?  Maybe we need to jettison the change agents and newly baked engineers at NIH and WHO, etc., and get some real medical researchers who know how to figure out this epidemic.  One thing in this article is crystal clear, that the experts cited therein appear to know nothing, thus their reliance upon euphemisms to explain something that needs hard science.

Amazing transparency. Well done President Xi. No country has ever been as transparent as China and the CCP. - WHO"
2020-02-20 14:00:57,"China handled an incident in 2004 that enlightens.

In April 2004 the SARS virus escaped a BSL3 lab in Beijing at least three times.  That led to doubts about the biosafety and biosecurity at Chinese virus labs.  China invited WHO experts to the lab to analyze the incidents. WHO investigators had full access.  China had been accused of not being forthcoming and forthright in the 2002 SARS outbreak.  The new outbreak of SARS in Beijing was the fault of a series of flaws at the CDC's National Institute of Virology.  Other lab scientists wanted details about these new 2004 SARS infections and how the virus escaped the lab.  That was their opportunity to learn.  That information was not disclosed.

Nearly 16 years later.

Why hasn’t China allowed WHO investigators to access the Wuhan Institute of Virology BSL4 labs - although some suspect the new coronavirus might have started there?   Investigators could rule out the lab as being complicit or implicate it.

Instead, the visiting WHO team were shown only the Wuhan Airport, Zhongnan hospital, Hubei provincial CDC, including a BSL3 laboratory in China’s Center for Disease Control (CDC)."

Part of the reasons is due to fear of Coronavirus spreading.  Another reason is due to local bureaucracy who are preoccupied with the virus.  Economy recovery is a secondary objective for them.  Sacking two top officers in Hubei province, the epicenter of Coronavirus, by Xi Jinping due to incapable of handling the crisis is not helping the economy either.  

Just learned from Hong Kong news, Xi Jinping has started demanding local officers to pay attention to economic matters, not just virus alone.

But sooner or later, the Coronavirus will die down, and of course in the meantime many patients will die.  It will be the price to pay for the ineffectiveness of local government and bad eating habits of wild and exotic animals."

Furthermore, why are we removing people from a quarantine, known to have a large number of active infections of a highly contagious virus, without taking every precaution to ensure that removing people won’t put others at risk of infection?! Doing so completely defeats the purpose of a quarantine, and unnecessarily and recklessly puts others at risk. 

Seriously, DO THEY UNDERSTAND the concept of a QUARANTINE, or INCUBATION PERIOD?! I’m guessing they don’t because they’ve just brought a virus to America which has infected more than 70,000 and killed over 1,700...and I’m not at all confident that they’ll be able to effectively quarantine people here, since they just removed those people from a perfectly effective quarantine for no discernible, justifiable reason.

The US economy economy is growing at a paltry 2.3%.  Our manufacturing sector is contracting because of the tariffs.  (Most US growth is in the service sector).  Trump wants to restrict the flow of technology into China which is a chief US export.  China, the world's second largest economy, has been slowing because of the tariffs.  Now this virus has shut them down.

The US cannot carry the global load with only a 2.3% growth.  Everything is in place for a global recession to set in.  If the world does not manage this situation properly, that will happen.

The tariffs are taking their toll.  I'm in the consumer electronics business and parts have risen 30%.  What used to cost 6 cents is now 8 cents, no big deal.  But what used to cost $3.50 is now $5, very big deal.  What used to cost $9 is now $12, what was $2.50 is now $3.25.  

This increases are destroying profit margins and we can't raise prices in a soft economy, and especially, in the face of foreign competition who can get the Chinese parts tariff free.  China supplies the entire world with electronic parts.

Trump doesn't learn nor do his supporters. The process of measuring and predicting can be applied to human populations as well. 

The economies of the world relied on cheap goods from China but the tariffs slowed that down and now the coronavirus halted a lot of purchases and trade altogether.

2020-02-17 15:55:41,"It won't be contained, and it largely isn't as bad as some people suggest. They don't really know how many cases there have been and they don't know what the fatality rate is. If you look at reported deaths and cases one might think the death rate is as high as 2%. However they reported that 1700 healthcare workers have contracted the virus ( a number that is likely to be accurate since they are the ones who administer the test) and there have been 6 deaths among this group. That means a death rate of 0.35% which is far below 2% but somewhat higher than a normal influenza which has a death rate of about 0.1%.

I don't know who these folks think they are fooling. They have no way to stop it. It's too easily spread and they are not going to shut down their economy to prevent deaths in people. The only thing they care about is the economic costs. Just like in the US, the fear is economic, not that people will die."

2020-02-17 16:28:21,"I spent 5 years working in a Chinese supply chain. Trust me. This is business as usual. We're at most a week behind schedule right now.

As a rule, we operated with an 8 week lead time for anything ordered from China. 6 weeks delivery minimum plus 2 weeks safety stock. Everything was late anyway. However, for Chinese New Years, we bumped the lead time to 16-18 weeks depending on the year and those orders were placed well in advance of the holiday. That's how business in China works.

In other words, we haven't actually seen the economic impact of the virus yet. Everything is speculation.

Will workers return to work with their usual tardy fashion? Travel delays are a perennial excuse for late 1st quarter deliveries. I'm sure we'll hear the excuse in 2020 with the word ""virus"" added to the same rambling explanation. Would you please pay for expedited shipping? That's where this story goes.

The question is when does a highly contagious, pneumonia-like virus start really interrupting manufacturing lines. The obvious answer: When employees start getting sick. Transportation isn't the issue. The problem is highly labor reliant industries. If the workforce gets sick, there's nothing China can do to replace them. More people only equals more illness.

I guess the US will begin feeling serious repercussions around July. The disease will peter off in Summer hopefully but the damage to supply chains will happen months earlier. We haven't seen the worst yet."

2020-02-17 16:35:19,"Confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been reported from almost every major region in the world. Every region except Sub saharan Africa. This is in spite of the fact that this region has several major Chinese projects which are part of the one belt one road program, with large numbers of Chinese workers, and significant Chinese expat populations.

Either this entire region has miraculously escaped unscathed, or the healthcare system there is unable to detect and isolate cases. This would mean that this infection is currently spreading widely in that region and we will see a surge in deaths from respiratory illness there in the next couple of months or so.

China and other countries with a good healthcare system may be able to contain this virus. It is Africa I am worried about."
2020-02-17 16:47:06,"Without trying to sound cynical, but imagine if the EU and Trump had been friends now when China is weak. I know, it is a terrible thing to say, but one thing that the Coronavirus has illuminated, apart from the fact that there will always be a new unknown that hits humanity,  is how entangled the world economy is. Not long ago there were cries about China's dominance and now many countries, and companies, are praying for China to open for business again.

To loop back to the top of my comment: A united EU and US would always be more able to adjust the balance of power together when working together and it is situations like this, when there are disturbances in the ""business as usual"", that most changes are being made."
2020-02-17 16:52:50,"Remember how the U.S. and E.U. credit system locked up during the 2008-2009 financial crises and banks and financial companies were afraid to lend to each other? So now it's not the fear of big companies making a bad financial transaction but the fear of nearly every Chinese citizen of sickness and death. To go from barricaded villages and apartment complexes, police threatening arrest for not wearing a mask, and general distrust of pretty much any outsider to everything is fine let's all go back to work is not going to happen till a shift in perception happens. And with human nature the way it is that can take a long time."
2020-02-17 16:54:13,"Manufacturing in the US will be disrupted in the short term, as even companies with relatively little China sourced components are experiencing gaps farther up supply chains. Japan, Germany and other export driven economies will be hit harder by a global slowdown. 

Global air travel and tourism will be affected more dramatically this year, especially cruises. 

Falling global demand will impact oil prices negatively, leading to lower oil prices, more fracking  bankruptcies and loss of employment in oilfield related businesses, as significant new supply comes on line in 2020. 

Eventually the epidemic will burn itself out on China, as 98% of those exposed will survive with immunity to this strain. With a million Chinese people now living and working in Africa and few constraints on flights from and to China, it is not hard to imagine a second China sized epidemic there, with fewer fatalities because of a younger population.

Trump's ""deal"" to create $200 billion in exports to China will be largely put on hold this year. 

Sectors of the stock market could experience another earnings recession, as in 2015-16, when oil prices fell. 

If Trump has taken credit for the economy in the past,  in spite of his destructive trade policies, he certainly owns whatever happens this year. His supporters will continue to chant ""just wait till next year"" to troubled agricultural, fossil energy and manufacturing dependent communities."
2020-02-17 17:00:59,"Happy to note that the Government of China has urged its people to give up non-veg because scientists believe that eating slaughtered animals’ flesh may be the cause of the disease. The virus is believed to have spread from animals to humans.

One research from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that more than 75% of emerging diseases originate in animals. Experts believe that the dangerous virus might have originated in a market in Wuhan, China, where humans have direct contact with live animals and animal flesh. So far, many dangerous viruses have originated in animals such as the new coronavirus, SARS, bird flu etc.

In this context it will be very interesting to note that in India Brahmins may occasionally eat certain types of meat, but generally they eat a whole foods plant-based diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, beans, grains, and other plant foods. Generally they believe eating meat—involving killing an innocent animal—develops bad karma and has harmful consequences. 

According to The Sivananda Companion to Meditation, food choice is extremely important for those pursuing a spiritual path in life:"
2020-02-17 17:04:34,"A critical issue is the source of this and other viral mutations that have appeared first in china. The vast number of urban small farms on which pigs, ducks, poultry and humans live is close proximity. The situation was improving as modern American agriculture provided pork and other meats, rapidly reducing Chinese dependence on small-farm agriculture. The Trump trade war cut a billion poeple off from thier supply of pork, prices skyrocketed, and Chinese small farmers doubled thier production, again producing the unsanitary crowding of animals and humans that is a hotbed of viral mutation. So yes, the trade war was a major cause of the epidemic."

There is nothing we can do, even with genetic engineering, to stop a virus, once unleashed.   Eventually, Homo Sapien will kill it's own but in the interim pathogens will continue to do what they do best."
2020-02-17 17:43:31,"It is fascinating to see that Kalitta Air, a charter firm in the Detroit area with military and other contracts, owned by Connie Kalitta, has been hired (a picture on the front page) to bring US citizens back into the country, in a converted high-capacity freight conversion B747 with no medical equipment or controls, and landing at an Air Force base in Texas.  Why would the US DoD (and State) bring almost certainly infected individuals back into the country, on a special contract charter flight, rather than quarantine them outside at dozens of optional non-continental locations?  They aren't using their own military aircraft either (they have literally over 500 hundred capable aircraft available, sitting on the ground, all over the world).  This has all the hallmarks of active virus management, not preventative virus quarantine. This may remind readers of the private charter flights between West Africa and the US with ebola infected patients, carefully protected in order to capture the virus genome.  This may sound too imaginative. Unfortunately it is too real."

This virus has not yet been contained and it could already be spreading in places where adequate public health services do not exist. And please Donald J.

2020-02-17 16:10:13,"Business for China may have slowed and on the back burner but its prioritizing Corona is the right thing to do. Health is wealth and when that is under a deadly threat, national security is under threat and everything else becomes a low priority. Now that the sleeping giant is awakened by this nano sized virus, the economic giant has to focus on eradication of COVID-19 already a much bigger threat than the earlier SARS corona virus.

China has certainly given a stimulus of over 10 billion dollars to take control of the containment of the virus and before all is said and done that amount could be 30 billion dollars. Hospitals are coming up in China at the rate of 1 every 10 days and certain sectors of Chinese economy will receive a boost. A silver lining of this epidemic is that so far the mortality rate stands at 2% and while seniors are the worst hit and Dr Li Wenliang was martyred, 98% of those infected will survive for better days after optimal medical support. I can also say that within 6 months the highly contagious sturdy virus will be history and we will be talking about this crowned nano monster that once stepped on our planet on the most populated country in the world by the continuing evolution of species that occurs side by side with climate change. Whether our fellow human beings cause the emergence of monster viruses by consuming exotic wild animals or polluting our environment, evolution and climate change will continue its march if we ourselves fail to change."

2020-02-17 17:03:22,"For quite some time now, “just in time” ordering of parts has been the way for businesses to save money.

But that money-saving strategy is going to lead to huge bottlenecks in manufacturing. 

Picture it:  one type of screw or nut or strange part could hold up the manufacturing of just about anything.

And those who supply those parts are also using “just in time” strategies for metals or plastics etc.

I’m picturing a nightmare where orders are sitting for months infilled.  Not just orders for the finished product, which still would need to be shipped, quite possibly across the ocean.  But for all the zillions of parts needed to make those final products.

Because of hospitalizations and deaths, there will also be empty positions in factories, which add to the bottlenecks that will inevitably occur.

Whatever you might be needing, better to get it now.  Because there’s NO telling how long things will take to get back up and running.

Even car repairs may become a nightmare. Truck repairs.  All of this could slow down transportation, even when something is available.

We are headed for uncharted territory."

How can you tell people one week that the virus is so dangerous that you need to stay in your apartment and can only leave once every two days and then the next week say “back to work”?

Chinese medicine and public health are not as sophisticated as in the West.   My gosh, a big component in epidemiology is communication and organization which is repressed over there.   Also, there is a conflict in values between public health and factory production.

A virus is an obligate intracellular parasite.   It needs a host.  And there are millions upon millions of potential hosts in close proximity of each other in China.   People in China are both a vector of transmission and a reservoir of contagion, to use terms of science.

Given the nature of their government and society, Chinese leaders  regard workers as fungible.   This norm will make the epidemic grow much larger.

The Chinese people will come out of this crisis as both the victims and the heroes. Yet, if something isn’t done to regulate wet markets this will happen again and again. Because the international community demand it and the fact that the US had a legal frame that can address negligence, the Max 737 was grounded world-wide.

The fact that President Xi has felt compelled to publicly take control of the response is not a good sign.  It could indicate we are in for a long siege.

This will in turn effect the US economy as we have, perhaps unwisely, tied much of our manufacturing to Chines suppliers.  As those parts dry up it will take an increasing bite out of our economy.  This could be bad news for Trump.  His ace in the hole is a booming US economy, if that evaporates away, then more people will focus on his behavior, he could then be in trouble.

Fortunately for Russia and the world a series of great Russian generals came to the fore and Stalin recoverd his nerve. This is the problem with communism, everything must be cleared by the people high up in the government and people below are afraid to take individual steps, because any mistake and their head will be on the chopping block and they will be the ones blamed for anything that goes wrong. The Chinese people did themselves no favors, by hoarding supplies, and fleeing Wuhan before the quarantine.
  I feel great sympathy for the Chines people, let us hope as more and more people recover and build up the antibodies that will make them immune, that things will get easier, and the virus as many do will begin to dissipate.

Avoid touching your eye,nose and mouth
wash hands often
Keep your home clean. Wash floors frequently, you and your guests bring nasty things home on your feet.

I wonder how the USA would cope with 15% of the infected needing to be on a ventilator / oxygen tank? I wonder whether the air conditioning systems of modern hospitals (without windows that open) would help to spread the virus? I wonder how many people in the USA would avoid seeking medical care due to the cost, until their symptoms are severe? I wonder how long it will be before the mainstream media reports upticks in viral pneumonia in US hospitals? I wonder whether Neil Ferguson from imperial college is correct that currently we are missing 2 out of every 3 Coronavirus infections in communities outside China, due to our focus on asking patients “did you travel to China recently?”"
2020-02-14 20:07:00,"What is this epidemic going to do, in countries with expensive medical care? Will millions of Americans go into bankruptcy once they're hospitalized? I have a friend who was recently three days  in ICU for for snake bite, and the bill was $93,000. Are American insurance and hospital companies making contingency plans for the virus, once it arrives here?"
2020-02-14 20:08:29,"I listened to a recent interview of a major medical mask producer from Texas by the BBC Newshour. The owner stated that most of the medical masks in the US are produced by China because the cost is lower. So the reality is that there could be a shortage of supplies even in the US as factories in China now struggle with this outbreak. In Canada, for example, Edmonton, has run out of masks and sanitizing gels at the moment."
2020-02-14 20:32:43,"I’d like to know what percentage of people who get infected with the coronavirus recover. Have we not seen those statistics because no one knows? When the patient gets better, they don’t tell the doctor or any authority?

Another way of asking this question is, is the death rate low simply because many people are still sick and could be on their way to death? 

For instance, Dr. Li Wenliang appears to have had coronavirus for 5 weeks or so before he died. (I don’t have the exact dates here, but if someone else does, that would be helpful.) If it takes that long to succumb, then I wonder if the death rate is actually higher than we currently believe it is."

2020-02-14 20:05:17,"This is somewhat off topic but when I see the pictures of people in China walking around with masks on but not covering their hands with gloves, somehow I think people are not thinking.  Please, please, cover your hands with a simple pair of good gloves when in public places. Railings, checkout screens, grocery carts, elevator buttons can be protected against with a simple pair of gloves.  That goes for everyone in the world -- not just China."
2020-02-14 20:28:26,We Americans must somehow send the medical supplies need to China.  I do not like the CCP but I have deep affection for the Chinese people.  Their suffering is killing me with sadness.  It is not an option to stand by and do nothing.  Are there any relief efforts?
2020-02-14 19:25:00,"Why can't China, with its huge factories, enslaved workers, dictatorial leaders, and single party control - produce enough protective equipment for its doctors.

China has known about this horrendous Covid-19 virus since people started coming down with it in November.

Why couldn't they run their factories night and day to produce the required protective equipment?

Looks like the medical/drug system needs to be independent of the political system.

Can the US or eastern Europe send protective eqipment to the Chinese doctors?  This problem belongs to all of us."
2020-02-14 19:43:53,"This is China's Chernobyl. Biological warfare weapon ""accidentally"" gets released and a large swath of the country dies.

Chinese state propagandists have spent years trying to convince the world that China is a genuine superpower. 

Yet this tragic health crisis shows rather conclusively the utter failure of Soviet-style centralized control; that China's glamorous, glitzy coastal showcase cities are little more than Potemkin Villages; and that China's totalitarian leadership is really no different in mentality from that of the old USSR, where secrecy and sweeping things under the rug were de rigueur. 

China is no great power, that's for sure."

2020-02-14 20:44:45,"It's a little hard to wrap my mind around this. If China can build a 1,000 bed hospital in 10 days, why can't it provide protective gear for it's doctors? If it can't manufacture them directly, doesn't China have the resources to buy them from other countries? And if, let's say, they don't have the resources, then how is the rest of the world helping?"
2020-02-14 21:02:36,"The masks needed are specialized.  I can believe that they are primarily made in China.  It clearly demonstrates the need to diversify the manufacturing of critical medical supplies.  They should be made in many countries and should become a WHO priority.  Even if it means subsidizing low profit manufacturing sites.
NOW...How do we help China?  If you don't have the Christian ethics to ""love thy neighbor as thyself"" consider it a selfish endeavor of limiting the spread of a potentially dangerous virus in a very inter-connected world.
For those laughing at China's misfortune, consider how well our medical system will fair with 20+million without health insurance and the most expensive medical on earth.  Even if our system can cope; how many will be bankrupted with high deductible medical costs?

2020-02-14 20:48:07,"From the Taipei Times:

Using a rice cooker to “dry steam” surgical masks for three minutes can have a sterilizing effect, an experiment by Chung Shan Medical University Department of Occupational Safety and Health associate professor Lai Chane-yu (賴全裕) and his team showed.

However, after dry steaming, the mask would have a lower filter efficiency compared with new masks, Lai said on Monday, adding that the method should only be considered if there is an insufficient supply of masks or they need to be reused in an emergency.

The team conducted several tests for cleaning N95 respirators, and found that a 70 percent alcohol solution, bleach, high-pressure sterilization and rice cooker were all effective sterilization methods, Lai said."
2020-02-14 20:44:52,It is in our best interest to help China. What are we waiting for?
2020-02-14 21:03:01,"Hard to believe China is incapable of drop-shipping medical supplies from one province to another. Western Allies were able to support Berlin for 323 days with nothing but air transport and no helicopters. You're telling me China is struggling to get medical supplies from factory to hospital within their own nation due to provincial interference? I'm a bit incredulous.

Anyway, the article still doesn't answer my original question: How many medical workers are infected compared to the overall medical staff? That's our metric.

Comparing medical workers to confirmed infections is useful if you want to make comparisons to SARS. Is CONVID-19 much more dangerous to medical workers than SARS? That's useful information. However, that's not the question we're asking right now.

We're asking: How close is China's medical infrastructure to complete failure? When do medical workers start bolting for the doors? They will eventually. You can't pay someone to mop-up diseased bed pans without offering a reasonable chance of survival. They are going to quit. That or they will burnout and/or die.

Either way, you have a problem. You can't replace doctors overnight. Well, the entire ship ceases to function anyway if the Captain is the only person left on board.

I want to know employment statistics specific to medical employees in Hubei and Wuhan. How many workers are out sick? What's the turn rate? How's morale doing? And so on. You can't contain the virus if people won't go to work."
2020-02-14 20:52:51,The sad thing is that since China is a totalitarian dictatorship we can not trust any figures about the virus that they produce. And the Chinese Government than accuses counties like Australia for overreacting. Sorry China you have blown it in the biggest possible way...people have zero trust in anything you say. A wake up call for the rest of the world. Xi is on borrowed time.
2020-02-14 20:52:58,"Becoming a doctor or nurse is not the same as swearing an oath to commit suicide. Neither is it a promise to offer up your own children and other loved ones at home for slaughter. If adequate resources are not available and it is dangerous to work, doctors and nurses should refuse to work."
2020-02-14 21:00:47,"Most people you see are wearing the wrong type of mask to strongly protect against airborne viruses. One needs the so-called FFP3 Respirator Valved Mask at a minimum to ward off most viruses to 99%. These typical surgical masks one always sees are not good enough. One of the “bonuses” of the FFP3 mask is it’s harder to breathe through them. During the day you’ll get by but at night, example, on a ship—where you wear it all the time, even when sleeping, its difficult. Add to that, one has to change the mask often and not touch the outer fabric which could be contaminated. That, my newspaper friends, is a hardship!

I had some similar experience with the U.S. Army Pro  Gas Mask of the 1990s. Trying to sleep during a Saudi Arabian dust storm was pretty near impossible because the human resting breathing rate is not acclimated to the extra breathing effort required.

So, if masks are sent, they need to be good ones."
2020-02-14 20:52:11,"Why doesn't WHO just go ahead and help out proactively by sending masks, gloves etc? This is a global crisis and its the humanitarian right thing to do. Why didn't they immediately do this?"
2020-02-14 21:29:48,"The new 1,000 bed hospital in Wuhan was an impressive construction project, but it was obvious from the photos that the handwashing stations were few and far between. 

The top photo of this story is also very impressive - lots of high tech machinery and everyone is special outfits. But I count six patients side-by-side and not one sink to be seen.  

I am an American RN and I also have an RN license in an Asian country where I teach nursing. This is very typical of hospital construction in that region. Just because the place where the put the patients in China is called a hospital does not mean that they follow the same standards as American hospitals do."
2020-02-14 21:37:02,China needs to pour funds and resources into affected areas and into containment—now.  The wealthy and the government itself have immense economic power. Use it on this; fail in this and China will lose much more—we all will.
2020-02-14 21:50:26,"Here in Hawaii, we have no cases of the virus.  Yet, there is a run on masks.  I visited a home improvement store this morning that had a sign up, which indicated that they had masks, but sales of these would be limited.  I'm wondering if there might be persons who are going around buying large volumes, and then sending them to China, or wherever, at a handsome profit."
2020-02-14 22:11:54,"Take a good, long look at what us happening in China. When there is ONE person, our government entity in control of distributing resources and setting priorities, this is what happens.

2020-02-14 22:13:02,Will China please hire the experts from NYC to takeover. China seems incompetent and they are not even sure how to discuss all the Chinese that are at home who are sick who have not gotten medical help or service. Establish a 311 number or a website so all those infected or who feel ill can contact the website so we can all have a grasp to the size of the problem. How do we know that it is not in the millions . China has a 4 trillion surplus and where are all the Chinese billionaires and why are they not giving financial aid to each and every family that is enduring hardship. Let’s stop talking about donating in the future and start right now. Chinese billionaires help your fellows out.
2020-02-14 21:40:03,"It would be an understatement to say that China is not a place where one wants to get sick.  The country’s government calls its actions something akin to ‘wartime’ yet they have not armed their protectors with the necessary weapons to battle a virus.  The average Chinese citizen has every right to be angry.  Lord knows, a lot of us outside of China are getting angrier with each passing day."

2020-02-14 22:32:16,"This is a serious question and not intended to try to be funny. Not at all! Maybe an infectious disease expert can answer.

But what if the virus was just allowed to run its course throughout the world, with continual detailed information to everyone about preventive self-protection and about self care at home if someone becomes ill. 

The world is NOT going to be able to isolate and quarantine everyone, as has been done with cruise ships, for example. There seems to be a reliance on ""putting people away"" somewhere rather than describing to everyone the best way to handle this.

Hospitals would not be able to manage everyone coming in with symptoms.

I understand there will/would be deaths but would money and time be better spent educating people with stories and ads on how to prevent and self treat this illness?

This post will sound shallow and foolish to some of you but I'm completely serious."
2020-02-14 22:20:29,"Can we not drop supplies in from planes and helicopters?  One should not have to expose drivers, or deal with checkpoints and road blocks.  Protective gear should be coming from all over, delivered by drone if necessary."

2020-02-14 21:37:38,"How is it that an industrial powerhouse like China can't supply protective equipment to front-line medics fighting this epidemic?  How can they claim to build a hospital in 10 days but not be able to supply masks, gloves and gowns in time? Is this a failure of the CCP's top-down management style?  Something is rotten in the state of Hubei."
2020-02-14 22:23:36,"The people in Wuhan are under attack, and the medical workers are the sole humanitarians. This crises is much like Syria only that the risks to the global community are greater. The problem now is that China is the country that makes medical supplies. Diversification of manufacturing is the lesson. Maybe supplies could be air dropped in? The patients need help but the helpers are becoming patients. The Chinese people are paying the price for having an authoritarian government that is skewed by corruption."
2020-02-14 21:11:46,"China is remarkably efficient in production, but its distribution systems are crippled by draconian communist policy.  

Imagine being so close to water, but unable to drink because there is a red barrier in front of it.  

The communist party do not seem to understand that the barrier that is making them fail at this and their economic endeavours is their control over the voices of its people.  

Free communication will open up networks that allow for local and national actors to release the bottle necks stopping medical professionals from receiving masks.

It will be messy, opening up communications networks, which is probably the most intolerable aspect of the process.  But, it does not mean the country would lose cohesion.  It does not mean the government would no longer be centralised either; as clearly parts of the centralised system work well for China.

The communist party no doubt want China to be successful and prosperous, but they are at a bottleneck in its development, and the next step is freedom of speech.  That's the reality that they will have to face.

But, until then, many of their citizens and medical professionals will die needlessly."
2020-02-14 21:59:20,"The best mask to use would be a Powered Air Respirator with a p100 filter. Fit issues are not a problem since it surrounds the entire head. It also does not allow you to touch your face with your hands. The only downside is that it requires batteries but lithium ion batteries last a long time and could be carried with the user.

If the crew on the ship wore these while distributing the food then no one would have caught the virus. They are expensive and used in welding and other manufacturing processes but should be readily available.

3M should be sending these to the infected areas for people to use."
2020-02-14 18:25:43,"I had to go to my primary care physician's office yesterday. It's the height of flu season, so I circled the parking lot a few times before I found a parking place. Then I went into the lobby and queued up in a line of 10 people waiting to check in while five different intake receptionists registered patients. Eventually I registered and was called back into the exam room, where I waited a half an hour before my physician came in. 
Mind you, this was a 10am morning appointment, and she was already running behind by a half hour. During my appointment, she disclosed to me that she's been working until 8pm each evening just to keep up with patient follow up and medical notes.
All of this is just a very roundabout way for me to illustrate that if we snicker at and look down upon the Chinese for their equipment shortages during this crisis, do not - for an instant - assume that we can do it so much better here in the United States. 
If this virus gets a toehold here and begins to spread widely, rest assured that we will confront the same dire (and embarrassing?) problems here. Especially under this dysfunctional administration. China is a cautionary tale and we'd all do well to show some empathy and learn."

I've been trying to find a way get supplies to her, but all package delivery routes I could think of are either subject to interceptions or indefinite delays.

2020-02-14 23:32:34,"It's human nature to ignore risks that seem distant, but in a risk analysis you assess not just the likeliness of an event but also the impact.   In my opinion the likelihood of a pandemic that either starts or reaches the U.S. fall somewhere around 4 on a scale with 5 being  Never.   The numeric value for impact would depend wholly on our ability to respond.  I used to think that we would probably never fall below the medium in such an event but now I'm not so sure.  

The CDC needs to be well funded and we need a wholesale review of our process and resources. We have to have ready masks, testing kits, methods of communication, quarantine  spaces, and most importantly, adequate personnel.

While unlikely, we have to be prepared.  The result of what would happen if we are not is unthinkable."
2020-02-14 23:42:50,"If the newly-christened COVID-19 virus becomes more virulent, spreads rapidly in the United States and makes hundreds of thousands of people critically ill, few cities would have sufficient in-patient facilities to care for them.

He was in fact telling all GP Doctors not to send people with mild symptoms to them hospital.

It is shocking to say the least.  This is the ultimate recipe for making the contagion worse.  All the family members would be infected, considering the infection is highly contagious, as the Prime Minister himself had pointed out.

Donald Milton, MD, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, helped prove via the use of his Gesundheit machine that influenza could be spread via aerosol transmission. He said he is in contact with colleagues in Singapore who are attempting to study the transmission of the COVID-19 viruses, which are often called nCoV, for novel coronavirus.

Though Chinese officials said earlier this week that they believe the coronavirus is transmitted only via droplets, implying they do not believe airborne or contact transmission plays a role...

""To me this sounds like someone trying to deal with panic, because people panic when they hear airborne transmission and long-distance transmission,"" he said. He said there has been scientific evidence of aerosol transmission of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), so it is likely possible for this novel coronavirus, as well.

""You cannot tell the difference epidemiologically between something aerosol transmitted by weak sources and large droplet spray,"" said Milton. ""They behave so similar, it's very hard to pick up the difference.""

2020-02-15 01:54:57,"Speaking of N95 rated respirator masks: it's impossible to find a vendor who's able to ship these online anymore. I have an order pending that will not be fulfilled before April 30. Shelves in my local Home Depot and Lowe's are empty too and these stores are rationing sales per customer.

I doubt the US and other western countries will be able to meet demand for N95 rated masks or better either once there is an epidemic."
2020-02-15 02:17:24,"The photo at the top is of very, very ill people.  I am not able to judge but I am impressed with the medical equipment and devices that I see in great number in this intensive care unit, isolated from the hospital.  From what I see, the shortages described here will likely be brief, China is capable of producing medical supplies and in great volume although overcome with the vast demands of this epidemic."
2020-02-15 02:19:11,"This is a very tiny virus, but I see no reason why these medical materials cannot be sterilized and recycled once to allow the manufacturing of them to catch up to demand. Also, I think the self made mask especially with many layers of material possibly activated charcoal would be any less effective than ear loop surgical masks or ones intended for paint dust (N95) which have huge holes in them compared to the virus."
2020-02-15 03:21:19,"The International Rescue Committee and The International  Red Cross may be accepting donations for this emergency appeal, and perhaps Conavid-19 now confirmed by The World Health Organization as a global emergency, should be deemed a universal infection.

2020-02-15 03:27:52,"We don't have to think back to far to remember the many struggles and mistakes our country and hospitals with ebola; placing health care workers close to exposure and death. We need to locate our resources and have a nationwide detailed plan for our next medical emergency. And we need to send every piece of equipment, medicine and medical supplies to China. We must help one another in this way."
2020-02-15 03:06:12,The picture says it all...the blood in the pillow...this is very scary...I feel we are still taking this too lightly...hearing it is like the flu and will be gone in April...No country is prepared to fight this virus. It came as wave in China. It is all started with one patient. Today Egypt reported the first case. This will be bigger than the Spanish flu. I wish all countries start a global response to provide masks and supplies for all healthcare workers. They are the real heroes against this enemy.
2020-02-15 03:37:19,"PRC is a mega-polity, along with US, Russia, India and Brazil. When times are good, things perk along ok, those in power raking in their ill-earned gains, while the general populace is so preoccupied with the apparently genuine possibility of making a decent living, it's unable to take note of what the government is really all about.
Come a crunch (pandemic, stock market tank, etc.), we suddenly realize that current governments are totally unequipped to deal with crises on such a scale. They've failed to allow them as possibilities, hence have no strategic plans in place. (It's a debatable question whether the CDC would have done a better job containing a rather infectious virus than PRC has done to date.)  
The PRC government has always been driven by the imperative to look good. It demands ""hearts and minds"" in order to ensure its own life, as against (what it claims would be) undesirable ""social upheaval"". (Perhaps some members of the GOP are now close to claiming that as the alternative to their own re-election?)
When the CPC fumbles, as now, it just kind of looks, roughly, like Boeing, which, thank goodness, is not a polity, but simply a huge business concern. 
Whistle-blowers in the US, etc., seem somehow to manage to survive, whereas, in the PRC, they simply disappear.
So life goes on ... or does it?"
2020-02-15 01:25:58,"Health workers in Wuhan are exposed to quantities of virus material in their surroundings that ordinary citizens are not.

Certainly the US has an interest in suppressing this disease before it spreads wildly in the US.  Is Trump oblivious to the problem or does he think this is just another Chinese hoax?"
2020-02-15 02:20:12,Is this how the leader of China scares the people of Hong Kong of what will continue to happen if they don’t listen? Is that why Trump said this would all be “over” soon?
2020-02-15 01:52:46,"Something strange is happening in HKSAR. People mourned the death of Dr Li WenLiang but yet they wanted to seal the Chinese border and the hospital personnels even went on strikes.

2020-02-15 03:38:11,"These medical workers are functioning like modern Norman Bethunes, the battlefield Canadian surgeon during China's war with Japan. Working countless hours saving the lives of soldiers and civilians, he slipped cut his finder and dies of septicemia. Every Chinese person knows his name.
Today's doctors in this crisis are working the same way: countless hours under extreme duress. Sooner or later a respirator will slip, a nurse might take hers off, finder coated with infectious detritus, and a health care worker will die. 
They need all the support they can get."
2020-02-15 05:07:03,"There was a piece in the NYT recenty that said people might be worrying too much because of human nature: wrong. 

The death rate is probably about 16%. The only recent figures that I could find said that about 7100 people had recovered and about 1300 people had died. There is no point comparing the number who have died to the number who have been infected because you don't know how the infected cases will pan out. 

COVID19 is more infectious than cold or flu. It has a long incubation period (Ebola is only three days) at 14 days (some people say up to 28 days), and it can be infectious before there are symptoms. All that is bad. 

The NYT said that the death rate in China is only so high because their health system has been overwhelmed. Overwhelmed - that word should be a clue. That does not happen with flu. If 60% of the US gets COVID19, and 20% of them die, then that is about 36 000 000 dead Americans. At least if that happens we won't have to listen to people being smart and saying not to worry because flu kills 40 000 each year."
2020-02-15 02:48:55,I’m hoping that public health planners and others in this country are keeping a close eye on things in China and have a plan for what we would do if an outbreak occurs. It’s lazy to suggest that America would never reach the level of chaos in China today due to our more open society/better handling of such things. Nobody knows how dangerous this virus really is. If China can’t even keep up (where everything is made these days) how will we be sure everyone has enough masks and suits?
2020-02-15 03:44:19,"The masks have been gone from Atlanta area Home Depot and Lowe’s stores for at least two weeks.  Same for Amazon.com and Walmart.  

I’m actually rather impressed by the people who have been quietly gathering supplies for their families and clearing out the stores of ear loop masks and the N-95s.  They have done so in the face of a media and health care agencies determined to give the impression that COVID-19 is no worse than the seasonal flu.  China doesn’t routinely quarantine tens of millions of people; construct earthen barricades across roads to stop people leaving; and refer to itself as “on a wartime footing” in response to a bad flu season.  We’re not stupid and shouldn’t be treated as if we cannot believe our eyes and ears.

Aren’t we all (per long standing Dept. of Homeland Security recommendations) supposed to be prepared to be on our own for a few days to a few weeks in the event of a national emergency?  People are preparing and the answer to that is to increase supplies; not criticize people for acting in the best interests of themselves and their family members."
2020-02-15 04:27:39,"China, so far, has pretty much refused any help. Even though a major world power, they have mostly isolated themselves and their people from the world stage.

Epidemics come and go; this one looks fairly bad, especially considering the denial on how many cases we actually have.

Well. Medics say, sneeze into your elbow, masks do not work, wash your hands a lot."

2020-02-15 03:03:29,"The Chinese government has poured billions into its Stasi like mad scramble to track and compile all citizens' thoughts and movements to force fealty to dear leader Xi. But police state top- down control and internet censorship have now backfired badly both by denying citizens up to date accurate information about the virus' spread and protections, and by lack of local control over basic hospital supplies and medicine. One result is roving goon squads grabbing unsuspecting people out of their homes for indefinite institutionalization, and a pathetic lack of the most rudimentary medical supplies. A virus outbreak can happen anywhere, but here China's medieval response is more dangerous than the disease itself."
2020-02-15 02:40:37,"The strangest, and disturbing, thing occurred today. Amazon sent me a box of surgical masks with my order for another item. I didn’t order surgical masks.

Many people think this will be contained like Ebola and SARS were.  I'm not so confident.  There was a report that someone caught the virus via an open pipe 10 floors away from an infected person in an apartment building.  If that's true, and I have no reason to believe it's not, then I think the world is in big trouble."

2020-02-15 06:26:08,"Honestly, I am horrified by the heartless response of many Americans. This is a catastrophy, and the health professionals who are trying to help are literally risking their lives. You should all be deeply ashamed for this horrible departure from common decency."
2020-02-15 07:00:04,"China has a 3rd world country medical system. I am a MD and toured China in 2012. While at the Wuhan airport, I felt faint and broke out in a cold sweat. The airport Medic sent me via ambulance to Wuhan University Hospital ER. Our tour guide stayed with me to translate and said I was at the best hospital in Wuhan getting VIP care as a foreigner. Families with wads of paper currency in their hands arrived at the ER by private car or taxi, and literally dragged or carried their sick family member from the entrance to the registration desk. The ER would not do anything without cash prepayment. I was on a gurney next to other Chinese patients and observed their medical care. None had insurance. I had shaking chills, cramping, nausea, and vomiting. I had an IV set at an inadequate flow rate, a brief exam, blood drawn, and an EKG. I reviewed my test results. The staff did not have a diagnosis. It became clear as my symptoms progressed that I had an bacterial or viral gastroenteritis. When they wanted to do a head CT scan to rule out brain tumor, I refused and told our tour guide to get me out of the ER immediately. I went to a hotel, stayed overnight, and self medicated with the travel medications that I had in my luggage. After a rough night with trips to and from the bathroom, I was fit enough to fly to Shanghai to catch up with the tour. My observations of medical care in the ER were under ""normal"" conditions. I cannot imagine what the ER is like during a corona virus epidemic."
2020-02-15 07:20:15,What comes to mind when I see these pictures is the bravery of the Russian soldiers during the Chernobyl nuclear disaster who were tasked with cleaning up the radioactive debris before the radiation could spread further.  These medical workers are risking their lives for everyone.  They should be honored for their bravery and given everything they need.
2020-02-15 07:57:41,"Seeing a row of at least 6 intubated patients in an open ward is what scares me. (I'm an RN, worked ortho/trauma/med-surg). If this is one of the facilities slapped up to cope with Covid-19 that would be understandable, but if this what a regular ICU in China looks like, then it's no wonder they cannot control infections. A look at the workers tells me that they don't have sufficient equipment- one of the visible workers does not have proper foot coverings (something I've noticed in other pictures, too). Another feature completely lacking in any of the pictures I've seen is that apparently they do not use IV pumps in Chinese health care facilities. Not that they are really necessary, but it just shows that the system lags behind the care standards of a western facility. 
That said, they are incredibly brave to be doing what they are doing. Nurses the world over are resourceful and innovative, and we usually find a way to do what needs to be done- even if it requires inventing some on-the -fly unorthodox methods."
2020-02-15 14:29:59,"Even during non crisis times U.S. hospitals have faced shortages of simple vital medical supplies such as normal saline,heparin and emergency cardiac medications.Chinese manufacture combined with hospitals' ""on-time"" supplies guarantee failure in the event a pandemic hits.There is absolutely no chance the supply of personal protective gear ,negative pressure isolation rooms and surface disinfectants is adequate to meet such a challenge.Plans,policies and procedures are no substitute for actions.This should  be a wake up call that today's lowest cost solutions may require a very large price paid tomorrow."
2020-02-15 07:14:08,Why not drop medical supplies in via the air at hospitals?   This would eliminate the road side checks.  I’m assuming helicopters could do this and never be near the virus?
2020-02-15 09:04:57,"Chinese medical practices border on the absurd. I've heard that in even the wealthiest parts of the country a clinic with 12 staff will be allowed 24 masks a day, despite the fact that once masks get moist from breathing for about 2 hours they are no longer effective. And on top of that, they are required to make house calls to everyone who is reporting symptoms, with the same inadequate equipment. The doctors are being made to spread the very disease they're treating!"
2020-02-15 09:43:45,"I'm asking because I don't know.

 Is testing for & treatment of Covid-19 covered by the health insurance carried by US citizens.

How easily can the spread of the virus be managed if it's not covered, or in the population of those with no insurance?"
2020-02-15 14:12:33,"Their sacrifices are highly appreciated.  Everyone in China will eventually know their stories.

In fact, one of the doctors recovered from the Coronavirus has volunteered to donate plasma (blood) to help patients to fight the disease.  Even he was infected and then recovered, he felt an obligation to help more, thus donating the plasma.  We can never say enough thanks to medical doctors and staffs not only during crisis but normal time as well.

China will overcome the difficulties during this crisis.  Medical equipment and supply shortage will be compensated quickly as productions gradually return in motion everywhere else in China."
2020-02-15 07:54:03,"This better not get going here in the US. We don't make masks anymore, thanks to globalization, so we would have to improvise protection with duct tape, trash bags and torn up sheets. We ought to be trying to test designs for improvised protective gear from common household items.

On a different topic, I am very pleased to hear that Americans are being evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Things have been going wrong aboard that ship and the virus seems to be spreading via unknown means. We need to get our people out."
2020-02-14 13:07:41,"A retrospective might be in order.  There is nothing new under the sun, over 70 years old here and the discussions regarding climate change and its effects including the proliferation of new genetic variations of existing diseases came up in my primary school classes long before current social awareness.  This is not an awakening, it is a nightmare constantly being replayed due to political and social intransigence favoring the economy over the survival of the human race."
2020-02-14 12:56:52,"What are the real numbers the CCP is hiding? If we JUST found out nearly 6k medical workers are infected, then this is definitely far worse than they're letting on."
2020-02-14 12:50:43,"Unfortunately, people seldom grasp the severity of a crisis while it is happening - in this case, containment failed and we are no dealing with a very nasty pathogen which is readily transmitted from host to host.  Hospitalizing people now runs the risk of infecting people in hospital for other illnesses and that dramatically increase mortality rates.  Blood plasma and antivirals point to an extremely dire situation when coupled with shortages of drugs and testing kits.  The USA is ill prepared and grossly under resourced to wage the fight that the PRC has been waging.  We are relying on local departments of health - but as the infection infects healthcare workers, we will quickly find that we lack the bench strength to win this fight.  Anyone who underestimates the lethality of the situation is a delusional fool.  I don't sense that the USA grasps the danger and it will not until the wildfire of contagion is raging like a pandemic inferno at which time it will be too late for containment to work.   Supplies of blood plasma from infection survivors in the US are non-existent as are adequate stocks of anti-virals to treat such a pandemic and forget about negative pressure rooms and quarantine facilities - and ask yourselves how many hospital workers will become infected and infect their families and you quickly see the unmitigated risk of a delivery system collapse."
2020-02-14 13:31:54,"ONLY ONE  lab in all of China  meets the required biosafety standards needed to study this coronavirus.  The lab is in the center of Wuhan.  The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory’s mission was/is to help Chinese scientists ""prepare for and respond to future infectious disease outbreaks”.  This research lab holds the world's most dangerous pathogens at maximum biocontainment levels.  The bio-safety protocols are exhaustive and exhausting for its personnel.   To err is human. 

No no no. Wuhan as a birthplace for this virus cannot be a freaky stroke of bad luck in nature.  At best it is an accident.  A tragic human error in that lab in Wuhan.

Of all the hundreds of thousands of back-alley wet markets in East Asia, SE Asia and Africa that butcher exotic and ordinary animals for human consumption, nature randomly but coincidentally chose Wuhan to release this virus?  So unlikely.  More likely - a lapse in bio safety practices at this Level 4 lab led to the virus’ escape into Wuhan.  And the government found it expedient to blame a wet market in Wuhan instead of taking responsibility for it.  Sound familiar?

Even the U.S.’ CDC has occasionally failed biosafety compliance tests at its facilities.   So I reject the official line for good common sense reasons.  Think."

So more people were discharged from hospital than those diagnosed with the disease on 2/13.

Also, like me, many people may be more concerned with how swiftly this could overwhelm our healthcare system and cause basic government functions to grind to a halt. Telling people not to worry is counterproductive even if the aims are supposedly noble. My partner is HIV positive and I am not and never have been worried about transmission because I understand the science and risk. I’m not one to overreact or group people into categories based on perceived risks or stereotypes. That said, this novel coronavirus has gotten my attention because of the potential societal knock-on effects should it spread in the US and the impact on my partner who is immunocompromised.

I suggest, medical organizations the world around, reevaluate their positions, calm fears in local populations around and deal with it as yet another new entrant in our world of illness. 

Absolutely terrifying, those poor people in imprisoned cities and ships must be sick with a multitude of secondary viral and bacterial illnesses.

The virus is now thought to be  aerosolized after six weeks of being told the opposite.

for those not paying close attention Covid-19 is most definitely unchecked and increasingly thought to be uncheckable in any time frame that will make a difference—no effective treatments no viable vaccine.

Sixty percent of the world population is [rounding up] 8 billion people—sixty percent is 4,800,000,000...let's say 5 billion.

The current low ball mortality rate is guesstimated at 2 percent—that would be 100,000,000 dead before the a year is up.

In addition to NOT being prepared to ""check"" the Wuhan virus the world is most decidedly not prepared to cope with 100 million dead over the course of a year.

I'd say it is very rational to be very concerned and more so given a media intent on minimizing what is happening."
2020-02-14 16:48:07,"Yes! Is this point where I say I have been ranting like a lunatic for the past two weeks that  blood transfusions would work? 

This is a cheap and scalable solution to reduce mortality. Plasma transfusions from recovered patients contain the B cells that produce antibodies. Antibodies attach to the viral spikes. This makes it more difficult or even impossible for the virus to infect cells. The antibodies also clump many virus together while chemically tagging the cluster to be destroyed. 

The question now is if it is memory B cells or active B and T cells from the donor. If it is memory cells then older plasma can be used.  If it is active antibody producing B cells then the patient would need plasma from someone who has recovered in the last 7 days. The good news is as long as there is someone who can survive a virus then transfusions are effective even against a virus with a high rate of mutation. 

Plasma can be donated every two weeks and every plasma donor is a universal donor. Convalescent plasma is a guaranteed antiviral that can be manufactured locally.

“a state-owned company under the Ministry of Health, said it had found that administering a round of human antibodies from the survivors to more than 10 critically ill patients caused inflammation levels to drop significantly after 12 to 24 hours of treatment.

The company called the use of plasma ‘the most effective method, which can significantly reduce the mortality of critically ill patients.’” :)"
2020-02-14 16:39:24,"Medical workers represent 3.8 percent of total confirmed infections. That about the most useless statistic I've ever read.

1) We know confirmed cases are vastly under reporting the spread of the virus.

2) Medical workers are separate high risk population that is simultaneously essential to recovery efforts.

We don't care how many medical workers are sick compared to the general population. We care about medical workers sick compared to total medical workers.

Is the virus ward in Hubei mostly staffed, half staffed, or less? How does 1,700 infections impact the medical community's ability to respond to the ongoing epidemic? 

The officially released numbers provide less than zero insight."

Take my area where for the population of 148000 the sole medical facility is a regional operation with a 442 bed hospital - 10 beds in ICU. Closest facility with negative pressure room for quarantine is 275 miles away. Now apply the infective & mortality rates & need for hospitalization for flu vs coronavirus to my area

Flu season = about 10% of the population catch it -14,800
1.56% of those infected need hospitalized -231 in hospital over flu season of 4-6 months (maybe 11 patients a week with 7 days in hospital)
1/10th of 1% (1 in 1000) of those infected die - 15 

Coronavirus = about 10% seem to be catching it - 14800 
20%+ of those infected need hospitalized - 2960  (for up to nearly 4 weeks in some cases)
16% of those ill are in serious condition and need an ICU  -2368
2.25% (23 in 1000) DIE - 333

Now tell me again how it is ""not serious"" when the only 442 bed hospital would be so overwhelmed that

*only maybe 1 out 7 who NEED to be in hospital actually admitted
* The 2368 that need ICU & oxygen/ventilators would be out of luck with only maybe 10 ICU beds.
* that facility could NEVER come up with a few thousand oxygen machines - be lucky to have 100 & less than 25 vents

The source also said the virus has “outsmarted all of us,” as it can hide symptoms for up to 24 days. This assertion has been made independently elsewhere, with Chinese pulmonologist Zhong Nanshan (鍾南山) saying the average incubation period is three days, but it can take as little as one day and up to 24 days to develop symptoms.

Also, the source said that false negative tests for the virus are fairly common. “It can fool the test kit – there were cases that they found, the CT scan shows both lungs are fully infected but the test came back negative four times. The fifth test came back positive.”

Stephanie Soucheray | News Reporter | CIDRAP News | Feb 13, 2020

   
Droplet or aerosol infection spread? Surgical mask or respirator? Asymptomatic transmission or symptomatic only?

These are the defining questions surrounding the person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 that have yet to be answered—or answered sufficiently—for US experts monitoring the disease. 

Yesterday the media reported that a Japanese doctor who was monitoring cruise ship passengers quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess in the port of Yokohama contracted the virus despite wearing gloves and a surgical mask. He joins the more than 500 healthcare workers in Wuhan, China, who have also reportedly contracted the disease—just by the middle of January.

Also can the New York Times follow up and see if infected blood can be used to create a live vaccine?

One would hope that infected blood could be treated to inactivate the virus and create a weak vaccine. UV radiation use to be a common treatment for diseases. UV light can knock down the viral load or disable some anti-interferon genes. 

Transfusing a lot of blood with viral fragments may provide enough inactive viruses for the adaptive immune system to recognize an infection faster or lower the threshold needed to become active.

I also want to know if an infected person with a lot of antibodies and active viruses can have their blood drawn and the total viral load in the blood neutralized outside the body by the current level of B cells in the blood. 

The tagged viruses are then injected into a healthy person and destroyed by lymphocytes to provide enough viral fragments for the host to become immune.

The reasoning in Singapore is said to be that China's way will result in many false positives, enlarging the incidence falsely.

2020-02-14 10:16:53,"So the first thing we need to realize is that quarantines aren't for the benefit of those quarantined; they never have been. They are exclusively for the benefit of those outside the perimeter of a quarantine, be it a single home, town or city. The purpose is to prevent the spread of the disease to those outside the quarantine. It would be nice to think that China, or any other country, cares about the well being of those within the quarantine perimeter but that is not necessarily the case, especially if resources are tight. 

 The quarantine that China has instituted is similar to that of the cruise ship docked in Japan which has a steadily increasing number of those infected. The quarantine of the cruise ship is set up to protect Japan as well as the home countries of those on the ship to some extent. That the conditions on board, similar to the conditions China has set up for those quarantined, is likely encouraging the spread of the virus among those ""locked down"" is pretty much irrelevant to them. It sounds cold and cruel but I suspect they figure that those who survive survive and those who don't don't but at all costs they don't want the infected spreading it outside the quarantine zone. When resources are stretched tight, this cold-hearted calculus of how they can obtain the most benefits for their larger population rules."

The deadly Coronavirus spreading so fast is difficult to image or stop.  This disease is new and very unpredictable.

Other recovered people may take over duties in the logistic services of the hospitals."

2020-02-14 10:56:44,"China has an enormous security apparatus and a tiny health care system. For example, there are 1-2 million internet censors active at any given time, while they have less than 100K primary care physicians covering 1.4 billion population. Additionally, no communist government has ever been considerate to its citizens. The role of the party in any socialist society is to ""guide"" and not to ""serve"". Such is the nature of this system.

The ""warlike"" approach is likely the only one the government can apply, given the limitations and resources that are available. 

The disease is the ""enemy"" and any carrier of the virus is basically treated like a traitor or spy in a ""war"".

The above approach can work initially, but will become problematic if too many are affected by the disease and a critical mass is reached, or too many members of the security apparatus succumb to it.

Then China may break as a society and as a country."

They would rather save face than save lives."

Sadly, the know-nothing in our White House has praised Mr. Xi for his handling of this whole mess."

2020-02-14 13:20:36,One would think a totalitarian government would have a master plan in place to deal with contagious diseases. Here in NYC I'm a member of the medical reserve corps that was formed after 9/11. We are prepared for emergencies like this one. The last time we had an emergency here was after Hurricane Sandy. I was called up and proceeded to a makeshift shelter near me where a college gymnasium was converted with several beds. And meals that could readily be eaten were in Meals Ready to Eat hermetically sealed bags. This article reads like modern-day chaos. Why put people in medical isolation if there are no health care workers to attend to them? Where I volunteered I remember we had diabetic people in the shelter who needed insulin. Back then an entire nursing home in Coney Island was flooded out and their residents were removed to Brooklyn Technical High School. All their medicines were brought with them. Only volunteerism made a difference. Subways and buses were shut down for a while so no way the regular medical staff could get to the residents. During the Cultural Revolution it was every man for himself. So it might be expecting too much to get people in China to volunteer to help their fellow citizens in times of emergencies like the current coronavirus epidemic.
2020-02-14 12:15:42,"It seems the spread of the virus has been exacerbated by the Chinese in 2 ways. First, no one seems to trust the government or do what they are asked. Second, the me-first mentality of the Chinese in refusing to help each other with ill relatives or neighbors seems to have caused a lot of misery and deaths."
2020-02-14 13:24:58,"It seems indicative of what a totalitarian or communist state's approach might be to control a population; in this case a population of sick or potentially sick people. It seems there was no plan to treat these people initially, just to get them quarantined. I question the soundness of the approach to quarantining masses of people together to contain the virus from spreading based on suspicion of illness. It seems like quarantining them apart could have been more effective, given the correct adherence to medical standards of quarantine and disinfection. Perhaps China should have focused more on instituting an effective at-home quarantine, rather than just sending the sick home. I don't like this, or the forced quarantine on the cruise ship in Japan. It gives the virus more bodies to infect and how do we know that it won't mutate or jump ship?"
2020-02-14 13:06:50,"The giant warehouses shown can only isolate possible cases.  The people within the inland lazareto are likely to infect each other, while those outside are shielded from them.  This seems to be happening aboard the MV Diamond Princess in Yokohama."
2020-02-14 13:31:41,"In spring 2002, during the SARS outbreak, I was the medical director in a suburban school district. We had a student who had traveled to “Toronto,” (she and her mother were at staying with family in a suburb outside of the city). She developed fever and a cough and was seen in a local hospital ER.

The three criteria for “potential SARS” were:
- travel to Toronto 
- cough
- fever

Thus, the hospital staff consulted the DOH, they consulted the CDC. This teen was designated a “potential SARS case.”

What these ER staff and public health officials did not take into account: the young lady had a history of asthma, and she was having an asthma episode with a fever.

The result: the situation became crazy. The girl was quarantined. Since she was on the track team, the school nurses had to take the temperatures of all the students in the girls track team twice daily. 

The media frenzy was intense. The local/regional media outlets tracked district administration staff, myself included, to a district event. We held a press conference to get out in front of the situation. No amount of information that we provided satisfied the media. —> A media outlet tracked down the “patient” &  her family and outed her identity, violating her medical privacy rights. 
 
The community was alarmed. I couldn’t disclose the asthma dx., and that this made me confident it was NOT SARS. The whole thing became a three week circus. 

What’s going on in China does not surprise me at all. It would happen here."
2020-02-14 13:40:54,"Please note that those who died before a CT scan or the scarce nucleic acid test will not be counted among the official tally of those who died from corona virus. Many died alone at home or in a quarantine location with no doctor, no medicine, and no test.  ""Official"" numbers will not count them as a COVID-19 case, nor will they be counted as a COVID-19 fatality.

As a result, the official numbers are vastly under-counting true deaths and true fatalities.  In addition, confining all people together if infected or not will rapidly spread the disease to all persons in the room.  Official Chinese numbers place the number of persons under observation at over 450,000.  This number is a much more accurate reflection of the scale of the outbreak."

2020-02-14 18:24:57,"While those of us who understand the risks of Coronavirus worry about the contagion / epidemic / pandemic possibilities, it's also time to think about seasonal flu.  As we know, seasonal flu is largely preventable by having an annual flu vaccine.  

To increase knowledge about the ease and importance of having an annual flu shot, the Atlanta-based CDC has loads of information.  Especially good is their Flu Widget program - and if every reader takes the FLU IQ test and sends it to family and friends, hundreds of thousands of people could learn about the importance of having a flu shot every Fall.

From CDC:  ""Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It can cause mild to severe illness. Serious outcomes of flu infection can result in hospitalization or death. Some people, such as older people, young children, and people with certain health conditions, are at high risk of serious flu complications.""

2020-02-14 20:05:25,"The Chinese people are behind the efforts of the government  to the point that would be rare if not impossible in most Western countries. The original response of the Hubei Provincial and Wuhan city governments were dishonest and insufficient. This left thousands of sick people being sent home to infect others. Also up to 5 million Wuhan citizens were able to leave the city before the quarantine which was what caused the spread of the virus nationwide and worldwide. What the central government has done since then has been effective and the WHO director himself said was impressive. Of course this kind of centralized control would be impossible in the USA, or elsewhere. But 20000 doctors from around China have volunteered their time and gone to Wuhan to help with the effort.  The epidermic is being controlled. Daily new cases outside of Hubei and Wuhan have dropped every day for over 10 days and the death rate has been controlled to around 2%. And the recovery rate at this point of over 10% with thousands of people being sent home from hospital cured. These are facts that are being ignored underreported here in the USA. In the entire city of Shanghai which is home to about 24 million there has been one death in January and about 300 confirmed cases. There is a strikingly transparent press conference including govt and medical personnel broadcast very morning. In  a country of over four times the population of the USA this is beyond commendable."

""A lot of people write panicky, naïve stories. They make it on TV and everybody says, “What about the possibility this is a bioweapon?” It’s not enough for me to say, “No, it’s not a bioweapon.” I have to explain, “If it were a bioweapon, here’s what you would see in the genetic sequence of the virus.”
That requires some digging, because I don’t know the answers off the top of my head. I have to call several scientists. A lot of what I do is write notes to my bosses and colleagues saying, “This is why we should — or shouldn’t — ignore this.”
The panicky stories and nonsense raised as wild theories take SO MUCH TIME. 
Thanks for a nice summary of the day-to-date.

If the statistics comparisons are the same, then the media is being alarmist, but if the statistics are alarming, then perhaps, we should be alarmed.

For me, personally, it is hard to be alarmed when the deaths from automobile accidents is so high, and no one gets panic-stricken. And no one gets worked up about the 20,000 annual deaths from the flu."

I want to hide under my pillow and bulk order food and water. I'm scared to see family member who recently were at UCSF, where there are two coronavirus patients being treated. What is wise??

I heard him report that the virus is estimated (by whom) to have infected somewhere between 3 and 10% of the US population.  I seem to recall that herd immunity kicks in when about 60/70% of the herd has been infected.  Without   a vaccine or prophylactic, and given 40K deaths already, then is it overly gloomy to assume that the final death toll will be 40K/(3-10%) = 0.4 - 1.3M?  
Is it also reasonable to believe that since a vaccine won't be ready for 12-18 months, assuming no ADE issues,.  By that time, how many people will still need to be vaccinated, and how long will  that take?"

It is unlikely the virus sprang from a wet food market in Wuhan China, which is the politically correct line.  There are wet markets all over China, hundreds of thousands of them, widely dispersed over vast distances. There are millions of wet markets all over East and SE Asia and Africa where all species of exotic and domestic animals are slaughtered for human consumption.  That’s a big number in the millions with hundreds of millions of visitors.  So the chance that a new virus would percolate from any of them is approximately the same.  Yet this new strain of virus chose to come out of one place and only one place  - Wuhan, China - a place where there is also the Wuhan Virology Lab that studies and experiments with new viruses.  This is a “bio safety level 4” facility because of the highly hazardous viruses it handles.  That chance, karma, or bad luck chose Wuhan’s wet food market over all the other wet markets in Asia and Africa is nonsense.  What made Wuhan’s wet market riskier than the millions of other wet markets in Asia and Africa?   The Wuhan Virology Lab."

This crisis presents a threat to the world which grows exponentially each day it spreads.  Unregulated animal production, sale and consumption, coupled with a lack of health and safety standards provides the breeding ground for lethal global epidemics such as the Wuhan Coronavirus to strike, causing worldwide panic, illness and devastation.

While efforts are being made by officials in China to contain the disease, the response is not nearly strong enough to prevent such a global health emergency from happening again, let alone contain the current outbreak.  The Chinese government has issued a temporary ban on wet markets, much like it did after the SARS virus appeared in 2002.  This temporary ban simply is not enough. This approach fails to address the root of the problem – the existence of wet markets where dead and live animals, wildlife, domestic animals and endangered animals are sold together on the street, subject to virtually no inspection.

Like the coronavirus crisis, both the avian flu outbreak and SARS were traced to this dangerously unsanitary practice. The world is literally sick of ""wet"" markets. If China's government cannot put an end to them, the nation should face an international embargo and quarantine."
2020-02-13 13:31:47,"I think the real problem is the CCP and Xi Jinping. So there’s no solution for coronavirus in that great masterpiece, Xi Jinping Thought?  What a surprise."
2020-02-13 12:47:41,What happens to a provincial leader after they are fired by the Communist Party? Retirement? Reappointment? Emigration?
2020-02-13 12:52:40,The number of infections is double due to new diagnosis. Then why the number of dead is also double than yesterday?
2020-02-13 13:06:19,China has a self inflicted flesh wound which risks contaminating many more countries. However instead of casting blame it would be more productive to produce the vaccine.￼
2020-02-13 12:57:10,"I agree with the lady in the net and blue gloves....

Shouldn’t everyone be wearing gloves?"
2020-02-13 14:03:07,"@Tom. Yes wet markets are clearly the proximate cause, and widely known since SARS to be the most likely source of pandemic threat.  

But their is another alarming aspect to what caused this crisis and one that in particular all those in the US should weigh heavily. That is a pervasive systematic cause of policy influenced by expectations from leadership. Expectations that clearly warped information coming from the provincial level through December and January. Today many wonder about false reporting from China and for good reason, for China is now fighting a massive provincial epidemic while simultaneously fighting at least a dozen other smaller potential epidemics through the country. Anyone of these has the potential to bomb out into regional epidemics. 

Viral epidemics do not listen to false facts, false reports, or false hopes. As Justice does not listen to false facts, false reports or or like the current GOP leadership false hopes of the President’s pervasive influence on the Justice Department and the Judiciary. We in the US must now fight as we have always done on multiple fronts for our common interests are clearly known and much indeed all is at stake."
2020-02-13 13:55:51,The question posed by the new cases that are apparently not related to the quarantined cruise ship is- How did this corona virus appear in three widely dispersed geographic areas. Clearly we need more data to ascertain if we have the spread of one virus or the appearance of independent unrelated viruses. Before running off at the mouth and pen and concluding only one virus is involved  the media and the public should wait for the science to provide facts.
2020-02-13 14:45:48,"The astonishing numbers of infected people either on the cruise ship (over 230 so far) or a hotpot gathering in Hong Kong(11 of 20) provide additional support on my assumption that high humidity will promote spread while very low humidity may kill the virus right away.
I understand that humidity should not be the sufficient or only parameter to cause an infection or not, maybe unless it is too extreme like that on the plane . From WHO , I find that the normal humidity inside cabin is under 20% . Would this be the reason that no confirmed transmission has been recorded so far by someone sitting close to a virus carrier this time ? Would the COVID-19 die easily at humidity under 20%?  On the other hand, why was spreading on plane occurred during Sars period whereas the number of current air passengers carried for China is 200% more than 2003 but with no case ?"
2020-02-13 15:54:47,"If the test they have been using is only 30 to 40% accurate, depending on what that means,  then the number of false positives may be or actually is huge, meaning that the number of positives who actually have the disease may be only a small proportion, which places all the statistics we have been seeing into some kind of netherworld.   

It would be nice to know what is actually going on."
2020-02-13 16:42:41,"Almost 30% of our mild colds are caused by human Corona viruses, so we just need to add yet another one to our sniffles and move on. For folks with preexisting conditions, any flu or illness can be deadly, so just take the same kind of precautions. As our global economy becomes even more inter-dependent, we are going to be transferring a lot more than just economics. I hope people who vote in November remember that our present government, with their current proposals to disarm the CDC with funding cuts, disabling scientists, destroying food safety and environmental safety issues, will increase the likelihood of not being able to address the future safety of Americans. Simply having a great economy does not guarantee you will live to earn or spend your money. Please vote Blue."
2020-02-13 17:17:16,How did the virus reach this woman or the taxi driver?  Or the Japanese official who was infected?  Have Japanese authorities failed their people by not conducting the ship’s quarantine properly?  Did they give their official a faulty biohazard suit or to train staff and meticulously supervise their donning and work in and removal of said suits?
2020-02-13 16:04:26,"This is all really concerning, and increasingly so as the days and weeks pass. I would like to know more about the virus: are people recovering? How many have it and don't need hospitalization (it feels like a regular flu)? Should travelers flying domestically in the US take precautions, and if so, what is effective? Could the virus possibly be traveling undetected within communities in the US already?"
2020-02-13 17:42:15,"Air pollution in China and other parts of Asia (from burning coal, low quality diesel and plastic) cause many people of all ages to suffer respiratory distress. This may increase the likelihood of catching the virus and make it more severe if infected."
2020-02-13 16:59:12,"USA has evacuated about 800 Americans from Wuhan and 15 of them so far have the coronavirus, with more to be expected as per CDC.

That's about 2% of the people evacusted from Wuhan, before they cross infect others.  That 2% number has held consistent about other groups evacusted from China.

In China, you can expect that the rate of infection among the population is more than 2% of the population, because infected patients continue to infect others , just because the numbers are so high and they cannot be isolated as effectively ,as have been done in USA. So 5% is a more likely infected rate among the population.

So in Wuhan province alone, with 50 million population, at 5% infected rate, there are 2.5 Million corona virus cases. I hope WHO does some independent analysis and comes up with realistic numbers."
2020-02-13 18:39:21,There is no mention in any of these articles about medical treatment for the virus or its symptoms - so why are people at the initial stages of the disease being packed into stadiums and schools if there is no medical help that can be provided? Surely the risk of contagion would be less if they just stayed home.
2020-02-13 18:45:01,"My neighbor just cam back from China on Tuesday and he's not self-quarantining. First of all, I thought no flights were coming from China and now people are arriving without restrictions. Granted he may not have been in the hot zone, but I thought the whole country of China was now considered suspect? He left DC January 18 to China for the Lunar New Year celebration and returned February 9."
2020-02-13 19:01:17,"I think the chinese policy of rounding up people suspected of corona virus and dumping them in hotels, motels, stadiums, exhibition halls with almost no medical care is counter productive. 

It may be better to keep patients with mild symptoms at home and quarantine families in their home setting. That way only family members are at risk and the patient is in a home setting and relatively more comfortable.

Only serious cases should be moved to hospitals, which are overwhelmed with no spare beds.
Its a gigantic challenge and my best wishes and prayers for people in the front line fighting it."
2020-02-13 19:10:51,"I thought I read statements by health officials that masks are not effective, but frequent hand washing is essential. So why aren't more people wearing gloves?"
2020-02-13 17:29:49,"PLEASE, NYT, report on how many people are SURVIVING infection with this virus, and what their experiences of the illness, recovery, and life so far afterwards.

Without this kind of reporting as well, you may be spreading a possibly inaccurate and harmful impression that the virus is always, or almost always, deadly to humans.  An impression that furthers the psychological torment of  those infected, those who’ve come in contact with them, and their families, all of whom may then be stigmatized or worse.  Mindlessly stoking panic or withholding credible hope-sustaining information is not what journalism is for, and we need a fuller picture."
2020-02-13 18:45:33,"The origin of this killer virus is most likely the Wuhan Virology Lab, not a wet street market in Wuhan.

From Science, “Mining coronavirus genomes for clues to the outbreak’s origins”
By Jon CohenJan. 31, 2020 , 6:20 PM


“Concerns about the (Wuhan Virology Lab) institute predate this outbreak. Nature ran a story in 2017 about it building a new biosafety level 4 lab and included molecular biologist Richard Ebright of Rutgers University, Piscataway, expressing concerns about accidental infections, which he noted repeatedly happened with lab workers handling SARS in Beijing. Ebright, who has a long history of raising red flags about studies with dangerous pathogens, also in 2015 criticized an experiment in which modifications were made to a SARS-like virus circulating in Chinese bats to see whether it had the potential to cause disease in humans. Earlier this week, Ebright questioned the accuracy of Bedford’s calculation that there are at least 25 years of evolutionary distance between RaTG13—the virus held in the Wuhan virology institute—and 2019-nCoV, arguing that the mutation rate may have been different as it passed through different hosts before humans. Ebright tells ScienceInsider that the 2019-nCoV data are “consistent with entry into the human population as either a natural accident or a laboratory accident.””"
2020-02-13 18:46:56,"The ease with which people are getting infected is shocking.  This is from latest Honk Kong infections.

The number of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) cases in Hong Kong has increased to 53 as of 8pm local time on Thursday, after three new case were confirmed, Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said.

One of the additional cases involves a 43-year-old man who has good past health and lives in Hong Kong's Tuen Mun district. He had no history of travel during the incubation period, but attended a family banquet on January 30 where the patient of Hong Kong's 47th case was also present.

The other two cases involve a 67-year-old woman and her 37-year-old son. They both had no history of travel during the incubation period, but had dinner with the patients of three previously confirmed cases at a restaurant on January 26."
2020-02-13 18:20:19,"This is going to be ruthless. China is well versed in ""mass roundup"" and has facilities and support personnel already in place to do that for very large numbers. 

The irony of the education centers that were built for ""educating"" Uyghurs now soon may be getting used for ""recuperating"" everybody."
2020-02-13 18:38:40,"By all indications they've been keeping everyone on that cruise ship until they're all sick. Left in their cabin rooms to deal with it. All the time, spreading more germs. What could be worse, than getting locked down on a cruise ship as the virus spreads...I've always had a low opinion of cruise ships, but this is beyond the pale."

2020-02-13 18:27:46,"Various news images show thousands of people wearing cheap masks that are worn with the ostensible purpose of avoiding infection by the coronavirus. Those masks are not air tight. People are being sold a ""bill of goods"" about the value of the masks."
2020-02-13 19:23:29,"World-wide, at this point there are about 60,000 cases reported and a little more that 1300 deaths.  The deaths are overwhelmingly, nearly all of them, in the Chinese province containing Wuhan with a little more than a handful elsewhere in the world.  That makes for an exceedingly low incidence and death rate.  Of course, that may change.  It speaks to something unique about the core area of infection which may reflect how China has bound so many people to remain in close proximity with one another.  We are seeing the effects of the disease but also, importantly, effects of how it's being handled in China.   It's a perspective to keep in mind when reading about the daily new infections and deaths."
2020-02-13 19:30:57,"I am concerned that a lack of eye protection is a serious oversight allowing many infections. ""Over the glasses"" goggles are available as well as regular goggles. The fast spread is alarming and that may be a contributing cause."
2020-02-13 19:17:15,Why are you still using coronavirus? The disease has a name COVID19.
2020-02-13 19:21:51,"I get a little unsettled when I read comments about how this is just like the seasonal flu and we should all just chill.

I'm not an epedmiologist nor do I have any medical training, but I do know a little bit about statistics.Anyone who is a skeptic regarding the potential exponential risks associated with the Covid-19 virus should study the four graphics displayed in this article at the Guardian:

<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/feb/11/how-novel-coronavirus-spread-across-the-world-visual-explainer"" target=""_blank"">https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/feb/11/how-novel-coronavirus-spread-across-the-world-visual-explainer</a>

I call particular attention to the last of the four graphics (two side by side graphs) which carries this header:

""The coronavirus is one of the most contagious and deadly of similar epidemics. In less than a quarter of the time, the number of cases and deaths has dwarfed those associated with the outbreak of Sars, a related virus, in 2003."""
2020-02-13 19:30:04,"One thing China can do better than any other country is mass roundups, rapid building of hospitals, quarantine and containment to prevent person to person transmission of the Coronavirus COVID-19. With 15 cases in the USA and the virus found in all countries except countries of the continent of Africa and Antarctica, if China can stop any further spread more power to China. It has a good track record of stopping spread of another Corona virus SARS in the early 2000s. 

China should share accurate information about what it knows about the virus so that the global results in the rapid eradication of the virus. response to eradicate the infection."
2020-02-13 19:39:40,Why is this referred to as a mass roundup? Bringing the infected to quarantine is public health 101.
2020-02-13 19:41:11,"Not that this doesn't deserve some attention, but for all the attention this is getting, keep in mind that almost every year, about 40,000-70,000 people die of influenza in this country, 10,000 - 20,000 die from drugs like ibuprofen, and so on.

Americans choose what they decide to care and get excited about, not always in a rational fashion.  

Dead from Influenza is the same as dead from Coronavirus

And people still don't get vaccinated against influenza."
2020-02-13 19:48:43,"This virus is a stark reminder that China is extremely autocratic and nationalistic.  We in the US should crack down harder on China - maybe raise tariffs even more not reduce them; substantially curtail visas for Chinese students and business travel and pregnant women and generally increase sanctions on those who jail Ughirs and inhibit freedom of speech in China.
These measures will help US companies become less reliant or even independent of Chinese suppliers while forcing China to deal with the repression of their own people.  We should stand with the voices within China that are bravely challenging repression and not with the oppressors."
2020-02-13 20:50:18,"Currently almost all hospitals in the US are packed with patients due to flu related illnesses. We currently do not have any capacity to manage an outbreak of Covid 19. So for those of you who keep saying what is the big deal, we have no place to evaluate or treat. We too might have to look at military bases and college dorms. It is a big deal and that is why both the CDC and health care providers are worried."
2020-02-13 21:01:45,"Cruise ships have never been my thing... it’s a Petri dish. My last two airline flights resulted in contracting common cold 3 days later. What seems to be missing from the reporting
Are statements from the epidemiologists / infectious disease experts....the disease complications, mortality percentages, incubation period etc.
Generally all of us need to wash hands  thoroughly so much more! And  get those flu shots each season and when symptomatic stay home."
2020-02-13 20:28:45,"I am indeed glad and heartened by the fact that China is responding to this epidemic by relying on its core competencies. After all, rounding up large numbers of their own citizens, imprisoning them for their own good and letting them die is something all communist regimes have been uncommonly good at."
2020-02-13 20:55:33,"So the Japanese government is unable to test even the people on one cruise ship? Compare that to hundreds of thousands the Chinese have tested. Does anyone really believe the US could handle such a crisis any better? Let's not forget that US has hundreds of evacuees detained on military bases under armed guard. No article on that NYT? No doubt the Chinese regime is and will be brutal, and no doubt the US would be brutal too."
2020-02-13 20:34:57,"I wish people would stop comparing this to the common flu. If anyone thinks China would take these measures over a virus comparable to the common flu then they are very naive.

Is China willing to admit to what truly caused this and stop obstructing along with their puppet WHO? Or will China continue along the same road? My guess is that the leaders feel they can risk losing a substantial portion of their population and carry on. 

The problem is if this starts wiping out other populations, especially 3rd world countries where China was making inroads for access to natural resources. The backlash would be tremendous. Anyway China after the coronavirus will have to deal with big changes."
2020-02-13 20:16:17,Mass round ups of people with mild symptoms will likely make more people sick and break the back of medical providers.  Rational preventive efforts should focus on avoiding sending people to hospitals or camps except as a last resort.  People with preexisting medical conditions should not go to mass camps.
2020-02-13 21:10:07,"The headline we should be seeing to help everyone rest easy:

“No ‘dramatic increase’ in coronavirus cases outside China""
 
WHO The World Health Organization said on Thursday there hasn’t been “dramatic increases” in coronavirus cases outside China, aside from cases on the Diamond Princess cruise docked in Japan.”"
2020-02-13 21:19:50,"Given the standard of logic newly discovered to have validity in Wuhan, China, perhaps patients formerly counted among those deceased ostensiblely due to Covid-19 & who have subsequently been cremated, should no longer be counted with the statistical analysis of the epidemic. They no longer show any sign of infection, no longer require treatment and are unlikely to make further demands on medical resources. Family members are typically not available for comment."
2020-02-13 22:47:13,"I see no reporting on how lockdowns affect the itinerant workforce in China. A huge population of construction  and day laborers would have no work right now. Because the virus outbreak began at the start of New Year celebrations, these workers would have likely already left cities to return to their families, in rural areas, for the week. And they will be stuck in the countryside with no income, or — maybe worse — stuck in the cities with no work. This is a largely invisible population that works for cash in hand, often off the books. How can they survive? 

The notion of being locked down in place, or rounded up and transported to a virtual prison, scares me more than the virus does. When people are prohibited from taking care of their daily responsibilities, there will be collateral losses. I saw a story about a disabled person dying from dehydration and because the family member (father, I think) who was his sole carer was placed in quarantine. That is a cruel death. I think of the elderly who have no one to see to their needs, and people with chronic health issues needing and not getting daily medication or home nursing care, and of abandoned pets — not human, of course, but living creatures — dying from lack of water or food.

Even for the people stuck on cruise ships — provided for, but stuck nonetheless — I think of how many things would go wrong in my comfortable, reasonably organized life if I were forced to sit on a cruise ship for weeks. It’s a terrifying thought."
2020-02-13 23:00:04,"Despite the human rights abuses which is what this piece strives to report, I am amazed by the daunting, to put it mildly, challenge faced by China.   Their response, its results, have yet to be fully evaluated.  They are in extreme crisis mode, dealing with millions of people.  They are doing what makes sense to them.  Those who sit far away in the comfort of their homes and criticize China are doing the easy thing.  While in this crisis mode, it's premature to pass judgement on their effort."

China is facing not just a health crisis but I think its reputation has been tarnished for ever.

 India is notorious for Delhi Belly - but this is at worse.

It's their Vietnam and they should own it.

I have been to China many times and travel a lot - just returned from Kashmir - days of bus loads of Chinese tourists being catered to - are gone - for good.

Governments around the world are going to tighten visa requirements for the Chinese - requiring health clearances like the old days of TB free certificates.

And that's going to make it difficult for Chinese to travel.

I also think it is their Vietnam because it is going to leave them with a sense of everything they have done economically - like our efforts in Vietnam - have come to a nought - and there is nothing they can do.

For commerce, many companies will now actively redo their supply chain to ensure they are not putting all their eggs in one basket.

Thanks to its strange eating habits - the Chinese have done themselves in.

No tarriffs ever could have strangled Chinese economy as this virus has.

And like us in Vietnam - they alone deserve the blame."

2020-02-13 22:33:59,"This story is misleading. Whenever you change the basis of measurements you will get a large change in the numbers. This is a re-calibration. No reason to get alarmed just because of the jump in numbers. Cases outside China are not jumping, and there appears to be a slow-down in infections. 

This is not to say that the situation is not critical in Wuhan. This is definitely a time to help China instead of always making reference to old tropes. The news from inside China is that the US talks a good game about helping, but has not done so well in actually providing help. Some may be due to communication problems, but we all know that the Trump administration talks a good game, but is poor on effective application."

We are men, fragile and strong, not omnipotent voyeurs."
2020-02-13 22:42:40,"I think that it is very odd that such a high percentage of the US citizens evacuated from Wuhan that are being held in quarantine actually tested positive for the virus. I am sure that anyone very sick would have been prohibited from the planes. Statistically speaking expats represent a small subset of population where there 20 million persons living in the Wuhan area.  Their activities, overall health, standard of economics would protect them more than the average citizen..So the original 150 passengers were in the first evacuation and about 500 passengers more in the subsequent. So far there are about 15 cases in the US where 3 cases were confirmed at their quarantined military base facilities (2 California and 1 in Texas). The initial 150 were tested multiple times and were released yesterday. 
As a subset you could take 3/350 there would be about a 1 percent infection rate. Given the agreed upon misinformation of the Chinese government. The real infections would be 20 million at 1 percent would be a 200,000 person outbreak with a 1-2 percent fatality rate.= 10,000-20,000. Adding for delayed symptoms onset, super spreaders, insufficient diagnosis, sanitary facilities for care- rates of incidents numbers would be increasing exponentially.

There is no change in the virus from 2 days ago, only a classification rule change and improved ascertainment. It is the (dumb) media leading the dumb public.

Mr. Xi firing two top communist leaders for not being loyal enough and the optics the world sees of his lack of controlling the outbreak and number of deaths. Sounds like Trump firing people who are not loyal to him in his administration."

2020-02-14 01:30:39,"The subway in the picture looks sparkling clean. I wish NYC would at least step up the cleaning of our subways, disinfecting them nightly and letting us know they are being disinfected. I know this isn't the most important issue right now, but this whole crisis has made me take a good look around and see how disgusting the city is right now. Garbage on the streets, trains never cleaned. New York is really at a low point (I lay this at your feet, Mayor DiBlasio). A clean city would make people feel more optimistic about their health, which in turn would lower stress and boost the immune system and improve public health!"

And the useless UN spend its time again and again attacking Israel on behalf of global liberal, anti US “enlightened” leaders with European support for the sake of Palestinians who have continuously rejected Israel and peace in favor of terrorism, ANTISEMITISM and delegitimization.  Ignored are the many more lives of legitimate victims around the globe.  

In our world, brainwashing and delusion is the filter that shapes policy and political discourse.

2020-02-14 00:43:13,"Absolutely incredible that censorship is what led to this outbreak becoming as bad as it has become — and yet the Chinese are STILL censoring people!!!

Absolutely chilling that two citizen journalists have gone missing. China — are you going to keep suppressing information until the whole world is dead? We need more information, not less. 

To the CCP: your hold on power loses legitimacy with every act of censorship. People see through it and know you are hiding things. If you truly had the respect and support of the people you rule, you wouldn’t have muzzle them."
2020-02-14 01:17:27,"Which is more likely? 
1.  This virus, like Ebola, Hantavirus, Lassa, Marburg, came from a wild animal.  We have a large market in the area where the disease broke out that has live wild and domestic animals which is an excellent way expose people to such things.  
Or
2.  It’s a secret plot by (insert hostile government here) to attack us."

If the virus was available at the laboratory, an accidental release would have been quickly camouflaged by multiple releases at a variety of other plausible locations in the tropics within a few days of the accident. The idea that the Chinese would have intentionally released the virus in the same city where their lab was located is very much like suggesting they would likely test a nuclear weapons by detonating one over Shanghai. Highly unlikely!"

This report can be dismissed as one of many and considered written by a ""Casandra"" like those so labeled who predicted the 2008 crash, but should the incidence rate dramatically increase in U.S., I fear that improper or insufficient information and attention will be given to the public in the U.S. from pressure by Trump&Co.

All institutional structures have been attacked, attempts to disassembled them continue, truth-tellers are demonized, politicians live in fear of their lives from right-wing elements, federal judiciaries and juries are being pressured, the rule of law is being reoriented by a lawless Attorney General, Wall Street reaches new highs as the society deteriorates.

I read again articles in the business press that offer tips for profiting off the deaths of tens of thousands while also admitting and long-standing disruption of supply chains could lead to a world-wide recession (read: depression).

In other words, is a ""perfect storm"" brewing that is under the stewardship of a sadistic, psychopathic president in league with power-brokers who only seek profit, call truth ""fake"", enrich the few, seek to starve the poor, willfully dismantle health related safety nets?

Call me Casandra, but I do think about it. I worry."

2020-02-14 03:16:13,"It is worth noting that despite the appropriate criticism leveled against the Chinese ruling party; that mistakes are being made elsewhere, by WHO and the CDC. Still to this today there is ambiguity on the part of scientists about the incubation period, infectious nature, time of incubation, where or not testing early on can even detect it (even though you may have it and be symptomatic later on) so on and so on. And viruses mutate. We are in uncharted waters, so beware the government officials telling you not to worry and that our health system can handle it. The same statement is being made in over 200 countries and frankly, it is a lie."

2020-02-14 03:23:56,"During the great plague of 1347-1351 - which killed 25 million people (one third of the earth's population at that time) - people were desparately trying to determine the cause of the disease so as to find a way to stop it --

One theory - understandable considering the time - was the plague was a punishment from God upon the earth's population - which gave rise to groups of religious penitents marched from town to town wearing hair shirts and whipping themselves as they went along - better known as the Flagellants - in the hopes of receiving God's mercy and forgiveness -

Another theory - somewhat more popular - was an idea that ""The Jews"" had somehow poisoned the public water supply - causing an unstoppable spread of the plague - and to blame them for the horror -

In ignorant retaliation - Jews were beaten and murdered in numerous cities across Europe as punishment - and in he hopes that would somehow hasten the end of the plague --

So - here we are in 2002 - with a new plague, which is also spreading panic and ignorance as it  infects humans around the world --

It's safe to say that we probably won't see groups of people wearing hair shirts and whipping each other in this iteration --

However - finding a target of blame - as in - ""This is all THEIR fault"" - or - ""If it wasn't for THOSE PEOPLE this would have never happened"" - is still a very popular, deeply ingrained - and an almost instinctive survival mechanism - lurking just under the surface..."
2020-02-14 03:31:02,"People who want to get tested should fly from  San Diego to Washington DC and walk into their Senator’s office. After saying “I was in Wuhan two weeks ago and the CDC has refused to administer a COVID-19 test on me,” they will get prompt and immediate medical attention."
2020-02-14 03:40:05,"What a disgrace is this so called government that condemns people to death because its so called leaders are simply breathtakingly ignorant and ingloriously callous!

As it is clear from victims of the virus elsewhere, common treatment against flu —basically good hydration and monitoring— works very well for most. 

Hospitalizations should be reserved for complicated cases. Treatment should be at home. The virus is already rampant in the wild, with most people having no symptoms but being contagious.

These ridiculous mass incarcerations —these are no quarantines— are only furthering the spread and condemning innocent people to die due to lack of care."
2020-02-14 04:12:41,"14840 to 4800. It's still increasing but at a much slower rate. What we can do to further contain the outbreak is to send more medical resources to China. While some hawkish critics might not be happy, this is the only way that the Chinese citizens will be thankful to the outside world after the epidemic goes away eventually. 
It's the Chinese people who can make China a better civilized society, not the Chinese regime. We can see the mirror image of this simple truth right in the U.S. In spite of the disrespectful Trump administration, the U.S. and its people are still the vanguard of democracy."
2020-02-14 03:51:31,"A comment about the condition of the subway in the pic made me think. Despite our mental images of China involving filthy wet markets and rampant spitting, the interior of that subway car looks like you could eat off it. Compare this to a typical NYC subway car. If one of the wealthiest cities in America can’t currently provide basic sanitation for its’ mass transit system, how are we going to deal with an epidemic here? We are the ones living in 3rd world conditions! We are NOT ready! We have to start fixing things now. We have to get ready because, even if we somehow dodge this one, a plague is coming."
2020-02-14 03:52:49,"What if this was not contained and was  allowed to spread? Would it truly be devastating in terms of deaths or is it the unknowns that are creating such panic? 

I don't intend this to be a stupid question; I'm trying to separate hype from reality. Is it inherently coronavirus that would be so devastating or our fear of coronavirus?"
2020-02-14 04:11:59,"The Chinese government, and their subsidiary the WHO, can't be trusted to provide accurate estimates of infections and deaths due to this virus. They go around spraying pesticides and rat poison throughout their streets, and pretend that is sanitization. They are locking people in makeshift prisons they call hospitals. They are quashing doctors who speak out when the disease hits.
Until we see an independent 3rd partys unbiased assessment, this epidemic will not be fully understood. Stop taking the CCP's word for it."
2020-02-14 04:24:23,"Newton wrote that every action has an equal, but opposite, reaction. Maybe reaching nearly eight billion people on earth inevitably resulted in a ""culling of the herd""? Epidemics thrive on close contacts, especially business contacts. Just look at how the plague spread in medieval times.

The German COVID-19 outbreak - just as an example - would not have been possible without international business travel. Also the fact that China has become a major global economic player contributed to the spread of the virus. In - let's say - the 60's the virus would probably stayed inside the country, even the city/province, much longer.

No matter how and when this epidemic (or pandemic?) ends, we should think about how to prevent the next one. Unrestricted air travel is not just bad for the environment (CO2) but can also put us all into an early grave. Watch ""Outbreak"" again and imagine an airborne-person-to-person Ebola flying Lufthansa at 500 MPH...

There are alternatives. Just ask Cisco how much their business jumped up after 9/11 when flying became a big no-no for business-people. I know that teleconferencing is not the same as ""being there"", and the ""networking"" part of having drinks and shaking hands is very important, but it's exactly the shaking of hands that's the problem.

Maybe someone needs to invent a surgical glove for business-people, with pinstripe-design or so. Boss and Gucci to the rescue!"
2020-02-14 05:27:42,"The weak link in infection control is a lack of eye protection. Eyes are a likely reason for the still expanding spread of the virus. It's all well and good to have a mask but people should be wearing eye protection as well. ""over the glass"" goggles and regular goggles are available. 

Another concern is the appearance of panic by some claiming they are detained without care. They should be told to remember that the death rate of those infected is only about 2 out of every 100 afflicted, so chances are pretty good if they endure the illness calmly to reinforce the immune system, they will easily survive. But panic will result in harmful stress that will inhibit healing. To be calm is to be confident of survival and that will likely contribute to defeating the disease.

Remember that out of chaos always comes order, but don't strong arm panic or you will exaggerate the chaos."

This is misleading. As used here, the ""death toll"" will always reach ""a new high"" as long as anyone dies and none of the dead are resurrected. While I am not saying that the official numbers can be trusted, the number of confirmed deaths over the past day does not represent ""a new high"" and has actually dropped a little. The total ""death toll"" at any given moment, however, is always ""a new high"" by definition. More humans have died by 8:50 AM EST, 2/12/2020 than at any previous point in history. See?"
2020-02-12 13:35:39,"China has re-defined cases to exclude positive tests that are asymptomatic.  So not only are they not testing everyone, they are also excluding some positive tests from the count!  That's why the rate is slowing- dishonesty and redefinition."
2020-02-12 12:59:56,"I'd like to get some confirmation that China has changed how to count infected or cured people, which would account for China's announcement that the infection rate is dropping. Can a reporter please look in to this? Thanks."

2020-02-12 14:25:44,"The Chinese have CHANGED the way they “count” those sick with the virus.  Only those with symptoms are now counted.  

So they SAY there are fewer “new” cases.  But really, they’ve figured out how to make it appear there are fewer.  Simply by counting differently.

How can WHO (world health org) allow this?

There has to be a common rule for counting cases!"
2020-02-12 14:46:27,"It would be laughable if it wasn't so serious.  Health officials being infected on a quarantined ship - infected people being released through paperwork mistakes the different ways the dead and infected are counted - statements like the virus doesn't live on surfaces and that washing your hands is the most effective way of controlling the virus.  They say don't overreact but a whole country is shut down - governments are spending billions, trade worldwide has been disrupted - what's really going on??  You can't find N95 masks anywhere  even the Doc who alerted the world died from it  - don't you think he took precautions.  I'm still scared!"

I would really like to know the health status of those people. What % have developed severe symptoms, how many require dramatic intervention (on respirators), how many are sustaining with milder symptoms? 

Being anchored outside of China, it should be easier to get specifics like this on these patients and importantly, to feel more confident in the information. As a representative case study of the illness, its very useful to follow closely. As a reader, I want this information.

What news outlets are providing the specifics on these 175 passengers and crew? I've seen nothing more than the fact that they have been identified and removed.

My heart goes out to all Chinese citizens, who live under this suppressive totalitarianism."
2020-02-12 15:33:44,"Corona has been roaming the world since some time. We can probably expect it to peak in April in the US judging by the way accidental releases of those exposed to corona are walking amongst the rest of us. The panic around it has astounded me. It seems like governments, administrations, medical institutions are all panicking first and thinking after it's too late. 

First, why did it start in Wuhan? There are wet markets all over China and many other Asian and African countries with animals packed unhygienically. Bats are captured and eaten in other places too. What is the event that makes Wuhan special? Did the corona native to bats undergo a seminal mutation that helped it jump to humans? Was the first infectious creature who infected others, a pangolin, a bat or really an asymptomatic human working in the market with this new, jumpy virus?

Secondly, is this strain or closely related strain already present in rural populations that live close to bats etc. Is it present in populations around the world that live in places with the fruit bat? Australia, India, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Middle east etc. 

Third, what changed the course of SARS, MERS, Nipah and Hendra? All from bats and all as scary if not more. Why did they reduce? Was it weather patterns, medication, awareness, hygiene?

Four, please folks, eat healthy, stay healthy. Be hygienic, don't eat or drink everyone else's foods. And if you choose alternative medicines, stick to plants we cook with."
2020-02-12 15:40:36,"In a notice issued by China's National Health Commission (NHC) on Feb. 6, it wrote that the classification of new Wuhan virus infections will be divided into four categories: ""suspected cases,"" ""clinically diagnosed cases,"" ""confirmed cases,"" and ""positive tests."" Among these, ""positive tests"" refers to ""asymptomatic infected patients"" who test positive for the disease but have no symptoms."
2020-02-12 15:59:43,A Japanese official testing positive after surveying passengers on a ship is scary. That tells me that the virus is not only highly contagious but also probably quite sturdy with regard to resistance to being destroyed by disinfectants or other environmental factors that would destroy HIV easily.

I realize that neither data point is particularly accurate at this point given the number of people who simply can't get tested -- let alone treated -- in Wuhan due to a backlog of patients.

And we keep hearing that more passengers on this ill-fated ship are becoming sick. I suspect COVID-19 is far more contagious than experts realize and can be transmitted through many other means than direct contact (perhaps even via ventilation systems). I wouldn't want to be stuck on that ship!"

I would also be contacting lawyers about the detainment and illnesses. Any competent lawyer can make the case that those testing positive on the ship did so because of the quarantine. I would be suing the cruise line for about $30 million.

Turned away on coronavirus fear, Westerdam cruise ship risks running low on food

Countries could continue to refuse to berth the Westerdam cruise ship carrying 2,257 people, citing unfounded fears of deadly COVID-19, until conditions on the luxury liner become so dire that it invokes an emergency.

The ship operated by Carnival Corp.’s Holland America Line could be forced to wait until it’s in distress — running out of water, food or fuel — before international law-of-the-sea conventions kick in and legally obligate the closest country to admit the vessel or provide help, according to maritime experts.

“The countries are all passing the buck until it lands in the lap of someone who has to take the ship because the ship’s run out of fuel or food,” said Jean-Paul Rodrigue, a professor of transit geography at Hofstra University in New York. “When the ship is in distress, the nearest port of call will be bound in this case to help. That’s the law.”

2 Russians flee virus quarantine, in dismay at hospitals

MOSCOW (AP) — One patient jumped out of a hospital window to escape her quarantine and another managed to break out by disabling an electronic lock.

Two Russian women who were kept in isolation for possible inflection by a new virus say they fled from their hospitals this month because of uncooperative doctors, poor conditions and fear they would become infected. Russian health authorities haven't commented on their complaints.

China has been reporting the cases of infected Coronavirus only if confirmed by the test kits, due to the shortage of test kits and shortage of medical facility, large number of patients in Wuhan were not admitted to the isolation wards and self segregated at home. Those were counted only as suspected cases and deaths resulting were not counted as due to the virus as local officials trying to put a best face on it. Beijing now has sent more than 10,000 medical doctors and nurses to the area to treat all suspected cases and require the reporting change of clinically suspected cases as decided by doctors as actual cases without requiring confirmation of the test kits. So the actual cases of infected and deaths will jump while the suspected cases will decline due to the reporting change. It means those suffering from the virus will be in isolation and treated."

With 31,000,000 (yes million) cases. That's a whopping percentage of the population.
If flu got even a third of the PR that Coronavirus is getting, perhaps lives could be saved.

2020-02-13 03:00:06,"Everyone is eventually going to get it. It spreads like the common cold and stays with you for life. If you don't die of pneumonia in the first outbreak, a recurrence when your immune system in weaker will get you years down the line. Flare ups will spread it to everyone you contact. That is what they are not telling you. It doesn't go away. it just goes into remission."
2020-02-13 05:31:13,"The sudden jump in infected cases should be greeted with a dose of relief. After all, it means the Chinese are making the situation more transparent. They're not trying to cook the numbers, so to speak. That's one step towards the right direction. Now what the Chinese need is outside medical resources to help it and the world to contain the virus. Yes, the Chinese are responsible for this disaster, but innocent people outside China are already the collateral damage. We need to fight the virus first and then assign the blame later."
2020-02-13 13:27:46,"If the Chinese government lied about the number of cases last week, who is to say the numbers they are providing now are accurate?  The Chinese government has been suspected of lying about their economic performance for years, why wouldn’t they lie about this?"
2020-02-13 14:04:45,Was there a 'sudden' surge in deaths in one day or have they been negligent in reporting accurate numbers? It seems odd that there were 1100 deaths on Wednesday and 1370 deaths today. Has the virus mutated and the mortality rate increased exponentially?

2020-02-13 23:26:39,"I was a 9th grader back in 1973 and it was the first day of my small animal science class. As I entered the room, I noticed an aquarium sitting on the teachers desk. Inside were 3 adult male mice and 3 pregnant adult females. The teacher called her experiment, ""Mouse Nation"". Today she declared, we would all see and understand the importance of ""population control"". As time progressed, the aquarium became so populated with mice that there was barely room for them to stand. So populated that when we walked into the classroom one morning, all 4 sides of the aquarium glass was covered in blood. ""Whether it's an animal or human nation, this is the result when a population reaches it's peak"". She went on to say population control is something all nations in the world must deal with at a certain point. Whether it's releasing a deadly disease, handing out opioids like they're candy, allowing the use of tobacco & alcohol, filling our foods with sugar, to allowing the sale of a weed killer proven to cause cancer, it's all about population control. She told us it's not that all nations are not evil but rather all nations face a necessary evil.
Seeing ""Mouse Nation"" cannibalize itself and listening to the teachers declarations that all governments must control their populations at some point by killing it's citizens was a lot for this 9th grader to take in. I've always wondered if she was right or just had radical views. Your thoughts?"
2020-02-12 13:39:54,"Why do we still quote China’s numbers like they are facts?  Does anyone reasonably believe the Chinese are accurately reporting deaths and infections. That is absurd. Each reference should point out that the actual numbers are most likely exponentially higher.  Everyone is reporting on  China’s continuous repression of doctors, social media and the news on this virus and then in the same article they unflinchingly and without modification report China’s official numbers.  Why?  Why would anyone assume the infection rate has slowed based on China’s official reporting?"
2020-02-12 15:16:50,"What “pipes?” Are these plumbing pipes or ventilation pipes? If they are plumbing pipes, how does the coronavirus enter the pipes? If they are ventilation pipes, why are most of them closed?"
2020-02-12 16:15:41,So....are you saying that the gas in the pipes are pushing the virus up and into the air? So does that mean if you have the virus and you pass gas then anyone in that room that smells it can get the virus???? My understanding that the pipes are in the bathrooms????
2020-02-12 19:13:13,"The information here is not so much about buildings as about people in close contact who have been in those buildings, just as people might be in close contact anywhere.  It is not surprising that there would be familial clusters of illness among people who live together. Though it is unclear what sort of ""pipe"" is unsealed, it's more likely than not that other surfaces or airborne viruses are responsible for the clusters."
2020-02-12 19:10:02,"The smartest thing done so far with this was by the government of Macau to order 41 casinos closed, regardless of loss of revenue to the government or the owners.  

Would the U.S. health authorities have this kind of guts?  How long before the virus is spreading in Nevada, NJ etc.  where a single person standing at a craps table could infect 100 people in 2-3 hours, while a table operator could infect hundreds in a day turning into thousands in a week.  Would state officials even have that authority?

Another problem:  should a state decide that a casino ""within its borders"" needed to be closed, most casinos in the West are on tribal land, beyond state government authority.  They would theoretically be under the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a cabinet level agency, but does it have authority over individual tribes, which might have their own autonomy on their land? The casinos have no concern over sick visitors, they would simply be replaced by others until people wised up and quit going.

I think the problems here would be as or more severe as in most other countries."

2020-02-12 22:15:13,"This corona virus - absent mutation - will not give rise to a reprise of the end-World War I global flu pandemic. Day-by-day, new infections grow more slowly. Even if China's data are defective, data from other countries show a similar down-trend. 

The key lesson: when a new, transmissible disease emerges, the first thing to do is to shut-down air travel to the affected country or region. 

The model: when a ship is holed below the waterline, sailors run to close water-tight doors, to limit flooding and so to save their ship. Time is of the essence.

Apart from the China-Hong Kong frontier, air travel is the only way for many to leave China. China's other frontiers are in remote, thinly-populated areas, which - in winter - can be crossed only the fit, trained, and well-equipped. China's top-notch rail system connects to few other countries' rail systems. 

So, despite its size and long frontiers, China is - in some ways - like an island. Islands can be quarantined. That should have been done. Weeks ago!!!!"
2020-02-13 00:25:05,Why i wonder arte there no reports of infections in schools or Africa??
2020-02-11 22:07:05,This article inadvertently shows something else that is wrong with the world.  The economy depends on people making things -- automobiles -- that we really should not need or use.  One irony is that Germany itself has one of the best public transport systems in the world and that a substantial group of its citizens support the Green Party.  The challenge is to build prosperous societies that are sustainable instead of pushing us towards extinction.
2020-02-11 22:07:58,"I'm first- that's exciting!  Europe has had sluggish growth for many years now. And yes, this virus could push the economy down even further.  And there are lessons for the US.  For all of those who continue to hold up Europe as an economic model for the US to follow, please note the lack of growth, essentially since the great recession of 2008. Germany has been limping along for a long time and only Macron seems to have the nerve to take on the unions and stodgy bureaucracy.  But even he has gotten bogged down, and it is unclear if most of Europe will ever turn this around again."
2020-02-11 22:35:50,"EU economy has been stagnating for a long time already.  In the past decade average EU growth rate was only half that of US, which was itself anemic.  EU elites and their suporters are far more concerned with achieving ethno-cultural suicide (ME-African mass-settlement) and economic suicide (unilaterally cutting emissions for the greater global good), than they have been with keeping up technologically and otherwise.  It is a basketcase, only masked by ECB rates of -.6% a decade into a global recovery.  Shock of coronavirus may be just another nail in the coffin."
2020-02-11 23:34:50,"It appears that a virus that may have originated in a wet market in China may tip a market consisting of hundreds of millions of people halfway across the world in Europe into a recession, with all the human suffering that innocent-sounding word conceals.

There seems to have been a monumental, systemic failure in risk management in designing the architecture of the global economy over the past 25 years.

And we're only beginning what will be a long and painful process of reckoning with the consequences."
2020-02-11 22:32:35,Another exacerbating factor is that the world is so highly leveraged that I doubt anyone has a handle on it. This could get very ugly very fast.

If an economy has made itself dependent on Chinese imports and China as an export market it is the USA.
The EU is far more self sustained.
This can be proven by a few economic statistics.
I would also argue that the US health care system and the governance under Trump will not be able to face a global pandemic. Europe is much better equipped for such things.
What is the point of such articles?"
2020-02-11 23:55:12,"The coronavirus epidemic has highlighted what Trump refuses to recognize.  

The world economy depends on China.  

Trump doesn't like that.  

So his attitude and policies toward trade, tariffs, and deficits are naive and reckless.  Trump's bullying - ""America is the greatest"" and ""we don't need them"" - will destroy all of us.  

The world economy could crater if we don't oust him in 2020 and return to being part of the world."

2020-02-12 17:16:40,Germany has had a devalued euro which has allowed it to export at the expense of both the US and the rest of Europe.

2020-02-20 20:57:25,"I don't praise China's handling of the virus issue, I don't know enough about it, but I wonder how the U.S. would have dealt with the same thing?  Would we (could we) have acted so forcefully to isolate it and prevent its spread?  Probably not.  Did China's effort exceed any actions the U.S. could have taken?  Definitely.  Do we plan to give the U.S. government any such powers?  Certainly  not--but If China has gone beyond what we think proper would we have preferred that they did not?  Would we have accepted the spread of the virus in the name of 'freedom'?  I am not a supporter of the Chinese government, but do we have to criticize everything they do?"

So maybe Xi has something worse in store for the country.

2020-02-20 21:04:39,"Why do your columnists continue to perpetuate the ridiculous  concern about China running out of people? Bret Stephens mentions this with a link to a previous NYT article about the falling birthrate in China. Economist Dean Baker has often written about this curious phenomenon (that often afflicts the mainstream media like NYTimes and Wapo) in his brilliant blog ""Beat the Press"" where he has written ""the concern about shrinking populations is complete nonsense"" and provides a very clear economic analysis of why a declining birth rate is nothing to be worried about it given other compensating factors such as productivity growth. NYT you can do better than this."

Number 1 priority of each communist system is harsh suppression of any freedom of speech and thought.  Every one knows that, no covid-19 needed.
They are managing it quite efficiently for a long time now, people quiet and obedient, even admirably so.  And rest assured, once that suppression crumbles, it will take the party with it and the entire economic miracle of China, since it will inevitably descend in some sort of chaos."

2020-02-20 21:28:17,"Anyone who has taken Chinese history in Asia or possibly in the US ( if they remember their history classes) knows that China considers  the term ""the sick man of Asia "" is worse than calling an African American the N word, or calling a German its version of N word. As a result,  Asians spent decades trying to produce athletes that can compete on the World stage, and they have. So it is hardly  surprising that China demands WSJ to retract the editor or copy editor choice of title intended to inflame.

Remember how upset you were when WAPO had an Op-Ed implying that you are anti semitic, and your defense was that you are in fact Jewish.  Multiply that insult by 1,000 times and you will understand why the Chinese government is aggrieved with WSJ's column."

I'm sure China would hear about that quite loudly, and it would cost China valuable business at a time when it can't afford to lose any. But that is just my knee-jerk reaction. If China, or Russia, or the Trump administration wants to beat up on journalists, give them nothing to beat up on. I'd love to never again hear about Trump in any news, and I sure won't be watching Fox. Like any tin-pot dictator/bully, without an audience they are dust in the wind."
2020-02-20 21:35:41,"For all its advancements China like the USA still has country folk. They are people that do not want to see any cultural changes, and that makes it easier for autocratic regimes to survive- maybe even thrive.

Americans are often seen as lucky people who had all the money and resources they would ever need, while the Chinese had nothing.

I am grateful that the Times and the WSJ maintain their professional ethics and continue informing and educating the public.  But my concern is not so much with China right now.  Suppression and oppression have been and will continue to be dominant traits of its government's DNA.  My fear is that our waning democracy under this administration is forcing us here in the US to become vulnerable, indeed victims, of manipulation, exploitation, and even destruction of that which can not and must not be hidden or altered.  One of the few democratic entities we have left during these past eternally long three years are our reputable and time-honored news' media.  We need you all.  We depend on you.

Western arrogance aside, it’s possible Western journalism has a good role in China, although neither the one it imagines, nor the one it is used to performing at home.  

Journalists who haven’t looked into their purpose deeply enough might want to take a look and consider what is there to accomplish underneath it all.  I would suggest the merit resides in making a contribution to improving the society.  

I take exception with the notion that a skillfully worded articulation of negative observations sufficiently meets the “contribution standard.”   More often than is comfortable to admit, I suspect,  it doesn’t."
2020-02-21 01:43:56,"China shouldn’t have expelled those journalists, but this comes a day after the US government is requiring Chinese news sources to declare themselves as foreign agents.

That is an astoundingly callous, vituperative, and cynical remark to make in the midst of an epidemic of the COVD-19 threatening China and the world. Words like these automatically harken back to the “white man’s burden” justifying imperial and colonial domination. 
The WSJ journalist also has the concept backward. The juggxrnaught is the virus, not the Chinese nation. The Chinese nation has not been humbled at all, they have mobilized incredible resources to cure the sick and prevent the spread of the disease. Yet every single NYT article on the subject cannot help but take shots like calling mass quarantine measures “draconian,” as if there were others choices available to deal with the spread of the disease.
I’m sorry, Mr Stephens, but China has not been humbled at all. Many of its citizens have died, including medical doctors and nurses, but the numbers show that new cases are on the decline. If the WSJ want to get back to China, they only have to apologize for their incredible fumbling."
2020-02-21 01:33:52,"I suspect that it is the title, with its reminders of China's historical humiliations, not the article itself, that prompted this expulsion.

2020-02-21 00:39:58,"Nonsense. WSJ was given over a week to retract and clarify the racist headline, yet it refused to do so, even attempting to justify its racism towards China by claiming that an analogous term was used against the Ottoman Turks. Of course, the WSJ and the NYTimes have the freedom to publish whatever they want, but they cannot do so without expecting consequences. The Chinese government has the absolute right to deny entry/expel any non-Chinese citizens, for whatever reason it sees fit. And in this particular instance, the expulsions are well deserved."

Everything else since Mao took over in 1949 has remained dark, bellicose and yes, backward. It cannot take criticism of any kind. A democracy it is not. It can resort to brute force to confront anyone at any time, citizen and foreigner alike. Four innocent Canadians have been held against their will in China for the past two years because Canada had the temerity to exercise an American warrant (for which a treaty exists) and arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. It is a blatant attempt by China to leverage Wanzhou's release by the only means it knows: intimidation. China can never be trusted - it's skin is too thin."

Well said. But how I wish that Bret Stephens would take his own advice and review the entire subject of climate change / global warming from a viewpoint unbiased by Lomborg and Pielke Jr., who have agendas and ignore vast swathes of evidence and understanding. ""let's all get rich and fix it later"" - ""global poverty is down"" (really? $3/day and no clean water) - some genius will come up with something - we can move to Mars - the arguments don't bend to reality.

Our public sphere is also engaged in hiding from the truth. But in fact, ""Truth driven underground doesn’t vanish. It stalks.""

Trump's economy may look healthy, but real societal assets - the people's wealth, decent working conditions, proper benefits - are being removed at speed by the greedy optimists at the top.

This cannot stand!"
2020-02-20 21:58:29,"Bret, you may want to brush up on your history. 

I'm a Chinese American and no fan whatsoever of the Communist Party in China.  Actually, I hate the party.

But the phrase ""sick man of Asia"" is a racist phrase.  Just see Wikipedia's entry of it:

""According to Duke University Professor Nicole Barnes in one of her books, the frequent use of the phrase ""Sick man of East Asia"" in media in the 19th century, when racism was common ... quickly turned it into a 'universal epithet for all Chinese.""

A lot of Chinese people (not the Communist Party) are offended by the term.

It's not up to you, as a white American, to declare that the phrase, and WSJ's use of it, isn't a racist one."
2020-02-20 23:08:28,"I don’t normally comment on this but I’ll do it today. 

This is a very ignorant article. I have heard and read stories of how people in the West stigmatized Chinese immigrants in the 19th Century by referring to their bodies as “disease ridden” and “not like that of white people.”  Like racism towards black people, Chinese persons went through a very hard time then. Sick man of Asia was then used to refer to the Chinese in a very racists way to mean Chinese bodies are full of diseases. 

This of course can be blamed on “white supremacists” or the “KKK.” 

When a journalist publishes an article “sick man of Asia” referring to China at a time when the world is fighting to control a virus epidemic, I cannot think of a more racist way a top flight newspaper like the Wall Street Journal to can be used to draw racist stereotypes and please their racist audiences, signifying just how much racism is deep rooted in Western nation’s culture. 

You’d expect some other media houses to disown The Journal article and call it out but to the surprise. They are all quiet “telling China how bad it it to deport journalists.” There we go on with the culture of blaming the victims."
2020-02-21 00:52:25,"Since in the late 19th century, the ""sick man of Asia"" statement is a symbol of China's past humiliations at the hands of the British, French and subsequently the Japanese powers. The Wall Street Journal choice of this title at a time when China is facing a viral epidemic virus is clearly offensive, crass and bluntly speaking, stupid.

In the unlikely scenario a similarly offensive and racist title about Israel appeared in a major newspaper, the author of this Op-Ed would've roundly condemned it in no uncertain terms. 

For instance:

In April 2019, a cartoon included in the New York Times' international edition showed Binyamin Netanyahu as a dog guiding a skullcap-wearing Donald Trump. The New York Times retracted it, saying it was offensive, and an error of judgment."
2020-02-20 23:24:13,"Yes Mr Mead’s column was not racist but the title of his article was. For someone with his experience he should have known how China treats its history of humiliation at Western hands. That title was meant to be insulting in the late 19th century and it was insulting today. And furthermore given the racially laden hundred years of history that have passed between then and now, it was also racist."
2020-02-21 00:59:30,Spot on. China remains a repressive communist state.
2020-02-21 00:19:58,"Do you think for one nanosecond that Trump would NOT expel Journalists, if he gets a whim and no one dares to stop Him ?
  Before you, or We, get so high and mighty, look at our own Authoritarian Regime.
   Do the Chinese keep Children in Cages, for yet to be determined “ Quarantine Periods “?  THAT is a real Crime against Humanity, not a temporary inconvenience to a Journalist.
    Seriously."
2020-02-21 02:55:30,"This is an unfortunate development.  It remains my hope that we (I'm US citizen) can develop with China a shared sense of respect for our differences and an overriding bond of amity.  We will banter over trade and stand firm against spying but share a common purpose for peace and stability.  I believe the US has in many ways grown in it's understanding of Chinese history.  We are patient in our approach in not demanding immediate adoption of first world standards in business, law or even human rights while opening our society to China.  Actions such as harassing our media organizations reflects China's lack of respect for our much shorter but complex history and culture.  I know well that my country will not retaliate in kind by say sending home the daughters or sons of senior Chinese government leaders to sit out a semester at Stanford or Harvard.  We must strive to build an understanding as to why expelling responsible reporters is such an insult to the US.  China should be reminded that institutions such as the WSJ and the NYT have long demonstrated deep concern and respect for China in the medern era."
2020-02-21 03:05:32,"What right do Americans have to criticize any country in the world. 

The GOP aspires to have the same power that the CCP has in China. The 60 million GOP outer party members worship Trump like he’s a deity or a monarch. 

The USA has self censorship. 60 million pollute their minds willingly by segregating their minds to Fox News, talk radio and social media conspiracies. 

At least the CCP has to spend billions on an internet wall and censoring media to keep their people from the truth. 60 million American GOP Outer Party members do it willingly."

Time will tell who manages to suppress the press more effectively (and please be clear that I am not arguing that suppressing press is a good thing). but there is no question which country is doing a better job of investing in the future.  Meanwhile, Donald Trump claims that we are stronger, better, and richer than ever before, which 40% + of our voters apparently believe is true because we have lost the power of honest and well-informed press in this

2020-02-21 03:31:12,"The Murdoch-owned WSJ is no longer the respected place publishing the capitalist view. It is now a Murdoch place.

A Murdoch place published some truly defamatory extremist attacks on China: the coronavirus crisis is the fault of the Chinese state and form of government.

What are the Chinese going to do when attacked that way? 

Perhaps we need to examine whether the scurrilous behavior of the Murdoch press ought to have gotten some real reaction in the West, long before this.

The core of the ""fire in a crowded theater"" exception to free speech and a free press is when false statements are used to spread fear, so that lies told could kill people. 

Fears of a pandemic could kill people. Panic reactions defeat treatment of a spreading disease, as for another example it did in Africa with Ebola. 

Responsible reporting and truth is important. 

If China has not told as much as it should, as soon as it should, that does not excuse scurrilous extreme reporting in the WSJ designed to cause panic and panicked reactions.

Attack China? Okay, but only carefully in ways that won't get people hurt. It is an important subject, and deserves the care.

Along the way, don't defend Murdoch. We know what he is, and the Chinese are right about that much."
2020-02-20 21:51:33,"Some commenters are making an equivalency between China's CCP and the Trump regime and it is not even close. Imagine the Republican Party having absolute and unquestioning control over the Presidency; U.S. Congress; Supreme, Federal and State Courts; every State Governor and Legislature; every major newspaper, TV and radio station, and the CEO of every major corporation and you will have a good start. China harasses journalists only one time and if they do it again they are disappeared till they understand the error of their ways."
2020-02-20 22:21:12,"Just so.  And one might recall that the absence of an independent press contributed to the terrible Chinese famines of the late fifties.  Central authorities overestimated food supplies because local officials lied about meeting harvest quotas, and spreading unflattering news about the suffering of the people was discouraged."
2020-02-20 22:10:35,"China is not complaining about the content of the WSJ opinion, which was written by an academic, rather its title, which was chosen by its editors. China demanded an apology for the offensive title, but the WSJ refused. China retaliated by expelling the journalists, as it has no way to directly punish the editors. Ironically, it was reported that WSJ's journalists also complained about the offensive headline, but were overruled by the editors, and it was the journalists who paid the price."
2020-02-20 23:17:35,"WSJ's title was in extremely poor taste, and it is now a distraction from the important subject matter of the actual article. The coronavirus epidemic shows how Chinese government's iron grip on the country is actually much more precarious than it looks at first glance. But nobody is even interested in that now. Instead everybody is arguing about the propriety of using ""sick man of Asia."""
2020-02-21 04:06:25,"Yes, Beijing should respect freedom of speech.

But remember, folks, freedom of speech is in our constitution, not that of China.

China looks back to millennia of glory, but the form of government was always autocracy.  They had a notion of good and bad rulers, as explained in the teachings of Confucius.  Some of their good autocrats achieved a high level of culture.  Under Emperor Taizong of Tang XI'an (598-649), Xi'an was the most cultured city in the world while Europe was entering its dark ages.

Instead of seeing the mote in the eye of China we should focus on the plank in our own eyes.

A few weeks ago the NY Times mentioned that Amazon had stopped carrying books by David Duke because his work was that of a ""white supremacist.""

I thought back.  I myself had ordered a book by David Duke a couple of years ago.  I was curious.  I wanted to know what Duke actually believed, not what the media said he believed.

I read a few pages.  My curiosity sated, I realized that further reading was a waste of time.

But the point is, I made the choice MYSELF to put the book down.  It was not because of being forced to by the thought police.

And that is the essence of the experiment that the US embarked upon in 1791.  In our system, as opposed to the Chinese one, we had certain rules designed to keep us free.

You see, democracy makes no sense if you cannot trust individual citizens to read whatever they want and choose for themselves.

It's not Duke we should fear but Trump."
2020-02-21 04:29:52,"While the criticism of the Chinese system and the government’s overreaction in expelling WSJ’s journalists is valid, the suggestion that only Westerners can objectively understand China and save China from its own ignorance is ludicrous. Also, journalism is a specialized trade, no more no less, and journalists tend not to be experts on anything. In the case of Western journalists dispatched to China, very few of them speak or understand the Chinese language and in turn heavily dependent on local informants to procure materials to feed the preexisting biases."
2020-02-21 05:25:42,"I live in China, and I've been in a fairly strict lock down the last few weeks. Everyone I know was quite okay with it, viewing it as a necessary precaution. I'm currently teaching my university classes remotely; I don't know when school will resume.

Overall, the response here I think was better than it might have been. Was it perfect? Nothing is. But it just seemed a convenient excuse for a lot of ""China watchers"" (none of whom probably speak the language), to weigh on the Chinese system. I don't think an outbreak of a disease that is not really well known is a fair time to do that, nor is it really constructive.

And yes, the title of the article, if you know anything about Chinese history, is completely bigoted."
2020-02-21 07:59:57,"The Communist party inside China is ever-evolving but always maladaptive. Whilst it no longer shoots people in the streets or drags them into the town square for humiliation, don't be fooled. It persecutes, tortures and imprisons high profile tormenters to frighten dissenters and the nascent middle classes who have more education than the previous generations.  

China would probably prefer to hack all email, and monitor all intra/international conversations, but it realizes there are limits on controls.  

Booting out Wall Street Journal writers is also likely a warning to Rupert Murdoch that he needs to be careful as well as a jab at the Trump Administration that earlier this week claimed several Chinese ""news"" organizations be labelled (rightly) as instruments of ""propaganda.""  How much should we read into it?  Probably not much, but one thing we do know about China is that you cannot trust much of what they say nor their motives for doing what they do.  The Mandate of Heaven is alive and well."

Re China.  Best to devote your energies to the corona virus, not Western journalists who, unlike the virus, pose no threat to the Chinese people nor its regime. 

I have wondered whether Xi Jinping would have the staying power to become a rational version of Mao, a communist emperor.  The great test for Xi's cult of personality is likely to be the corona virus.  If, as we all hope, it burns itself out in fairly short order, his grip on the country will be unshaken.  

But if the virus becomes a great pandemic, it will undermine political order, not just in China but everywhere."
2020-02-21 11:50:44,"A funny thing happened on the way to the Arrogance Column...

H1N1 erupted in Mexico in 2009 and spread all over the world. The Chinese were able to contain it better than most countries, presumably because they had recent experience with pandemics and an authoritarian system that allowed more effective measures than those taken in other places. About 800 people died from H1N1 in China; nearly four times more died in the US, with a third of China's population.

China's rigid authoritarian system might have saved tens of thousands of lives.

China has an ugly political system but it was not the Party, or Xi, that arrested those doctors and tried to hide the pandemic. It was the culture, the system, and some local bullies in police uniforms who did it. It would be reassuring to see them prosecuted and see the leadership condemn that kind of reaction. It would be reassuring to see them open up.

We have an ugly system too. God forbid a pandemic like this should break out in a US city of 10 million people. I am not so sure things would go so much more smoothly, although a certain someone would reassure us that he has ""the best doctors"" on the case. In a word, I am no fan of Xi and I think the Chinese can do better than their ugly system. That's for them to do.

This is a tragedy, and it's appropriate to blame China's political system (judging from Weibo, the Chinese certainly seem to). But it's not a time for arrogance. We may be eating humble pie when the next pandemic strikes."

2020-02-21 12:37:26,"Bret,
There are two separate issues conflated here.  1) Insofar as China believes in a ""greatest good for the greatest number"" strictly utilitarian social ethic, that ethic is incompatible with an individual rights ethic, so, even though individual rights are important, it does no good to point out to them they are suppressing such rights.  They know that and believe that is right.  It is like excoriating Trump supporters for his and their not being liberal or not tolerating whistleblowing or enforcement of the Constitutional limitations of his Presidency.

2) Your main argument is that the Chinese people and government would actually be collectively better off if they permitted a free press, which is a different argument from one arguing for freedom of the press as a right.  The utilitarian benefit of a free press has more of a chance of appealing to them, but not if considered absolute without exception and without allowing some criteria to guard against harm from abuse (like libel or like revealing sensitive classified information).

In short, I think you would be more effective trying to get them to see the benefit of a free press that respects utilitarianism instead of championing a free press as an absolute right in the way that Fox News and Mark Zuckerberg seem to and instead of chastising Chinese officials for not accepting or tolerating that view."

Of course, we have already retaliated with the re-classification and registration of Chinese news media in US, requiring them to report everything including personnel, US contacts, and activities in details.

Of course, our White House often punishes reporters who ask tough and embarrassing questions in the briefing by not renewing their White House correspondent badges.

China's rapid economic growth seemed to prove that authoritarian Capitalism could work.  People even began to believe that authoritarian Capitalism was a more effective vehicle for rapid growth.  In fact, it never really worked.  The first sign of failure was the inevitable rampant corruption that flourished because authoritarianism does not allow the societally based controls that are inherent in democracy.  No one gets voted out of office because they are corrupt. The natural reaction to corruption in authoritarian society is more authoritarian control of commerce.  Fighting corruption then because a political tool of those in power which will eventually strangle the economy.  So, in the end, it is true that authoritarian Capitalism has too many internal contradictions to function.  Unfortunately the consequence has been more authoritarianism rather that the emergence of democracy that people had hoped for."

But neither Stephens nor the author of the Atlantic piece explain why disinformation tactics are so widely used and are considered to be effective. The answer should be obvious. Too many voters lack even a basic capacity for information gathering and critical thinking. The long-term solution is a robust education system, like those in the Nordic countries, that emphasizes critical thinking skills.

Furthermore, it has used McCarthy tactics to suppress certain views. And it also uses surveillance which has a chilling effect on speech.

This is the same as in US when you use certain words to refer to African Americans, you would be called a racist, but people from other countries with no knowledge of American racial history would understand why. “Real sick man of Asia” is what colonial western powers called Chinese back in the 1900’s after Britain exported opium to China and caused a national opioid crisis (sounds familiar?) and then 8 western colonial powers invaded China.

It takes a narrow approach of separating writer’s responsibilities at the NYT. The reality is that there is no separation when it comes to picking topics regarding current administration or berating Trump 24/7. The news and the opinion is exactly on the same page.

By-country numbers make no sense at all – unless multiple vectors, and the one leading to the most severe cases is the most localized, quickly leading to speculation like…

> The most severe cases may be spread by animal bites or droppings. If the virus made its way into the blood via laceration or ingestion – and then found its way to the lungs, where it then becomes a severe form of viral pneumonia, without having given our immune system a heads-up by pausing in sinuses or throat

> Less severe cases spread a la other flus – for these, the numbers are underwhelming

> #2 sovereign entity for cases not a country, but a cruise ship.  Here, even single rat bites would be quickly noticed, vs droppings making it into food

> Creative context probably not military, but drug-discovery.  The number of permutations across both lab rat and virus variants and mutations is perversely large.  What makes this even plausible – doctors involved close to ground-zero keep dying.  And, is anyone profiteering by selling lab rats to food courts – either as food or feedstock?

> With this, the intersection of this with our current paranoia of all things Chinese – sort of a weaponized viral version of Murphy’s law

2020-02-21 03:59:13,"Discussing whether the majority of the article or even the intent being racist or not is beside the point. The headline use of a well-known demeaning and racist phrase is horrible enough. There is no debate about its racist nature. And that is the responsibility of the editorial desk, which represents the WSJ. No point citing it was an op-Ed as if the paper doesn’t exercise any editorial authority. 

Now the journalists. That’s what we call collateral damage. Plus they signed up for the JOB. There is nothing personal. They do however need to re-evaluate their employer’s worthiness to their time and professional commitment. 

Poor judgement on WSJ to publish something like that, let alone at this crucial time when the world need information on what could be one a pandemic. Mr. Mead, I do not know. But I expected more professional acumen, better taste and more decency from WSJ."

There was a lot more wrong with Walter Russel Mead’s WSJ OpEd of 4 February 2020 than just the title: The piece was clearly intended to attack the Chinese government by inciting panic and anger during a public health emergency. It was the equivalent of yelling “Fire” in a crowded public venue. While the WSJ is blocked in China—evidently for good reason—we all know that VPNs are widely used to circumvent the “great firewall.”

During an epidemic, it is absolutely essential that the public remain calm and cooperate with the government in controlling the contagion. If people lose confidence in the government, fear reigns, panic ensues, cooperation ceases, control efforts fail, disease spreads and more people die. 

The initial response to the epidemic might have been suboptimal—that is unfortunately most often the case in most epidemics—but when the problem became clear, the Chinese government’s response was organized, vigorous, resolute, effective and competent. The last thing that China and its people need at this critical time is a malignant, invidious screed like Mr. Mead’s to stir up hate and discontent. Fortunately so far, the Chinese people are cooperating.

Mr. Mead and the WSJ editorial board tried to advance their own political agenda at the expense of the Chinese people. Both rightly deserve the indignation and opprobrium that they received from the Chinese government. You deserve it too for defending their indefensible malevolence."

Beijing sits atop a huge country comprised of 60 different ethnic groups, speaking some 300 languages.

On the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus, as will as the previous pandemics of SARS, etc., all of which originated in China, China’s unregulated livestock industry is a cesspool of dangerous viruses and bacteria. There are many reports of the outbreak of dangerous virus among animals, most recently pigs, in China which forces the culling of large herds of animals. This is why the West has a prohibition for the import of any animals, fowl, etc. from China. The science of the transfer of virus from animals to humans has been proved. There will be more pandemics originating from China as long as China’s livestock industry is unregulated.

I was listening to a epidemiologist on Canada’s CBC radio (a sister organization to the PBS) last week and he indicated that if the coronavirus reaches Africa or large developing countries in south Asia (India, Pakistan, etc.) or in the west Pacific (Indonesia, Philippines) then it can emerge and spread to be a global disaster … he added that this is because these countries do not have the infrastructure to deal with or control coronavirus.

There is the risk that if this scenario happens, then the coronavirus may have the impact of the 1918 influenza that killed more people than who died during WWI."

Americans believe that free speech should triumph, but not all speech is worth publishing or airing.

That said, I don't believe this is a case of willful racism. I worked for Professor Mead as an intern; he does not choose his headlines, his editors do. The content of the article makes no reference to the term. Even in the case of Prof. Mead's editors at WSJ, I believe they were probably unaware.

I think the Chinese government has a legitimate grievance. Their track record with free press and human rights more generally leave China open to criticism. However, I can see how a government attempting to tackle a major epidemic would find Mead's comments unhelpful at best. Expelling journalists was the most expedient way to convey their displeasure.

Also consider, China is a highly bureaucratic and administrative nation. This was true long before Mao. Occam's razor: The mishandling of CONVID-19 was mostly due to misinterpreting facts on the ground rather than an actual failure to reply. What would you say if New York ports suddenly had a suspiciously large flu outbreak?

Both the Chinese government and the Chinese Americans in the U.S. had requested the WSJ to apologize for the erroneous use of the offensive headline ""Sick Man of Asia."" The WSJ merely responded by explaining that the editor did not know it means a stigma in the context of Chinese culture and history. Maybe the editor didn't know.

2020-02-20 21:00:17,"The collective wisdom still considers major events from a territorial perspective. COVID-9 is shaking deeply-held beliefs in China and its vicinity; but is merely an incident with insufficient impact to trigger a debate let alone a prompt action, as the dozen comments posted in NYTtimes since five hours attest. The level of American dissatisfaction with the status quo is growing, but wouldn't hit the inflection point as COVID-9 remains largely off-shore and local stocks mitigate supply-chain disruption.

Investors, mesmerized by recent market gains fuel the demand and drive up prices and pro-investment hashtags, adding to a speculation and possibly a bubble. Collective wisdom is at odds with reality. Except for a tiny minority and nervous buyers who opt out before the storm, investors are oblivious to calls for restraint.  Even AI algorithm do not possess the complexity-reduction power to act with foresight.

The speculative adventure may culminate in a painful crash frequently triggered by a tidal wave of surprise events. An overriding issue tag crops up à la #metoo. Established perceptions and beliefs are questioned within the sector or society at large. The quasi-stationary equilibrium turns fragile. Issue champions emerge to block or steer the fence-sitters’ migration.  Only then, the stakeholders’ dynamics tips the issue potency towards a critical mass, i.e. the minimum number of powerful players necessary to break resistance to change, a milestone in issue incubation."
2020-02-20 23:28:22,"I find it interesting how we keep hearing how great the US economy. I love it funny all those Deep State people don't believe anything is going on. Well are some simple facts for them and the business/economics page. If the employment numbers go up next month here is a clue the books are cooked. Manufacturing has fallen through floor, Boeing has sold a total of 4 planes in three months. GE is at zero money made since with tariffs and the problem with the Boeing Max they are going to Airbus. By the way Airbus that also owns Bombardiers aircraft can't keep up with orders. Lets see Americans are in debt to the tune of $14 trillion and climbing, credit card debt is $930 billion, the job report from March 2018 to 2019 was amended to show that 514,000 less jobs were created a loss on average of 40,000 a month, cars being repossessed at record numbers, credit card non payment min. at record numbers, farm debt is at $425 billion and looking for another dare I say the word socialist bailout, farm prices down, oil down and natural gas wells being capped because the price is so low. Stock market has been failing. But back to the rigged job numbers wages increases are not existent, and what type of jobs are created most are low wage, so two jobs equals one. Subcontractors to Boeing have been laying off thousands of workers, and manufacturing also, mines have closed at record numbers and Caterpillar sales were crashing are now gone with the virus. No economy is great. Jim Trautman"

Furthermore, his repeal of anything with Obama's name on it is insane and so detrimental to the domestic economy.

This is a bubble, because there will be no insulating the market from reality using the force of our military.

Now we are looking at more due to the virus. Pay increases have been frozen. Travel to asia is being zeroed out for now. So this talk of a disconnect between reality and the market is a very real thing. But again there is the question of what else folks can do with their money. I have my own zany theories. A) We are simply witnessing the growing retirement savings of the millennials, who absolutely know they must save at all costs. And the market is their only option. I'm no expert, but it seems like this happened in the 80's too when the boomers started getting real jobs. If this is a millennial effect, it might keep going for longer... until they lose their jobs. B) I can't help but think that if Russia is manipulating elections, etc... what is to stop trump's cronies and Putin (who by some estimates is actually the wealthiest man in the world, all in offshore accts) from keeping the market cranking thru the election? Think of the money they can make. It's not even a bad bet for them. They pump up the market. Trump wins, which enthuses all the chumps to invest heavily. And then the cronies rotate their money back out of the market."
2020-02-22 00:17:58,"The stock market really should worry about coronavirus.

My wife and I have canceled a Baltic cruise for this June because: 

1. Most cruise lines reserve the right to alter or curtail the schedule and itinerary without refunds; and cancel-for-any reason insurance will be about half the cost of the cruise. 

2. We are both over 70 and thus at higher risk of becoming seriously ill or even dying from COVID-19 if we catch it. 

3. In the best of times cruise ships are floating Petri dishes that easily spread noroviruses; note the current COVID-19 transmissions on the Diamond Princess and Holland America Westerdam. 

4. While our cruise ports are in countries that now have fewer than 25 cases, the coronavirus could become a pandemic affecting thousands in many countries, including those on our itinerary. Our nightmare scenario is that we or other passengers contract the disease aboard or in port. Do we want to be treated or quarantined on the ship or in Latvia or Estonia or Russia or Finland or Denmark? No way. 

For us the medical/financial risks are just too great, so for 2020 we are planning to limit our travel to US destinations we can reach easily by car or short flights. 

Over time we will evaluate the coronavirus situation and see how cruise lines and foreign countries are coping. There’s always next year.

Finish the job of destroying the US Government's ability to respond quickly and intelligently to future challenges. 

Why do a few very wealthy people wish to inflict huge damage on the US economy? Possible answer: they are focused on a fossil fuel based economy and income streams, and wish to postpone a reckoning as long as possible.

The Coronavirus has significantly more potential for economic harm than currently quantified because we know China will not be forthcoming now..or in the future.  What we also know is the FED is gunning the equities markets with significant short term liquidity; nearly zero interest for short term money which is then fed into machine learning algos that buy, buy, buy.  The current low-participation rally is ripe for a 10% sell-off but cheap money will drive more buying, trapping short interests until they give up...and drive the market higher.

Over 600 have been infected. That means either the virus spread like wildfire before the passengers were separated, or continued to spread after they were separated. 

Neither explanation gives much comfort. 

Also, looking at the figures for china as a whole, there's a big disparity between the death rate in Hubei province (around 2%) and the rest of China (around 0.4%)

Hopefully this is indicative of incomplete stats from Hubei province's stressed administration, rather than a more worrying interpretation that case outcome is heavily dependent on availability of high intervention healthcare. 

Taking reasonable middle of the road estimates from a number of studies from reputable sources, a infection rate of 20% and case fatality rate of 2% should be planned for by our countries.  That equates to 1.3m fatalities in the US, 265k fatalities in the UK. 

That's not a declaration of doom, just sensible view of the risk we should be preparing for. 

We need to keep a close eye on the amazing efforts in China, with the largest quarantine effort in the history of humanity. 150 million people in home isolation. 

Here in the UK the BBC is not even including the 150 million person quarantine in it's headline reporting. It feels like worst sort of state control in our news."

And let's not forget the terrible impact cruise ships are having at the places where they stop. Small coastal towns receiving thousands of tourists at once -- and that's just from one boat. The tourists walk around, take instagram-worthy photos and buy a few trinkets -- then they eat and drink and sleep and engage in entertainment on the boat, not the country they are touristing in. 

In other words, a lot of impact on the host country with almost no economic benefit. An article in the NYT last year found that in one Greek city that was positively overrun by cruise ships, the average tourist spent $5 on trinkets.

And the carbon expenditures of cruise ships are huge -- especially when you factor in that people generally FLY to get the port that the ship is leaving out of.

For so very many reasons, please ... skip the cruise ships!"

The ship could have then been taken where ever they take ships to be scrubbed.  As it was passengers were forced into tight quarters, breathing recycled air, while a virus spread through their numbers.  They were living in a petri dish.  A four year old child would have known better.

In an ideal world the cruise ship industry would crumble.  I certainly would not shed a tear for it.  Huge, embarrassingly tacky vessels spewing unknown tons of waste, human and otherwise, into the ocean.  They represent everything that is excessive, wasteful and ignorant.

Just use common sense, you’re in a large, floating Petri dish full of other humans’ entire bio germs, and it’s going merrily along the water, sending out bucket fulls from your cabin’s toilet. 

Cruise ships are flotillas full of whatever the latest bug is...so are airplanes, except in planes you don’t shower, or swim in the same pool, and it’s for a shorter period of time.

PR is intended to control the narrative and minimize the financial impact to the company, and self-assertion of their concern for the public, or their competent management of crisis are likely dubious."
2020-02-19 16:09:50,"The US government has an obligation to support American citizens, and as best I can tell is doing its best to meet that obligation, in exceedingly difficult circumstances with no clear signposts.

The government's obligation does NOT extend to financially supporting Carnival.  From what I have read, Carnival registers its ships at foreign ports, and avoids paying much in US taxes.  The company is, of course, not the only firm to do its best to avoid paying its fair share of taxes.

I am reminded of the incident in 2013 when the Carnival Triumph experienced an electrical failure.  Lacking a backup system, the ship became stranded without power, many of its systems such as air-conditioning and plumbing, non-operational.  The US Navy and Coast Guard came to its rescue.  When our government asked the wealthy company for reimbursement, the company sent a notorious, well known, response: ""Carnival’s policy is to honor maritime tradition that holds that the duty to render assistance at sea to those in need is a universal obligation of the entire maritime community.""

Adverse publicity resulted in the company ultimately  making a payment to our government, but you get the idea.  My own feeling is that the company needs to bare the economic consequences of the corona virus outbreak on its ships, without financial support from taxpayers."
2020-02-19 16:11:49,"I'm not clear why anyone would book a vacation on the Carnaval lines or any other cruise ship at this point in time. While the Coronavirus is serious it's just one of many maladies that these cruise ships have had over the past number of years. First it was the Legionnaires disease, then troubles with toilets and foul smells and food poisoning just to name a few. I prefer to spend my money on a nice island with hotel accommodations rather then sleeping on a ship. I had enough of that when I was in the Navy."
2020-02-19 16:24:50,"So, help me understand how the shipboard Corona Virus spread is Carnival Corporations fault?  Who ordered the quarantine?  Did the Japanese government say it would allow passengers from the ship the freedom to come and go as they pleased? Did the harbor master grant permission for passengers to disembark? For the passengers, did the public health officials of their prospective countries advocate for them and seek a solution in a timely fashion?  For Americans, did our government proactively seek and offer alternate solutions to shipboard quarantine?  Perhaps move passengers to a military installation with adequate medical facilities and staff?

I have no vested interest in Carnival Corporation but it seems to me many of the comments here lack thought and are generated by the collective monkey mind that's become predominant in American discourse."
2020-02-19 16:39:35,"We have sailed on Holland America at least 20 times, Princess 5 or 6 times and 3 times on Carnival. Never had a health problem that I didn't cause myself and was never forced to stay in my cabin or stayed in the infirmary. Medical care was excellent when I needed it but expensive. My insurance covered it since Medicare won't. We always take the best travel policy available.  Now if this happened on a Royal Caribbean monster ship with 5000 passengers plus crew it really would be a nightmare. The Carnival ships are half the size and more passenger friendly. We have sailed on the Diamond and Westerdam and loved both ships. Don't blame Carnival when the problem started in China."
2020-02-19 15:40:12,Why anyone would take a cruise is beyond me. Especially on these cattle barges. The risks are in the headlines at least once a year.

2020-02-19 16:19:50,"Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe U. hospital, Japan, said that he tried to get onto Diamond Princess to offer his services, but they kicked him off the ship. The infection control practices were so bad -- actually, nonexistent -- that he is afraid he might have picked up the virus in his brief visit, so he self-quarantined himself for 14 days to prevent spreading it to his family and students. He left a video on Youtube. This is his summary: 

""Diamond Princess has completely inadequate infection control, and there is no professional ID person in charge. Passengeres, crews, health care professionals working inside are at risk of infection, and the practice is even worse than what I saw in Africa. Immediate action is needed to save people inside.""

2020-02-19 16:28:29,"This entire debacle was handled by choosing hysteria over medical fact. The reason so many people are dying of this in China is their idiotic quarantines. By quarantining all the crew and passengers on this cruise ship the Japanese gov't absolutely guaranteed everyone would get sick. Altho I love cruising I'll never, ever, get aboard one of those huge ships. There's a reason that Carnival (and subsidiaries) are always the ones with huge disease outbreaks and fines for polluting."
2020-02-19 15:49:59,"Oh, boo hoo. I'm sorry for the people who think floating around on a multi-story apartment building laying on its side is somehow so invigorating that they'll spend megabucks for the pleasure."

2020-02-19 16:53:42,"These large cruise ships are massive incubators of bacteria and viruses, there have been multiple outbreaks of serious diseases on them for years now.  Yet people still pay serious money to float around on these giant petri dishes.  The ships are also bad in other ways, including as polluters.  And they despoil every place they go to: you can use the maps in the cruise ship ads as a guide to global destinations that are now blighted with ugly hotels and have oil slicks in their once pristine waters.  And then there's the special case of Venice, where immense cruse ships come in close to shore for photo ops of the church of San Marco. The waves the boats create surge up into the city, greatly accelerating its complete and utter destruction. The Venetian government lacks the foresight and decency to stop this horror: a dollar today outweighs a hundred 20 years from now."
2020-02-19 16:57:42,"These behemoths are the perfect delivery systems for any virus.

2020-02-19 15:52:06,I’ve yet to read mention of the crew on these ships. How many are ill or quarantined or treated or rescued? How many have died? What is happening to them? These ship have hundreds of staff.
2020-02-19 16:16:26,"Sorry, my idea of a vacation isn’t a week on a floating mall with 6 to 8 thousand other inmates, with Purell sanitizer stations every 10 paces. 

Cruise corporations skirt labor, environment and tax regulatory oversight by flying flags of convenience. Who in good conscience can relax onboard knowing they are served by hollow-eyed crew being paid shockingly low wages? Not me."
2020-02-19 16:31:17,"I guess I shouldn't be surprised by all the negative comments here but I'm guessing many haven't even been on a cruise. The Coronavirus situation is a very serious and frightening one, and obviously cruising isn't for everyone. But it's not the disaster portrayed here. Personally I have found it uniquely enjoyable and stress-free (especially vs air travel) and being surrounded by an ocean for days at a time is magical. The stereotype of lazy, gluttonous, ugly Americans doesn't hold true for all cruises. There are all kinds of itineraries for those want an athletic, eco-friendly or adventurous experience. Any illness outbreak or accident is a concern, but you can say the same about other forms of travel. (In my mind air travel is almost unbearable these days unless you're a premium FF member.) Carnival isn't my favorite, and I admit I cut back my trips due to environmental concerns, but, again, you can make a similar argument about unnecessary air travel. Cruises on smaller ships are also a good way to see parts of the world that aren't accessible otherwise, like Alaska and the fjords of Norway. Seriously, many of the comments here seem very ignorant to me."
2020-02-19 16:17:39,"Say what you will, but Carnival/Holland America is NOT doing an adequate job keeping passengers on upcoming trips informed.  We are booked out of Yokohama on the Westerdam on April 11, and don't know if the ship will sail then, or to what ports, or if we even want to be on board.  Our airfare to Tokyo is non-refundible, and whatever our insurance may provide, our voluntarily-cancelling the trip is not covered.  In all this, I know we are far from being alone.  Future articles on this story need more depth, please."
2020-02-19 15:58:38,"My wife and I have travelled on many Holland America ships and over the years have found that infections are easily transmitted no matter how rigorous the efforts to contain them. We joked about the inevitability of catching the ""ship's cold"" after seeing it spread amongst our fellow passengers. Last year we were presented with a bill of almost $2000 after the diagnosis and treatment of my wife's 'flu on board.
To add insult to injury, norovirus treatment from on-board medical staff is now an expensive proposition whereas it was once treated free of charge. 
Now that the world has seen how easily infection can spread on a ship, even in the face of heroic precautions, I wonder if cruise lines will be accepting more of the responsibility for such outbreaks and stop treating contagious disease as a revenue opportunity."

An outfit that has dumped oil contaminated waste into the oceans, that violated its own probation, that operated the Costa Concordia with an incompetent captain and crew and whose boats are regularly infected by norovirus epidemics."
2020-02-19 21:24:04,"Cruise ships could do more to prevernt the spread of virses.
For example, the air conditioning systems may spread the viruses from one room to another. If so, adding UVC lamps or even bright visible light to the ducts could kill the viruses. Also, adding air filters to remove aerosols could help. Influenza viruses do not live as long outside the body when it is hot and sunny as when it is cold and and dark. The same may apply to coronavirus.
Another measure would be to provide passengers and crew members with vitamin D, which has been shown to reduce risk of many types of viral and bacterial infections. One of the reasons respiratory tract infections are more common in winter is due to low vitamin D status. The cause of death after a viral respiratory tract infection is generally from pneumonia. Higher vitamin D status helps reduce inflammation which, in the lungs, leads to pneumonia. Those who have not been taking vitamin D should be taking large doses while on contaminated ships, perhaps 10,000 IU/d (the amount a person can make in a day in the sun)

2020-02-19 23:22:29,"Carnival's management is largely responsible for the public health disaster on the Westerdam. They must have known that risk was rather high after a first case, given that cruise ships are superfertile grounds for viruses. The respoonsible action would have been to repatriate the ship to the US. Instead, they dumped the ship on Cambodia, a very poor country with the public health expertise and infrastructure that comes with it. They did so by lying to the Cambodian government and the world by saying that there were no infections on board, even though they knew that they had no way of knowing. Shame on Carnival, its management, its shareholders."
2020-02-20 04:35:12,"I was on a Holland America ship in the Mediterranean and the captain was a fine enough human being to rescue African refugees who were adrift. One wonders how many other people passed them and just averted their gaze. I've been on 3 Holland America cruises and the ships were well run and clean and they had staff stationed in the dining room entryways to watch you sanitize your hands. I had a lovely time seeing places I had wanted to see all of my life: Greece, Sicily,Turkey,  Copenhagen, St. Petersburg, Stockholm. It is an easier way for an older person to travel and have fewer stressful arrangements to make. I would not want to be quarantined for weeks because of an outbreak but there are worse places to suffer confinement. I am disturbed to hear of the ocean dumping. And conditions for the workers are surely difficult. I hope none of them became ill. They are surely crowded closer together . Still the people who run them seem to me to be smart and capable.I was actually very surprised that so few people contracted the virus. Blaming the ships is easier than worrying about what things could be like internationally in about 8 more weeks. I'm worried and I live in the middle of the American Southwest."

2020-03-03 16:41:02,The mortality rate difference probably reflects the higher rate of  prevalence of predisposing  co-morbid conditions among men. It would be hasty to conclude women have better immunity without studying the deaths closely and compare the co-morbidities in both sexes. It would be better to compare the deaths in both sexes with no apparent co-morbidities to draw the conclusion regarding the immunity factor.

2020-02-19 12:43:51,"The current facts are, there is no known medicine for the virus. The death rate for those infected with the virus while low (2.5%), the concern is that 80% of those who died were above 60 years of age. This virus is much more contagious than SARS and it is still not clear how many people in Japan were infected or how the virus is spreading so fast. Under these circumstances it is not surprising that governments and people are booking fearful of the virus. China too has not been forthcoming with information and for months did not allow US CDC into Wuhan to understand the virus and its prognosis. The real danger is if this virus spreads to Africa and poorer parts of South Asia which have poor medical facilities and people live in close proximity in slums and settlements.

If you want to bring your dog on a visit to Australia, you must first get him vaccinations, get a certificate attesting thereto, and even then your dog must enter a 60 day quarantine upon arrival in Australia.

I've been out this morning - just a normal London working day, nothing shut down, usual public gatherings. My local pharmacy even has face masks available for sale. Things are possibly dangerously casual but certainly not fearful.

I'm about 2 miles from the hospital ER where a Corona +ve Chinese national pitched up in a cab and sat around the emergency reception area for an hour. Yet, Uber's still in business and black cabs are still playing for fares and the hospital's work carries on unchanged. This incident barely registered on the radar of locals.

Whilst it seems to be NYT policy to paint everything European in the worst possible light, there's none of the usual NYT descriptor suspects: 'scrambling', 'panic', 'desperate', 'squabbling', 'ineffectual' here in Europe.

2020-02-19 20:11:47,"Unfortunately, despite the fact that we are an intelligent species, the worst of human nature comes out during a crisis like a pandemic. Much like the classic Twilight Zone episode “Monsters on Main St,” people easily overreact and become paranoid and fearful of each other. Even I must admit that while traveling recently through LaGuardia Airport in NYC, I hesitated for just a second when I came into contact with a fellow traveler of Asian descent. It was a just a split second but I had to catch myself and let logic prevail. Shame on us. This is a classic case of the reactions being worse than the problem. Far more people will be hurt because of vicious reactions to the virus than the virus itself."
2020-02-24 14:37:40,"The problem is actually much older.  Most experts agree that the HIV virus jumped to humans from the simian population sometime around the 1920’s as a result of human consumption of meat caught in the wild.  It’s a constant risk and until we deal with the fact that many of the emerging diseases, as noted in the article, are jumping from animal populations to humans, these outbreaks will continue."
2020-02-24 15:08:54,"Unfortunately, culture mores are very hard to break in a short amount of time. While like most I see a breaking of the wildlife market a key to containing these viruses, I think a bigger problem herein is one of economics. When the people who traffic in this area do it out of pure economics, then it's time to address that area so that the ability to sell animals does not become a person's primary means of income.
Unfortunately, as has been pointed out in the article, people have short memories and the next outbreak is lying just around the corner."
2020-02-24 16:02:42,"A ban may be morally appealing and perhaps would slow the spread of viruses from wild animals to humans, but I think the spread would happen regardless. People will live near bats, be bitten by mosquitoes, and eat wild game no matter what our laws say."
2020-02-24 16:09:40,"This is an issue that revolves around culture and an entrenched value system. One carried into the 21st century from primitive eras. As long as there are customers for these animals and animal products sale of them will continue. In marketplaces legal or illegal. What can counter this is a mass, concentrated government effort to educate the population, raising their consciousness to bring it into alignment with enlightened thinking. A big challenge in societies resilient to change where traditional practices are powerful elements in daily life."
2020-02-24 16:17:48,"Every year many people get a flu shot. They probably don’t think about from where flu mutates but they should. Millions of domesticated animals live alongside other domesticated animals in places like Wuhan. The wild animal markets just bring more variety to the virus mutation and species barrier jumping circus that now has briefly captured our attention. Yes something should be done. But the question of whether we are willing to adjust our lifestyles (whether Chinese or American) seems not to connect up with the realities those lifestyles bring. This time those lifestyles are bringing thousands and maybe tens of thousands of deaths.  Our responses are flimsy, like those ubiquitous masks. We all reap what we sew, or in this case what the folks in Wuhan like to cook."
2020-02-24 16:54:01,"The benefit of banning wildlife markets in China would be at least threefold: preventing disease outbreaks, stopping the decimation of wild animal populations throughout Asia and Africa, and putting a dent in the organized crime networks that benefit from the trade."

What really rankles me is how the Chinese and other Asians are not being shamed for creating the huge economic demand for endangered animal parts.  We put all of our efforts into a futile goal of policing poachers and traffickers when we should be attacking the root of the problem.

One should not use cultural tradition as an excuse to tolerate harmful behavior.  We don't and shouldn't see cultural justification for things like slavery, female circumcision, and dog-eating.  These bad things should go away as civilization matures, and so should killing endangered wildlife.

It really falls on the younger generations of Asians to force change in their culture.  Most of east Asia is now well developed and educated.  Young people should not just casually avoid exotic foods and traditional medicines prepared from endangered animals that they see in their parents' and grandparents' lives.  They should actively stigmatize these practices.  As we are learning, the consequences could be immense."

Why they deny the obvious? YES of course they are ashamed.

I am not against eating any animal or insects; it is food. But also it has to be recognized that it comes with risks, and if risks cannot be managed, then it has to stop.  At least regulated!

It is a known fact that wild animals (even horses & camels) have immunity against diseases that humans don't have. That is why horses are used to manufacture the antidotes/cures

One more thing, the demand for such animals sadly comes from cultural superstition; they believe that eating such animals will give you longevity &, good health! The Chines government has to be engaged in a mass educational & media campaign

Finally, it should be noted that this phenomenon is all over Africa and southeast Asia; so this is a global problem and not just related to China. However, these countries don't deny it like most Chines people do."

The only difference is that Indians are mainly vegetarians and don't eat any of those exotic animals (unlike depictions in Hollywood movies). Maybe China should take a page from India and enforce international laws to prevent the eating of exotic animals. It will be good for their economy, people and the world's endangered species."

I won't eat a deer from the wild because they probably have Lyme disease.  Humans can't act like we are on the farm when we are the big city as far as carrying live animals around in busses and whatnot before eating them.

But rarely have they cracked down on the wildlife trade. They have decimated huge populations of rhinoceros and pangolins just to name a few of the animals in danger of extinction.

Animal agriculture, at least in the West, directly and through the feed grown (and fished) for livestock, accounts for a disproportionately high share of greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient loading and ""dead zones"" in our waters, pesticide release, groundwater depletion, and damage to land, soil, and wildlife. Add in ammonia, particulates, and other air emissions; also over-fishing and killing of non-target species.
Far from least, is the suffering of billions of sentient creatures annually for the sake of flavor and a buck.

Co-authored by researchers from three Chinese institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences and published Friday on the distribution platform ChinaXiv, the study attempts to trace how the virus emerged and evolved.

The data suggest that “the SARS-CoV-2 source at the … market was imported from elsewhere,” researchers say.

The paper follows on the heels of research published last month in the well-known medical journal The Lancet challenging the hypothesis that the virus emerged at the Wuhan market. That paper analyzed 41 infected patients whose cases dated as far back as Dec. 1 and concluded that 13 of them had no links to the marketplace.

As Yi-Zheng Lian said, Chinese cultural practices which are ""firmly embedded in the Chinese collective consciousness” have helped lead to the current outbreak of COVID-19. His recent commentary in the NYT's discusses the notion of “jinbu,” and a long list of exotic foods, ""whose methods of procurement or preparation can be outright cruel.”  Bats, which are believed to be the original source of both the current coronavirus and the SARS virus, ""are said to be good for restoring eyesight- especially the animals’ feces. Gallbladders and bile harvested from live bears are good for treating jaundice; tiger bones is for erections.” It is also thought that animals killed just before serving are more “jinbu” potent, which is one reason the more exotic offerings in wet markets tend to be sold alive, making them more potent vectors for any virus they might carry."""

So I can well imagine the circumstances, the anxiety, the sense of feeling imprisoned in a small room.

But at the same time, this is new virus, the entire world population is potentially at risk, and every nation must do as much as possible to protect us all.  

Of course there must a plan to disembark all these passengers.  But that must include ways to quarantine them, whether in Japan or elsewhere.  They must all be protected from each other and from anyone who cares for them.  And that quarantine might need to last more than 2 weeks.

Any one of us must be prepared to take precautions as well as be ready for their life to be upended by a quarantine.  We must come to see a quarantine as a public service some are “called” to perform.  It’s as simple as that.  It’s as necessary as that."

To say that Cambodia was reckless is valid only if the worst case scenario comes true. At this point, the virus has too many unknowns for an accurate assessment.

The Coronavirus unknowns.
1. How the virus is transmitted from one person to another.
2. Once transmitted, how long before the person shows symptoms. (Working assumption is 14 days.)
3. Once transmitted, when the is person contagious? Do you have to have symptoms for the virus to be contagious?

So to update it again. I now suggest you read Edgar Allan Poe's the Masque of the Red Death. Published 178 years ago. Poe's ""Prince Prospero"", the confident  despot, didn't have to deal with airports and cruise ships, yet his efforts still failed. Miserably.

Prince Prospero... Ring a bell?"
2020-02-18 18:39:58,"I don't want to cause more fear but I have a question: How it is possible that in Japan there are now 3 members of the medical team providing care for the Princess Cruise ship are now infected. And in Wuhan the medical director is among the casualties. With all the modern equipments and professional training, how can the virus be transmitted to medical team members?"
2020-02-18 16:46:39,"If Cambodia does become a ""vector of transmission"" of the COVID-19 virus, the Holland-America cruise ship line must bear some of the responsibility. 

They were desperate to bring the ship into port. They allegedly did no testing of their passengers besides taking their temperature. The virus appears to be contagious by people who are infected but remain asymptomatic. Holland-America knew this. 

The previous port-of-call was Hong Kong, part of the PRC, on February 1, where new passengers boarded. HK has a number of people infected by the virus. Holland-America knew this.
  
Other nations knew all of the above: they refused permission for the ship to stop at any of them. Maybe Cambodia knows more about this virus than those local nations (including the USA: Western Samoa also turned away the ship.) 

Perhaps Prime Minister Hun Sen is as wise as he is generous. Surely Holland-America hopes so."
2020-02-18 17:46:19,"My questions: 
1. How long will it take to sanitize and disinfect the cruise ships, hotels, etc where coronavirus infected people have stayed?
2. Do masks really work? 
3. What is the impact to international sporting events, eg. summer Olympics, Formula 1, World Cup?
4. Is there a vaccine or cure?"
2020-02-18 17:44:59,"The reporting on the coronavirus is another example that exaggerated reporting on an unfortunate event  can cause more damage than the event itself.  The mortality rate of this virus is about 0.6% outside of Wuhan province  in China and is dropping. The mortality rate drops to less than 0.3% outside of China.  It's clearly and quickly losing  virulence as it spreads away from the epicenter of Wuhan.  The death rate outside of China is in the same range as a seasonal flu.  Overreaction on this particular disease is not only causing unnecessary damage to the world economy, but distracts our attention to this year's seasonal flu, which has caused much more death than the coronavirus."
2020-02-18 16:43:00,"Here's the bottom line on masks; if they are the cheap ones sold in home centers as ""dust masks"", they are useless for protecting oneself against airborne bacteria and viruses. They do not fit tight to the face, leaving gaps. Good masks cost money. The masks that will be effective are the ones made to protect against fumes and gases, such as spray painting, handling fuel, and protection from smoke and vapors. If the virus is transmitted through the air, there can be no gaps in the mask that allow unfiltered air into the lungs. Though the masks seen in pictures of Chinese volunteers appear better than hardware store dust masks, they are ultimately inadequate in keeping out all particles."
2020-02-18 17:55:08,"If we start trusting governments like that in Cambodia, a global pandemic might not be too far down the road.

Flights to and from any country and Cambodia should be grounded immediately.

Imagine a world putting its trust in a Cambodian government to do what's right."
2020-02-18 18:54:02,"Cambodia has never been known as a place with public health excellence, superb medical care, or distinguished medical personnel. When you couple this with Holland Amercia's irresponsibility of just wanting to dock its ship somewhere and not owning up to the acknowledgment that some of its passengers could be carriers of the virus, you've got an explosive cocktail that could potentially explode on the world."
2020-02-18 17:15:32,"Is this how it all ends?
I guess we don't have to worry about climate change.
Don't tell Greta Thunberg and her family.  They've been counting on a big payday."
2020-02-18 17:49:07,Mr. Hun Sen better hope that this spectacle won't come back to haunt him personally.  He is not a young man and the elderly are probably more susceptible to coronavirus complications.  What foolish behavior he is exhibiting.
2020-02-18 17:57:23,"Michael Osterholm's observation is eloquent but misdirected. “It’s like trying to stop the wind.” Well, that's why we build windbreaks. We channel and funnel and direct wind in order to diminish destructive power but also harness energy. That's how sail boats work.

What's going on in Cambodia is more like kicking the windows open during a hurricane and hoping the storm blows right through. Not very intelligent. You should be afraid. A 1 percent mortality rate on 1,000,000 infections is 10,000 deaths. CONVID-19 could easily infect hundreds of millions in weeks. Excessive caution buys time.

We hope the virus will slow down in warmer months. However, we still need a year at least until a vaccine is developed. If you, your child, or your parent contract the virus before there's adequate treatment, that's it. You're rolling the dice on your entire family. The odds aren't good. Hun Sen just placed a genocidal number of people at risk."
2020-02-18 23:57:17,"So, have the lawsuits against Holland America started yet?

First person infected in Cambodia can sue the ship’s company for the apparently fraudulent statement that everyone on board was virus-free.

If the crazy dictator does not allow the suits in his country, relatives just come on over (if you truly are virus free) and talk to lawyers here, or wherever the ship is really from, although if not registered in the U.S. then you can add “fraudulent advertisement” given the Holland America name. 

Are there any international treaties or conventions that can slap something on a country due to the erratic behavior of its leader during and pertaining to a pandemic?"
2020-02-19 03:16:48,"Could this be the solution to global warming? How about the gross misinformation being spread?  Could all of our problems in the world right now be solved with a mass culling of the population?  The answer, when we return."
2020-02-18 11:58:03,"Thinking of Professor Paulos's opinion column today, it's important to remember that influenza mortality is mitigated both by widespread seasonal vaccination, and by the use of Tamiflu in early infection."
2020-02-18 11:58:43,"Will China need to receive proceeds from their investments in US and other countries bills, notes and bonds when they mature rather than rolling them over due to softening of their economy?

Possible propping up of the Yuan and borrowing outside funds could hurt China's growth and eliminate jobs and businesses for a while.

Could the Coronavirus be a harbinger of a world economic readjustment?"
2020-02-18 12:26:56,"China is doing the best they can to stop Coronavirus.

The Coronavirus setback on global production chain disruption is more significant than we thought.  It is not just us, but worldwide companies who depend on China for parts and final products.  In addition, Chinese tourists' globally buying spree will be stopped.  Both European luxury brands and us knocked down our annual growth estimates.  We certainly underestimated the influence of China.  It is now an important member of the global family.  When China suffers, every one feels the pain.

Based on the current numbers from Chinese government, China seems to have taken the virus under control.  No further unexpected rise or spreading occurs.  Production is also coming back gradually.  It is certainly a good sign.  In a way, our stock markets based on the performance have more faith in China than every day Joe in us."
2020-02-18 12:33:09,"Using only confirmed cases of coronavirus to calculate fatality will solidly overestimate its fatality rate. Under lock down and facing incredible congestion at hospitals, many with mild illness will simply stay home and recover without ever being diagnosed. A fatality rate using only lab diagnosed cases is irresponsible at best and liable to encourage panic at worst."
2020-02-18 11:58:03,"My concern is that the president is controlling the release of information from the CDC on the test results of those Americans and diplomatic staff and families  whom first departed Wuhan and China. Given the number of tourists, students and business people traveling back and forth to and from China we should have more than 15 cases in the US. If the first case in Seattle is any indication of reality."
2020-02-18 12:26:41,"Apple said it is “fundamentally strong, and this disruption to our business is only temporary.”

I doubt we’ll hearing about the virus come warmer weather in May. 

I hope I’m right."
2020-02-18 12:35:45,"This is evidence that the US needs to keep some production facilities in the US for critical items.  

Many generic drugs are made in China, if there were a long term shut down of these facilities, people in the US would be in big trouble."
2020-02-18 11:10:18,"The Americans on the Diamond Princess should have been evaluated 10 days earlier. The Americans in Wuhan should have been evacuated earlier than they were. 

The delay led to more cases of COVID-19 among the group, and cases being brought into the U.S. 

I hope those folks will be OK and that all those Americans in quarantine are in comfortable conditions.

But, the State Department and CDC need to learn some lessons from this and act faster in the future. For Americans who travel abroad, this situation raises serious concerns about whether our government has our backs."
2020-02-18 12:05:19,"Good job China!
Stay strong and keep up the fight!

As far as everyone else, please get your act together. We won’t have many chances to fumble without consequence. Some of the stuff going on is crazy, especially that cruise ship debacle."
2020-02-18 11:30:54,"Wearing masks is probably little help. 

The mesh is too coarse to prevent the passing of tiny viruses."
2020-02-18 11:59:58,A new virus is mentioned.  Is COVID-19 the new virus or is COVID-19 the flu and there is a new virus in addition to that one?
2020-02-18 12:26:25,"“.... a hospital at the heart of the outbreak ...”

Thank you for not saying “epicenter” as, seemingly every other journalist seems to do. Journalists should only use words of which they know the definition."
2020-02-18 12:23:15,People need eye coverings  as well as masks.
2020-02-18 14:22:55,"How can the cruise ship even think of considering their quarantine effective if it has spread to over 500 passengers?

All the passengers should be put under government quarantines without recirculated air where the people are kept in solitary confinement. 

I understand the frustration of the passengers on board in this scenario, but this is more important than your frustration."
2020-02-18 13:56:46,"That Novel Corona is roughly 20x deadlier than seasonal flu, is not 'new analysis'. It was just newly added to the CDC website.  To even call it 'analysis' overstates the case. It is division, the kind you learned in elementary school. For NYT readers who bothered to divide the number of fatalities by the number of cases, which have been printed every day in the NYT, it has been clear for weeks that the fatality rate is over 2%, which is indeed, ~20x more fatal seasonal flu.

Most reporting has consistently underestimated the risk of corona virus, often by comparing it to flu, which we treat casually."
2020-02-18 14:24:22,Any info regarding North Korea and coronavirus?
2020-02-18 14:58:05,Can someone explain the math behind the mortality figures?   I’m reading that only about 18K people have recovered from COVID-19 and nearly 1900 have died.  Doesn’t that mean that by the end of the infection’s lifecycle the mortality rate is roughly 10 percent?
2020-02-18 15:10:05,"Has anyone looked at the mortality rate for patients who are put on oxygen, versus those who are not? Reportedly people with underlying health issues are dying at higher rates. They are more likely to be put on oxygen. I wonder if oxygen might actually exacerbate the progression of the disease?"
2020-02-18 14:59:50,"Let's dispense with these obviously fake causalities why the virus spread.  The cause is human behavior, and the presumption of those potentially exposed to ""escaped"" to avoid because they think they are not  yet infected, or are trying to avoid getting infected.  Millions left Wuhan before a quarantine could be put in place.  

For those who are posting snide remarks.  Think what might happen in the US if the thousands of individuals who are "" considered not infected and return to the general public was later found to be silent carriers, like the British businessmen who infected at least 11 people in 3 countries in less than 3 days."
2020-02-18 15:03:31,"Gradually we seem to understand this infection better. A few major issues remain unanswered. 
1. Do asymptomatic individuals spread the infection?
2. What is the exact incubation period?
3. Why are there such high rates of infections in health care personnel? Is it lack of protective equipment? Highly transmissible like measles? High viral loads?  Different modes of transmission?
4. Is one ethnic group more susceptible to severe infection in addition to underlying medical conditions?"
2020-02-18 15:20:02,"There is one big advantage and one big disadvantage to the coronavirus starting where it did.  

The big advantage is that Communist China can wall off, ""quarantine"", half a billion people with its authoritarian rule.

All these things are crucial and, yes, complex. But most of all, please keep this very dangerous & supremely contagious virus from spreading, that must take precedence over most other matters and must not be done hesitantly, and without proper funding (looking at you trump & co.). Can we please give this everything we’ve got? It is here, it will spread, it will kill. Let’s keep that difficult reality in the forefront of all decisions. Let’s tell people, repeatedly, to have two weeks of food & prescription medicine in their homes. Let’s get a team talking regularly to Americans, not a fool who tweets on occasion that everything is fine, someone more like Fauci, someone who knows what’s cooking and can give us updates on what can be done.

While there was hope that the “phase-one deal” would bring a respite to the Chinese leadership, before entering a new phase and negotiating thorny issues like technology and intellectual property etc with the US, Xi  has not  had a good start to the new year. He and other leaders have been caught off guard by the ferocious   spread of the Coronavirus, bringing the country to a standstill and hurting its economy.

Xi can't punch down and blame his underlings without appearing cowardly and weak.

By definition Xi has no governing political peers and must fall or stand alone.

How long are the virus particles viable once released?  How is it similar to other coronaviruses; what differences have been detected?  How much is known about an immune response to the virus as opposed to other RNA viruses.  Being an RNA virus, it can be expected that the mutation rate of the virus is high--has this been detected?

There is amazing science about what is known about viruses, and just as amazing, what is not known about RNA viruses like HIV.

The flu is prevalent but not particularly deadly.  Ebola is not as prevalent but is extremely deadly. How many are being restricted doesn't tell us what we need to know.  Throwing around numbers like 700 million and 150 million exaggerate the problem.  Knowing China's policies doesn't tell us nearly as much as knowing the prevalence and the deadliness of the disease.

As with war, information and truth are among the first casualties, and something of this scale all but rises to that enormity.

Imagine if you will, the whole of southern California locked down a la Wuhan if virus outbreaks of any quantity occurred there ... wow.

A final thought: this entire experience should remind the world of the perils of putting all of our eggs into one basket.  We have, over that last 40 years, come to depend on China to manufacture and produce just about all of our consumables; our colleges and universities depend financially on Chinese students coming here; and the tourism industry all over the planet depends upon Chinese tourists to an excess and with their disposable income to stay afloat.

This is history in the making and we should do everything to help China to win this war against a one of a kind nanometer  sized monster than is only visible under the electron microscope, not seen by the naked eye or on a radar screen.

That the Westerdam disembarked without testing all passengers, multiple times given the known false negative issue, shows stunning negligence. Cambodia's PM is now conducting a political show that will result in spread of the virus there. Westerdam passengers, who didn't quickly fly out, are touring at the PM's behest rather than self-quarrantining. Unconscionable.

China prohibited sale of thermometers and analgesics because they knew people would try to evade quarrantine. The Westerdam relied on self-reporting. Those honest enough to report or go to infirmary were the only ones tested, a series of fever checks the only shipwide measure. It is human nature that fear of quarrantine would lead some to attempt to evasion. China is willing to concede this. What of the rest of us?

A US passenger, 40ish with a healthcare background, expressed how stressful, upsetting her experience. Imagine you're 83, traveling with your 85 y.o. husband. If you thought you were sick, how great the tempation to take analgesics and avoid the infirmary, in hopes of getting off that boat and back to the US asap. People spin self-justifications. For better or worse, only an enforcable response from authorities can act against selfish human nature."
2020-02-18 17:57:39,"People often compare this new coronavirus infection to the seasonal flu and there is a general assumption by many people that the common seasonal flu is far worse since it affects more people but COVID-19 is far more serious infection.
   The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is 2.5%. By comparison, the case fatality rate for the seasonal flu in the US is between 0.10 percent and 0.18 percent. 
   China has already lost many health care workers to this illness including an ophthalmologist and a neurosurgeon. We have vaccines available for the seasonal flu but not for COVID-19 and no effective antiviral medications either as of now and this illness seems to be easily transmissible from person to person just like the seasonal flu. Other than hand washing there is very little we can do to prevent this infection. Also, there are many unknowns even the incubation period. The 2 to 14 days incubation period is only an estimate, can vary greatly between patients. An outlier of a 24 days incubation period has been observed in a recent study but the WHO said it could actually reflect a second exposure rather than a long incubation period.
   The COVID-19 may initially present with few or no symptoms. This disease has already spread to 26 more countries apart from China.
  The good news is scientists are already racing to develop a vaccine for 2019-nCOV, a feat that experts say is technically possible but the bad news is, it is not going to be available to help during this outbreak."

Assuming COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8%, that is 200 times more deadly than flu. It seems that it is almost as contagious. So it is pretty easy to see how it could completely overwhelm even the best medical system in the world."

But tomorrow, I guess they're not releasing the remaining 2000+ people with no further quarantine, do they? 
Sorry, but Maybe 14 days ago, the chances were1 or 2 in 1000 that a passanger or Crew member was infected. Today this Risk is Maybe 1 in 10 or more (!). As a matter of fact, the remaining passangers suffer a far hihger likelihood to cary the virus than any neighbourhood in Wuhan City. 
I guess, all countries Need to pick their citizens up ASAP, means within short days. Then, the passangers would sadly have to pass a new time in Quarantine...but this time under safe conditions...and not on ship with no effective protection.

I have NO empathy or sympathy for the multi-nationals whose supply-chains have been interrupted by the reality of what can happen when they're scattered all over the world: boo-doggone-hoo. 

Keep your supply chains local, i.e. in this country, pay your people fairly, and grow more consumers here, instead of trying to import them.

The CDC test kits were flawed, readings from Singapore spoke about many folks testing false negative, lung CT scans uninformative, even if cases were suspect. The problem has always been the irrational and scattered response to a contagious disease. In China, because the government is authoritarian and muffles voices, doctors rebelled and rightly spread word of a zoonotic new virus that had spread to humans. The problem is, this was before they even understood the extent of the illness it caused. This must have barreled into public panic, fanned by utterly foolish government directives, a complete absence of experts to guide them from other countries, to pool intelligence and strategize. Now you have an influx of frightened people rushing to the few overwhelmed hospitals. No great diagnostics, unsure antivirals. So what do they do? The only thing they can, build more hospitals. And by that time the bug is already out all over Asian countries. The results, puzzling as it appears mild enough to all except those who are more susceptible to any illness, those with heart, lung, kidney or diabetes problems. Thankfully children are spared. Chinese governmental mismanagement, has now imprisoned and stalled it's own people, destroyed the economic futures of many of it's own people and stalled the world.

All the manufacturing plants in China, should spread their businesses to several other locations. Today's update here is highlighting problems businesses are facing, with shortage of materials at the production centers. This is causing a cyclic effect all around, on the supply and demand chain.

That means immediately isolating and placing under quarantine people in and around the epicenter for as long as necessary.
That means making it everywhere illegal to trade in wildlife for human consumption (food, ‘medicine’, pets).

The company that owns the cruise ship would ask for a 500 bed or whatever number hospital or a hotel to spread apart these folks and quarantine them.

As to numbers - Dr. Gottleib - the ex FDA chief was on CNBC yesterday.  And he gave some interesting information.

He said if Chinese data is to be believed - hardly anybody in age less than 20 got infected and no children or babies at all.

Reminded me of Andromeda Strain - perhaps these young folks are a clue to how to fight this virus.

As to elderly and folks with underlying medical issues falling victims to thus virus - hard to understand why this is even a surprise.

While we are all right now for these drastic actions of long term confinements and restriction on movements of huge number of folks - a year from now - it may be shown they were counter productive."

Perhaps it seems medieval, but quarantine is an improved version of the disastrous world wide flu epidemic of the early 20th century. The situation points to the reality, that despite our sophistication as societies, we must look to old fashioned means to prevent a virus from taking over.  In the future, perhaps there will be medicine to take that prevents contagion.  Until this happens, we must go the old fashioned way of hand washing, masks and avoiding large crowds in areas where the virus is active.   Yes, the world economy and China's in particular may suffer.  The only other option is a world-wide outbreak where everyone comes to a stand-still."

After years of Silicon Valley sanctimoniously telling people in dying industries to get new skills and move to where the jobs are, Tim Cook discovers the downside of blindly relying on totalitarian-ruled China for cheap, inexhaustible labor and a market for iPhones.

One wonders whether Apple has been compelled to remove ‘Winnie-the-Pooh’ from iBooks or risk being kicked out of China.  If it’s not the infantile caprices of an insecure dictator, it’s the Stone Age hygiene and folk remedies that spawn new epidemics with such regularity you can pencil them into your calendar a year in advance.

I bet Apple shareholders are wondering why Tim Cook did not diversify his suppliers, possibly even manufacturing in Central America or the US.  Sure, their profit margin will plummet to merely “outstanding “, but business is full of trade-offs."

Where is the pandemic? Why is this only a Hubei/Wuhan problem? 

If it’s so contagious why haven’t we seen at least one additional chain develop? Just curious.

Why are there not signs with pictures everywhere, on buses, trains, airports, train and bus stations and public places showing people how to cover their mouths with their elbow or a tissue if they have to cough or sneeze? All of the experts say to wash your hands often and not to rub your eyes, nose or mouth, probably because someone coughed in their hand, then contaminated a hard surface that you touched. So why not ask people to stop coughing and sneezing in their hands (as I see often in public transportation)? The experts say a mask may not protect you, but if you cough or sneeze, the mask will protect other people if you are wearing one. I’ve seen a report that even loud talking can spread tiny droplets of saliva that contain the virus. Then wouldn’t wearing a mask protect other people from those secretions as well? There could also be hand sanitizers and tissues made widely available for low cost or free at every bus and train station, airport and public place, donated or paid for by donors. Would all this not prevent at least some disease?"
2020-02-19 04:23:55,"The economic harm from trying to isolate it will be unnecessary since it won't likely be contained. It is also very likely that the fear of it is far overblown. I don't know if governments are just posturing in case it is truly severe so they don't get blamed for not doing anything, but I find that unlikely since most government do all kinds of deadly and cruel things to their people without a hint of concern. It may be that they are so inept that they really don't know that it won't be stopped no matter what they do, and that it is highly likely that they are under counting significantly the actual number of cases and so it is likely not that deadly. And of course, knowing how our government works (much like china and Russia really), my guess is the specter of having a two percent drop in the population and thus a two percent drop in their profits has then shivering in fear."

Several readers on previous articles have commented on the importance of hand hygiene in controlling spread of viral infections.  As I vaguely recall, Toronto aborted its SARS outbreak by putting hand disinfection stations all over the city.  But there has not been the first word in any reports that China is aware of this important control measure."

Although it's not an original observation, the same can be said about our own government.  When there's a vast disconnect between what a dear leader says and what a captive public observes, something has got to give.

A few nights ago, I heard historian Timothy Synder observe that when a people wants to revolt, it's far better to revolt in great numbers, rather then a few at a time--hard to punish a hoard.

As Nicholas Kristof observes, if the Chinese  public has come to realize how tough it is to quell a resistance of millions, maybe we too will soon see the light about the power of a majority over the whimpers of a minority."

Meanwhile, Xi, for all his faults, at least steers many features of the Chinese economy with a shrewd long view, sending out webs of influence through loans to create access to world resources for years to come without squandering blood or treasure on futile wars or excessive military spending. 

He achieves access to resources much more efficiently than the the U.S with our endless military interventions that sap our resources. 

The question to me is whether his stifling of free speech and democratic ideals will be equally damaging to the Chinese economy as are our senseless wars are to ours?

Free minds are the most creative, or at least one hopes.  If he manages to succeed and shows his model is more efficient than our contentious and messy democracy, human beings all over the globe will have their own freedoms threatened.  

Is it more productive and efficient to have political organization that is like a free-range jail?

We need to show the world a better alternative."
2020-02-15 20:38:17,"To a hammer, everything is a nail.  The Chinese government has one way of operating, and that is heavy-handedly.  No matter what the problem is, the solution is to grab the people and all means of communication by the reins.  For their leadership, at least maintaining the appearance of control is an end in itself.  But of course illness is in no way comparable to citizens’ political dissent, the former being far more unresponsive than the latter to humans’ ideas about any social order."
2020-02-15 20:39:18,"Mr. Kristoff,

How effective was your freedom of speech in ending up the endless state of war the US government has been engaged in ever since the end of the WWII?

Since the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, no foreign government has first declared the war on the USA.

So, why have we wasted many trillion dollars on waging them, got close to 100,000 US soldiers killed, hundreds of thousand maimed and millions of them living with the PTSD?

Can you imagine the world we would live in if all those monetary and human sacrifices were invested in educational, scientific and technological innovation and breakthrough?"
2020-02-15 20:46:36,"The single greatest thing we can do to control disease outbreaks is for countries to share data and resources quickly and honestly. W. Ian Lipkin, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, is trying to create an international exchange of information to facilitate this process. But countries must be honest and cooperative which, given the authoritarian regimes in places like China, is highly unlikely. Substituting Trump's name for Xi's is appropriate, given how Trump seems to see Xi and Putin as role models. 

Substituting President Trump’s name for Xi’s is a just replacement."
2020-02-15 20:46:40,"""...and they’re working very, very hard...""

President Xi worked very, very hard to silence the truth, and those who work very, very hard to save lives can only do so much with limited supplies, need to sleep, overwhelming number of seriously ill people, and hope that they themselves do not get infected and possibly die. 

""and I think it’s going to all work out fine."" Right now, it has not worked out for maybe 100,000 ill, more than 10 million locked down, and while not likely, certainly possible that a billion will be infected.  

I'm amazed at how much we know about this virus so soon, despite the politics of silencing whistleblowers, throwing video bloggers into quarantine, and on this side of the dateline, all the anti-science actions which fortunately haven't yet had time to destroy our public health system too much. That will go should there be a second term.

Amazing how vaccines become a good word during these times."

Sadly, I fear that our current administration, with its disdain for science and expertise, is also ill equipped if this epidemic takes hold in North America."

While the Chinese leadership may be excessively secretive, it is hardly more ""corrupt, thuggish and narcissistic"" than much of ours, where the cash nexus decides where medical research goes and where the regulated polluters and poisoners have become their own regulators.  The steady drumbeat from the Times berating the Chinese leadership is becoming tiresome, particularly when what is ignored is the culture of the Chinese people, most of whom are either in a basically traditional peasant culture or only one or maybe two generations removed.  The agricultural systems there are the source of almost all of these outbreaks, and these are the agricultural systems the Chinese people prefer or at least accept.  Maybe the Chinese leadership needs to be more ""authoritarian"" in order to clean up this mess."
2020-02-15 21:11:29,"The threat of deadly pandemic is one of the world's greatest disorganizers. I doubt that the mal-adaptive Chinese response is much worse than what we might have seen in the U.S. The initial impulse among politicians everywhere is always to play down threats of catastrophe, because the unhappy social consequences of such threats are themselves so hard to control.

Which raises the question, what makes anyone think the U.S. is adequately prepared, should a wildly contagious, and truly deadly, epidemic get a foothold here. I have seen news accounts of pre-planned counter-measures, and caches of medical supplies, vaccines, etc. Nothing described strikes me as remotely sufficient to reassure a public panicked in the initial stages of a spreading, deadly contagion.

So far, we have been lucky. That is about all we know."
2020-02-15 21:21:34,"It is not a Chinese failure, it is a human failure and it is unrelated to any political party. It can happen here or some other place.  To politicize it is uncalled for.  It could have happened here too.  People tend to foul up, some times with more harm than other times.  Accepting responsibility is not easy either."
2020-02-15 21:22:03,"We don’t need freedom of speech.

Why?

Because it’s not prerequisite to solving our problems.

Actually, freedom of speech as it is currently is counterproductive. We use it to criticize somebody else for the social problems and pile up the entire responsibility and guilt on the others.

Actually, probably 95% percent of the world  problems could have been solved internally because  those are self-made.

In the most cases we have created our own difficulties, including the global warming.

We could eliminate them and improve ourselves if we wanted to.

We don’t need the freedom of speech to analyze own behavior, recognize our personal mistakes and make us better individuals.

There is only one thing in the world that enables us to act in such a way. It’s not freedom of speech but the faith.

But please, don’t mix up the faith with the religion.

The faith empowers each of us individually and make us responsible for solving own problems.

In contrast to the pure faith, the religions teach the folks that God would take care of everything..."

When it comes to sacrificing honesty in exchange for maintaining political authority Trump and Xi are two of a kind. On the other hand, only one of them can be defeated in a legitimate election.

Thank you for writing this.    Yes. We owe to scientists--our longer lifespans, our standard of living, and almost every measure of our way of life vs that of the 1700's.   It's probably time that the citizenship think about electing (may be on a part time basis  scientists to political office--society , no doubt,---would be in a much better shape.

I say part time because its my understanding that scientists --in general--love what they do.

I am the relative of 3 doctors---and a former biology student who could not finish--because I could not study at night and had to have a full time job to support myself.   And also didn'twant to ask for financial help.    But I would not change for anything my knowledge of science that has helped in numerous ways to improve my daily existential needs enormously."

Thank you and Ms. Wudunn for speaking out about things our institutions are ignoring or trying to cover up. Thank you for drawing parallels to what is happening in China now.

2020-02-15 21:56:27,"It is always hugely important for our journalists to give a far-reaching voice to those who say, ""I cannot remain silent""—especially when their voices might not otherwise be heard.

But we must always keep in mind that it's always far easier for these journalists to give this voice to those in another country, especially one whose government (handily called a ""regime"" here) and foundational institutions happen to be the targets of other strong and wide-ranging criticisms.

We only need to recall the many decades that passed before our journalists here finally gave a voice to children within the Catholic Church (remember the Oscar-winning Spotlight, anyone?) and finally gave a voice to women in ""industries"" whose power structure created a working environment where sexual abuse was openly known as just part of their ""cultures."" (We have many more thanks to give to Rose McGowen than we do to our journalists who dismissed women with stories just like hers for far too long.)

Of course, this doesn't detract from the importance of Kristof's piece here, which is vital to us all.

But we must also know that there are vital voices here saying ""I cannot remain silent.""

Yet Nicholas Kristof and other journalists simply cannot hear them because these voices threaten to reveal the abuses of power happening within our own foundational institutions—institutions that also happen to directly (or indirectly) sign the paychecks of Kristof and other journalists working for ""our free press."""
2020-02-15 21:57:51,"China has come a long way since the year 1959.  It was then and for an estimated three years that anywhere between 7 million and 27 million Chinese people died; of what, starvation or disease or both?  

The scientists who accompanied the then US President, Richard Nixon, to China, in the early 1970 (1973), reported that even with gross errors, their new population estimates for China were way off, and that it was without doubt that huge numbers of the previously estimated number of Chinese people were missing. 

From that perspective, even the somewhat narcissistic President/Premiere Xi, is more humane that those in power generations many decades ago.  

If it were not for the internet, how might the Chinese in mainland China would exist with some control over their lives. 

It is only a matter of time, when the now Chinese government decentralizes and becomes more democratic."

Yes, the technology outpaces our willingness to accept its assessments and developments. We have political leaders who not only discourage certain technology related to climate change, for example, but mock the concern and predictions (assessments) of our scientists. And so, the Chinese leaders have shown us they too attempt to discount the warnings of science. Rather than affirming and listening and accepting the extraordinary knowledge we often have a pejorative response mixed with fear of the unknown."

America is so utterly easy to blame, as our basic freedoms are under attack in so many ways.  Even as China is in the ascendancy - whatever that may be - they are still locking up way more people than we are.
The solution is to vote - as if your life depended on it - because it literally might.  And remember all the things that we take for granted that sort of look like ""socialism"" - roads, post offices, public schools, libraries.  These are things we all pay for, and things that are mighty important to a funcioning society."
2020-02-15 23:51:01,"Think a bit deeper, Nicholas!

Early hints to the public of a potentially-deadly new virus was a criminally irresponsible act that created panic before preventive behaviors could be recommended, and isolation and quarantine measures put in place.

The public is justifiably enraged that the disease has so  rapidly spread beyond the initial site of infection. Chinese authorities should investigate and prosecute those who prematurely divulged the sensitive medical information that sent people fleeing Wuhan to spread the disease to the wide world!"
2020-02-15 23:55:34,"NYT's China-bashing continues. Is the hidden agenda regime change? Let's assume that COVID-19 had started in the US in  the middle of the all-important (to our economy) Christmas shopping season, like the Lunar New Year is for China. Wouldn't you agree that our business and political leaders would have tried to downplay its severity during the initial weeks of the epidemic (until it went out of control)? For fear that it might adversely affect our stock market, hasn't Mr. Trump been telling us at every opportunity that we have nothing to worry about and that the epidemic will be gone by April?

I admire and applaud China for mobilizing all its resources, including building 1500-bed hospitals in a few days, and imposing a quarantine, to contain this epidemic. God forbid such an epidemic were to occur in a country with ""freedom-of-speech"" like India, where it would probably spread to millions within months.

All said and done, looking at the miracle that China has created over the last 70 years, I believe that authoritarian rule is not much worse than the pseudo-democracy in which we, and many other countries live."

For my own sake, I read it again and included Trump's name and Global Warming as the issue.  We must realize that Trump chooses to deny the human factor in warming, hence endangering all of humanity as the earth increases in temperature.  I would blame Trump as the Chinese are blaming their leadership.  And, to me, the warming issue is even more serious, for obvious reasons.  Without action, I don't see a solution."

Governments of various types have restricted it for millennia; the death sentence for Socrates was issued by a democracy, while America's most famous contemporary whistle-blowers, Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden -- one was imprisoned and tortured, while the other is safe in exile due to the antagonism between the U.S. and Russian governments.

Possibly millions will be infected was her input, but many will be carriers, and she would like to respond to the latest appeal for masks and health kits for the medical team in China.

It is no longer a matter of remaining silent but of taking action, and Mr. Kristof might post a website for those of us able to respond to this emergency request.

The virus has no nationality, religion or political agenda, but  will continue to spread without discrimination during the height of the flu and other seasonal hazards.

Dr. Li's mission was to save lives at the cost of his own.  Others are following in his footsteps, and while politicians will keep clocking each other on the head, those who care about the safety of medical workers in China, here and beyond, have been given a moment in time to respond.

It is definitely not my impression that “Ordinary Chinese see through government propaganda.”  On the contrary.  Even the most well educated, well travelled of them parrot the official government line about everything, unthinkingly. - China is kind to Uighurs and proud of all its minorities.

2020-02-16 00:45:11,"It is not just the Chinese government that is incapable of responding to new medical threats.  
Ronald Reagan was loath to even say the word “AIDS” long enough to let Americans get a really good head start spreading that virus.   
I’m pretty sure Reagan was not a communist, but he was 19th century in many ways, just as you describe the government of China:  looking backward and idealizing a non-existant past, and trying to control the lives of those who did not conform to the leaders view of the world."

If you must eat meat, eat it once every few weeks or so, and then demand that it be very expensive, from a free-range animal. 

Eating wildlife (as in China) and eating dirt-cheap meat produced in our own hideous factory farms is irresponsible and selfish. Okay, so perhaps you don't care about the animals suffering hideous cruelties: then how about you care about your fellow humans, including the ones who aren't meat-eaters but who will be just as susceptible to the viruses that come out of the meat-eating industries? 

We have so many other possible sources of healthy protein nowadays that most people on the planet could easily stop eating meat and stop endangering us all. Doing that will be far more effective than agonizing about which leader we have, and whether leaders should or should not listen to doctors when they speak out."
2020-02-16 00:55:24,"These statistics may be correct in so far as they reflect reported numbers:

it’s a tribute to China’s progress that a baby born in Beijing today has a longer official life expectancy (82 years) than a baby born in Washington, D.C. (78), or New York City (81)

However, in an editorial questioning the disconnect between science and politics, I find it highly ironic that the author cites these numbers without questioning their provenence and acknowledging that (1) government politicians report these numbers, (2) that ""life expectancy"" is itself an ambiguous concept such that numbers from different countries may well compare apples and oranges (e.g. all births, births that survive the first 24 hrs or 72 hrs, births from babies carried to fulll-term discounting premature births, etc.) and (3) the comparison includes ""official"" numbers from the same government accused of possibly obfuscating Corona virus figures.  China may well have made enormous strides in science and technology.  Using questionable government statistics only when they support your arguments seems unreasonable at best."

This is good news but I won't hedge my bets that a change of regime is forthcoming. The government's control is too strong.
Comparing levels of cluelessness, I don't think Xi has anything to fear from Trump. I found it quite funny that the Chinese would use Trump's name instead of Xi to bypass censorship."

That said, I value Kristof's take, albeit I recognize he and I do see China differently.

That said, the question then arises, would any other government have handled this situation any more adroitly?  Or, perhaps more pointedly, would the US leadership be able to do a better job?

As ham handed and overly autocratic some of China's actions may be, could the US actually construct a 1000 bed hospital in 10 days as was done in Wuhan?

And come to think of it, would the good old boys who are always screaming about their ""freedoms"" and their ""gun rights"" be willing to accept quarantining if tested positive.

Before we so quickly condemn China's leadership, a leadership that does seem to have done a major league screwup here, let us reflect on how well things will go here if we too are faced with such a public health crisis."

In such an environment governments lose credibility and social cohesion breaks down.  However faulty China's response to the virus, it looks like they've done a pretty good job of restricting its spread and, even if we can't praise their methods, it's wrong to attack them for the job they've done."

2020-02-16 01:49:21,"It's disturbing that Mr. Kristof sees human suffering as one more opportunity for China-bashing. Yes, local officials thought it was their job to suppress information about the epidemic. Their treatment of Dr. Li was criminal, as was the cover-up. I believe that Xi has acted responsibly in leading a national effort to combat the virus. He would have nothing to gain by doing anything else.

We had exactly the same thing happen in my home city, New York, when, following 9/11, Christy Whitman, the EPA head, declared that the air at ground-zero was safe to breathe, based on no evidence at all. We know the consequences. Public officials hold the misguided belief that it is their duty to provide reassurance, even when that reassurance isn't  justified. 

It took years for the US government to recognize AIDs and provide adequate funding to combat the disease. And the poisoning of the water in Flint was certainly a cover-up by local officials. 

Yes, Mr. Kristof, China has an authoritarian government, we get it, but authoritarian governments hardly have a monopoly on poor management of health crises. When the Chinese people grow tired of their current form of government, they will rise up against it as they did in 1911. Back in the days of Ike, that was called Self Determination of Peoples. Chinese politics is something for the Chinese people to sort out, NOT the US.

Interestingly, the 1911 Revolution had its first success in Wuhan."

The leaders and their minions don't care about the general welfare of its citizens, only for their positions of power and vast wealth.  We here have a better social safety net then they do  according to Chines nationals i have spoken to. So,  as much as i should have sympathy,  i don'.

A baby born in Washington DC or New York City may have a slightly lower life expectancy than a baby born in China (not sure I believe Chinese statistics), but the life of that American baby will be far, far richer, with freedoms and opportunities that the Chinese baby will scarcely be able to imagine because the Chinese baby will be living its life under oppressive totalitarian rule.

I would argue that quality is far more important than quantity in this particular calculation.  And the brutal regime in Beijing is worthy of our opprobrium."
2020-02-16 03:42:48,"It is exciting to think of a China where an enraged middle class overthrows — peacefully — an inept oligarchy, and engages with the world along peaceful, democratic, and commercial lines.  It is a counterpoint to the omnipresent narrative of China as an Adversary, with whom we are locked in zero-sum conflict.  The evidence of the past 50  years (pace Brexit and our own retrenchment) is a validation of Adam Smith’s insight that (at a macro level) countries are better off in multilateral cooperation and specialization. Imagine what the world’s two greatest economies could achieve together.

A separate thought on Trump repetition of Xi’s talking points. We all tend to trust people more that we understand and identify with.  Trump identifies, maybe, with the absolute devotion to self-aggrandizement, retention of power, and corrupt self-dealing of Xi, Erdogan, Netanyahu, Johnson, Bolsonaro, and others (maybe even Maduro and Jong-Il). He repeats the points because he believes Xi, over the experts and career professionals he does not understand, and therefore does not trust.  It should come as no surprise.  It is disturbing and distressing how many people admire and want to be ruled by these men (and they are all men) but American voters need to carefully look at the countries these men run, and decide in November if that’s what they want too."

It's also probable that China was ramping up its research on viruses to deal with the massive swine flue problem they've been having.
Perhaps someone from the lab got infected, then did some shopping at the market? Perhaps the virus leaked out of the lab and the market is the closest thing to place the blame on?"

However, there is a bit of self-righteous presumptuous in make his statements so definitively at this point. There is so much we do not know about how this epidemic will evolve, how Chinese policies will work out, whether they were reasonable even if things get further out of hand, the appropriaate balance of public health and medical measures, and many other things. 

Epidemiological statistics are hard to record and aggregate in the moment, let alone tease out consensus meaning by qualified people. China is a vast country whose health (as well as other) infrastructure is new compared to most Western countries. I am not saying criticism is out of bounds, but before we get too smugly certain, think of the statistical disaster that was the recent Iowa primary, a miniscule event compared to China and the Wuhan coronavirus epidemic."
2020-02-16 06:34:49,"One of the most plentiful resources available in China is people. It would appear that the Chinese government treat its boundless resource like we treat water or fuel, you know, yes it’s valuable, but it’s ok to waste a bit to achieve your goal.

You must be aware that Beijing, like other Chinese cities, enforces Draconian residency restrictions (the ""hukou"" system) that severely limit migration. So life expectancy in Beijing should not be taken as a measure of the quality of public health in China as a whole (where life expectancy is in fact close to 77 years).

Your insistence on this argument only serves to reward a practice that is reminiscent of the ""pass laws"" of apartheid-era South Africa."

Don't expect a mea culpa from President Xi, but some other heads may roll.

China and hopefully the world will learn an important lesson - don't mess with public health.  Usually relegated as an after thought and in deference to the military and police, we spend precious too little money on public health research, bioterrorism preparedness, WHO funding, and the authority of health in the face of an epidemic.  

One would have to wonder how prepared America would be if the epidemic began here given our dysfunctional health care system, our exclusion of immigrants, our competitive rather than collaborative model of delivering health care, our blithely continuing ""business as usual"" with our penchant to borrow money to pay for war or the opioid epidemic and our own undervaluing of public health.

Dr Li Wenliang was a profile in courage and did his best until his final breath when the virus destroyed his lungs and the equipment needed for his final days got moved and taken away from his bed side., He lost his race with the virus multiplying in his lungs before his immune system could hold up. 

Enough has been made of the Chinese communist regime's mishandling of the coronavirus by arm chair opinion columnists. I understand that not everyone is a career virologist like me and unfortunately there are only a handful of us who understand viruses and how they cause disease. From the speed with which this virus has spread passing barriers like masks, gloves and gowns is just totally baffling. this is one of a kind highly contagious, sturdy virus that has outsmarted virologists in China just after another virus of a different family, not corona infected pigs and thousands of pigs were put down.

I am quite fed up with Chinese government whining about how the US over reacted by shutting our borders to incoming Chinese travelers. When you export a deadly pathogen to 26 countries, there are consequences. I am even more fed up with the WHO acting as China's public relations agency rather than trying to protect global health. The WHO tried to claim that asymptomatic transmission was rare at a time when nearly 20% of the cases outside China were due to a nearly asymptomatic carrier in Germany.

There is also what appears to be a coordinated PR campaign claiming that the real problem is an epidemic of anti-Chinese racism. This has the effect of suppressing criticism of the Chinese government by people outside China. Perhaps demonstrating Beijing's reach, some of this has even appeared in the pages of the New York Times.

The Chinese scientific and medical community has published a lot of very useful information about the virus. They have provided many valuable warnings about the tricks covid-19 has.

And in all honesty, we must wonder about that similar mind-set when we witness our major US enterprises greedily and aggressively running toward that cheap labor in this Asian country.

2020-02-16 06:51:15,"I wonder, strictly hypothetically and speculatively speaking rather than make any assertions consisting of  whether cia murdered that doctor, at least in theory being relegated for now to mostly abstracts in China to create a martyr out of him there for the media concept factors development. Don't think they in China mishandle that coronavirus at all episode. New cases of infected subjects are dwindling and strict quarantine has been working to achieve its objectives. Furthermore, a common annual flu circulation has resulted in more deaths than that novelty virus which is of dubious higher virulent attributes than seasonal flu propagation. That is considered routine and inevitable to humans exposure to those pathogens without calling it pandemics."
2020-02-15 20:14:31,"Authoritarian regimes whether China or the Trump administration politicize everything -- especially science and the justice system. Kristof points out that during the SARS outbreak the Chinese government punished the whistleblower -- now doesn't that sounds familiar? At some point U.S. citizens like their Chinese cohorts will also grow ""impatient with the corrupt, thuggish and narcissistic leadership.""
""The contrast between heroic doctors and bumbling political leaders could not be more stark."" How true and how incredibly disturbing."
2020-02-15 23:16:51,"So Trump basically hamstrings the CDC by pulling 2 billion in funding and says President Xi is doing a good job handling the crisis. Makes you wonder how Trump would handle an outbreak here. Belief in science should probably be a prerequisite for an American President, but this one is unable or unwilling to connect the dots. Climate change+population density+lack of resources+emerging pathogens+lack of funding=many deaths."
2020-02-15 21:55:25,"It doesn't make me brave, to submit comments here. I won't be imprisoned or tortured for doing so. My family won't suffer generations of impoverishment and persecution as a consequence. All the same, my decision to begin commenting here in 2016, having never left an online comment before on any news site, was also motivated by principles and patriotism, that is, by the very same abiding thought: ""I cannot remain silent."" These brave individuals in China are thinking only of the wellbeing of all of their fellow citizens, and are motivated by many of the very same ideals and values that our own president and his party have jettisoned."
2020-02-16 08:01:20,"I live in Wuhan. I’m in lockdown quarantine right now, and here’s a sobering observation.

By far the vast majority of Chinese are not complaining. There is no 1.4 billion mouths screaming to be free. Far and away, the bulk of China’s population shuts up and does what the Emperor says. A stunning number, easily the majority are cheerleaders for the Party. That could of course change, but right now I see Chinese turning inward and being angry at the world. I do not see internal upheaval. 

Older people have no desire for revolution. They lived through one already, they do NOT want another one. Young people in Shanghai or Beijing are one population. Here in the interior, it’s like 1930’s America; kids just want a job and some money. Even when I try to draw them out, they refuse to denounce leaders or even suggest they made a mistake. The vast majority of Chinese still live I small towns and cities. They think Xi is doing a great job. 

Mr. Kristof mouths a Western ideal to which the average Chinese has no interest. Somewhere, someone, maybe several, are seething. They are so far, invisible, and it’s not due to censorship."
2020-02-16 14:28:29,"The most important takeaway here is that the Chinese government’s approach to governing made this disaster more likely to happen and then greatly hampered the fight against it. Even now, based on Xi’s recent pronouncements, its decisions are being made based primarily on the government’s rather than the people’s interest.

The exact same thing happened with a different disaster, presided over by a different authoritarian government: the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the USSR in the 1980s, as hauntingly portrayed in the recent HBO miniseries “Chernobyl”. President Gorbachev later stated his belief that the government’s actions as the crisis unfolded ultimately contributed to the downfall of the USSR itself, by removing the last shred of doubt among its citizens that the government cared more about safeguarding its image than their well-being.

The problem in one way may be even more pernicious in the US than in China or the former USSR. The level of skepticism that develops in people involuntarily force fed lies does not exist in the subset of the population in a country that voluntarily subjects itself to being propagandized. The recent words from Trump’s former Chief of Staff General John Kelly should I think serve as a stark warning: “ you have to be careful about what you are watching and reading, because the media has taken sides. So if you only watch Fox News, because it's reinforcing what you believe, you are not an informed citizen."""
2020-02-15 20:39:31,"John Barry's book on the Spanish Flu (The Great Influenza) is a sobering read.  Barry writes that the Spanish Flu started in the United States, and the medical experts in the government recognized the risks and made all the right recommendations.  Those recommendations were ignored by President Woodrow Wilson, who thought canceling war bond rallies or pausing training that crammed infected troops together would endanger the war effort.  As a result, the flu spread world wide. Wikipedia says that 500 million people were infected and between 17 and 50 million died.  One should thus be a bit cautious in saying 19th century political leadership on virus containment  is a problem in China when 20th century political leadership in the US on the same issue was woeful."
2020-02-16 13:39:10,"To anyone who is, or would be, a student of China I suggest a read of Yang Jisheng's book ""Tombstone.""  It's a look at 1950's China when +35 million citizens died of starvation directly attributed to inept ideological strictures of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party).  

You read the book and I guarantee that you will not be surprised by anything you see going on there today.  After all, the same political party is in place.  In fact I'd all but guarantee many of the VERY SAME PEOPLE who were around then are still within it, in powerful positions, today.  There is no such thing as aging out within that party.

The Middle Kingdom has always been a top down, hierarchically structured society.  In fact one could argue that theirs was the first bureaucratic State, put in place to tame the Yang Tze river.  It's a system that has its limitations, but overall it has worked well for them for some 2 thousand years.  I don't see them changing it, and quite frankly I get the ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" logic they often express.  

But the CCP is a malignancy within that structure.  A metastatic growth intent on retaining its grip on power at all cost.  It does not suffer any other type of competitive organizational structure due to irrational fear.  A fear increasingly well founded; because sooner or later the average Chinese citizen will realize that the only way to cure such cancer is to entirely cut it out.  So watch out when this begins to happen.

2020-02-16 13:04:28,"This coronavirus epidemic has reached a critical juncture. The story is too big for the Chinese government to cover up. Though the Chinese official reports including its claims that its control efforts are succeeding the truths are otherwise. Once praised by the World Health Organization and its scientists worldwide for the quick and transparent response to this new virus, China now faces international vilification and domestic unrest. the continued cover-ups, repression and lies have failed to stop the virus."
2020-02-16 14:06:49,"It's a shame Xi can't see that providing a unified, international approach to health crises emanating from China would bolster his image as a leader and technocrat. Instead, he puts his mediocrity and base political instincts on full, deplorable, display."
2020-02-16 05:18:35,"Mr. Kristof:

I find this China bashing gratuitous and cynical.

According to The Economist, the punishment Dr. Li received from his dimwitted tormentors was a rebuke: They made him promise to never do it again. That’s it. Dr. Li was never jailed, beaten, fined, nor professionally sanctioned. Had he not gotten sick, he would have been able to continue practicing ophthalmology.

Dr. Li acquired the virus that ultimately killed him from an asymptomatic 82 year old glaucoma patient. Because she was not ill, neither she nor he wore a mask. No one, not even Dr. Li, knew at the time that the virus could be transmitted by asymptomatic people. It took a while to figure that out.

Had Dr. Li been persistent in making his concerns known via official medical channels instead of blindsiding his bosses by posting them on WeChat, he very likely would have been treated differently. Blindsiding your boss under any circumstances is a sure fire way to get into trouble anywhere, including in the USA.

While Dr. Li’s death was indeed tragic, is an exaggeration to claim that he was abused by the Chinese authorities or that their negligence caused his death.

The US healthcare system would be very hard pressed to react as focused, coordinated, and resolutely as the Chinese have.

As you should know well, Chinese culture is very hierarchical, paternalistic and authoritarian. They are not going to change a system that has brought them unprecedented progress over the past 40 years.

Give it a rest."
2020-02-15 21:01:18,""" 'I spoke with President Xi,' Trump said, 'and they’re working very, very hard, and I think it’s going to all work out fine.' ""

These folks exemplify brave, principled, patriotic. They are acting on behalf of the wellbeing of their fellow citizens, at unimaginable personal expense. They know all too well what the repercussions will be, and yet they persevere. Their ideals and values are precisely the ones we once championed, before January 2017. Our own present administration is also inept, superficial, corrupt, secretive, dishonest. Their response to Puerto Rico after the hurricanes was incompetent and racist. Our own leader has created his own white nationalist personality cult. One difference is, the Chinese people can see through the machinations of their own leader. I don't find it strange at all to hear our summer soldier and sunshine patriot parroting the words of their autocrat. I feel great sadness for these brave people and their families. Speaking up means prison and torture for the speaker, and poverty and persecution for their families."
2020-02-16 01:03:08,I am still waiting for a NYT columnist to write about what the US response would be if and when the new coronavirus lands and spreads in the US. Would the US with its « medical care for the lucky ones » system and its anti-« socialism » stance be able to institute policies of containment and universal treatment of a deadly coronavirus pandemic? I strongly doubt the US would fare better than China.
2020-02-16 03:58:54,"It is definitely appropriate to substitute Trump for Xi in condemning the Chinese leader, and your comments on Trump's ""strangeness"" in using Xi's talking points is to be expected of Trump. Trump has acted like a dictator ever since he came in to office. His MO (Method of Operating) is very similar to Xi's. He rules the country the same way any dictator rules. His goals and demands are loyalty is to himself, not to the welfare of the country. He holds himself above the law. He covers up facts that reflect badly on him to the detriment of our democracy. He lies to make himself look good. He admires dictatorial rule--he wants to have it. He admires dictators--he wants to be like them. He thinks HE is all three branches of our government--tells the legislative and the judicial branch what to do and says he ""has every right to do so.""  (He is clueless to the checks and balances in the Constitution.) In his view of the world ""HE IS THE ONE.""  ""ONLY HE CAN DO IT RIGHT.""  In reality he is also CLUELESS."

Here’s an example of trump’s ignorance. He did not know about Pearl Harbor. Gen. Kelly, trump’s Chief of Staff  had to tell him about the Japanese sneak attack. 
If his knowledge of world events is so shallow, we are in a lot of trouble if a world crises comes our way."
2020-02-16 12:59:28,"For humanitarian reasons and because what happens in China affects the well-being of people in America and in countries around the world, we must care about the mishandling of the coronavirus tragedy.

It is the great misfortune of the Chinese people to have the self-promoting President Xi in charge at this critical juncture, just as it is America’s misfortune to have President Xi’s foolish enabler, Donald Trump, as our head of government.

The Chinese military props up President Xi and conducts cruel and lethal campaigns to punish dissenters, but in the United States our military cannot be blamed for the dangerous regime of President Trump.

The ignorant and corrupt Trump administration, in spite of being propped up by Attorney General Barr, the Republican leaders of the Senate and a narrow majority of our Supreme Court, is immediately vulnerable to the will of the people through a free press and our voting booths. 

We have only ourselves to blame if Donald Trump is allowed to continue to wreak havoc."
2020-02-16 14:41:39,"Mr. Kristof,
Your reply to Kenan Porobic, I believe, misses the point and irrelevant to the comment.  The fact is that the U.S. military budget has increased very year and is now at more than $770B is insane.  You don't need this kind of budget to carry out some of the military actions you described as justified in your reply.  Coupled with the fact that the U.S. maintains over 700 military bases around the world, the only rationale for this is that the U.S. wants to be the most dominantly hegemonic and most militarily powerful nation on earth regardless of the decimate of the American middle class, stagnant wages, lack of affordable health care, child care, third world infrastructure, opioid epidemic, income inequality and countless other issues in the U.S. domestically. 
The point of Porobic's comment is that these trillion of dollars were wasted and the tragedy is that the U.S. keeps spending more and ordinary Americans and the world are paying a very high price for this arrogance and ignorance."
2020-02-16 14:49:13,"Thank you for this fair and accurate description of the Chinese state and dilemma.  The comments overwhelmingly provide evidence of the epidemic facing America, Trump Derangement Syndrome.  That so many people could read your fine article and convert it into a diatribe against Trump shows how biased and reflexive those who claim to be objective analysts of human activity have become."
2020-02-15 21:18:37,"We have two far deadlier, intractable, chronic epidemics in the United States. Both continue unabated as a result of a toxic stew of regressive politics and government policy, propaganda and corporate greed: 

1. Over 30,000 deaths per year, and tens of thousands more serious, permanent injuries from gunfire, including homicides, suicides and accidents that affect everyone from infants to the elderly.

2. Addiction to opioid drugs, with a similar number of deaths from drug overdose and tens of thousands more lives destroyed by ongoing addiction, with related loss of productivity, domestic violence, suicide and crime.

This may not exonerate the Chinese government from its boneheaded response to the coronavirus outbreak; but I’ve heard it said those who dwell in glass houses should refrain from hurling stones."
2020-02-16 13:41:41,"Chinese scientists did not sequence the virus’s DNA, as it is an RNA virus that replicates without a DNA intermediate.  Chinese scientists created a cDNA copy of the viral genome, then sequenced that.

Look at Xi, look at Putin. These are the leaders that Trump admires (dare I say envies)?

With our healthcare system that's based on making money for the CEOs, those who have no health insurance will be doomed to die without medical help.   If such a disease were break out here, we'd have more deaths than the Chinese do now. We'd never be able to quarantine our individualist populace, and that individualist populace would not have access to hospitals. And, with the Trump administration, and Republicans in general, wanting to rid the US of Obamacare and, God forbid, give healthcare to ""illegals"", we'd be doomed.

If this outbreak  had occurred in the US the traditional disaster story arc would have been followed including a heaping helping of the ""heroes"" of the story bravely addressing the challenge. There is no shortage of those in China the volunteer doctors, nurses and health professionals flocking to Wuhan oblivious of risk to help in the situation. Ordinary citizens helping to build the new hospitals, delivering food to the quarantined. And yes heresy of heresy Chinese government officials from cities across China ""twining with cities in Hubei to help get them the resources and support they need. The list is endless. But if your goal is hammering China and its system you like the ever loyal on the geopolitical level US media inflate the negative and ignore the positive. Nothing new in the wider context of the NYT's feverishly, some would say panicky, constant negative China coverage but more than a bit sad to see them going so low as to take advantage of crisis like this to score cheap geopolitical propaganda points by distorting the news of a challenge no government or people could handle smoothly.

But, the idea that American are really more free is laughable. The genius of the ruling elite in America is that they have managed to convince Americans that they are getting what they wanted, what they voted for,  that they are free. Never mind that what they get is not in their best interests. And the tool that they wield so effectively is, of course, fear. So, in the Land of Freedom and Wealth , we incarcerate more people than any other nation, we bomb and destroy countries without justification, we torture, we have no sick days, we elected Trump. But it's fine, it's better, it's democracy, the people have spoken! Laughable. 

I have been perplexed by how much Americans, left or right, loathe China. How important it is to imagine  Chinese citizens as slaves yearning for American freedom. I think  I understand. If they are more successful at anything, lowering mortality, improving standard of living, it threatens our mental house of cards. It would be worse if average Chinese citizens could actually enjoy their prosperity instead of serving as beasts of burden to enrich a brutal elite(you know writing this makes me think of another country).

This is especially true in China where the deal is no say in governance, high levels of obvious corruption (more than we have here) in exchange for raising living standards.  2. A few billion people in mass panic would/will be very very ugly.

2020-02-16 04:24:16,"@James Ricciardi ""That situation is not as bad as the one which prevails in the US under Trump.""

Right on!  It continues to amaze me how many comments here extol the virtues of US democracy when there is ZERO democracy in the US and healthcare is a national disgrace and being made even worse the Trump and the entire GOP.  In fact the US has become so corrupt and so racist that Trump is now a dictator and has already destroyed the Constitution, the rule of law and democracy.  He and Barr have totally corrupted the Justice Department, selectively absolving criminals who are Trump's friends, and targeting Trump's perceived enemies for prosecution.  This makes America the richest banana republic in history!

""Trump's social media policy which is 21st century.""

Yes, social media is Trump's 21st Century propaganda machine and coupled with Faux Noise the US now has a world-class propaganda machine that rivals the one in Russia.  Trump uses social media for all it's worth (and so did the Russians on Trump's behalf in 2015) and he uses it to distract, to spread malicious lies and to fan the flames of racism, hate and division.

Trump is a walking Molotov cocktail and it was those Americans so full of hate who decided to vote for him so that he could destroy America for them.  Trump is doing exactly what they wanted."
2020-02-16 15:20:23,Not at all strange to hear Donald John Trump repeating the Xi talking points. It’s what he does as he wants the same ridiculous adulation.
2020-02-16 15:39:57,I am more worried about the Hepatitis A coverup by the Florida Health Department. Last year three people died within 5 miles of me and they said “wash your hands”. Even though the Sheriff offered to help they did not investigate. This year the paper says someone died in December or January but the Health people say privacy laws keep them from saying anything. At least China admits people died. The Patriots owner sex scandal is covered in excruciating Ken Starr detail but they won’t do anything or admit anything about a deadly disease.
2020-02-16 15:45:49,"Perhaps this reflects the present divide in this country, but my reaction to this story was it demonstrated clearly why communism and its little brother socialism are failed systems.  Then I read the comments and it is all about Trump, his cutting of CDC budget or his call with President Xi that "" it will all work out fine"".  What would  you have him say, that it is hopeless and we are all going to die?  He has to be positive in order not to create a panic.  And cutting the CDC budget or any government service does not mean you want the unchecked spread of virus.  It simply means that our government needs trimming and that the solution to all problems is not necessarily more money.  Which brings me to a final point, Sanders the leading Democratic candidate is the socialist candidate and a takeover of all of our healthcare by Medicare for all.  In light of coronavirus, do you think that is a solution or a problem?"
2020-02-15 21:27:06,"Mr. Kristof,

We have a virulent diseases in the United States and too
many people are remaining silent.
We have the diseases of hatefulness, corruption, dishonesty and immorality and it has infected our government from the president to cabinet to republican party. These diseases are rapidly destroying our democracy, our morality, our world standing.

There are many people who know what is happening and should be speaking out -- and some have bravely told the truth like Lt. Col. Vindman, Fiona Hill, Marie Yovanovitch.
They did this at peril or discrimination, harassment and bodily harm to them or their family. 

Where are the others who should be screaming the truth?
John Bolton how can you be silent - to sell your book?
John Kelly you waited a long time to say very little.
All republicans - you know the full truth and you are silent.

So there is no cure for this dangerous illness destroying our democracy until people who  know the truth start telling all the know. Sadly, these people are all cowards and our country is on its way authoritarianism.

So, Mr. Kristof your message about the lies and dangers from Chinese government is completely applicable to the lies and dangers from our government.

Besides translation into Chinese, publish it on Fox news and Breitbart and put a copy in every Republican's mailbox."

I for one will go back to bed knowing that there is absolutely no chance that anyone in America will contact the coronavirus.  And just like climate change, impeachment and the Mueller Report, it is just another Chinese witch hunting for a hoax."

I'd rather look at the black and white Of American politics and think 

So you can accuse China of being a fascist country but what do you say to our own politics

The Justice Department and the president endorsing criminals and persecuting patriots

Does this bring us back to the fascist government of Germany and Italy of the 1930s , 

Does this lead us to the end of the Roman empire and beginning of the imperial empire in Rome.  

 The same things that happened in Greece during the Peloponnesian war are now occurring in America ---Athens did many of the same things with populous governments, where the leaders were not educated  and using populist movements 

Which caused the end of the Athenian Empire until now-- it is not recovered"

2020-02-16 13:08:40,"Thank you for showing us the roadmap for our future under the Democrats.  We have seen throughout history that when you give the government too much power, inevitably somebody uses that power to take away basic rights from its citizens (China, Soviet Union, Cuba, Venezuela,North Korea, Nazi Germany, etc.,etc.).  Is is not ironic that the same people who are complaining about Donald Trump's abuse of power want to give the same US government massively more power, including running our healthcare and our energy industry and controlling what is ""truth"" in political advertising.  Just look at China today and you can see exactly where that will take us."

2020-02-15 21:14:38,"There is now a headline here on the NYT website asserting that Xi knew about the corona virus almost two weeks before acknowledging it publicly.

Many of his countrymen are in revolt and call out the government for its ineptitude.  Unable to criticize hm by name, they substitute our president's name for Xi's. 

The parallels to our own government are legion.  And if and when COVID-19 gets a foothold in America, the outcome will be nearly the same and the underlying ineptitude of our government will be laid bare (again).

In the way most of the world only deals with emergencies and crisis, not in true and systematic planning, most countries would display the same behavior as the Chinese government. The USA also mishandled the AIDS epidemic. The USA also treats whistle-blowers very badly.

This is a country whose leadership cannot be trusted to say or to do the right thing.  Does that sound familiar?

2020-02-16 17:34:49,"It's difficult to know whether the corona virus is really more severe than a normal virus because there is no way to get accurate numbers of cases. Undoubtedly many people do not go to the doctor. However, recently it was reported that 1700 healthcare workers had contracted the virus and of those 1700, 6 had died. For this group the death rate was 0.3%, which is more that what occurs for a normal influenza, but not that much. This suggests that the fear surrounding this virus are really not based on rational information. 

I suppose, the governments and their corporate owners are really worried about what it will do to the economy. They can't stand any money getting away from them."

2020-02-16 03:01:40,"Xi Jinping and Donald Trump are both as much exemplars of the vagaries of winning the human genetic daddy lottery as is Queen Elizabeth II.

Xi is the princeling son of a Chinese Long March legend father who was raised then purged by Mao Zedong before being resurrected by Deng Xiaoping. 

Xi Jinping once led a collective term limited leadership before he proclaimed the Mandate of Heaven  of a Chinese Emperor and the Cult of Personality of Chairman Mao Zedong to reign and rule until his natural death.

Xi is the first Chinese leader since Mao Zedong whose thoughts are deemed worthy of study by members of the Chinese Communist Party and the first Chinese Core Leader since Deng Xiaoping. 

Because Xi has no political nor governing peers he can only punch down and look cowardly and weak by blaming underlings and/or make his collective former partners like Premier Li Kejianq and Foreign Minister Wang Yi run and speak interference for him.

Donald Trump was the second son of a New York City real estate baron daddy whose wealth saved him from his sustained serial business bankruptcies and defaults. Trump played a successful businessman on reality TV. 

But the coronavirus is a lot smarter and wiser than both men. While sharing the innate inability of both men to express and show any humble human empathy for any of their fellow human beings fears of coronavirus and to effectively deal with it."

Although Xi is able to render brave dissidents like Professor Xu “incommunicado,” which Trump cannot do (yet), Trump is able to use the power of the presidency to lie, insult and fire his opponents and harness the right wing media to treat demonstrable facts as “fake news.”

Sure, things in the United States are far from perfect.  But unlike Chinese citizens, we in the US can vote every two years to change our leaders; we are free to travel anywhere we like; we are free to speak our minds, organize ourselves to protest, and have unlimited access to information from around the globe; we are not surveilled by central state authorities, and our freedoms are not limited willy nilly on the basis of whether or not those authorities perceive our behaviour as hostile to the state.  

In other words, we here in the USA are not born into a totalitarian system of government.

Most importantly, the United States is, has been and will remain a beacon of hope to people around the world who are looking for a better life.  Foreigners seem to have a FAR better sense of our political system and the opportunities we enjoy to change our elected representatives and laws.

2020-02-16 03:18:50,"I have no argument with any of the points made by Mr. Kristof.

However, I should like to comment on one misconception: 
Mr. Kristof cites an open-access peer-reviewed article in Viruses 
<a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/3/210"" target=""_blank"">https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/3/210</a>
 from about a year ago predicting the outbreak and various hot spots. 

Does Mr. Kristof think that politicians anywhere, anytime, will relate to such articles quickly and efficiently. Note the rapid timeline of publication of the journal article. Governments can barely sneeze that fast. Even if picked up in the Chinese scientific community and accepted, and that is always a question and takes time, governments tend to act slowly on journal publications (if at all). 

All governments should have a greater connection to what goes on and is published in the scientific world, but the speed there is beyond the ken of politicians.

I do not write this as an apologia for the Chinese; they screwed it up enough even without this, just to put things in perspective."

2020-02-16 18:05:25,"Are we that much better? I recall that some years ago, at North Carolina State University, a professor who called attention to an infectious agent was roundly condemned by the political authorities, personally abused, and maybe fired. (I don't recall all details; I think the germ was some type of listeria.) Ultimately she was proven correct and her work was accepted, but it took a long time. 

These abuses will happen anywhere that people in power feel threatened; they aren't limited to the evil Communists, though we like to gloat that they are."
2020-02-16 18:10:01,"I think it's worth nothing that many Chinese came to accept their lack of liberty and freedoms so as to insure safety and order.  I think they perceived it as a social contract of some type.  We'll keep out opinions to ourselves.  We'll do as you say, without question.  You keep us healthy and safe.  The Coronavirus has shown that the government is not really holding up their end of the bargain.  I think that Chinese citizens are realizing now, that just as Ben Franklin once suggested;  'those that give up liberty in the name of safety will probably lose both and deserve neither.'   

I mention this here, now, because it seems to me that many Americans are going down this very road now*.  Giving up essential rights - theirs and/or others - for the illusion of safety.   trump was elected on this premise and will continue to sell this vision in 2020.

2020-02-15 23:53:34,Is this not the entire history of humanity in a nutshell. A true hero and humanitarian like Li Wenliang does exactly what the whole world would hope and pray one would do given both his knowledge and compassion. In a sane world he would have immediately been listened to; and many lives would have been saved from this horrible disease. Of course we don`t. live in a sane world; do we?! No; instead of doing the right thing; Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist government silences and punishes him for making China look bad; and raising fears that some horrible outbreak in their midst was posing a major health risk to China and beyond. Politics; not humanity; as usual rules the day. Some time in the future I have no doubt the entire planet will be caught up in some wildfire outbreak like this; where WHO and all the true heroes will be ignored and silenced by some stinking political agenda; and millions and millions will die just like the 1918 Spanish Flu; simply because of insane and evil political agenda that refuses to admit such truth and immediate danger to humanity; because it is inconvenient to some idiot named Xi; Trump; or whoever is in power and wants to hide facts and truth until it is too late. The world may have gotten lucky this time. It seems the worst may have past. Next time we may not be so lucky unless morons in power listen to a hero like Li Wenliang.

In a less ominous fashion I also see different political parties show up here as well.

This is an article/opinion piece about how China, a totalitarian government, dealt with the opening stages  of a possible pandemic virus. Comments that switch the conversation to the US are ahead of schedule and suspect. There will be time to discuss Trump's bumbling in the coming months.

The Corona virus is out of the bottle, human nature pulled the cork. Talk about falling life expectancies in the states and rising in China are based snapshots in time.

It’s worth a reference in the same context to the plight of Hong Kong and Taiwan. The thought that the  world might acquiesce in allowing this oafish communist tyranny to prevail in these two territories is monstrous.

As the Climate Crisis worsens, it's predicted we'll be seeing more and more of these worldwide diseases for which there'll be no previous inoculation, so it would be most prudent of the new administration next year to provide funding for the department meant to handle these threats. Yet one more imperative reason to vote Trump out."
2020-02-16 18:12:38,None of what China has done should surprise anyone. China is a totalitarian state that controls every aspect of  its citizen’s lives—think Big Brother in 1984. The ruling communist party must always put on  a good face for its citizens and the rest of the world.

Seven decades ago, our world came to the brink of nuclear annihilation over something incredibly stupid - the best path toward the just and fair society.

There were two trajectories, one from the very right and the other from the very left.

One started from the oligarchic capitalism without any worker rights or social benefits. The other originated from the Stalinist dictatorship.

Both sides have been improving over the decades. 
The capitalism added the Social Security programs, Medicare and Medicaid in the thirties.

Tito’s socialism ended the state ownership of corporations and replaced it with the social one. It chose independent way forward without alliance to Moscow by creating the non-aligned movement.

America responded by allowing the worker pension funds to be invested into the corporate ownership, thus basically having those be socially owned in some way.

In the meantime, both the USSR and Yugoslavia collapsed. Beijing promptly adjusted its course.

The socialism in China added the market economy and private corporate ownership.

Now there are the strong attempts in America to dismantle the critical social safety net after the end of Cold War.

Suddenly the Scandinavian countries have grabbed the lead in this race.

We don’t need the wars to decide the outcome but the decades of peaceful evolution."

But none of us here can afford to be smug for what the Chinese leadership is doing is not much different from what the Trump administration is doing to our country. Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, William Barr and Donald Trump are quite comfortable with the tactics and approaches used by the Chinese government.

I wouldn't be surprised if the Chinese people rose up and overthrew their oppressive overlords, maybe setting off a chain reaction around the globe. 

When the Black Death swept through Europe in the middle of the 14th century, it was this factor that ultimately caused the unraveling of the feudal system and the rise of capitalism.

Prominent US doctors and news organizations have promoted a narrative that covid-19 is similar to flu and that the majority of cases are mild. Recent data from Singapore disproves this. 

Singapore has a very modern and well resourced health care system and they are aggressively tracing contacts of known cases. It is unlikely they would miss mild cases unless those cases don't save symptoms.

Singapore currently reports 75 cases, of which 5 (6.7%) are in critical condition in the ICU. Influenza only sends 1.7% of cases to hospital, of which only a fraction enter the ICU. This data proves that covid-19 is far more lethal than influenza, contrary to the claims of prominent US doctors and media organizations. 75% of SIngapore cases remain hospitalized.

2020-02-14 14:34:17,"I’m not sure what the point of this article is. I don’t see anyone panicking about the Coronavirus. People are still going to work and school, going shopping, eating at restaurants, exercising at gyms, etc. However, many people are rightly concerned about this new and emerging threat, which is still poorly understood. The scientists at the CDC and WHO have been clear that it is still far too early to determine how much of a risk the virus poses to the US population, so the author has no empiric basis for his thesis that the public is miscalculating the risks associated with this viras. At this point the risks remain unknown. The outbreak in China provides a vivid example of how badly things could go in other countries, although this is not a foregone conclusion. Prudence dictates vigilance and early preparation in the face of emerging threats."
2020-02-14 14:44:31,"Firstly, it is worthwhile distinguishing individual from government responses. Secondly, it is helpful to distinguish risk from ambiguity. Thirdly, risk of an activity is always to be measured against the benefits from that activity.

Governments cannot respond to the flu as they can to coronavirus because the flu is already widespread and mutates from season to season. In contrast, governments can respond aggressively to prevent the epidemic from becoming a pandemic

The risk of a disease it really threefold: risk of contracting it, the mortality rate, and the effects on different individuals. We don’t yet know any of these with much certainty — that is ambiguity. If the mortality rate is somewhere between that of the flu and 20 times, that is potentially highly lethal. What are the mortality rates for children or the elderly, or for the normally healthy for whom the flu is a weeklong inconvenience of binge-watching?

And never measure risk by absolute numbers of deaths, but by frequency. Dog bites are more common than shark attacks but which do you want to play with? Dog bites are more common from, the most common breeds.

There is no rational basis to fear contracting coronavirus in New York Chinatown. But there is in Hong Kong or Shanghai, where cases have been reported and the population density and use of public transport facilitate exposure opportunities"
2020-02-14 14:50:31,"The concerns about the Coronavirus are as much related to its apparently high infectiousness as they are to its lethality. High infectiousness could lead to a very rapid exponential spike in cases if containment fails, and could overwhelm our preparations for events like this. Flu season in the ER is bad enough, this could break systems and force emergency measures. 

Talking about human irrationality seems to always be a welcome topic in the press, and it is an interesting counterpoint to rational choice theory. But, in this case, minimizing the need to vigilance and preparedness in the face of this epidemic (very possibly soon to be a pandemic) sends the wrong message. We don't know where COVID-19 will end, or where the next outbreak like it may occur. Fear can prompt us to act, to better fund the missions of the CDC and WHO, and take infectious disease and epidemiological research more seriously."

2020-02-14 14:37:05,"Accuracy on the facts is important when dealing with a public health crisis. This article does not clearly state the level of uncertainty with the statistics cited within it. The mortality rate is a moving target. The number diagnosed is changing as diagnostic criteria evolve. R0, the replication rate, has not settled. Proclamations from CDC have ranged from this having potential to be a broad pandemic to something that may constrained. We just don’t know yet. While the principles of the article are true, it implies that coronavirus is lower risk than flu when it’s too premature to make that conclusion. It’s the wrong time for this article."

And this despite strict quarantine measures? Do you think there's something special about Hubei province which makes it so deadly there but not everywhere else? 

When you show me photos of hospitals in a province overwhelmed with the sick and dying with dead piling up in hallways because of the flu, I'll believe the coronavirus is on the same level as the flu. Until then I'll continue to believe that this new virus is in fact much more deadly than the flu...and this especially since the early evidence is that it also spreads much more easily than the flu on top of the higher mortality rate (just look at the cruise ship where its spreading despite everyone being locked in their rooms....)"

Each passing day, the NYT for instance, was reporting that the number of cases first was skyrocketing, then that many more cases were being diagnosed, that previously had gone undetected. Then came reports of clusters of infection, far removed from Wuhan.

Generally, the picture being painted in the press was that the virus was spreading at alarming rates and uncontrollably.

As a sole reader, we are left to interpret the reporting with very limited information. And thus we start to extrapolate. And exaggerate the threat. Both in terms of severity and numbers.

And eliciting reactions of fear and panic."

With the small amount of information we have, i.e. how quickly it spreads, the ""reported"" death rate among the ""reported"" cases, my brain is definitely telling me it's a serious danger.
If the US were to have the same spread rate as China, the devastation would be hard to imagine."
2020-02-14 15:01:57,"This article leaves out one important component is assessing risk - the understanding of how society and government will react to a real danger. For example, I worry about nuclear power because the nuclear industry has a terrible record in preventing and responding to disasters and has consistently been dishonest about potential risks, while there has been - at least until Trump took office - a record of  effective government response in reducing air pollution.  Same with climate change - I would be  less worried about it if there were any signs that governments were willing to honestly confront the problem. The signals from the Trump that he ignores science , doesn't care about the public interest, doesn't want to fund health services, and reacts impulsively do nothing to reduce perhaps unwarranted fears about the coronavirus."
2020-02-14 15:02:44,"I am an actuary, so I suppose I am less emotional about risk.

The actual economic and societal threats are really quite modest (see the U.S. national assessment, which documents only a few percent cut in FUTURE growth).   Yet it is being framed as a terrible existential threat, with a highly emotional reaction.  Perceived and actual risks are very different."
2020-02-14 15:08:55,"It's surprising the author does not note in detail the role that 24/7 media coverage plays in intensifying people's perceptions of dread and danger.

As Jen in the Comments indicates, there is good reason for television in particular to highlight the latest outbreak. If the majority of people who get the virus recover -- why no stories about that side of the issue rather than more scary deaths and new locations of coronavirus popping up?

Just as the omnipresence of Trump spreads his despicability on our screens, so the hyper-coverage of the new virus increases our fear and anxiety. Yes, we can turn off the television, not read the articles. But that's no longer the way the world works -- and media, knowing that, profits from the kind of research into our psychology Mr Fisher includes here."
2020-02-14 15:09:13,"A few case histories of the mild cases would go far in relieving anxiety.  There are actually very few published articles describing the course of the disease.   I have seen only one article where someone described the illness (stayed home with the flu and coughed a lot - lasted a week from onset to no symptoms).

There should be enough people who have recovered to generate a few news articles."
2020-02-14 15:03:27,"Yes, the emotional impact of scary images is a factor. However, there’s a logic to it. If flu is so deadly, why are people near people w the flu wearing hazmat suits? Why isn’t everything being sprayed down w disinfectant? Why aren’t people w the flu dragged off to quarantine? Why aren’t cruise ships with flu victims under quarantine? And I could go on. From the images one could easily infer that COVID-19 is more dangerous than the flu (and that we’re not getting the whole story). Both emotion and inductive reasoning are in play re fear of COVID-19."

2020-02-14 14:28:36,"Um, maybe.

Comparisons between the flu and the coronavirus, one a well-known quantity with a vaccine that people can get to inoculate themselves for it, the other an exigent pandemic with no vaccine and an unknown fatality rate, neglect the fact that ""unknown"" poses a far greater risk than ""known"", both to the brain and in reality.

It's ironic that you chose to talk about our fears of flying when there are two plane crashes in quick succession.  Most of the world, including those involved in genuine risk assessment, and not trying to act more knowledgeable than the dumb reader, would agree that two very fatal crashes of the Boeing 737 Max in quick succession was fundamentally different than a statistical happening that would even out over time.

The fact that for an unknown quantity, the 737 Max's algorithm for preventing stalls, for example, we tend to rate risk far higher, is not an artifact of a badly programmed mind, but a well tuned assessment function that tells us that, unlike journalists and exasperated public health students, we should be worried about an unknown causing deaths in rapid succession.

The genuine concern about the coronavirus is not a fevered aberration.  Some of the internet-viral reaction to it is.  But people with far more experience in public health than your student do take threats seriously before they kill as many as the flu.  And that's a good thing."
2020-02-14 14:41:05,"OK, there are a lot of valid psychological issues.  But this article itself demonstrates that there's a lack of basic numeracy which seems to be just as important.  And addressing that would go a long way to dealing with the psychological issues.

The article begins by citing one person's frustrations with others who won't pay attention to the numbers, and the punch-line is supposed to be about the relative mortality rates of the flu and coronavirus.  But those rates aren't actually given, and the numbers that are given aren't enough to allow the reader to figure them out.

The mortality rates -- deaths per contraction of the disease -- are key to understanding how severe this disease is.  (One needs more information, too, of course, but this is the first number one wants to know.)  That they don't show up here seems to be an index of how little people think quantitatively.  I hope the NYT will improve its reporting in this regard."
2020-02-14 15:12:37,"The points about risk assessment on the part of individuals are valid, but that does not mean the response to the novel coronavirus is outsized. SARS, after all, was contained, saving countless lives. And as long as there is a chance that this novel coronavirus can also be contained, the public health measures and medical interventions that are being undertaken now are not disproportionate to the risk."
2020-02-14 15:14:39,"The reason people are so worried about 2019-nCov and not the flu is the uncertainty surrounding it. Influenza is a predictable seasonal virus that we develop a vaccine for each year. The Wuhan coronavirus has a currently indeterminable mortality rate, and the fact that people are quarantined immediately stirs up fear. The fear is, in my opinion, a bit overkill but it has some truth to it."
2020-02-14 15:15:16,"China is locking down cities of tens of millions of people, something unprecedented in public health history.

@60 million people are currently under travel restrictions in Wuhan and other nearby cities. To put that in perspective that is  roughly the combined populations of the states of New York and California.

I would say we are all in uncharted waters with regards to this virus."
2020-02-14 15:15:08,"The comparisons between the flu and COVID-19 are getting tiresome.  We have a vaccine for the flu and a pretty good idea of the risks and how to mitigate against them.  We don't know much about COVID-19.  It could end up being just another flu, but also appears to have the potential to be much, much worse, particularly given we probably won't have a vaccine anytime soon.  That potential is what fuels the anxiety.  I don't think the Chinese government would react the way it has if this was just another strain of flu. 

I'll try an analogy to look at risk.  Guns kill more people than nuclear weapons, does that mean we should worry more about gun violence than nuclear proliferation?  In a purely ""rational"" sense, yes.  You are obviously more likely to be killed by a gun than a nuclear weapon.  But if a nuclear weapon were to be detonated in NYC, DC, or any large US city, the consequences would be far worse than all of the gun violence in the last 40+ years combined.

Check out books like The Black Swan and Antifragile by Nassim Taleb for good discussion about comparing ""fat tail"" risks to regular risks."
2020-02-14 14:50:39,"How bad would a disease have to be for our government to lock down an entire state? Because that's essentially what China has done.  Perhaps it's not that people don't comprehend the statistics being given, but that they see those statistics are strikingly at odds with the actions being taken."
2020-02-14 15:11:54,"Another thought: We also all have a mental ""template"" for how this will play out. Every American has seen at least a couple of big-budget blockbuster thrillers - Contagion, Outbreak, Omega Man, 28 Days Later, a few of those ridiculous low-budget cable documentaries - that are about a global pandemic of deadly disease.

We have a narrative already in our heads, and the narrative starts with a disease jumping from animals to humans, the government hiding the problem, failed efforts at quarantine, talking heads on the news growing increasingly concerned, people fleeing the cities... They don't make movies about epidemics that burn themselves out harmlessly, so that's not a story we have handy in our heads."
2020-02-14 15:13:57,"I find this article patronizing. Show me who panicking in the US? The Chinese in Wuhan are panicking for good reason. As someone else mentioned, where are the epidemiologists in this article? Sure, for dinner talk a psychologist and student can joke about how people are overreacting to the virus. But the reality is that it is incredibly infectious. We hear about crematoriums running 24/7. We see people dying in hospital hallways. OK, so tell me, what is the real risk. The answer? We don't yet know."
2020-02-14 15:13:51,"Had to go look up the names for these fallacies, which differ depending on the source.  They are called the statistical fallacies of composition and division.  One assumes that what is true about the parts is true of the whole, the other assumes that what is true of the whole is true of the parts.

It is always best to remember these fallacies when reading something written about statistics by a journalist.

I wrote a comment already about the irony of Max Fisher using the example of two plane crashes in succession while Boeing reels from the 737 Max.

The fear when there are two quick crashes in succession stems, to put it succinctly, from the fear that they are comparable to the 737 Max -- that there is a reason why and that it is not a case of statistics producing a ""batting slump"".

An even better example is 4 plane crashes in quick succession on the morning of September 11, 2001.  Interpreting these as statistical noise would be, shall we say, fatal.

Unobvious application of the fallacy of division:  In general it's very safe to fly so go ahead and get on that 737 Max in the tropics. I shouldn't have worried where my friends were September 11th, just because they embarked from Logan at near the time of the attacks, planes are safe.

The concern (not the panic) over the coronavirus is legitimate. That it hasn't caused deaths like the flu isn't an indication of its capability, but it's lack of pervasiveness.  Doing real statistical analysis is hard, not easy, Mr. Fisher."
2020-02-14 15:16:42,"This is a thought provoking article. I consider my own behavior and that of those around me while thinking about the article; which is what I think the point is.  As a person who lives with an auto-immune disorder (MS-I can’t give it to anyone) I remain vigilant about, mainly washing my hands, using tissue, elbows, arms to open doors and use of my debit card vs. cash.  I recall Dr. Sanjay Gupta-CNN saying years ago that we need to stop using anti-bacterial soaps; we are creating our own superbug through the use of these products. I don’t get the flu shot, when I’m older maybe I will. Maybe. 
I, personally, think it is always wise to consider others before self, you are of little use to others if you are sick. If possible, stay home for 3 days and care fir yourself, thus reducing your exposure to others.  
Why do we think that ‘we’ are so important that our absence will somehow perhaps mean the downfall of others? 
Regarding our current political situation; it is of grave concern regardless of whose at the top. In my travels around this country and others, in order to remain the beacon of hope, freedom, prosperity and all that encompasses the ‘American Dream’, perhaps we take lessons from an era that many seem to want to go back to (the greatest generation) for lessons and values to move forward. Even then, we were fighting for the equality of our own citizens who are of a different skin color. So maybe not.
The human brain. It’s a crazy thing."
2020-02-14 15:19:10,"I’d like to hear more about the risk assessments from real experts, epidemiologists familiar with and involved in dealing with the current coronavirus epidemic/pandemic.

For example, the US has set up quarantine facilities at 11 US military bases located near major US airports that receive flights from Asia. Let’s hear more about the rationale for this from the people who have put these precautions in place. Are they dealing with possible, likely or worst-case scenarios? Are they being prudent or alarmist? What are their current assessments and projections for the epidemic?"
2020-02-14 15:20:21,"Three points. 

1. Interesting article and effective overview of how we assess danger and threats in ways that are not wholly rational — and which likely cannot be.

2. It is interesting to consider these observations about response to the threat of coronavirus and then imagine that we are instead considering how Americans respond to the threats posted by the current administration in Washington.

3. The gratuities quotes regarding the risks and benefits of nuclear power are unfortunate and superficial. For example, they fail to not the scale of the danger. While it is possible to propose, for example, that the Three Mile Island incident affected only a handful of people, it is not possible to say that about the Chernobyl Incident. The _stakes_ of an incident affect the risk assessment, not just the likelihood that some incident might occur."

2020-02-14 15:26:36,"Risk we can calculate. Uncertainty we cannot calculate. It is inherently incalculable. So, it seems to me, the fear of coronavirus is a rational one. I take the world's extraordinary efforts to control the outbreak to be based on this."
2020-02-14 15:28:30,"“We’re hearing about the fatalities,” he said. “We’re not hearing about the 98 or so percent of people who are recovering from it and may have had mild cases.”

True. Say the fraction who die are 49%. Do you feel better if I tell you ""The majority of people don't die. Here's one now. They look fine."" I think most of us would easily recognize that those aren't good odds. That most of the time we fall ill we don't have nearly even odds of dying. Our math sense gets a little worse when it becomes 2% chance of dying. But a moments thought says that's a really scary rate of death. At least for young and healthy individuals, the seasonal flu has nowhere near that death rate. So that may not turn out to be the actual death rate for this virus for young and healthy. But we don't know yet. It is worth a more careful analysis and consideration. I worry this article seriously failed in that regard and many folks may find its analysis very misleading."
2020-02-14 15:21:00,"Overall, lack of quantitative data about the dead, recovery and spreading rates (and easy to understand graphics) makes it hard to know for sure what is going on. NYTimes should create a consistent set of charts to help us make sense of what is happening.  

I bet the head of the CDC or WHO has access to such a basic set of tracking data.  

Raise the bar and start sharing it with everyone."
2020-02-14 15:24:46,"A virus becomes more dangerous the (a) higher its mortality rate is,  (b) the more contagious it is and (c) how quickly it mutates. We are still in very early days. All of these factors are unknown. Furthermore, these variables are not independent. For example, the more it spreads, the more chance it has to mutate. The more contagious it is, the more it can cripple health care resources and therefore dramatically increase mortality. Not really interested in a psychologist’s opinion on the topic. Stick to patronizing your readers with cliché biases about winning lotteries or air travel safety. I’ll be listening to epidemiologists."

2020-02-14 15:30:01,"fear as an emotion existed long before even basic mathematics. we respond to new threats worse, in part, because we generally understand we have already done something to mitigate old threats. What is left out of this fine examination of threat perception is the fact that electronic media providers use the emotions generated by fear to increase their viewership (ie. to sell soap).  If there is a local fire with video, it leads on the local evening news, as do stories of tornadoes in the midwest shown to people on the coasts. There must be some accountability for purveyors of news to responsibly turn down the inflammatory escalation of fears when they are unlikely, simply because the generate more viewers or hits."
2020-02-14 15:32:39,"The flu is known and understood. The coronavirus is not. This is an apples to oranges comparison when it comes to how we assess risk. Because the coronavirus is new and not yet well understood, it makes sense that feelings of panic are heightened. There are news reports that include statements about uncertainty about how the virus has spread in some people, so that's unsettling. In addition, because the virus is new and unfamiliar, we are getting information about it in real time, and it seems like that information gets worse every day. This raises the question, ""How much worse could it get?"" These feelings of uncertainty are all exacerbated by the fact that the epicenter of the outbreak is a country with a questionable record of transparency, which raises questions like, ""Is this worse than we even know?"" A simple comparison of mortality and recovery rates is a gross oversimplification."
2020-02-14 15:37:37,"Unlike neuroscience psychology isn't a science. 

Because there are too many variables and unknowns to craft the double-blind and/ or randomized controlled experimental tests that provide predictable and repeatable results.

Psychology is not even a medical arts and science field like psychiatry.

So far the biological genetic evolutionary fit reality is that coronavirus is a lot smarter and wiser than 7 4 billion African primate apes and their nation state leaders."
2020-02-14 15:37:55,"People are afraid because there is little known about the transmission of this disease, and because we are relying on biased and asymmetric information from governments that are more interested in minimizing panic and economic contagion. This scenario unfolding does not have normal risk distributions, an assumption that underlies what these psychologists are saying. The lack of transparency is asking the situation worse, and to suggest that extreme fear is irrational right now is unfounded."
2020-02-14 15:35:38,"Most informed people have assessed the risk and I don’t think anybody is freaking out except perhaps hypochondriacs who were going to anyways. The risk outside China appears to be low, but the situation is nonetheless alarming and the experts at the WHO and CDC seem to agree as much. Mr. Fisher and others who bring up the flu consistently forget to emphasize the fact that we have a vaccine for the flu. Antivaxxers concerned about coronavirus: that is irrational. Please direct efforts to critiquing them. Those of us who are already vaccinated for the flu are not in the crazy camp for being cautiously concerned about this. And let’s not ignore the fact that the Chinese government simply cannot be trusted to provide accurate information which adds to the uncertainty. As reported elsewhere the deaths reported by Beijing appear to match a perfectly simple and predictable mathematical formula. If true that is very concerning. We don't have the full picture because China won't allow it, all we know is SARS stats were surpassed in a matter of weeks and ""war time"" protocols are being implemented in China. Even if the global risk ends up being low, we're still left with the reality that a powerful state cannot be trusted to give accurate information to the world during a major health crisis. Where does that leave us if another outbreak in China poses an even bigger threat to the world? The concerns are more than just health-related."
2020-02-14 15:38:16,"The writer of this column should read some of the comments regarding the public's reaction to this virus. The risk isn't just the virus itself, but the bungling method an authoritarian government uses to manage the virus. It demonstrates how necessary it is to count on front-line employees at hospitals and in the government to deal properly with an unknown and contaigous disease. 

Look to my hometown, Everett, WA for that example. I sit at my breakfast table confident that this virus isn't being spread in an uncontrollable manner because the good people on the front lines in Everett did their jobs. My thanks to them!"

2020-02-14 15:38:46,"China has locked down and/or quarantined multiple cities with populations in the tens of millions, i.e., the size of New York City.  I have seen experts say that this could become a global pandemic, infecting 2/3's of the world's population.  If that happens those 2% fatal cases could add up after awhile.  

Not to mention the economic effects.  The virtual shutdown of major industrial centers in China is affecting the global supply chain, causing interruptions in factories in Korea and Europe as parts from China become unavailable.  

I agree with the overall thesis that we are bad at estimating risk, just not sure that a highly contagious disease with a long incubation period and a 2% fatality rate is a great example."
2020-02-14 14:47:13,"Comparing the COVID-19 epidemic to plane crashes and regular flu seasons is highly misleading, especially with quotes from Dr. Slovic such as ""We’re not hearing about the 98 or so percent of people who are recovering from it and may have had mild cases."" While there seems to be a 2% fatality rate (which is already worrying), the number of infected that require serious medical intervention and, possibly, life support is much higher than that.

While we're hearing from a public health student, a psychologist, and an economist, I notice the distinct lack of information in this article coming from epidemiologists. Wouldn't people who study disease and its spread for a living be best suited to give a statement on risk assessment for this outbreak?

By not including the opinions of doctors who work directly with viral diseases, the article itself seems susceptible to its own cognitive bias - that of optimism bias. We seem to still be in the early stages of the epidemic and, if it spreads worldwide and overloads medical facilities, there's a very good chance we'll see the Case Fatality Rate go up (due to a physical limitation on the amount of life support systems, respirator systems, etc. available in hospitals). If that happens and the disease becomes widespread, the deaths may dwarf annual flu deaths by an order of a magnitude.

Furthermore, it helps to remember that the Spanish Flu outbreak was also the flu. If anything, our bias is underestimating influenza as well."
2020-02-14 15:39:12,"Quite simply, we are relying upon the Chinese government to provide us with accurate figures on the effects of this virus. They have previously proven to be unreliable and tending towards massively under reporting the effects of illnesses (see, SARS). Why should we suddenly trust them now? 

This is especially true considering the government forced quarantine of millions of people - to the detriment of the Chinese economy. China's actions do not correspond with the notion that this virus is no worse than the common flu. Hopefully, the Chinese are overreacting in the manner set out in this article. Time will tell . . ."
2020-02-14 14:31:52,"Risk is inversely proportional to the amount of information you think you have about something. The less information, real or perceived, the greater the perception of risk. And false information is worse than no information which is typical of the age we are living in."
2020-02-14 15:19:23,"It’s true that humans misjudge risk all the time. It’s also true that coronavirus is a new threat on top of flu. If governments weren’t reacting the way they are, it would be spread across this country within a year, leading to possibly millions of deaths. 

How are we misjudging this as individuals? Those who keep bringing up the irrelevant statistics about flu are the ones who aren’t judging the risk correctly."
2020-02-14 15:30:15,"Your article contains very good points.  The Chinese government never lies nor would they intentionally suppress the free expression of facts and ideas.  And Donald Trump always tells the truth and never exaggerates about anything important in our daily lives.  Besides, Trump would only hire the “best” people.  And he reads a great deal so he knows everything, right?

The reality of the situation is that much is not known or understood.  It appears to be less lethal than SARS or MERS but how it might mutate is not known.  We know much about the basic flu and its prevention.  We can even develop vaccines for the flu in short order.  

Something about this virus has the Chinese government very nervous.  It would be helpful if they were more honest and open to outside assistance.  No wonder fear takes over."
2020-02-14 15:42:17,I'm simply going to say that in my 46 years on this planet I have never seen 3 major cities in a country like China fully quarantined (and bear in mind the figures were a lot smaller then)plus I believe either Hong Kong or Japan thinking of quarantining a large village. Also all countries dealing with this are wearing hazmat suits etc. How media keep saying it's like the flu is really really bugging me too. Flu kills less about 0.1% - this virus at the moment is at 2%. The maths is worrying to say the least. Plus you can get a vaccine for flu and people have some immunity to it. This virus is novel meaning no one has any immunity at all. Go work out why a lot of people have concerns!
2020-02-14 15:42:06,"Slovic rightly links the current hysteria to the availability heuristic (e.g. mis-perception of risks on Airplane due to news coverage).  Indeed, many more people have died of Influenza (and of car accidents) during the same time of the Coronavirus outbreak, and both examples are are currently greater threats than COVID-19.   

However, one massive point Slovic (and article author) have overlooked is that risk is being communicated very poorly.  

Everyday, the headlines show the number of new cases and the number dead.  Third grade math is all you need to see that your odds are not good if you get the virus (about 1 in 50 die).     You really have to pick apart the data to see that the risk is probably lower (evidence from kill rates outside of China indicate this), but most people don't have the time.  

Based on the facts being presented, hysteria seems a reasonable response.  

Isn't the bigger issue the poor communication about the numbers being presented?   Seems there would be much less hysteria if media did this."

2020-02-14 15:45:25,"Human threat perception is a pretty well-researched area.

In addition to basic innumeracy, emotions and memories shaped these perceptions, leading to either an overestimation or underestimation of actual risk.  The article gives a good high level explanation of this.

In addition, our sources of information about risk are typically biased.  High risk stories generate clicks and eyeballs, while low risk stories do not.  The media therefore give stories a high risk slant.

There are certainly unknowns with the actual mortality rate and speed at which COVID-19 spreads (I forget the term for that.).  In part, it’s still relatively early so we don’t have complete data sets. In part, we are dealing with a Chinese government that has a track record of falsifying data AND has multiple motives to understate the risk.

But the initial NYT coverage of COVID-19 accounted for this in part by showing a range of mortality/speed of infection, compared with other infectious diseases.  Even at the outer edge of the range, it doesn’t indicate a particularly high relative threat.

Should our medical experts continue to watch this closely? Yes.

Should Americans be overly concerned at this point?  Probably not."

98% have not recovered. Very roughly 2% have died and 3% have recovered. That leaves 95% of cases in hospital/quarantine for weeks, if not months. When health care systems become overwhelmed, as in Hubei, that guarantees that a portion of that 95% will get more sick through poor care, misdiagnosis and new illnesses picked up in the hospital/quarantine. 

Look at the Princess Cruise ship. Those passengers are trapped in everyone's worst fear of a quarantine - they are getting sick at a higher rate than the rest of the world because they are forced into quarantine with sick people.

What percentage of Americans can go into hospital for six to eight weeks and not go bankrupt? Imagine the constant anxiety of being in quarantine wondering if i. health insurance or the government will cover your care, ii. you will have a job when you get out, iii. whether you infected your frail parents, or iv. whether you infected your children, spouse, co-workers, etc. And the stigma when you emerge from hospital.

The government's necessary response to the disease and the treatment/quarantine of patients would likely cause more damage to people and our country than the actual disease itself.

Instead, readers' brains are bombarded with ebola, mass shootings, and other statistical fantasies."
2020-02-14 15:49:38,"Just because humans already suffer from one widespread and reoccurring illness that has persisted for centuries doesn't mean we should be cavalier about another newly emerging virus that could take hold and bedevil us for years to come.  Jumping on and containing this new  Coronavirus,  or SARS, MERS is the right approach.  No, we shouldn't all panic, but neither should we be nonchalant. Familiarity breeds contempt.  We've come to accept yearly outbreaks of influenza, some relatively mild, others extremely serious, because it's been around for centuries and the opportunity to eradicate it completely is long past.  Also, many people mistakenly believe they've had ""the flu"" when they had some other less severe  and less deadly illness, thus making it seem more benign. There is no such thing as the stomach flu, but I've heard many people claim they just had a bout of it.  Make no mistake, influenza is a serious scourge that claims thousands of lives every year. That means we should double our vigilance and whenever a new disease is identified take immediate and decisive action to stop it before becomes a permanent feature of our environment. That's what epidemiology is all about, and this article completely ignores this."

2020-02-14 15:48:52,Using flu statistics is not a good comparison with the new coronavirus because one can take steps to reduce the chances of contracting a potentially fatal case of influena - get vaccinated yearly!  There is no such vaccine at the moment for COVID-19
2020-02-14 15:52:13,"Certainly great points in this article, but every year a team of medical professionals comes to my place of employment and administers flu shots free of charge. 

During flu season, there are multiple reminders about how to prevent the spread of the flu. Medical professionals understand how the disease is spread. Medicine to treat the flu is readily available. 

Add the two points above to the fact that the outbreak of coronavirus is happening within a country that is not a democracy and actively censors its citizens ALL the time, not just when there’s an emergency. 

Influenza and this coronavirus have stark contrasts, particularly the lack of a vaccine and the lack of understanding of coronavirus in the medical community. 

I’ve been vaccinated for this year’s flu, and I know how to keep myself healthy during flu season, because I’ve been taught how to do that for the last 30  years. This article is patronizing."

Until I see that, perhaps, it is best to heed the advice in this article that fear and risk are what we perceive."
2020-02-14 15:58:53,"Actually the seasonal flus account for multiple viruses.  The influenza virus also comes in multiple strains.  The student combined the total for all flu deaths in a season.   This is not a very accurate way to look at it.  

The coronavirus is one strain.  Our governments are behaving appropriately to an unknown epidemic.  Factors like the ease of transfer and the risk of complications are not completely understood.  This virus is likely transferred as easy as any flu or cold, through particles in the air and contaminated surfaces.   For now the mortality rate could be as high as 2%.   Can you imagine if 20 people died for every 1000 people who contracted a communicable disease?  The likelihood of someone you know dying would be very high, if this is not contained.  

Psychological analysis is available after-the-fact.  It is not even relevant until the facts are in.  Perhaps it will turnout that the coronavirus poses no greater risk than the seasonal flu.   ...But we don't know that yet.   Epidemiology is its own fields, so you have to ask the right questions and be aware that hindsight is 20/20."
2020-02-14 16:00:08,"The article does not take into account the full spectrum of the ways in which we make decisions.  While it is reasonable and rational to weigh the probability of outcomes, there is also a theorem called ""minimize regret"" which essentially notes that when the probability of an outcome is low, but if it occurs the consequences are terrible, we will take steps to avoid that outcome that go beyond ignoring it's low probability.  While the risk of getting into an accident when renting a car is very low -- think, all those miles you've driven and never gotten into one -- the consequences of one, the potential costs and liabilities, are so great that we spend a little more to avoid that worst case.  Hence the strong reaction to the new virus - the chances are low, but the consequences of entering that low probability are awful."

This coworker complained ""it's just a virus"" and ""the media is making a big deal out of a routine flu."" 
The danger is that, as the number of cases and deaths grow, and if the disease should jump the shark and become a more serious threat than SARS, for example, my meat-headed coworker will continue to crow about how bad the media is, and not take heed, should corona become a more serious threat.

I’m not the only one who thinks the media, particularly headline writers, bear great responsibility for creating a feeling of panic. “Disturbing New Information about How Coronavirus Cam Spread” was a headline I saw that was about a report of a number of medical people infected by a single patient in an emergency surgery situation in the first few days of the outbreak before the medical people in Wuhan were aware if the virus, so no precautions were taken. Reading only the headline the impression is new unexpected transmission routes were involved, which was hardly the case."

2020-02-14 16:05:45,"Dr. Fisher writes:

""A classic example is airplane crashes. If two happen in quick succession, flying suddenly feels scarier — even if your conscious mind knows that those crashes are a statistical aberration with little bearing on the safety of your next flight. But if you then take a few flights and nothing goes wrong, your brain will most likely start telling you again that flying is safe. When it comes to the coronavirus, Dr. Slovic said, it’s as if people are experiencing one report after another of planes crashing...""

Am I the only reader who sees the flaw in the author's chosen example? Here's a hint:  Lion Air Flight 610 on October 29 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10 2019.

While history may well prove Dr. Fisher right, for the moment I'm more willing to assume the cautious approach advocated by WHO director, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, regarding the possible scope of Covid-19's reach.

But maybe Dr. Fisher knows more than the WHO. The answer to that question is above my pay grade."

I can tell you it is not as black and white as they make it sound.
2020-02-14 16:08:05,"The author leaves out the very real geopolitical inlfuences on the coverage of the coronavirus. In the system's competition the US and China are currently in any indicator that one ""system"" is superior to the other is latched upon by the rival's media systems. Given the coronavirus presents such an opportunity to Western, predominately US media, it is not surprising to see the current hair on fire coverage of the outbreak and very critical coverage of what China has and is doing to contain the virus in a very difficult situation that no nation no matter how developed is prepared for. Interestingly, assessments by the World Health Organization (WHO) which have, while recognizing the seriousness of the issue, praised China's efforts and repeatedly stated travel restrictions were not effective and even detrimental in cases, have seen very little coverage in the US because the WHO assessments run against the preferred ""Bad China"" narrative so important to the US for their current hearts and minds campaign being feverishly run on all fronts against the Chinese. 
The fact the Chinese are guilty of promoting their own narratives sometimes in contravention of the facts should not blind us to what the US media is engaged in as they take to the battlefield for the US in the propaganda war. NYT coverage of the coronavirus and other China issues largely reflects that and falls into place with just what the US foreign policy establishment wants to see."

2020-02-14 15:52:42,"Mr.Fisher neglects to mention the contribution from the Media to our fears and occasional hysteria. "" The Tamils of the Month""
was a phrase used to describe both Media hype and attention span ."
2020-02-14 16:07:11,"The psychological talking points of this article have nothing to do with the actual risks of this virus. At this time there are many objectively large risks. China doesn't even have a reliable diagnostic test, never mind enough test kits. Nobody does yet.

Modeling suggests that the transmission rate may be much higher than presently acknowledged, partly due to an unknown but evidently substantial occurrence of ""super-spreaders"". With super-spreaders, the range of outcomes over time could be 2 to 2.5 times worse than the best possible outcome, and the outcome is not deterministic: we cannot predict how it will go. At this point, isolation policies can at best slow things down, and they can't be maintained indefinitely.

It is clearly possible for health care systems and especially hospitals to become overwhelmed. Would you like to be a cancer patient in an infected hospital? In our own country, who will pay for care for uninsured cases?

It is true that many more people have probably been infected than have been counted, so there must be many mild cases. But we don't understand why older people are more susceptible. 

We all hope it is manageable. We all hope the risks pan out to be far from worst-case. Panic serves nobody. But psycho-speak articles don't really help us understand the situation objectively. After reading this article, would YOU travel to Wuhan?"
2020-02-14 16:19:13,"People in Western countries are thankfully no longer accustomed to any form of mass death.  The last really mass death situation the US has experienced was World War II. This means that even if the COVID-19 mortality rate is as low as say 5x that of normal flu, if it becomes a pandemic the number of deaths will dwarf anything that has happened within the lifetime of 90% of the population.

Also, even if it is irrational to fear deeply yourself or your loved ones getting seriously ill or dying, it is not irrational to fear how other humans will react to an unusually deadly epidemic.  Part of the fear associated with COVID-19 is the fear of how it will disrupt society. Being concerned about that is not irrational even if the disruption in the end is silly."
2020-02-14 15:59:15,I'm skeptical that China would quarantine a whole city and build hospitals in two weeks if the mortality rate was actually 2%.
2020-02-14 16:06:55,"As Mr. Fisher points out, this is how — and why — terrorism works. We are literally more likely to be killed by lightning than in a terrorist attack, but our emotional reactions lead us to unreasoning fear. The whole point of terrorism is to cause terror, to lead us to irrationally severe responses that are way out of proportion to the actual danger. We instituted draconian measures to ""safeguard"" ourselves after 9/11, and these fears were and are then stoked by demagogues for their own reasons (I'm thinking of you, Donald). The ""Muslim ban"" is the most egregious of these, ignoring the actual rarity of Islamic terrorism, and the fact that actually there are more deaths due to domestic terrorism than due to jihadists.

The true risk of terrorism is that we allow our reaction to it to subvert our values and give up our freedoms. It's like the immune system overreacting to an infection — it's the overreaction that often kills the patient, not actually the bacteria.

This is not to say we shouldn't take reasonable precautions, trying to infiltrate terrorist groups, sensible screening at airports, etc. But we should not live in a state of perpetual panic and turn our society into a perpetual surveillance state."
2020-02-14 16:26:34,"The mortality rate of this new virus is unknown.  The number of people infected is unknown.  The ease of transmission is unknown.  The possibility of a worldwide pandemic is real and it will require extraordinary efforts to prevent this. I wonder if these experts have seen any of the panicked videos posted on social media by nurses and nurses aides in Wuhan--these are folks who are treating these patients.  The modern city's health care sector is overwhelmed.

The flu, on the other hand.  I get my flu shot every year.  When I do get the flu, I will feel bad for a few days then I will recover if I take care of myself.  I worry about the young and the elderly and those with poor access to health care, when it comes to the flu."
2020-02-14 16:36:03,"I would have appreciated a bit more context with the example of the Three Mile Island issue given that radiation does cause cancer and people who live near that area are still getting cancer. While yes air pollution from fossil fuels causes premature deaths related to lung and heart health...I am not sure you can say it's actually worse than the cancer risks. Or that these effects (radiation in the environment) are not longer lasting and therefore intergenerationally damaging.  I imagine the public health student quoted in this article would have something to say about this example too.

Please expand on something like this in the future before you toss it in as a seeming equivalent to indicate ""people fear things and then that drives behavior."""
2020-02-14 16:42:57,"The author mentions one consequence of the irrationality of the human psyche, our near abandonment of nuclear power generation (which, to be honest, may actually make sense).

It fails to mention another: the failure of so many Americans to get annual flu shots.

The flu vaccine is far from perfectly effective; it's been estimated that it can reduce the odds of catching the flu by about half.  That's still a major benefit.  The vaccine is safe, inexpensive, and easy to get; most pharmacies will provide it, without a prescription.

This article addresses the question: why are so many in a panic over corona virus?  It should perhaps more fully address what is probably the more important question (since the answer to this question will save many lives): why don't more of us get flu shots?"
2020-02-14 16:45:03,"Another key difficulty in risk assessment exemplified by the current coronavirus, alongside those that Max Fisher correctly identifies, is the challenge in conveying nuance esp. of the ""both of these things are true"" variety. The human mind tends to ""dichotomize"" competing concerns into binary, opposing categorical boxes even if both are valid, for different and varied reasons. So it is with ideological disputes in our current bitterly polarized political environment, the way ""capitalistic"" and ""socialist"" economic features are pitted against each other even though every modern economy (including the US) needs both to function. Same with risk assessment.

The COVID-19 coronavirus indeed is serious and of major concern for international spread, with some features that may make it more virulent and contagious than the flu. But the current main flu strains are also quite serious and dangerous if widespread, in some ways even more than COVID-19 -- for example this coronavirus appears to largely spare children, which the flu does not. Bottom line is that both are most dangerous for the elderly and immunocompromised, and containment is imperative,  but the vast majority of victims fully recover. As a physician I myself suffered severe lung damage from a novel strain of whooping cough, even with immunization, a reminder of perhaps the primary take-home lesson here: we'll never be entirely free from the risk of new infectious disease, so eternal (infectious) vigilance is warranted."
2020-02-14 16:46:06,"What the population is told by public health officials about the risk of contracting coronavirus in North America and what individuals see in the media or experience overseas appear to be two different things. We are told that the risk of contracting coronavirus is low. But when was the last time that populations of entire cities were on lockdown?  When were supply chains stretching around the world impacted by efforts to control a disease? When was the last time that cruise ships with passengers confined to their cabins were quarantined for weeks off shore? When were travellers and expats  in extricated from affected areas and quarantined at home on military bases?  What messages do extreme public health containment measures taken by China and highly praised by the World Health Organization send to populations elsewhere?  How can the average person without an understanding of epidemiology be expected to take into account morbidity and mortality statistics relating to influenza vs coronavirus when they are bombarded minute by minute with updates of the number of deaths caused by only one of these, coronavirus? Why, from their perspective, if flu kills so many more, are extreme measures taken only with coronavirus? I have a public health background but can easily understand, even before taking into account the factors mentioned in the article, why assessment of risk level might be high."
2020-02-14 16:46:35,"I operate by an old maxim:  Better safe than sorry.  For instance, I get my water through a catchment system which uses an electric pump to get water into the house.  When high winds and rain are imminent, I fill buckets with water, so if power goes out at night, I have water available for, among other things, filling my toilet tank.  In 20 years, I’ve needed the buckets only three times.  But the effort weighed against the consequences is small, and boy, I was glad to have the water available.

Similarly, there’s been a run on surgical and N95 masks on my island because of coronavirus.  They’re essentially unavailable, much like they sold out during the recent volcanic eruption.  I lucked out and was in a store when a box of six arrived, so I bought them.  In my assessment, I included the fact that the vast majority of food and supplies to Hawaii have to be shipped here, and inventories on my island can be erratic.  Again, the effort outweighed the possible consequences.

I get a flu shot every year.  If there was a shot for coronavirus, I would have gotten that and probably not bought the N95s.  But there isn’t, and much about the outbreak — the way it spreads, the number of infected and dead — is uncertain.  Comparing it statistically to the annual flu seems only partly relevant.  I think I’m making a reasonable assessment of effort versus risk, and am not acting from emotionally driven panic.  I’ll end with another maxim, from my Boy Scout days:  Be Prepared.  I am."
2020-02-14 14:26:20,"Constantly looking out for risk, vigilance, seems to be the mental state people seek to be in these days by over-reading the news, myself included. Sometimes I open this app 10x a day. Why? Often the headlines are the same, but my brain is looking for that shocking article that gives an emotional reaction, often of outrage or fear. We are like the cavemen keeping our eyes peeled for a predator in the darkness. Remember when we got a paper newspaper 1x per day, and left it alone after reading once?

Reading the comments sections on various Trump-related articles shows how truly scared people are, many people taking the time to type outright, into the void, “I’m really scared”.

Human health and justice are of course issues to feel strongly about. I think if we all tried to have self-control (ie: stop ourselves from pushing the panic button by reading and re-reading scary articles like it’s our job), if we believed it’s not healthy to over-expose ourselves to information, we would begin to feel less inundated, and we could turn those strong but not overwhelming feelings into helpful and ethical actions. When we remain in a state of fear we remain stuck."
2020-02-14 16:48:37,"I understand the comparison with influenza, but what doesn't make sense is what is actually happening in China now. A hospital was built in Wuhan in a matter of days to handle the influx of new patients. Modern cities in lockdown. These are not routine responses to an ordinary influenza. These are extraordinary responses that have no precedent in modern times. There is no reason to believe that the disease won't spread in a similar fashion outside of China, with similar consequences. Granted, many, many people are working hard to make sure it doesn't spread outside of China, but we don't know the outcome of that work yet.

Am I worried about catching this disease today? No, of course not. Am I worried about what will be happening here two months from now? Yes I am and I'm not ashamed to admit it."
2020-02-14 15:29:54,"Agreed, especially since they brought it on upon themselves. I do not feel sorry for a country which abuses animals, both wild and domestic. Viruses are a nature's way to repay those who eat what they are not supposed to. Until China decides to promote a civilized way of living, they will spread diseases like bats do in their colonies."
2020-02-14 16:50:34,"I agree that the flu is a larger concern for most people, but mot of the irrational fear comes from the fact that we are relying on China to relay accurate statistics.

It is clear from recent history that we cannot trust any news or numbers coming out of China.  For all we know, the number of affected people could be 10, 20, 50 times greater and that the mortality rate could be anywhere between 0.5 and 20% as far as I can tell.

If we and the WHO had real, accurate data from a trustworthy country, I'm sure there would be a lot less irrational fear."

That means 2% of the people you know that get this disease will die.   Will die.  And a good percentage of this country will get this virus. 

 Theones who do die are more likely to be old or have another disease, but why on earth would that make that OK?  Would it be OK if mostly who died were children?

Personally I don't know anyone who has died of the flu.  I do know that everyone has gotten it at some time or another.  I do not think it's OK that the elderly couple who lives next door - one with heart issues and the other overcoming cancer will probably not make it through what is coming.

The point is that we have some time to plan and reduce the fatalities and to make the response less cruel (anyone up for being forcibly taken from their family or spouse?).

Why don't we wholeheartedly work on that kind of response rather than shaking a finger at people who find this 2% death sentence frightening."

2020-02-14 16:32:32,"Here's an example of this type of psychology --

Back in the early 1980's - there was a global panic centered around a new pathogen which was killing people and for which there was no cure --

Rumors of uncertainty, panic - and blame - were at forefront of many conversations between people from all walks of life --

During this time - I was riding the Broadway Local #1 subway downtown on the West Side of Manhattan --

It was a crowded mid-afternoon train - with all the seats occupied - except one -

In bold marker - someone had written the following -

""Did the last person to sit here have AIDS?""

That seat was avoided and left empty - even as other riders sat in the adjoining seats and people stood over it --

Imagine seeing - ""Did the last person to sit here have the Coronavirus?"" written on a subway seat --

Would you sit down on that seat...??"
2020-02-14 16:34:06,"As memory helps guide our psyche's future reactions to reoccurring events, so too, by a similar type process, is the body able to incorporate master plans for antibodies in its DNA. These plans will provide future protection after contacting this pathogen, again. The CRISPR genetic process, which is capable of introducing healthier genes into the body of sick individuals, sometimes with remarkable improvements, is based on how blueprints for antibodies can be stored in the human body's DNA, via storing their genetic sequences.

Since the coronavirus, as well as SARS, attack older individuals with more morbid and lethal outcomes, due to their less efficient immune systems, are older individuals innately too risk-seeking in evaluating the risk of viral contacts? Does their past success in their more youthful contacts with viral diseases cause these individuals to be too optimistic in their risk evaluations? Would a more pessimistic perspective be healthier for such people?

Contrast older individuals and their viral contacts, say, with a pro golfer facing a 20-foot putt. In all probability, the putter will two-putt. But if the golfer is a realist and admits the true difficulty, her chances of making the putt objectively and subjectively, are small. But, if the putter is a rosy-eyed optimist and very positive about her chance of success, due to her past track record, then she subjectively overrates; and also probably ups, the chance of a one-putt.

To make decisions ""rationally"" (i.e. like an actuary), you need a reliable math model of the phenomenon (a probability distribution, say) and, of course, an assumption that the future will look like the past. We basically have these with mundane things like the flu, driving, air pollution, etc. We do not have them with things like nuclear power, terrorism, coronavirus, even air travel. To apply the same logic to those things is to use Mediocristan reasoning in an Extremistan world: you'll be (occasionally) surprised in a very bad way. 

What this article misses is that people are worried about coronavirus because they are worried that it does NOT follow the understood model - i.e. this time it's different. I find that to be a very rational reaction, at least for the time being."

While we appropriately pay serious attention to the evolution of Wuhan coronavirus, let us not let it cloud out the ongoing risks from flu and other threats and the need to act accordingly. Let's keep a little perspective.

The C.D.C. estimates that 42 million people got sick during the 2018-2019 flu season and 61,200 died. If quarantining cities in China and cruise ships is sensible and legitimate, maybe we should consider the same for anti-vaxxers here in America.

3,000 were killed on 9/11. Compare our ongoing response to how we respond to the 40,000 killed every year in largely preventable vehicle crashes. As with those deaths, the flu is not a ""sexy"" news story, so does not get nearly the coverage deserved. On the other hand, the Wuhan coronavirus, makes for excellent clickbait. That is not to deny the legitimate stories, many hooked to the unknown elements. Novelty and the unknown get attention, until what was once novel becomes the new normal. That's human nature. Think of suicide bombers. In the mid 2000s when they started happening as more than a rare ""curiosity"", each had huge news coverage, complete with psychological ""analyses"", biographies, detailed descriptions, etc. Now when there is a suicide bombing, it is simply covered as any other bombing, ""suicide"" simply being consigned to being an adjective.

Rationally, don't worry about the new virus or airplane hijackers: worry about drunk and TEXTing drivers."
2020-02-14 16:22:24,"I'm not so much scared by the chance my family or I may get it. The chances are much better that I'll get the typical flu, and I get vaccinated every year for that reason.  I wash my hands religiously and even research the best hand washing methods (WHO has a good routine for health care professionals and I use it even though I'm a layperson).

The concern I have is about the wide-ranging economic and social impact of a virus we don't know yet. The draconian quarantines and flight suspensions are the only reason this hasn't spread further outside of Wuhan, but these measures can't last for much longer without damaging the world economy. The Chinese state can't keep people indoors forever. When we get virtually all of our non-food goods from China, this is not a good spot to be in.

The CCP is between a rock and a hard place. If they send everyone back to work, the virus will spread like wildfire through the country and around the world. But if they keep mass quarantines and house arrests in place, they will crash their economy. 

And even if this flu only kills 1% of those infected, that's still 10,000 people per 1 million. Assuming 60% of the world population of 7.8 billion contracts it (by one recent estimate), that's 46 million deaths worldwide and 2 million deaths in the US. On top of the deaths we already get from the flu and other infectious diseases."
2020-02-14 16:25:06,"""Not the statistics of risk, but the feelings of risk.” ... ""Our feelings don't do arithmetic very well.""   Not quite true.  If all one reads about are a virus killing dead people, then how can the mind get an accurate assessment of the risk?  If two planes in a row crash, then the mind suspects the current risk has changed for the worse.  If the virus hits your home town, then the risk changes again.  On top of that, the quotes from psychologists above hint at the poor work that has been done to educate on this topic.  That said, now go to the Health section of any newspaper, including NYT,  and decide for yourself whether they are approaching panic mode or if they are giving a true picture."
2020-02-14 16:40:22,"It is completely rational to fear the unknown more than the known. The flu kills tens of thousands every year. How many people will die from COVID 19? We have no idea. 

Ask yourself this. When was the last time the flu killed more than a hundred people a day, every day, with no end in sight, that too in just one city? What happens when the other cities in the world resemble Wuhan? Is there any rational reason to believe that the death toll will not be in the millions?"
2020-02-14 16:22:38,"Thought provoking article. The risk in the United States at this moment is almost non-existent. But that is likely to change. It would have been good to interview some epidemiolpgists. I read this in today Wall Street Journal: “I think it is likely we’ll see a global pandemic,” said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “If a pandemic happens, 40% to 70% of people world-wide are likely to be infected in the coming year. What proportion of those will be symptomatic, I can’t give a good number.”  
That sounds pretty serious."
2020-02-14 16:24:28,The irony of the photo with the throne of people trying to purchase mask:  the chance of them contracting the disease by being in such close contact with others is probably higher than the 'protection' that the mask could provide them.
2020-02-14 16:30:00,Another of the shortcomings when it comes to diseases is to have cut the CDC budget as the Trump administration did last year and again in his new 2021 budget.  In that case I don't think they are misjudging risk but are not intelligent enough to realize they are not immune from an epidemic and simply don't care as long as they save money and can use it for more war games.
2020-02-14 16:31:37,"Or the fact that around 40,000 people die each year in the United States alone, from car-related fatalities. (Citation: US Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration)."
2020-02-14 16:31:58,"Today, NYT reported six medical worker deaths out of an estimated 1700 infected which is troublesome and not on par with influenza . While most deaths appear to occur in older persons and with chronic conditions, the fact that there seems to be considerable mortality in younger infected persons suggests a more virulent virus.  Until there is better data on infection rates and mortality in younger healthy individuals, it is still too early to discount the lethality of this virus."
2020-02-14 16:53:34,"The article is conflating our reaction to risk with our reaction to the unknown. The reason why people reacted so strongly to Three Mile Island has little to do with the risk calculus of fatalities, it has to do with the realization that we really did not understand the technology all that well. And I would add the events at the Fukushima reactor in Japan illustrate that further.

The same can be said about CoVid-19; it is scary for people because we really do not know what we are dealing with. We do not know what the exact risks are so how can we have a rational risk assessment?"
2020-02-14 16:54:00,"I disagree with this analysis. The Wuhan flu is far more dangerous than ordinary flu.

The Chinese government reported that 1,700 health care workers have contracted the virus, and 6 have died. That is a mortality rate of 0.4%. It is about 4 times higher than ordinary flu. I think this is a reliable estimate because they probably keep close track of health care workers, and they probably give them the best treatment available. This is probably the best estimate of mortality we have so far.

Projecting that to the U.S.: in the U.S., ordinary influenza kills 12,000 to 61,000 per year, depending on how virulent it is. (How widespread it becomes.) The Wuhan flu appears to be very virulent, based on what has happened in Japan. So, a 0.4% mortality rate would kill approximately 61,000 * 4 = 244,000. But, you have to increase that by about 40%. In the U.S., ~40% of adults get a flu shot, so they are nearly all immune. There is no flu shot for Wuhan flu, so roughly 40% more people will get it. That's another 98,000 deaths, around 342,000 total. That would be one of the worst epidemics in U.S. history. In absolute numbers, it would be about half the deaths of the Civil War, the worst war in U.S. history. It would also be an economic and social disaster, as it already is in China."
2020-02-14 17:00:38,"People dying from regular flu normally die because of preexisting conditions complicated by the flu. Perfectly healthy young adults typically don't just suffocate to death in the case of regular flu as they do very often when infected with the novel Coronavirus. That said, the current epidemic may be past the most unpredictable phase and on its long way out, in part due to precautions taken, especially the reduction of transcontinental travel."
2020-02-14 17:04:42,"I agree with one overall point of this article, which is that humans are terrible at evaluating the relative risks of one danger vs. another. Absolutely. However, I am also appalled at the main point of this article, which is that people should really worry more about ordinary seasonal flu than the new coronavirus. I don't think most people worry enough about seasonal flu, but this new virus is going to cause many more deaths and be far more disruptive than your average flu season. The author admits that the case fatality rate of the new coronavirus may be anywhere from slightly more than that of ordinary flu to up to 20 times that of ordinary flu. But it will likely cause illness in perhaps 20-30% of the population, far more than the average of less than 10% for ordinary flu. So even at the very lowest possible end of the case fatality rate, healthcare systems will be swamped. At a more realistic rate of 1% (and consider this: 1% of 30% of the US population is approximately 1 million people!), healthcare systems will be overwhelmed, and more than that 1% will die of the virus and other health problems simply for lack of care. In addition, social distancing - closing workplaces and schools, canceling public events, etc. - will likely be implemented in various locations, and the economy will be seriously affected. At that point, we will be dealing with an event comparable to the 1918-19 flu pandemic. We need articles telling us how to prepare, not why to calm down."
2020-02-14 17:08:42,"COVID-19 doesn’t seem like a good example for the thesis of this article, but terrorism certainly is.  We have sacrificed our privacy over events that when averaged over time amount to little risk. In the meantime we are lowering safety standards for our air, water and transportation.  Those are all places with potentially severe outcomes and where where we have continuous lifetime exposure."
2020-02-14 17:10:08,"As a therapist, I teach clients the relationship between feelings, thoughts, and behavior. These are intertwined and cycle on one another. Only when we consciously become aware of our of the influence of our emotions on our thoughts can we break negative cycles. By learning to approach information from a cognitive perspective, our emotions can be in line with reality and we can act in the most effective means. 
This is true for own lives and for issues at a larger level like the news."
2020-02-14 17:10:26,"Tell a passenger in a troubled plane, with one engine on fire, that driving kills many more people than flying. Yes, driving is generally more dangerous than flying but being in a troubled plane is much more dangerous than being in a troubled car. With the novel Coronavirus we are in a troubled plane."
2020-02-14 17:11:39,"Risk of mortality is calculated as number of deaths divided by (number of deaths plus number recovered). The latest data suggest the about one in six with the new coronavirus die. Granted, we do not know the number of cases too mild to be counted. Nevertheless, widespread cases in the US would a very serious matter."
2020-02-14 17:20:23,"My daughter's a paramedic in the city. Like other medical professionals, I imagine, first responders are provided with protocols from the CDC for how to protect themselves when they have infectious patients. Presumably, the CDC is doing the research and learning all it can from China and our own researchers about how to protect our medical workers and, ultimately, the rest of us who come in contact. However, all the CDC has advised so far about the Coronavirus is the same as they advise regarding the flu: wear face masks. The face masks don't do a lot when it comes to flu prevention -- I hope they work better on this new bug :/ I get anxious when it feels like there's nowhere to go to get useful information about serious situations or when it feels like people in responsible positions shrug their shoulders and say, well, that's all you can do.... I hope they ARE taking this seriously enough to do A LOT more digging and that they get the word out to the people on our front lines here at home before there IS something many times a day to cause a panic."
2020-02-14 17:06:04,"It's absolutely comical to see this coming from the NYT, who has plastered headline after headline of, ""THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK"" across every single front page since the virus emerged. From shocking photos of patients in Wuhan, to out of stock shelves at pharmacies around the world, to medical workers in hazmat suits surrounding patients, the Times has engaged in this sensationalism surrounding the virus just as much as anyone else, and yet they then have the audacity to publish an article blaming this sensation on ""flaws in how human beings assess risk."" 

Perhaps it's time for the Times to take a look at their constant coverage of this crisis and the way in which they have contributed to the panic-stricken media bombardment surrounding this virus as part of the problem, rather than blaming readers and human judgment in general. 

At last check there was not a single headline concerning the flu on your Daily Briefing, and yet the Coronavirus has been at the top of every day's briefing for months. Check yourself, NYT. This issue is certainly worth covering but your coverage contributes to the massive chasm of concern between this virus and flu and blaming the very people you're delivering your own fear-mongering headlines to is insulting."
2020-02-14 17:17:43,"Wuhan blatantly censored people from initially speaking publicly about their fears regarding a new virus-- an unknown threat that was, in the official's minds, overrated and could potentially provoke panic in their society. The NYT has spent a lot of ink condemning this initial response in China, yet apparently sees no contradiction in publishing condescending articles laden with psychospeak and machismo chiding Americans for 'panicking' about coronavirus-- even without citing any real evidence that Americans are actually panicking.

Coronavirus is a real and rational threat to our deeply flawed healthcare system. Stop the gaslighting. It isn't time to panic or be afraid, but it is time to prepare, and to take steps to change certain very American behaviors (unpaid sick leave means most Americans go to work while ill)."
2020-02-14 16:51:23,"This article is shortsighted.  The fear of COVID19 comes from not knowing enough about its origin and progression as well as our experience with China’s responses to other viruses.  

You are doing a disservice to public health by writing such a piece that invalidates what we do currently know.  That’s COVID 19 is highly transmissible and that death rates appear to higher than flu deaths."
2020-02-14 16:53:27,"Overlooked in the article is the media's role in this.  The coronavirus is of no real concern, but the media has been hyping it up incredibly, with stories every day breathlessly telling the world there are another twenty deaths, another quarantined cruise ship, another possible source (pangolins, anyone?).

The media gets attention by telling people what to fear.  Probably nobody remembers this anymore, but about six weeks ago Trump assassinated a major Iranian general and then Iran launched missiles at U.S. bases.  The media seized upon this lunacy and soon everyone seemed to be terrified of world war three.  This was pretty much out of the question, and sure enough after another week or two all hostilities died down and Trump forgot that Iran existed.

Nonetheless, the media rode the panic as long as it could, and then fortunately for them the coronavirus came along to terrify people with the latest thing.

In a few more weeks, we'll be done with corona and it'll be on to something else.  And nobody will remember how idiotic the panic was, just like nobody remembers we were theoretically at the brink of armageddon a month ago, and nobody recalls how silly it was to get worried about SARS.

So I try to tell people corona is nothing to worry about, but people want to worry, and the media wants to sell fear.  I grimly await the next panic over the next unimportant thing."
2020-02-14 16:57:28,"The author writes: ""A classic example is airplane crashes. If two happen in quick succession, flying suddenly feels scarier — even if your conscious mind knows that those crashes are a statistical aberration with little bearing on the safety of your next flight.""

Has the writer of this story *not* followed the saga of Boeing Max 737?

Two crashes in quick succession *may* be a statistical aberration, but they can also be an underlying safety issue!"
2020-02-14 17:15:56,"I think this analysis overlooks a very important feature of evaluation of risk: bigotry.  Any quick look at early comment sections in NYT on coronavirus articles were rife with ""those people are nasty/dirty"" comments, all arising from fear of people not like self and attribution of negative hygiene to same.    Xenophobia thus becomes another component in conflating minor risks into major panic fears - those people can't be trusted to do the right things, after all.  Never mind that the US has very backward health policies and bad health habits in many ways that will eventually fuel this epidemic here, such as lack of sick time for front line food workers."
2020-02-14 16:57:42,"In addition to the other, usual factors that cause individuals to over-estimate risks, I would add the ""alien"" factor to the list.   And this is of course the flavor of the month amongst western governments. The coronavirus is being advertised  as sourced in China and its cultural eccentricities - and the threat is being seen as ""Chinese"" not viral.  It is nonsense that an alien people are being blamed for this year's cold season.

As for the Chinese government's over-reaction, this is simply the usual attempt by the Party to seize every occasion (no matter how cynically) to claim absolute control over the country.  Demonstrations of complete shut-downs and over-night emergency-builds are the Party's reply to those that say it is not all-powerful.

Ridiculous and cynical responses by governments on both sides of the world."
2020-02-14 17:05:49,"Sitting in bed as I recover from pneumonia, I have to admit I hit a Lion Air sized road block at the two plane crashes part of the story. Sometimes, unlikely events are statistically related. Sometimes they aren’t. 

But here is what the story lacks: the world economy is grinding to a halt as a new illness forces 2 week home stays at best and weeks of Intensive care at worst for the survivors. What is really happening in Wuhan to make the central government so scared that they’ve turned off the economy? How many ships are currently being loaded in China, on their way out to the rest of the world? How much airfreight has happened in the past month? Yeah, historically the flu kills more people annually in the United States. The flu does not disrupt the world economy."
2020-02-14 17:00:10,"Fear induces people to accept government intervention in the name of public safety. Just as 9-11 was an opportunity for the US government to enact the Patriot Act, the cornavirus is an opportunity for governments worldwide to increase their tracking of the movements of people (Singapore is doing this) require citizens suspected of carrying the virus to wear GPS bracelets (Taiwan is doing this). It would be no surprise given the actions of the US government in the “war against terror” to increase surveillance of US citizens and access individual health records."
2020-02-14 17:46:19,"This is 20 times more lethal than the flu, possibly two or three times more infectious, and there is no available vaccine...yet. It has caused countries to close borders and disrupt supply chains. What the author and students are exhibiting is called normalcy bias.

A tendency for people to believe that things will always function the way they have normally have functioned and therefore underestimate both the likelihood of a disaster and its possible effects. This may result in situations where people fail to adequately prepare themselves for disasters, and on a larger scale, the failure of governments to include the populace in its disaster preparations.

2020-02-14 17:40:07,"One of the dumber articles I’ve seen. Completely leaves out the fact that the world is being turned upside down right now about the coronavirus—not by average folk but by officials at the World Health Organization which deems this (not the flu) a global emergency,  and governments, many agencies, business leaders, and health leaders. 

If we aren’t supposed to be afraid of the coronavirus, these professionals are doing a darn good job acting like we should. 

Are we now supposed to believe they are all wrong?"
2020-02-14 17:42:48,"This is a new infectious disease.  The risk is not quantifiable.  Is the case mortality 2%  or is it 0.1% ? No one  knows.

It is not crazy to be worried about Covid19."
2020-02-14 18:23:31,"I've been saying to my classes from the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak that the whole thing has become an hysterical overreaction. I make the same point about the flu. Yes, we're dealing with an unknown, but we already know the great majority of infected people recover and that the most vulnerable are the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions - just like the flu. If I had to go to Wuhan tomorrow, I would so so happily, knowing that the odds of not catching anything are very much in my favour. I think this tendency to irrational hysteria is very controllable. Just don't get hysterical and think about what you are ""afraid of."" Is it a reasonable fear? I told a friend after 9-11 I would happily have gotten on a plane the next day if they were flying and done so without any qualms whatsoever - if anything security was tighter the day after than it had ever been. We should stop making excuses for peoples' stupidity. Let's encourage a bit of rational thought."
2020-02-14 18:32:39,"I think most people understand that statistically, there are things responsible for more deaths than than these new diseases, terroristic threats, or other such hyped threats like cartel/gang violence.

The difference though is in the control we have as people and being able to see it coming. If I eat unhealthy, that is my choice to expose myself to the heart problems that come with it. If I choose to speed to work, that is my risk. If I walk through a dangerous neighborhood and scream obscenities, that is me putting myself at risk. 

That is not the case with the unpredictable and unforeseeable dangers. I can’t save myself from a reckless pilot or profit driven airplane design. Nobody chooses to be the victim of terrorism or deserves it. And people are quite rational to be afraid of a disease which has unknown qualities and is apparently quite contagious."

There is no vaccine for animal-based viruses like the #Coronavirus & they have the potential to kill in the tens of millions."
2020-02-14 20:19:54,The statistics may not lie; but statisticians do.  The potency of this virus to be able travel undetected and infecting is probably higher than the flu.  What's not widely reported is that the Chinese Government has the crematoriums in the province going 24/7. You don't need the crematoriums going 24/7 if the death rate is 1000 people. Hong Kong Crematoriums have been ordered to operate 24/7 two weeks ago.  China did not have this response for the SARS outbreak.  This is SO MUCH WORSE!  KEEP on being COMPLACENT!  See where that gets you.  We almost had a individual released into the general population after being quarantined here in the U.S. for two weeks with no sign of infection.  Yet was later tested to be infected.  I'm lucky to have friends and family that can help me decipher the actual news casts and also comment with historical insight.    Face masks shipped back to Hong Kong are being stolen by workers of the delivery companies.  The different Chinese government agencies are stealing supplies from one another.  Yup go ahead and be complacent...  The Flu is worse... yeah right...
2020-02-14 21:18:40,"This article is unhelpful and perhaps dangerous in that it misunderstands and therefore inappropriately downplays the nature of the threat that COVID-19 represents. Our healthcare system is currently overburdened with the flu. If this virus were to spread widely in the United States during flu season, major problems, and yes deaths, will ensue. Cuts to public health have also threatened our ability to do the contact tracing necessary to stop new diseases from spreading through vulnerable populations. If the mortality rate of COVID-19 is indeed 2%, it is a far more serious threat to global health and stability than the flu is. And even if it ""only"" as virulent as the flu, whose to say the next emerging virus will not be more deadly? COVID-19 is showing that the world may be ill prepared to deal with emerging infectious diseases, something that should scare us all."
2020-02-14 21:28:03,"Reading the comments again, I am convinced that people just really want to be terrified, and are happy to exaggerate and invent threats so that they can be paralyzed by fear, and that they can tell other people to also be very scared.

So, since these people are unwilling to be talked out of their fear, I guess I should just let them have their fun.  The media needs to attract more attention by hyping the heck out of the sniffles, so let them make their money.  A year for now I'll enjoy saying I told you so, about how the coronavirus was never going to amount to anything.  Until then, enjoy worrying."
2020-02-14 21:59:08,"Okay a few problems with this piece.  If 20% of the cases turn severe, where do those people go?  Do they all go to hospitals in isolation units?  How many of these do we have available?  What do we do with the 80% who have mild cases?  Do we let them stay at home with their families and infect each other?  Do we isolate them somewhere else (like in China's new quarantine ""hospitals""? 

Isn't it a better idea to try to contain it before it gets here en masse?  Isn't it better to have people on alert so if they do have it, or were exposed to travelers who had it, they take proper precautions by alerting a hospital and the CDC so they can be tested and isolated before it spreads? 

What exactly does telling people not to worry about this accomplish?  The people who need to know end up brushing it off.  This piece is extremely irresponsible."

2020-02-15 01:55:52,"Max Fisher makes some good points but I think he also suffers from distorted thinking. No deaths may have been reported from Three Mile Island, but the consequences of Chernobyl cannot be pooh poohed away. Fukushima was even more unsettling because we had assumed that the Japanese were rigorous about safety, but as it turned out, we were wrong. Also our concern about nuclear power did not have to lead to increased demand for fossil fuels. Already people were thinking about promoting renewable energy and shifting to less energy consuming modes, but those with vested interests in fossil fuels and the like pushed the global economy in a different direction."
2020-02-15 03:00:53,"Fisher describes the way we access risk clearly, so why was this in the international section rather than the science section?

I've been mulling over why there's so much attention to this outbreak and the seemingly extreme reaction.  It seems that the death rate is still unknown, as is the R0 rate, so this could conceivably become much more serious threat to human health than the flu.  I was also wondering whether the quarantines that have been imposed prior to learning more about the risks might be intended  to ensure that the virus doesn't spread enough to be an annual threat (the way the flu is), or if there's a chance it could be halted and then controlled once a vaccine is developed."
2020-02-15 01:57:41,"The issue is the media.  Until the Corona virus there was practically no information about the dangers of flu, the number of deaths etc.  Why this has happened is anyone's guess but it is one more example of the poor job they are doing, creating hysteria about global warming, Trump, and other dangers but ignoring a very real threat to people, happening right now!"

2020-02-15 03:17:56,"""34,200 killed by the Flu last year and 61,099 the year before.""Are there statistics on how many of those people did not get the Flu shot? People do not panic over the annual Flu, yet are worried that there is no cure for COVID-19. This is an example of how broken our relationship is to Public Health.

It is time that our population understands that people pass viruses to others. This is basic science. Our Health Care and Social systems could be overwhelmed by those who are presenting with annual Influenza complications during the COVID-19 epidemic.
At this time, there is no country in the world that can afford the luxury of non vaccination for treatable disease. We are global citizens with global responsibilities. COVID-19 has proved that.

I am upset by Health Care Workers in the U. S. who don't get Flu shots. I think that it is time to require it. I have never heard of a religion or g-d that wants you to harm others and possibly kill them while working to help them get better. If Health Care workers in Wuhan could get their hands on an effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 they would take it.

The next time you visit a patient in a hospital, nursing home, doctor's office, may I suggest you ask all practitioners.
Did you get your Flu shot? Imagine how much money, medical resources and most of all lives we could save.That is true risk management."

I'm disappointed that this bit of coverage is probably just a rare sliver of what The Daily used to be.

Why did this podcast turn into basically a political pundit session every single day about 6 months ago? Why did we get so much excellent varied coverage from around the world before? 

I'm skipping the entire podcast basically every day now because of the incessant political messaging. But I won't today because this is finally something fresh and REAL. I'll probably skip tomorrow's."

No doubt that the compact ""We the Party are your family and will take care of your needs as long as you toe the line"" is based on a promise that cannot be fulfilled to perfection and yet demands plenty.

However, whether western liberal democracies do better when confronted with a calamity of similar scale remains to be seen."
2020-02-13 10:19:20,"THE NUMBER OF THE CORONA VIRUS CASES and related death has been accelerating.  Let's just hope that we can dodge this bullet.  Because if we can't, the uncontrolled fires in Australia will be a walk in the park compared to the 100s of millions who could potentially perish if the Corona virus turns into a pandemic.  Worldwide the #1 priority MUST be the rapid development of a vaccine.  It is more important than any weapons system, because a larger number of people will die in a global pandemic than from any weapon system.  There may be a way to combine existing medications to speed up the process.  Also, if a SARS vaccine has been developed, it could be the basis for streamlining the corona virus vaccine.  The ebola virus became available after a year.  Let's hope that a Corona Virus vaccine can beat or match that deadline!"

Showing a sudden and substantial uptick in diagnosed cases based on different reporting criteria is a good example of comparing apples and oranges.

Until the World Health Organization or some independent agency gets a look at the numbers and can verify them on an ongoing basis we must consider that any figures released by China are suspect."
2020-02-13 11:19:33,"Not only are scans a poor proxy for testing the virus, it also only tests the very sick who arrive for treatment.  Many become ill but don't need treatment and won't be tested either because  of lack of tests.  They need a better understanding of what differentiates those who become gravely ill, even die, vs the vast majority who don't."
2020-02-13 11:33:07,The first few reports from the Chinese government in this article contradict themselves.  Outbreaks slowing and yet the number of reported cases leap by nearly 25%.

2020-02-13 11:41:15,"Frankly, I'm surprised China, given its history, is reporting anything at all. But when I heard that two ""citizen"" journalists who had worked to alert the public to the dangers of the outbreak have ""disappeared,"" I got much more concerned. The likelihood of the true nature of this outbreak being grossly under-reported by the Chinese Government is very, very high, even if they do manage to manufacture enough test kits soon. I really feel for all those poor people trapped there with fear of the disease in front of them and fear of the Government behind them (to paraphrase the words of one of those missing citizen journalists). I hope it is contained before it gets here because I seriously doubt this Administration is equipped to handle it either, and we know they'll try to cover it up, if it does become a problem."
2020-02-13 11:48:50,"Of course it’s not leveling off.  The higher mortality and infection rate in Wuhan isn’t because Wuhan is just less lucky; rather it’s just because Wuhan is where it started and people have been infected for a longer time there. Evidence suggests that symptoms may not occur for 2 weeks after infection, with death another week or two later for those who can’t beat it. In other words, the spread has already occurred, we’re just now becoming aware of it.  Expect a slow moving wave outward from Wuhan, with infection and death numbers climbing over the next few weeks."
2020-02-13 11:57:46,"This seems to be an admission of (the obvious)  undercounting, still likely still low, but a start. Had the officials released the the  numbers using the new criteria for the previous week, we would have a better sense if the growth rate is slowing.
This is good news/bad news. The fatality rate looks  lower using the new number. The bad news is there  lots of mild cases out there to infect those who will get the acute version."

symptom free, and wash our hands."
2020-02-13 11:46:49,This article says nothing.  The cases were declining but then increased when the reporting criteria changed.  So did the real number of cases decline or did they rise?  My assumption is that new infections have decline significantly but this articles certainly doesn't answer the question.
2020-02-13 11:45:55,"No offense, but from other photos, these patients, all lined up did not appear to be receiving any medical treatment that could not be administered at home - no IV’s, for example.  Oral medication can be taken at home.  Why not stay there and take the medication there.

In addition - what is being done for urination and defecation in these monster minimal “hospitals”?  

This is really creepy.  I’m a nurse.  I don’t get it.  I’m not talking about ICU’s.  I’m talking about these lined up beds, one after another.

I listened to an interesting interview with a British medical scientist involved in the coronavirus crisis, and he made a convincing case for not talking about “super-spreaders,” but “super-spreading events” according to where the infected person had been and the number of people he had been in contact with -like the British man at the French ski chalet. “Super-spreading events” may not evoke quite the drama of “the super-spreader,” but his explanation made it sound like a more accurate description of what was happening."
2020-02-13 10:05:10,I feel like we are slow walking into a world wide crisis encompassing a viral contagion and an economic one. And we have a incompetent reality television star surrounded by sycophants in charge.

Simple preparedness would mandate all families keep a minimum of 4-6 weeks of food and water, as well as necessary medications and means of charging cell phones and light sources.
The meals can be those of the emergency “evac” type so as not to take up room.
The normal disposable  masks are nearly worthless so pick up some cheap dust masks sold at your local Lowe’s or hardware store and spray outside with rubbing alcohol...much more effective and can be used for days.
Truth about how virulent this strain of virus will turn out to be is hard to know as it’s still in its early highly mutable state as it adapts to new hosts and evolves no means of transmission.
Fortunately, private Chinese netizens are providing a more complete, albeit frightening, picture of a pandemic that the political class has been loathe to disclose in its full breadth.
Remember simple historical facts about pandemics, such as the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918; the build in waves and the other shoe has yet to drop."
2020-02-13 09:28:07,"I saw the WHO panel today congratulating China and downplaying the botched Chinese response to this crisis. Clearly China is in over their heads and one has to wonder what forces make the WTO spread such nonsense. 

What is even more worrisome is how clueless science is: “We are in uncharted territory.” 

Let’s abandon the false sense of calm. It is time to panic."
2020-02-13 11:51:29,Well- according to the WHO (which is less a health org and more a political PAC) we should not stop travel to China. Perhaps it’s the cozy relations that China has with Ethiopia that is pushing this narrative.
2020-02-13 12:00:14,With a strong wall of secrecy surrounding the real state of affaires in China it is really difficult to know what is the real toll of Coronavirus infected cases or even the health protocols being adopted to prevent and cure the disease.
2020-02-13 11:35:01,"To understand the Chinese government's response to the coronavirus, it is essential to understand how the Chinese state applies Marxist ideology. 

There is an important article by Long Ling in a recent London Review of Books (What really happened in Yancheng?) that describes the process of being admitted to the Chinese civil service. It illustrates how the apparatchiks of the Chinese state are taught to respond to a report of a crisis, in this hypothetical case the panic following a chemical leak:

<a href=""https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n02/long-ling/diary"" target=""_blank"">https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n02/long-ling/diary</a>

This article first appeared a few days before the initial public announcement of the coronavirus on January 20.

The following paragraph may also remind some of a leadership style found closer to home, ostensibly far removed from Marxist ideologies:

""How do you ensure you score more than your competitors in essay writing? Not by being the most elegant writer, nor the most eloquent, but by demonstrating a command of official style. Outstanding candidates write their essays in neat handwriting. They choose the most appropriate words, they quote from the classics and they express complete loyalty to the party’s Central Committee. The content of what they write is, of course, shaped from the top. It is no exaggeration to say that Xi Jinping’s reports to the Party Congress are the civil servant’s bible. Candidates must be sufficiently familiar with the congressional reports and Xi’s lectures. Key paragraphs must be memorised."""
2020-02-13 11:55:22,"Anyone with any knowledge at all in stats and health reporting could see the official figures were nonsense. The fact that the news sources we're supposed to use as a bolster against misinformation were parroting them is concerning. 
Even today the BBC is reporting a ""sharp increase in deaths""...instead of the more truthful but less headline worthy long period of under-reporting.  Good to see the NYT is avoiding that trap. 
What we need now is less virus deniers telling us to be more worried about seasonal flu and more straightforward fact based information."
2020-02-13 09:39:50,"When visiting China I observed that spitting, while officially discouraged, is prevalent throughout the country, yet I see no mention of this germ-spreading activity with relation to the corona virus outbreak. Is the Chinese government actively doing anything about this ubiquitous bad habit that surely would enhance the spread of this deadly virus?"
2020-02-13 10:52:10,"The Trump administration didn’t bother to show up for the Senate briefing on the outbreak yesterday by US public health experts even after being asked by GOP Senators. Trump told them it will die out by April, no worries everyone Dr. Trump the Epidemiologist has it under control he got his degree at Harvard medical school just last week."
2020-02-13 10:42:08,"Simply put, when it comes to the coronavirus, we really do not know how bad or good things are in China, and we should not be basing conclusions on what we hear from the Chinese government.  What is important is what we are doing to keep the virus from coming here and establishing a foothold.  Yes, there will be fallout from the effects in China that will impact us, but this fallout is not the virus coming here but rather the economic disruption we are likely to experience as China fails to provide much needed critical parts for our industry and other materials usually sourced in China.   That can be serious, but we can cope with that far better than with the virus, if it were to establish here.  Happily, we and most other nations are taking strong measures  to keep the virus at bay.  And, in all likelihood, as was the case with SARS, Ebola, etc., the coronavirus too will run its course in due time.   The real problem is managing the economic difficulties that will arise from sourcing too much in China,  and that is something that needs to be addressed and vigorously pursued."
2020-02-13 12:30:01,"It's now this virus vs the Chinese economy and the very ""legitimacy"" of the Xi administration. If the numbers stay on the upward trend, the accuracy in reporting by the government will become very hard to measure given the full control of the party in everything and their devotion to the image of China and the country's social harmony."
2020-02-13 12:37:14,"Is there concern that COVID-19 might also mutate now that it's being ""hosted"" by many more humans?  

It mutated from its original source to a intermediate host that allowed it then transfer (or mutate and transfer?) to humans.  Might it be changing further, adapting to aerosol-based transmission?"
2020-02-13 12:43:16,"Using this outbreak as a stick with which to beat up and criticise the Chinese government is pointless at this stage and only risks making matters worse. They have released a lot of information, and with the numbers of infected people in Hubei it's no wonder they struggle to keep track. What happened at the start of the outbreak should now be of epidemiological interest only. Some people have been sacked and that's enough. Remember that no one will ever have intended to facilitate the spread of the virus.

With our own case of a single person infecting ten or so others and with sight of how that's been handled by our system, media criticism of the Chinese has markedly dropped in the UK.

When the dust has settled and hopefully the virus contained, then it can be time to try and work with the Chinese on things like closing live food markets and preventing public spitting. But these are cultural issues and while it seems that their society has evolved massively over the past decades, it's hard for them to become a fully developed country overnight. It took us centuries."
2020-02-13 12:44:13,"As the old saying goes, you repair the roof before the rain. So time to do some preparation. 

2 likely impacts. First stress on supply chains, particularly in cities. By going out today and stocking up on non perishable food you're helping yourself, and lessening a sudden stress on supplies. 

Secondly. Think about what happens if you or your family members get sick.  Statistically speaking you're most likely to get the virus at the peak of the pandemic...ie when the health system is most stressed.  Will you be able to access an oxygen supply when the time comes? Does you're local health service have that spare capacity? If not may be worth investing a few hundred dollars in an oxygen concentrator now. If you do the worst (and best) case is that you've wasted some money."
2020-02-13 11:45:58,"There was no reason to trust previous numbers, or the calculation of serious complications and death as a percentage, because at no point have we ever understood the base number of infected.

The disease spreads like a cold, and people have no immunity or at best limited immunity to it. Millions may have just had a cold, relatively asymptomatic, even as we see the effects of more serious illness spreading.

The people at ground zero have the biggest difficulty since the disease could spread and overwhelm medical facilities before it was even recognized. A sharp doctor did understand he was looking a a real threat, but while the disease was contagious, alarm was not. The rest of the world has the advantage of knowing what to look for. 

Frankly, I hope Trump is right, and the virus has a season the way that flu usually does. We'd be idiots to bank on that, especially as we are busy undermining healthcare for our most vulnerable populations."
2020-02-13 09:10:10,"""A single infected 'super-spreader' can infect dozens of others""

In the case of the British man who got infected in a Singapore meeting, he in turn infected 5 in France and 5 in GB, but he wasn't very sick and is already released from hospital.  

The press called him a 'sup-spreader', but experts say it has more to do with circumstances than the infected person themselves, and therefore it ought to called a super-spreading event."
2020-02-13 12:23:32,What I’d like to see reported is who this disease is killing. The number of deceased with underlying illness. The number of children.
2020-02-13 11:57:41,"Why does the world seem to believe the amount of infections, reported by the Chinese government, which has never told the truth before?"
2020-02-13 12:49:38,"Now conspiracy promoters are going to add another 0 to their numbers. Facebook and YouTube need to hire some volunteer moderators to monitor their platforms.

Another thing, notice how the number from advanced countries keep going up for the last 2 weeks but developing and undeveloped countries are still low single digits or none? Need simple and cheap testing kits quick."
2020-02-13 12:55:13,"As Chinese medical staff dealing with more Coronavirus patients, broad in-situ experience shows that screening criteria need to be changed.  This change is not surprised nor unexpected. This new number won't change the situation how to stop the virus nor discourage the determination of Chinese front line fighters to eliminate it.

Based on the news from Hong Kong today, both the leader of Hubei province and city mayor of Wuhan, the epidemic center, has been replaced.  Unless the virus is under control or contained, Chinese government won't dare to change the local leadership now.  The situation will get better as the companies and factories slowing admit more workers to come back.  

Also based on the news from Hong Kong, ordinary people seem to adapt to the daily restriction and inconvenience rather well.  People trust their government and worry less about Coronavirus than their jobs.  And many China experts predict that the production and supply chain will soon be running back in full force with a vengeance."
2020-02-13 13:23:04,"Lung scans are not a bad idea and more efficient - whether a lung infection is due to the coronavirus or something else, the patient needs to be treated. It may not help with analyzing the epidemic, but it may help save lives."
2020-02-13 13:37:48,"I get it.   This situation is completely out of hand.   They don't know if they have any ability to diagnose the tip of the iceberg on cases of coronavirus.

But, now, this actually matters.   In terms of deciding how to TREAT the patients, which seems to be what the actual issue is in this Communist nation where the government often thinks upside down and most other people can't seem to think in a straight line, the strategy of diagnosis by X ray makes good sense.  

They're not just using the X-ray diagnosis to count cases, they're using it to decide who gets into a hospital for treatment.  People with viral pneumonia need it treated no matter what is the cause.   I can't imagine my own local U.S .  hospital even bothering to identify the virus.

And it obviously needs to be said; coronavirus seems WAY more likely to cause viral pneumonia than the flu ever has since 1918!"
2020-02-13 13:38:31,"Everyone needs to stop looking at random variation/noise and declaring trends.  In these sorts of cases, you won't be able to call trends until far into the trend or after it's done."
2020-02-13 13:44:31,"According to reporting on NPR this morning, following the WHO's reclassification, there are now in excess of 60,000 people globally infected with this strain of Coronavirus.  We know this and we know the number of people that have succumbed to it.  What I'm wondering is how many have fully recovered.  Is anybody aware of that figure?

Our office has posted a document from the CDC in all public spaces which makes it quite clear that this specific virus is no worse than a common cold and that treatment, provided the infection doesn't spread to the lower respiratory area, is no different than that of a common cold, ie: rest, fluids & off the shelf medication.

This is all well and good if all those that have been infected with the virus, and whose lives haven't been lost to it, have recovered.  But I don't know what this number is.  As far as I know everybody that contracted it either still have it or have died.

Anybody any idea how many people have FULLY recovered form a confirmed case of this disease?"
2020-02-13 13:59:03,"What's the problem? Trump says it will be gone by Spring, so why worry? He said that if it isn't , he'll fire the Physician General and close the CDC, since, he says, clearly, they can't be doing their job if this disease is still rolling around, He is such a Guiding Light for Sense and Sensibility."
2020-02-13 14:08:55,"This article is a misinterpretation of the data.  Cases of the novel Coronavirus illness have been occurring at a much higher rate than reported all along, because everyone with illness cannot be tested.  In flu epidemics, cases of flu or ""flu-like illness"" have always been counted in the epidemic curve, as have cases of ""pneumonia"", all cause.  The ""jump"" in cases is likely due to changing the case definition.  With this new definition, the curve can be followed for the next few weeks to see what is actually happening in Wuhan."
2020-02-13 14:18:37,"Don't panic, yet.

""The few experts to learn of the new numbers on Wednesday night were startled.""

What kind of ""expert"" would find this startling or unexpected? It would be startling if we found that previous testing had captured all, or even most,  cases. But think about it. Even in China, you can't apply a complicated and costly test to everybody who is sick in a timely fashion. What they are doing now is making a clinical diagnosis. This can be an effective way of identifying patients if there is some clinical feature  that is fairly specific for Covid-19 infection (not all pneumonias look the same on scan). Of course, with this approach, there will always be false positives, with some people ""diagnosed"" when they have something else. It should also surprise no one when we later discover that there have been many infections that were not counted at all by either method. The deadlier something is, the easier it is to keep track. This looks like it can be pretty bad, but not *that* bad, so many milder cases will be missed. Unfortunately, we also can't know how many are dead in their homes, etc. 

The important thing to remember, is that this ""increase"" does not represent an actual surge in infections or deaths, but is the result of a quick and dirty diagnostic method that is hopefully helping to capture a more accurate number. The actual trend remains unknown and totals could still be dropping.  Hold the panic, for now......"
2020-02-13 13:17:51,"So far coronavirus is a lot ' smarter', 'tougher'and 'wiser' than Chinese President Xi Jinping and American President Donald Trump.

2020-02-13 13:48:47,Why are the stock markets continuing to go up after analysts keep lying saying this virus is under control? Even hotels chains and car companies who have already admitted this will cause disruptions to their profits for the year and yet all their stocks continue to rise and rise. This whole situation is proof the stock markets live in heavily manipulated fantasy world.
2020-02-13 12:53:37,"Please, media:  A little perspective.

In the city of Wuhan, there are some 18-million souls.  In all of Hubei Province surrounding and including Wuhan?  Nearly 60-million.  Therefore, 1,300 +/- deaths and 100,000-plus infected overall is not a reflection of a virus out of control.  For that, you could expect to see the above numbers rise two, perhaps three decimal points.

As officials attempt to corral ""Coronavid-19""  and reduce it to harmlessness, the numbers will ebb and flow with each passing day, week, month.  It's akin to trying to round up a gaggle of slippery chickens soaked in paint---not only is it hard to corner the darn things, but lots of people are going to get splattered with paint.   That's a terrible analogy, I know, but I thing you get the imagery.

We're still rounding up chickens, but rounding them up, we are.  The numbers reflect that."
2020-02-13 13:04:18,"An increase of 15,000 infected people sounds more like an error or a cover up than a change in diagnostic criteria.  Not sure why you are taking this at face value and even attempting to justify it."

Forced to self-isolate...marvelous use of doublespeak...""force self-isolation""...or as it should be called ""forced isolation""."
2020-02-13 14:37:57,"All viral illnesses have a period after the patient has become infected and the virus is multiplying within their body and being shed in secretions before the individual has any symptoms of being sick.  This is the asymptomatic carrier stage of the illness.  During this time people carry on their normal daily activities be it going to the market, staying at home, flying for business or pleasure, etc.

You cannot expect mass isolation to work once the cow is out of the barn.  Self isolation of the noninfected from the infected may help.  Masks do not.  It will run its course.  As it does, use appropriate precautions."
2020-02-13 14:41:45,"The fact that somebody had time to retabulate heaps of data means that the local authorities have time to do this. I infer that they feel more in control of the situation.

The additional numbers also mean that  the bureaucrats in charge will cover the higher numbers in a report up the chain of command with a statement that things are improving."
2020-02-13 14:49:09,"Approx 80,000 died from the flu  in the  2017-2018 season, in the US alone.  That year, 900,000 Americans were hospitalized, more than double the usual.

These facts would be nice to know when reading articles about the severity of a coronavirus."
2020-02-13 14:50:28,"There have been reports out of China of a) Under reporting to save face, b) That many people in the countryside are not even being checked nor quarantined.  There could be a large reservoir of people with the disease.  This crisis could last for sometime as those people  infect others and the cases spread out of the cities to the general population.

That could make it hard for China and its factories to restart anytime soon.  In turn that will put pressure on the US economy as we are tightly linked with Chinese manufacturing.   We no longer have the capacity to make these parts in the US in large enough numbers for our needs so we could also see an extended slowdown.  That could effect the Presidential election.  Trump of course will try to blame others for this, I doubt he will be successful.  Interesting times are ahead."
2020-02-13 14:57:19,"Perhaps this has been mentioned by others. It seems the most important takeaway from all these recent epidemics: MERS SARS Novel Coronavirus is that the sale, consumption and warehousing of bats must end."
2020-02-13 15:00:18,"The lesson seems to be that much/most of the world is simply not prepared for this.  Not governments, cruise lines or health systems.  If nothing else, this is a lesson on the importance nations having strong, well funded public health services, which are too often the least appreciated facet of health care."
2020-02-13 15:03:36,"As many have pointed out, we can’t get an accurate handle on the number of people who have contracted the virus and, therefore, how contagious it really is. The corollary to that missing data is any sense of the symptoms of the sick. We hear only some rough estimate of the number of cases and the number of deaths. 

What are the symptoms and severity of most of the cases? It looks as if the virus is particularly contagious because humans have no antibodies to fight it, just as native Central and South Americans had no antibodies to fight smallpox at the time of European contact. Is this new virus as virulent and contagious as smallpox, or is it more like the flu, which sickens most people but kills relatively few?

Until we can get accurate data, we are operating in the dark. Packing people into “hospitals” with very limited medical resources may indeed be increasing and accelerating the death toll. Just as we were able to isolate and effectively treat the few returning health workers from Africa during the Ebola outbreak, the contagion was containable and treatable. Therefore, those countries experiencing a few cases have a special responsibility to isolate, monitor and treat each individual.  

And by the way, a cruise ship is nothing more than an old fashioned plague ship. Get those passengers home, even if you need a private jet for each of them, and place them under proper quarantine and care."
2020-02-13 15:08:06,"China's attempt to show the world it is in control is backfiring. Commingling the healthy with the high risk in closed spaces like a cruise ship certainly doesn't help. People need to use common sense. Quarantines work with the high risk; but when you are mixing it up, secondary contamination is more a norm than an exception"
2020-02-13 15:09:26,"It was premature to expect this virus epidemic to wane especially since it's highly contagious. The clinical diagnosing of this virus would certainly ramp up aid to those infected. Imagine Chinese health providers are becoming experts on identifying/diagnosing COVID-19 along with chest xrays, since many test kits like the ones CDC sent out, are flawed-don't work."
2020-02-13 15:21:59,"As a world, we are over populated.  We may have become efficient at controlling diseases and outbreaks, but there will always be new strains developing that are not containable.  As wild fires clear the land globally, mother nature will also manage the world population.  In highly populated areas, such as in China, controlling new strains of viruses will be nearly impossible.  Our only hope is that the coronavirus has a short life cycle."
2020-02-13 15:24:03,Bat excrement or guano mining is an industry in several parts of the world.  It is a rich fertilizer.    Regulations to limit consumption of bat meat vary from country to country and enforcement varies as well. Contact with bats and with their excrement will therefore remain a potential source of future plagues since bats are among the highest carriers of viruses in the animal world.
2020-02-13 15:00:01,"This still isn't an important disease, despite all the hype.  If the deaths reached a hundred million, which they almost certainly will not, it would still not be enough to put a dent in the destruction humanity is causing to the environment.

A million species are due to go extinct soon, due to human deprivation of the environment.  The earth is warming up, again due to us, and vast areas are going to become unlivable.  Coastal cities will go underwater, the Middle East will become as uninhabitable as the Sahara, and these effects won't just wipe out human settlements, but most life forms.

We're also filling up the oceans with plastic and wiping out a lot of life that way.  Due to our pumping poisons into the air and water, most insect life has vanished already, and since that's near the bottom of the food chain it will have catastrophic repercussions.

So as the media keeps whining and moaning about a paltry thousand or two deaths from this virus, I can't help but react with disgust.  There is nothing important about this extremely minor cause of death to humans only, and everyone is doing their best to ignore the truly important things.  Meanwhile, the virus news causes racists to attack Asians for no reason, in places the virus has never hit.  You humans are appalling."
2020-02-13 14:51:52,"President Xi Jinping is leading the people's successful struggle against the novel coronavirus:

Wuhan is a heroic city, and the people of Hubei and Wuhan are heroic people who have never been crushed by any difficulty and danger in history.

If Wuhan wins the battle against the virus, Hubei will. If Hubei wins the battle, the nation will.

We can certainly obtain a full victory in the fight against the epidemic.

Close attention must be paid to employment and large scale layoffs should be avoided.

The fundamentals of China's long-term economic development remain unchanged and the impact of the novel coronavirus epidemic on the economy is short lived.

-- President Xi Jinping

Chinese leaders are firmly in control. 

Nothing to see here people, move along."
2020-02-13 15:04:02,"SARS-coV 2 is the actual name given to the virus by the international Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Covid-2019 co(crona)vi(virus)d(disease)-2019 is just the name of the illness caused by the SARS-coV 2 virus. Why do publication keep referring to the virus by way of the illness it causes as opposed to its actual taxonomic name when we don’t do that for any other disease? Ex..we say Ebola virus not hemorrhagic fever, we say HIV when taking about % of population, not AIDS. We say H1N1 influenza, not unspecific flu symptoms with varying levels of severity. This is all confusing because now I don’t know if the media is referring # of people infected as people who just have coronavirus disease symptoms or if it is referring to the actual number of people infected with SARS coV -2. I can see why China is changing their criteria for diagnosis (chest scan vs lab test) so they can get sick people treatment quicker. But the way the media reports on SARS-coV 2 is confusing and seems misleading. We’re all big kids. I think we can handle the virus’s actual name even if it is scarier sounding than covid-2019."
2020-02-13 15:23:48,"Similar story to those over the years telling us poor capitalist saps how great the USSR was doing. There seems to be a problem in countries ruled by a communistic dictatorships in truthfulness. We need to remember this in dealing with these countries - N Korea, China, and the ex but still willing Russia."
2020-02-13 14:57:33,China has a long history of lying about statistics like this. If the number of cases jumped it's only because their lie wasn't realistic.
2020-02-13 15:27:59,"Isn't it well established that reported flu cases represent many more unreported cases?   That is to say a definitive diagnosis is rare when there is obvious widespread activity.     

I'm glad someone listed to an expert to report numbers based on clinical findings to signify disease.    There is hope for the future beyond that offered by demented old men running the world.  

My point is this new larger number of cases were already there.   The afflicted knew.   They're just measured and reported now.  Let's see the world wide response ramp up appropriately."
2020-02-13 15:36:11,"My guess is that the actual infected ( and death) has been leveling off and already decreasing, BUT statistically ( not merging both confirmed-via-swab and suspected-via-chestXray due to initial overwhelmed med care) the previous numbers (total infected and death) were erred by half (given the daily death almost doubled today, and newly infected is about equal Wuhan’s previous total.). There is still one omission imo, I believe the total dead should be about 2x of previous total, around 2500, to reflect the daily 2x jump. 

Outside of Wuhan in rest of China, there was no such jump in data, perhaps an indication of sufficient test kits to confirm all cases from the beginning."
2020-02-13 14:48:24,"Read the last sentence in this paragraph, then think about a third possibility.

From Science, “Mining coronavirus genomes for clues to the outbreak’s origins”
By Jon CohenJan. 31, 2020 , 6:20 PM


“Concerns about the (Wuhan Virology Lab) institute predate this outbreak. Nature ran a story in 2017 about it building a new biosafety level 4 lab and included molecular biologist Richard Ebright of Rutgers University, Piscataway, expressing concerns about accidental infections, which he noted repeatedly happened with lab workers handling SARS in Beijing. Ebright, who has a long history of raising red flags about studies with dangerous pathogens, also in 2015 criticized an experiment in which modifications were made to a SARS-like virus circulating in Chinese bats to see whether it had the potential to cause disease in humans. Earlier this week, Ebright questioned the accuracy of Bedford’s calculation that there are at least 25 years of evolutionary distance between RaTG13—the virus held in the Wuhan virology institute—and 2019-nCoV, arguing that the mutation rate may have been different as it passed through different hosts before humans. Ebright tells ScienceInsider that the 2019-nCoV data are “consistent with entry into the human population as either a natural accident or a laboratory accident.””"
2020-02-13 14:49:36,"COVID-19 (Wuhan Corona virus) has evolved to outsmart the human race and anyone who thinks otherwise is being deceptive. As I have been saying all along there are many unknowns about the dirty tricks this virus plays. To base any diagnostic criteria on not knowing enough was bound to cause confusion and ignorant actions. It all started with unfair denial of the warnings from DR. Li WenLiang who had to lay down his life to make his countrymen believe his warnings and the accept the impending disaster that was to fall on his country. 

Common health officials in China. Always remember truth will set you free and ignorance is not bliss, it will result in mistrust and harm an optimal response and the cause of eradication of this deadly, highly contagious and sturdy virus."
2020-02-13 14:50:23,"It is striking how little perspective is being sought in these stories.  For instance, the Times ran a story yesterday about a person testing OK and then later testing positive for the virus.  Scary; makes you question reliability of tests.  But follow-up elsewhere, from CDC was that an initial test was mistakenly not performed on that individual; the positive test was the only test done.  Keep a skeptical eye about what you read."
2020-02-13 15:05:31,"The emperor of China has assured the emperor of the United States that there is no problem.  This will go away by itself this summer because it will be too hot for the virus to spread.

Nothing to see here.  No action need be taken.  Our emperor has the highest regard for his counterpart and feels that cutting funding to the very agencies that would need to deal with this is an appropriate response."
2020-02-13 15:13:28,"NYTimes need to send assets to the undeveloped world and find out what’s going on there. All the focus reporting on China and China bashing is distracting everyone from the real threat: countries without the money and resources to contain the infection.

Yesterday NYTimes reported Indonesia reported no cases so far even through surrounding countries all have. I am looking at the tracker maintained by Johns Hopkins and there is big gaping hole from South Asia, Africa and Latin America.

India reported 3 cases, Sri Lanka 1, Africa and Latin America all 0. I check the tracker daily and I think India and Sri Lanka reported the same number 2 weeks ago.

North America, Europe, and East Asia all have numbers creeping up on a daily basis but the rest of the world none? Japan and Korea each have 28 cases, Singapore 58, Hong Kong 51, Macau 10, Australia 15, Finland and Sweden 1 each. These are the wealthiest, cleanest countries with longest life expectancy and they have problem isolating patients but India and Nigeria do?"
2020-02-13 15:10:46,"For context, how many cases of flu are there currently, and how many people have passed away from the flu this season?"
2020-02-13 15:44:14,"Back in 2003 people were claiming that it will be a world wide epidemic and in the end the casualties were minuscule in comparison to the likes of the flu. 

Of course, the mortality rate is higher for Coronavirus. However there is also a much greater focus on the prevention of its spread. Much of China is locked down on an unprecedented scale and fact of the matter is that if there is no human-to-human contact, the virus can't spread. Sooner or later the spread will slow.

The real risk is the virus spreading to countries with less efficient infrastructure and governance. That risk is greatly reduced due to the quarantine in place in China.

The telling sign is that the Chinese government is confident enough now to allow some companies to return to work."
2020-02-13 15:52:24,How many people who had the coronavirus have recovered?
2020-02-13 15:56:22,"At what point do we start questioning any products coming from the affected area?  Half of the worlds production comes from China.  Seems logical to ask how this virus can impact possibly exported products.  If most of the world is restricting travel on people, shouldn't we be considering the same for products coming from China???"
2020-02-13 16:15:41,"The statistical models are probably more useful than the reported numbers at this point.   There is a nice article in the LA Times about the four tiers of cases and how you try to measure each using different methods.  

At this point too, it would be interesting to see the course of the illness in people who have recovered."
2020-02-13 16:24:56,"It is hard as yet for real scientists to know the extent of this new coronavirus epidemic, its virulence and its infectiousness. Scientists know what they do not yet know,. It's the politicians like Xi and Trump who make predictions based on muddled, unscientific thought processes who have been coming up with all sorts of statements of imagined fact, when, in fact, they don't know what they don't know. Trump tweets that the virus will die in April when the temperature warms up. Anyone who believes anything Trump predicts deserves what will happen if they act on Trump's predictions."
2020-02-13 16:36:43,"What would happen if we stopped panicking and treated the Coronavirus like the flu?  We are not China, we have a health system that works and can address issues like this without full on pandemic response.  Let us remember that we have a grand total of 15 cases in the US, versus 9 million to 49 million cases of the flu each year.  Those cases of the flu result in 12,000 to 40,000 deaths each year.  We have yet to have a death in the US due to the Coronavirus.

I am wondering if perhaps we are reacting like 'Chicken Little'  ""The sky is falling, The sky is falling!!"""
2020-02-13 17:07:49,"Not really a shocker... it’s just that the Chinese government finally decided to accept doctors’ diagnoses in the statistical count. Previously the diagnosis could only be counted if a governmental test kit was used, and the test kits were in short supply and hard to get. So, as the supply of test kits dwindled, the epidemic seemed to be fading. But when the rules changed, the true picture emerged."
2020-02-13 16:11:20,"While we all prefer a genetic test, China is telling us they don't have the resources. A test kit shortage is causing them to triage testing based on preliminary evaluations. You can imagine how such a system would produce horrifically inaccurate results. The test is perfectly accurate. Determining when to administer the test is fatally flawed.

Enter lung screening. Far less accurate than a genetic test but easily administered to anyone who shows up at a health facility. An analyst's worst nightmare though.

You've reset the baseline on how we identify Wuhan virus. All the old data are only comparable with themselves. China basically admitted all their current data aren't worth saving. They're starting over from scratch. A backwards admission that China believes their old data are garbage anyway.

We therefore have absolutely no idea what is actually going on with coronavirus right now. This on the day we learn a taxi driver in Japan has contracted the disease without contact with the cruise ship. While I'm not one to panic over infectious diseases, we should all be increasingly alarmed."
2020-02-13 16:12:50,Coronavirus spreading to India?
2020-02-13 15:56:09,"Press reports seem to be coming out every day with unverified  information about the number of cases. Enough ""Fake News"" already! We only know the number of cases that tested positive for the disease via actual genetic or serologic analysis. We do not know how many people sick or not are carrying the virus but have never been tested. Info that is not scientifically documented is as useful as a Tweet from Trump."
2020-02-13 17:47:41,May be the reason? Don't be ridiculous. Of course it's the diagnostic criteria.
2020-02-13 16:23:53,"That 14000 new cases would be known as off-balance sheet items in accounting. The new party boss refused to take the job unless they were cleaned up. It won't be long before he starts to hide things of his own. That's how these Communists roll, and the joke is on you if you believe them, or the WHO."
2020-02-13 16:22:04,"I'm sure no scientist, but doesn't it seem logical to assume that because of the massive increase in ""officially reported"" cases that not only is 2019-n-CoV capable of being spread by air, contaminated body fluids and feces, it also may be surviving for long periods of time on both hard and soft surfaces that are being touched, coughed near or sneezed near by an infected person, including clothing, desks, doors, handles, windows, countertops, and trash receptacles where discarded contaminated tissues and latex gloves are tossed, etc."
2020-02-13 16:42:56,"Could someone including NYTimes shad some light on this. I was just checking WeChat and some friends posted they have seen reports of 6000 people quarantined in southern India. The photos have signs in English and Tamil pointing to “corona isolation ward” and healthcare workers in full protective gears.

Numbers from WHO still shows India at 3 cases from 2 weeks ago."
2020-02-13 15:39:24,"I'm amazed that in al the coverage, not one word about the case of Typhoid Mary!"
2020-02-13 20:24:18,If you think the numbers are bad now just wait until this virus mutates again. I think that is what really has China worried. Weaponizing viruses can go horribly wrong.
2020-02-13 20:26:34,"Time to send The Donald to China.  He alone can fix it.  And maybe get himself a Nobel Prize or a magazine cover in the process.  Also, a good way to distract from proposed funding cuts to CDC.  Sounds like a win-win to me."
2020-02-13 20:52:18,"Reading through the comments, I'm convinced that people really want to be in a full-on panic about this insignificant virus.  Maybe lots of Walking Dead fans that are really yearning for that kind of apocalypse, not that it's possible.

So I don't know folks, if you want to wear a face mask for no reason, hide under your bed, and attack Asian people out of mindless racism, I guess I can't stop you.  It'd be amazing if next year, once this has faded away to nothing like SARS did, you realized how silly and hysterical you were about it, but frankly I don't think most people have that kind of self-awareness."
2020-02-13 21:14:30,"A lot of people and organizations point the finger of blame for the spreading corona virus epidemic to China and Chinese authorities.  I wonder how much more effective the United States would be under the brilliant and humane leadership of Donald Trump.  Will we also be quarantined in internment camps along with the illegal immigrants, or perhaps be sent back to where we came from?"
2020-02-14 00:54:24,"NY times, really? The increase is due to using a different standard to count the cases not because of new cases appearing. if this is the quality of journalism NY represents, there is no hope in this country."
2020-02-14 00:42:55,"What the experts are saying about the #Coronavirus . OY!

“We’re in unknown territory,”

“This outbreak could still go in any direction,”

“It makes it really confusing right now""

“We’re in the dark in terms of knowing what to expect next.”"
2020-02-13 21:51:07,Does anybody can confirm if this virus confers any kind of post infection temporary or permanent immunity to the patients affected? Is there any reported case of reinfection?Thanks so much.
2020-02-14 02:49:13,"Trump is elderly and very obese, in the very highest risk group likely to die from this."
2020-02-14 02:25:33,"The increase was due to a re-catergorization of suspects.   Things are seemingly under control and China is working furiously on all fronts to fight and contain COVID-19.  A promising approach is the use of TCM cures.  

COVID-19 has been used by the Trump Administration and Taiwan's DPP Administration as political weapons to demonize China, which is unfortunate and inhumane.  At least the rest of the world is more benign and supportive, offering aid.    

There is no need for panic about COVID-19. It should be noted that influenza has killed 12,000 Americans this flu season so far, between 10/1/19 and 2/1/20.  

Each year over 40,000 Americans die from flu, which is astounding.  So Americans should not be as arrogant as Wilbur Ross in jeering about the misfortune of China."
2020-02-14 08:15:08,"I understand people's comparison with flu, and use this type of argument myself when threats are over stated. But in this case the flu comparison isn't the comfort some claim. 

Covid-19 is more transmissible than seasonal flu and has a 10-20 times higher fatality rate. 

So the fact isn't...flu kills 50,000 Americans a year so we shouldn't worry about Covid-19

The fact is...flu already kills 50,000 Americans a year and we've something heading our way which may be more than 20 times worse. 

With that in mind, some sensible preparation now...right now...is not an over reaction or panic.  

Smug flu comparisons will not help feed your family when supply chains are stressed."
2020-02-14 06:18:07,"Can we please not panic over this. The idea that there is now a shortage on N 95 masks is very concerning, Will there be a shortage of the masks in the nations hospitals where they are a critical personal protective equipment? as far as we know 1400 people have died of the novel corona virus worldwide. so far this flu season there have been 12000 deaths in the U.S. alone. Use common sense methods, handwashing, staying away from people exhibiting symptoms and your chances of contracting the virus are minimal."
2020-02-13 12:46:22,"Over the past ten years, USA deaths have averaged 50,000 just from regular flu. This corona virus is minuscule compared to regular flu. It will continue to be. The media is hysterical and not putting this into a rational perspective. It may effect the Chinese economy over the next few months only. The biggest impact is the USA Elite Democrat Media trying to make this into something big in order to influence the 2020 November general election for the Democrats. The Democrats are desperate and have nothing else."
2020-02-13 13:19:39,"No one with any common sense believed it was leveling off despite what the paid ""experts"" stated. China lied in the beginning, is still lying and will attempt lying again. The irony is that their attempt to reclassify how they count cases just backfired and exposed more lying."
2020-02-12 21:52:02,Can't this just be detected under a microscope? Is it really that difficult to test for?
2020-02-12 21:54:14,"So many have criticized China for not eagerly accepting help from the Big Boys at our very own CDC. Between this and the little label mishap, we can now better understand China's reluctance. Maybe it's the Trump cuts, maybe something else, but if you want competence, don't look here.

God help us when corona gets here. We are going to look positively stone age compared to Wuhan. And, I am not saying that they are doing such a great job there."
2020-02-12 22:31:08,It is extremely challenging to produce a new assay for a new disease and make it work among labs around the world. There are so many variables to control. But the CDC is outstanding. I hope they are adequately funded.
2020-02-12 22:36:58,"Hope they have several language translators to instruct that all 320,000 tests or test ingredients world wide are destroyed.  Because it would be bad if somebody in some lab somewhere in the world didn't get the message.  Sorta like like the High School kids that didn't understand what the CDC meant by self monitoring at home, so they went back to 3 High Schools in Newport News VA after returning from China.  I guess they thought that when they were at home that's when they should monitor.  

CDC deciding that a Lab Tech needs to be present at Quarantine areas to make sure labels are right means this org is not ready to go to China.  Going to China was probably motivated by how much more money they could ask for rather than any real contribution.  Maybe time for some changes in the CDC."
2020-02-12 22:39:31,"The people in charge of communicating crucial information to us use simple words like ""kit"" that don't tell us the type of sample required, the type of test, the accuracy, the uncertainty, etc. No wonder there is so much confusion."
2020-02-12 23:32:20,And things will only improve with CDC budget cuts and reduced contributions WHO contributions?
2020-02-12 23:44:25,"No surprise here.  I expected incompetence.  The government is never competent.  Think how they would manage health care and the degradation caused to health if that was the only option.   With the coronavirus test, the CDC is currently the only option. These tests should be performed by a private diagnostic company such as Lab Corp.  Then the tests will be far more reliable."
2020-02-13 00:17:55,"Everything is being done in a rush, and there is a tradeoff between risk of not having kits ready in time and risk of kits not being accurate.  We'll experience that same kind of tradeoff for many other COVID2019 related items as well, e.g., vaccines. 

I am very appreciative that the CDC is rolling along."
2020-02-13 00:19:15,So some coronavirus testing kits are flawed.  The CDC should've realized something was off when it got a great deal on the kits. Turns out they came from Iowa.
2020-02-12 22:40:24,"We are NOT prepared to deal with the virus here in the States. The CDC has been gutted and we're unable to just lock down an entire city like China did with Wuhan.

Can you imagine trying to quarantine NYC? It's not going to happen.

God help us when it finally arrives in force here. Trump will find some way to blame somebody else for being ill-prepared I'm sure."
2020-02-12 23:34:55,"This is beyond ridiculous. CDC needs to be held accountable for its failures. 

Coronavirus presence can be detected by a simple PCR test, these kinds of tests are routinely ran in all major clinics. It doesn't require any special knowledge or materials.

But right now clinics can't legally run this test. And all CDC needs is to allow it."
2020-02-12 21:59:30,Imagine how many unknowingly infected people by the coronavirus were released because of the broken testing kits and are spreading the virus now. Truly scare times.
2020-02-12 23:08:33,"Wow, first the CDC mistakenly tells a hospital that a woman’s test was negative when it had not been tested; and then they send out nonworking test kits? 

I am assuming they are hopelessly understaffed and unprepared. Please, please, CDC employees get your rest, take care of yourselves  and proceed slowly and carefully. Take a deep breath! Slow and accurate beats fast and wrong."
2020-02-13 00:36:58,"I hope readers realize that one month ago, when the Chinese government first discovered the virus, there were no ready-made test kits. Chinese researchers have to develop a new test, make sure it's reliable, and then mass produce hundreds of thousands of them in short order, distributing them all over China. 

This fiasco with the CDC in delivering merely 200 kits, when the testing procedure is already well known, reflects poorly on the US's ability to respond to epidemics. 

We should also keep in mind that there is an ongoing flu epidemic in the US with 22 million cases of the illness in the US, 210,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 deaths. <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/07/health/flu-season-high/index.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/07/health/flu-season-high/index.html</a>"
2020-02-13 00:57:54,"Great reporting by Denise Grady  - as usual.
The CDC has been stonewalling the media.
Yesterday the Wall Street Journal reported their failure to respond to messages.
I have been trying to report on the Wuhan evacuees in San Antonio for MedPage Today since last Thursday. The CDC media person I was directed to does not answer emails with specific questions about the quarantine/testing process including questions about the accuracy of the test for the virus. The WSJ reported that Japanese officials have questioned whether sputum samples need to be obtained from deep down bronchial passages vs. only from the oral cavity.
