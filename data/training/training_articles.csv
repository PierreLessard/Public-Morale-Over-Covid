Covid:
On Tuesday November 23 scientists in South Africa alerted the world to a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID-19. Officially named the B.1.1.529 variant it has been dubbed Omicron as part of the World Health Organization (WHO)s Greek naming system and has put health officials and researchers around the world on high alert as they make sense of its potential implications for the ongoing global pandemic.
In addition to South Africa the new variant has been detected in at least 15 countries in Africa Europe and North America according to CNN prompting myriad restrictions on international travel. The variant is likely already present in additional countries including the United States The Wall Street Journal reports.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus describes the Omicron variant as perilous and precarious according to Reuters. Its too soon to tell whether Omicron will continue to spread internationally or if it will overtake Delta as the primary variant of concern The Wall Street Journal notes. Many SARS-CoV-2 variants that initially seemed concerning have fizzled out over time. Still the WHO designated Omicron as its fifth Variant of Concern on November 26.
Little is known about the new variant but experts have been working to glean insights from its long list of mutations as well as the preliminary clinical reports from South Africa. That early evidence suggests that Omicron may be even more infectious than the Delta variant that previously overtook the globe which was in turn more infectious than previous forms of the virus some experts say. Virologist Pei-Yong Shi of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston tells NPR that the rapid spread to several South African provinces is concerning as it may indicate the variant is outcompeting Delta. But University of Massachusetts Medical School virologist Jeremy Luban stresses that its too early to tell. Everyone is afraid that Omicron will be significantly more transmissible than Delta. Upon first impression it looks like it could be he tells NPR. But that could be totally wrong. Right now nobody knows. The problem is that our data is very limited.
Scripps Research infectious disease researcher Kristian Andersen tells Science that the sudden increase in Omicron infectious could be largely driven by superspreading events such as university or sports events rather than increased transmissibility. Its similarly difficult to say anything about how severe infections from the variant are based on the limited number of cases reported to date notes a WHO update.  
See Dissecting the Unusual Biology of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant
The Omicron variant diverges from the original SARS-CoV-2 virus by about 50 mutations including more than two dozen in the spike protein Nature reports—far more than any other variant of SARS-CoV-2. Alex Sigal a virologist at the University of KaZulu-Natal tells The Wall Street Journal that its likely that the variant accumulated so many changes by surviving in a single patient for months where it could slowly morph from a variant known as B.1.1 (which by now has nearly vanished from the world) into Omicron. According to the WHO the earliest sample of the variant was collected on November 9 but when and where the variant originated remains uncertain—especially in light of the discovery of Omicron in stored European samples reports NPR. Its detection in South Africa could be because of the countrys robust genomic surveillance program rather than proximity to the variants emergence says STAT.
The spike protein mutations have public health experts especially concerned as most of the highly effective neutralizing antibodies including those in antibody drugs such as Regenerons REGN-COV2 as well as those whose production is triggered by all of the COVID-19 vaccines available globally target that protein. This could mean that Omicron can better evade natural and vaccine-induced immunity says White House Chief Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci according to The Hill. However it will take time—perhaps weeks—for experts to sort out whether or to what extent thats the case according to the WHO update.
According to The Guardian South African doctor Unben Pillay told reporters at a November 29 briefing that Omicron cases have been typically mild to date and that vaccinated people tend to do much better. Cases are also heavily skewed towards the unvaccinated South African health officials have noted. Together these may indicate that the vaccines retain at least some degree of efficacy but the countrys low vaccination rates—about 65 percent of people over 60 have received at least one dose and closer to 25 percent of adults under 35 according to The Guardian—make drawing conclusions about efficacy difficult.
Indeed the fact that many countries in southern Africa that have inoculated only small percentages of their people means that vaccine protection aside these areas must prepare for the worse says Rudo Mathivha head of the intensive care unit at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto South Africa. We know we have a new variant she tells members of the media in a press briefing reports the Associated Press. The worst-case scenario is that it hits us like Delta . . . we need to have critical care beds ready.

Pharmaceutical companies say theyre monitoring the situation to see if modifications to their vaccines need to be made. Pfizer and Moderna previously stated that it would take about six weeks to alter their mRNA vaccines according to CNN and spokespeople from both companies tell The New York Times that theyre investigating whether such alterations are necessary or if booster shots will fend off the Omicron variant.
In addition to the novel spike protein mutations the Omicron variant contains ones seen in previous variants. These include E484K which studies suggest helps the coronavirus elude antibodies as well as N501Y which is implicated in making both the Alpha and Gamma variants more infectious CNN reports. However fully understanding how these and the variants other mutations may alter the dynamics of Omicron infections will require researchers to gather and analyze a lot more data over the coming days and weeks.
In the meantime experts emphasize that masking washing hands and social distancing remain helpful.
We have been through all of this before with the Alpha and Delta variant University of Leicester clinical virologist Julian Tang tells Science Focus. But the main difference is that the scientific evidence for the effectiveness of masks and social distancing has increased—and there is more conviction now amongst scientists that these measures do work to reduce the spread of the virus.
Symptomless transmission makes the coronavirus far harder to fight. But health officials dismissed the risk for months pushing misleading and contradictory claims in the face of mounting evidence.
MUNICH  Dr. Camilla Rothe was about to leave for dinner when the government laboratory called with the surprising test result. Positive. It was Jan. 27. She had just discovered Germanys first case of the new coronavirus.
But the diagnosis made no sense. Her patient a businessman from a nearby auto parts company could have been infected by only one person: a colleague visiting from China. And that colleague should not have been contagious.
The visitor had seemed perfectly healthy during her stay in Germany. No coughing or sneezing no signs of fatigue or fever during two days of long meetings. She told colleagues that she had started feeling ill after the flight back to China. Days later she tested positive for the coronavirus.
Scientists at the time believed that only people with symptoms could spread the coronavirus. They assumed it acted like its genetic cousin SARS.
People who know much more about coronaviruses than I do were absolutely sure recalled Dr. Rothe an infectious disease specialist at Munich University Hospital.
But if the experts were wrong if the virus could spread from seemingly healthy carriers or people who had not yet developed symptoms the ramifications were potentially catastrophic. Public-awareness campaigns airport screening and stay-home-if-youre sick policies might not stop it. More aggressive measures might be required  ordering healthy people to wear masks for instance or restricting international travel.
Dr. Rothe and her colleagues were among the first to warn the world. But even as evidence accumulated from other scientists leading health officials expressed unwavering confidence that symptomless spreading was not important.
In the days and weeks to come politicians public health officials and rival academics disparaged or ignored the Munich team. Some actively worked to undermine the warnings at a crucial moment as the disease was spreading unnoticed in French churches Italian soccer stadiums and Austrian ski bars. A cruise ship the Diamond Princess would become a deadly harbinger of symptomless spreading.
The two-month delay was a product of faulty scientific assumptions academic rivalries and perhaps most important a reluctance to accept that containing the virus would take drastic measures. The resistance to emerging evidence was one part of the worlds sluggish response to the virus.
It is impossible to calculate the human toll of that delay but models suggest that earlier aggressive action might have saved tens of thousands of lives. Countries like Singapore and Australia which used testing and contact-tracing and moved swiftly to quarantine seemingly healthy travelers fared far better than those that did not.
This was I think a very simple truth Dr. Rothe said. I was surprised that it would cause such a storm. I cant explain it.
Even now with more than 9 million cases around the world and a death toll approaching 500000 Covid-19 remains an unsolved riddle. It is too soon to know whether the worst has passed or if a second global wave of infections is about to crash down. But it is clear that an array of countries from secretive regimes to overconfident democracies have fumbled their response misjudged the virus and ignored their own emergency plans.
It is also painfully clear that time was a critical commodity in curbing the virus  and that too much of it was wasted.
She Was Not Ill
On the night of Germanys first positive test the virus had seemed far away. Fewer than 100 fatalities had been reported worldwide. Italy which would become Europes ground zero would not record its first cases for another three days.
A few reports out of China had already suggested the possibility of symptomless spreading. But nobody had proved it could happen.
That night Dr. Rothe tapped out an email to a few dozen doctors and public health officials.
Infections can actually be transmitted during the incubation period she wrote.
Three more employees from the auto parts company Webasto tested positive the following day. Their symptoms were so mild that normally its likely that none would have been flagged for testing or have thought to stay at home.
Dr. Rothe decided she had to sound the alarm. Her boss Dr. Michael Hoelscher dashed off an email to The New England Journal of Medicine. We believe that this observation is of utmost importance he wrote.
Editors responded immediately. How soon could they see the paper?
From her perspective she was not ill said Nadine Schian a Webasto spokeswoman who was on the call. She said OK I felt tired. But Ive been in Germany a lot of times before and I always have jet lag.
When the health officials described the call Dr. Rothe and Dr. Hoelscher quickly finished and submitted their article. Dr. Rothe did not talk to the patient herself but said she relied on the health authority summary.
Within hours it was online. It was a modest clinical observation at a key time. Just days earlier the World Health Organization had said it needed more information about this very topic.
What the authors did not know however was that in a suburb 20 minutes away another group of doctors had also been rushing to publish a report. Neither knew what the other was working on a seemingly small academic rift that would have global implications.
Academic Hairsplitting
The second group was made up of officials with the Bavarian health authority and Germanys national health agency known as the Robert Koch Institute. Inside a suburban office doctors unfurled mural paper and traced infection routes using colored pens.
Their team led by the Bavarian epidemiologist Dr. Merle BÃ¶hmer submitted an article to The Lancet another premier medical journal. But the Munich hospital group had scooped them by three hours. Dr. BÃ¶hmer said her teams article which went unpublished as a result had reached similar conclusions but worded them slightly differently.
Dr. Rothe had written that patients appeared to be contagious before the onset of any symptoms. The government team had written that patients appeared to be contagious before the onset of full symptoms  at a time when symptoms were so mild that people might not even recognize them.
The Chinese woman for example had woken up in the middle of the night feeling jet-lagged. Wanting to be sharp for her meetings she took a Chinese medicine called 999  containing the equivalent of a Tylenol tablet  and went back to bed.
Perhaps that had masked a mild fever? Perhaps her jet lag was actually fatigue? She had reached for a shawl during a meeting. Maybe that was a sign of chills?
Editors there decided that the dispute amounted to hairsplitting. If it took a lengthy interview to identify symptoms how could anyone be expected to do it in the real world?
The question was whether she had something consistent with Covid-19 or that anyone would have recognized at the time was Covid-19 said Dr. Eric Rubin the journals editor.
The answer seemed to be no.
Early in the pandemic some believed that the arrival of summer would make COVID-19 cases drop much like the flu. In March 2020 Brazils president Jair Bolsonaro implied that his country should not expect a COVID-19 crisis like that in Italy at the time given the totally different climates of the two places. Maybe this goes away with heat and light said then–US President Donald Trump the following month.  
But the increased number of cases in the US and other countries in the Northern Hemisphere in the summer of 2020 contradicted these predictions. Moreover the tropics were not spared from high death tolls despite their lack of wintry weather. Brazil and India emerged for instance as two of the leading pandemic hotspots.  
These events illustrate that climate has not governed whether COVID-19 emerges or vanishes in a given place or time. But nearly two years after the first reported cases the available data are allowing researchers to better explore the role of meteorological factors in case numbers and their results point to low temperature low humidity and limited sunlight as conditions that foster the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Currently factors such as human behavior outweigh the influence of weather but experts say its likely that COVID-19 will eventually be a seasonal disease.  
COVID-19s seasonal signatures
We cannot rely on climate to make SARS-CoV-2 to disappear says Sen Pei an epidemiologist at Columbia University. But while thats now clear early on there were reasons to suspect that SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive to temperature and other climatic factors. These included the fact that respiratory infections tend to be seasonal and that the new viruss structure seemed likely to be sensitive to temperature humidity and sunlight.  
In 2020 various research groups began trying to ferret out whether there was a role for climate in COVID-19 but given the limited data available then they did not reach a consensus. For instance positive negative and nonsignificant associations were observed between temperature and viral transmission by different teams. More recent studies have been more consistent in identifying negative correlations between temperature and transmission although the degree of its influence is still a subject of debate.  
Pei and his colleagues for instance estimated this June that the combined effects of temperature humidity and ultraviolet radiation explain 17.5 percent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 2669 US counties from March to December 2020. Two global studies by different groups published in October 2021 also concluded that weather matters although one identified temperature and humidity as strong drivers of transmission during specific periods of time—as in other climate-sensitive diseases—while the second found only a modest role for these factors and emphasized that government interventions in the early stage of the pandemic appeared to be much more determinant. 
One of the multinational analyses was led by Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) climate and health scientist Xavier Rodó who has previously studied the relationship between climatic factors and diseases such as cholera malaria and seasonal flu. His team has identified that in such seasonal diseases weather and transmission are coupled transiently—that is factors like temperature and humidity influence the incidence of cases for specific periods of time. These couplings however may last only a few days or weeks at most followed by periods where little or no association is observed explains Rodó. 
Climatic process tend to act in the form of thresholds he says. For instance above or below a specific temperature or humidity level intense short-term transient associations between meteorological variables and case numbers are more likely to be detected. 
Using data from 162 countries collected from March to October 2020 Rodó and colleagues looked for this pattern in COVID-19 searching for transient couplings in time windows of different lengths (from 14 to 75 days) and across different space scales (country region and city). They found consistent negative associations between temperature and humidity and COVID-19 cases especially in the first two pandemic waves. Strong correlations were also more common at temperatures between 12 and 18°C. These temporal associations sometimes accounted for more than 80 percent of the total variability in cases in three regions they zoomed in: Lombardy in Italy Thüringen in Germany and Catalonia in Spain.  
The influence of these meteorological factors acts on top of other processes such as the behavior of people given the nature of the disease and how it is transmitted he adds. But Rodó foresees that in certain latitudes essentially in the temperate climates weather may become one of the main factors driving the disease if community transmission levels are low.  
The strength of this study is that they applied this method to many different countries . . . with various control measures says Pei and if they observe consistent patterns in the seasonality that is an indication that maybe the virus has some seasonality there. 
Weather matters to a point
Temperature and humidity affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission but government interventions impact was six times greater early in the pandemic concluded the other international study published in October which focused on the first wave of COVID-19 in 409 cities across 26 countries (using data collected from February to April 2020). 
Francesco Sera a statistician and epidemiologist who worked on the study while at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine explains that the team characterized the epidemic growth for each city in the first 20 days after the first locally-transmitted cases were detected there. The researchers analyzed that growth along with contemporaneous environmental data while controlling for socioeconomic variables such as population density and gross domestic product and pollution levels. Importantly he adds they also considered government measures to combat the virus as drawn from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Tracker.  
The teams analysis found that temperature and humidity accounted for 2.4 and 2 percent of the variation in transmission rates respectively based on the effective reproductive number. In contrast government policy responses such as school closures restrictions on gatherings and testing programs explained 13.8 percent of that variability.  
Overall the methods [used by Sera and colleagues] are very robust says Maggie Sugg an environmental health scientist at the Appalachian State University who was not involved in the study. Climate is just one small part of the puzzle she adds but nonetheless it is important to understand its role in order to tackle COVID-19 from every angle. 
Although they ask a similar question the two multinational studies use different methodologies and focus on different locations and different stages of the pandemic. Thus it isnt possible to closely compare their results but according to Pei the consistent readout for both papers and his own work is that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is certainly modulated by climate factors like temperature humidity but that these are not currently the dominant factors driving it.  
Both of these studies are some of the best in the field right now in terms of trying to pinpoint an effect says Princeton University epidemiologist Rachel Baker who did not participate in either of them or Peis earlier study. They are using some of the best approaches out there to understand the impact of weather in COVID-19 yet it is a tricky signal to detect right now. She explains that a lot of data is needed to detect such a signal—for instance to compare warmer versus colder years—so it may yet be too early to reach an absolute conclusion on the seasonality of COVID-19.  
As SARS-CoV-2 is an emergent pathogen it has colonized everything on its way says Rodó and thus we have it in winter and summer in colder and warmer locations. During this early stage the high number of susceptible people has been a more fundamental driver of the pandemic than weather according to a modeling study Baker and her colleagues published last summer. It might be she says that only after population immunity increases over time will we see a more evident climate signature and more seasonal patterns of outbreaks. 
A preference for cold dry and not too sunny  
In addition to epidemiological studies identifying the role of meteorological factors in SARS-CoV-2 transmission the viruss behavior inside the lab points to a preference for winterlike conditions. In lab experiments higher intensity of simulated sunlight higher temperature and higher humidity result in a faster decay of the virus in aerosols.  
We know that at low relative humidity [aerosols] dry out explains University of Nebraska Medical Center aerosol scientist Shanna Ratnesar-Shumate and this seems to contribute to the infectivity of the virus. Changes in temperature and humidity within the aerosols may be either friendly or toxic to the virus but what exactly happens within that microenvironment under those changes is not yet entirely understood.  
But the climate-dependent survival of SARS-CoV-2 in the aerosols may not be the only explanation for its success in cold and dry environments in real life. Independently of what happens to the virus within these particles other factors may contribute to its higher infectivity at certain temperature and humidity levels. For instance aerosols shrink in dry environments which allows them to float around more easily increasing the chances that the viral particles inside will infect someone. Additionally small aerosols can bypass the barriers in the respiratory system so they can reach to the deeper parts of the lungs says Rodó. 
Regardless the specific chemical physical and physiological explanation for the viruss weather preference Ratnesar-Shumate says that judging by the results of laboratory studies on the seasonal flu and those on SARS-CoV-2 theres really nothing that lends to one being different from the other in terms of [their] seasonality. Furthermore we know other cold-causing coronaviruses are also seasonal. Thus she says she thinks that COVID-19 will eventually converge on seasonality.  
A disease of winter?  
While Rodó and his colleagues conclude that COVID-19 is a seasonal low-temperature infection Sera who is now at the at the University of Florence argues that we need more time—many more years of observation before that can be known for certain.  
Rodó concedes that COVID-19 has not yet organized as a normal seasonal disease. But seasonal outbreaks nevertheless are occurring he adds as winter conditions in some places facilitate airborne transmission which he says can affect infection rates even though you can have the process being dominated by other factors. 
Whether this year will see a winter wave in the Northern Hemisphere will depend on several factors Pei says. These include the percentage of the population with immunity (due to vaccines or previous infection) possible new variants and human behavior. If a decline in case numbers leads people to relax their social distancing and other protective measures this will create more opportunity of transmission in the winter he says. 
As Sera and his colleagues conclude in their paper there are no climate conditions that could impede SARS-CoV-2 transmission if preventive measures are not taken. But knowing that the virus is likely more transmissible in winter we may want to take better precautions this time of the year advises Pei.   
The journal did not publish the letter. But that would not be the end of it.
That weekend Andreas Zapf the head of the Bavarian health authority called Dr. Hoelscher of the Munich clinic. Look the people in Berlin are very angry about your publication Dr. Zapf said according to Dr. Hoelscher.
He suggested changing the wording of Dr. Rothes report and replacing her name with those of members of the government task force Dr. Hoelscher said. He refused.
The health agency would not discuss the phone call.
Until then Dr. Hoelscher said their report had seemed straightforward. Now it was clear: Politically this was a major major issue.
A Complete Tsunami
On Monday Feb. 3 the journal Science published an article calling Dr. Rothes report flawed. Science reported that the Robert Koch Institute had written to the New England Journal to dispute her findings and correct an error.
The Robert Koch Institute declined repeated interview requests over several weeks and did not answer written questions.
Dr. Rothes report quickly became a symbol of rushed research. Scientists said she should have talked to the Chinese patient herself before publishing and that the omission had undermined her teams work. On Twitter she and her colleagues were disparaged by scientists and armchair experts alike.
It broke over us like a complete tsunami Dr. Hoelscher said.
The controversy also overshadowed another crucial development out of Munich.
The next morning Dr. Clemens-Martin Wendtner made a startling announcement. Dr. Wendtner was overseeing treatment of Munichs Covid-19 patients  there were eight now  and had taken swabs from each.
He discovered the virus in the nose and throat at much higher levels and far earlier than had been observed in SARS patients. That meant it probably could spread before people knew they were sick.
But the Science story drowned that news out. If Dr. Rothes paper had implied that governments might need to do more against Covid-19 the pushback from the Robert Koch Institute was an implicit defense of the conventional thinking.
Swedens public health agency declared that Dr. Rothes report had contained major errors. The agencys website said unequivocally that there is no evidence that people are infectious during the incubation period  an assertion that would remain online in some form for months.
South Africas president tests positive for the coronavirus.
Britain will speed up its booster rollout targeting all adults by the end of the year.
Fauci says we have the tools to protect ourselves.
French health officials too left no room for debate: A person is contagious only when symptoms appear a government flyer read. No symptoms = no risk of being contagious.
As Dr. Rothe and Dr. Hoelscher reeled from the criticism Japanese doctors were preparing to board the Diamond Princess cruise ship. A former passenger had tested positive for coronavirus.
Yet on the ship parties continued. The infected passenger had been off the ship for days after all. And he hadnt reported symptoms while onboard.
A Semantic Debate
Immediately after Dr. Rothes report the World Health Organization had noted that patients might transmit the virus before showing symptoms. But the organization also underscored a point that it continues to make: Patients with symptoms are the main drivers of the epidemic.
Once the Science article was published however the organization waded directly into the debate on Dr. Rothes work. On Tuesday Feb. 4 Dr. Sylvie Briand the agencys chief of infectious disease preparedness tweeted a link to the Science article calling Dr. Rothes report flawed.
With that tweet the W.H.O. focused on a semantic distinction that would cloud discussion for months: Was the patient asymptomatic meaning she would never show symptoms? Or pre-symptomatic meaning she became sick later? Or even more confusing oligo-symptomatic meaning that she had symptoms so mild that she didnt recognize them?
To some doctors the focus on these arcane distinctions felt like whistling in the graveyard. A person who feels healthy has no way to know that she is carrying a virus or is about to become sick. Airport temperature checks will not catch these people. Neither will asking them about their symptoms or telling them to stay home when they feel ill.
The W.H.O. later said that the tweet had not been intended as a criticism.
One group paid little attention to this brewing debate: the Munich-area doctors working to contain the cluster at the auto parts company. They spoke daily with potentially sick people monitoring their symptoms and tracking their contacts.
Dr. Rothe though was shaken. She could not understand why much of the scientific establishment seemed eager to play down the risk.
All you need is a pair of eyes she said. You dont need rocket-science virology.
But she remained confident.
We will be proven right she told Dr. Hoelscher.
That night Dr. Rothe received an email from Dr. Michael Libman an infectious-disease specialist in Montreal. He thought that criticism of the paper amounted to semantics. Her paper had convinced him of something: The disease will most likely eventually spread around the world.
Political Paralysis
On Feb. 4 Britains emergency scientific committee met and while its experts did not rule out the possibility of symptomless transmission nobody put much stock in Dr. Rothes paper.
It was very much a hearsay study said Wendy Barclay a virologist and member of the committee known as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. In the absence of real robust epidemiology and tracing it isnt obvious until you see the data.
The data would soon arrive and from an unexpected source. Dr. BÃ¶hmer from the Bavarian health team received a startling phone call in the second week of February.
Virologists had discovered a subtle genetic mutation in the infections of two patients from the Munich cluster. They had crossed paths for the briefest of moments one passing a saltshaker to the other in the company cafeteria when neither had symptoms. Their shared mutation made it clear that one had infected the other.
Dr. BÃ¶hmer had been skeptical of symptomless spreading. But now there was no doubt: It can only be explained with pre-symptomatic transmission Dr. BÃ¶hmer said.
Now it was Dr. BÃ¶hmer who sounded the alarm. She said she promptly shared the finding and its significance with the W.H.O. and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.
The Coronavirus Pandemic: Key Things to Know
Card 1 of 5
The Omicron variant. The latest Covid-19 variant which has been detected in dozens of countries seems to dull the power of the Pfizer vaccine but the company said its boosters offer significant protection. Omicron appears to spread rapidly though it may be less severe than other forms of the virus.
A new wave worries Britain. With cases of the Omicron variant doubling every three days and the government introducing new restrictions the country is bracing for a new coronavirus surge.
Vaccine mandates in Europe. The latest wave of the pandemic is prompting countries like Germany and Italy to impose restrictions that single out those who are not vaccinated. The measures are rekindling the debate over governments right to curtail individual liberties in the name of public health.
Boosters. The F.D.A. authorized Pfizer to provide boosters to 16- and 17-year olds on an emergency basis six months after receiving their second dose of the Covid vaccine. The C.D.C. promptly signed off on the move. Pfizer recently said that a booster shot of its vaccine offers significant protection against Omicron.
The worldwide vaccination campaign. One year into the global vaccine rollout the gap in vaccination rates between high- and low-income countries is wider than ever. Challenges in Zambia highlight how infrastructure issues and the publics hesitancy to get vaccinated are proving to be large obstacles.
Neither organization included the discovery in its regular reports.
A week after receiving Dr. BÃ¶hmers information European health officials were still declaring: We are still unsure whether mild or asymptomatic cases can transmit the virus. There was no mention of the genetic evidence.
The doctors in Munich were increasingly frustrated and confused by the World Health Organization. First the group wrongly credited the Chinese government with alerting the German authorities to the first infection. Government officials and doctors say the auto parts company itself sounded the alarm.
Then the World Health Organizations emergency director Dr. Michael Ryan said on Feb. 27 that the significance of symptomless spreading was becoming a myth. And Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove the organizations technical lead on coronavirus response suggested it was nothing to worry about.
Its rare but possible she said. Its very rare.
The agency still maintains that people who cough or sneeze are more contagious than people who dont. But there is no scientific consensus on how significant this difference is or how it affects the spread of virus.
And so with evidence mounting the Munich team could not understand how the W.H.O. could be so sure that symptomless spreading was insignificant.
At this point for us it was clear said Dr. Wendtner the senior doctor overseeing treatment of the Covid-19 patients. This was a misleading statement by the W.HO.
If This Is True Were in Trouble
The Munich cluster was not the only warning.
The Chinese health authorities had explicitly cautioned that patients were contagious before showing symptoms. A Japanese bus driver was infected while transporting seemingly healthy tourists from Wuhan.
And by the middle of February 355 people aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship had tested positive. About a third of the infected passengers and staff had no symptoms.
But public health officials saw danger in promoting the risk of silent spreaders. If quarantining sick people and tracing their contacts could not reliably contain the disease governments might abandon those efforts altogether.
In Sweden and Britain for example discussion swirled about enduring the epidemic until the population obtained herd immunity. Public health officials worried that might lead to overwhelmed hospitals and needless deaths.
Its not like we had some easy alternative said Dr. Libman the Canadian doctor. The message was basically: If this is true were in trouble.
European health officials say they were reluctant to acknowledge silent spreading because the evidence was trickling in and the consequences of a false alarm would have been severe. These reports are seen everywhere all over the world said Dr. Josep Jansa a senior European Union health official. Whatever we put out theres no way back.
Looking back health officials should have said that yes symptomless spreading was happening and they did not understand how prevalent it was said Dr. Agoritsa Baka a senior European Union doctor.
But doing that she said would have amounted to an implicit warning to countries: What youre doing might not be enough.
Stop Buying Masks!
While public health officials hesitated some doctors acted. At a conference in Seattle in mid-February Jeffrey Shaman a Columbia University professor said his research suggested that Covid-19s rapid spread could only be explained if there were infectious patients with unremarkable symptoms or no symptoms at all.
In the audience that day was Steven Chu the Nobel-winning physicist and former U.S. energy secretary. If left to its own devices this disease will spread through the whole population he remembers Professor Shaman warning.
Afterward Dr. Chu began insisting that healthy colleagues at his Stanford University laboratory wear masks. Doctors in Cambridge England concluded that asymptomatic transmission was a big source of infection and advised local health workers and patients to wear masks well before the British government acknowledged the risk of silent spreaders.
The American authorities faced with a shortage actively discouraged the public from buying masks. Seriously people  STOP BUYING MASKS! Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams tweeted on Feb. 29.
By early March while the World Health Organization continued pressing the case that symptom-free transmission was rare science was breaking in the other direction.
The Hong Kong study concluded that people became infectious about two days before their illness emerged with a peak on their first day of symptoms. By the time patients felt the first headache or scratch in the throat they might have been spreading the disease for days.
In Belgium doctors saw that math in action as Covid-19 tore through nursing homes killing nearly 5000 people.
We thought that by monitoring symptoms and asking sick people to stay at home we would be able to manage the spread said Steven Van Gucht the head of Belgiums Covid-19 scientific committee. It came in through people with hardly any symptoms.
More than 700 people aboard the Diamond Princess were sickened. Fourteen died. Researchers estimate that most of the infection occurred early on while seemingly healthy passengers socialized and partied.
Government scientists in Britain concluded in late April that 5 to 6 percent of symptomless health care workers were infected and might have been spreading the virus.
In Munich Dr. Hoelscher has asked himself many times whether things would have been different if world leaders had taken the issue seriously earlier. He compared their response to a rabbit stumbling upon a poisonous snake.
We were watching that snake and were somehow paralyzed he said.
Acceptance. Or Not.
As the research coalesced in March European health officials were convinced.
OK this is really a big issue Dr. Baka recalled thinking. It plays a big role in the transmission.
By the end of the month the U.S. Centers for Disease Control announced it was rethinking its policy on masks. It concluded that up to 25 percent of patients might have no symptoms.
Since then the C.D.C. governments around the world and finally the World Health Organization have recommended that people wear masks in public.
Still the W.H.O. is sending confusing signals. Earlier this month Dr. Van Kerkhove the technical lead repeated that transmission from asymptomatic patients was very rare. After an outcry from doctors the agency said there had been a misunderstanding.
In all honesty we dont have a clear picture on this yet Dr. Van Kerkhove said. She said she had been referring to a few studies showing limited transmission from asymptomatic patients.

General Motors intends to spend several billion dollars to set up production of batteries and electric pickup trucks at two locations in Michigan giving the companys home state an economic boost a person with knowledge of the plans said Friday.
The automaker has started sketching out proposals to convert an electric car plant in Orion Township to produce electric pickups and to build a new battery plant with a partner LG Electronics near the existing Lansing Delta Township plant this person said.
The company which has laid out ambitious goals for a shift to electric vehicles was more circumspect about its plans in a statement issued Friday. G.M. is developing business cases for potential future investments in Michigan it said. As part of developing a competitive business case we are having discussions with the appropriate local officials on available incentives.
G.M.s prospective development of the Michigan sites was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
The total investment is likely to be more than $4 billion. G.M. previously spent $2 billion to convert a Detroit plant to electric vehicle production. Incentive applications filed to the City of Lansing on Friday showed that G.M. and LG envision investing $2.5 billion in the battery plant and creating 1700 jobs there.
Production of a high-volume pickup truck could significantly increase employment at the Orion Township plant which has been used to make the Chevrolet Bolt an electric compact car. Bolt output has been limited and is currently suspended because of a recall of the battery packs used in the car. When in operation the factory has 1100 workers on a single shift and E.V. production would probably increase production to two or even three shifts.

The investment would be a victory for Michigan as automakers race to begin making battery packs and electric vehicles in high volumes. Several factories are planned for Southern states. Toyota said this week that it would build a battery plant in North Carolina that is supposed to employ 1750 people.
Ford Motor is spending $11.4 billion to build two battery plants in Kentucky and a third battery plant and a new electric truck plant in Tennessee. G.M. has battery plants under construction in Ohio and Tennessee and it plans to add others in Ontario and Mexico.
The spate of investments and job commitments has caused concern among some economic development officials in Michigan that the state was not winning a significant portion of the jobs being created by the auto industrys conversion to electric vehicles.
G.M. Ford Toyota and other traditional automakers are trying to catch up to Tesla which leads in global sales of electric vehicles by a wide margin and has captured the imagination of investors. Tesla has a market value of about $1 trillion  more than G.M. Ford Toyota and several other automakers combined.
G.M. plans to introduce 20 electric vehicles in the United States by 2025. The first few include the GMC Hummer electric pickup and sport-utility models and the Cadillac Lyriq a luxury S.U.V. Those will be built at a plant in Detroit that G.M. now calls Factory Zero. A variety of other E.V.s are supposed to follow including an electric version of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup that is supposed to go into production in early 2023.
These models will use modular battery packs  produced in a joint venture with LG  that G.M. is counting on to help reduce the cost of electric vehicles.
Ford is slightly ahead of G.M. in electric vehicles. It began selling the electric Mustang Mach-E S.U.V. nearly a year ago and it plans to start making an electric pickup the F-150 Lightning in early 2022.
Fords chief executive Jim Farley told CNBC on Thursday that his company had 200000 reservations from customers for the truck and that it was scrambling to increase production capacity to meet demand.
Workers picketing outside of a Kelloggs plant in Battle Creek Mich. last month.
President Biden on Friday waded into a strike involving 1400 employees at four Kellogg plants whom the company said it planned to permanently replace after workers voted down a proposed contract this week.
I am deeply troubled by reports of Kelloggs plans to permanently replace striking workers Mr. Biden said in a statement adding that permanently replacing striking workers is an existential attack on the union and its members jobs and livelihoods.
The strike began on Oct. 5 and has largely focused on the companys two-tier compensation system in which employees hired after 2015 typically receive lower wages and less generous benefits than veteran workers. Many veteran Kellogg workers who the company says earn about $35 per hour on average believe that adding lower-paid workers puts downward pressure on their wages.
Kellogg raised the possibility of hiring permanent replacements in November. The company and the union last week reached a tentative agreement in which the company would lift a cap on the number of workers in the lower tier which was 30 percent under the previous contract. In exchange the company agreed to move all workers with four or more years experience into the veteran tier as well as an amount equivalent to 3 percent of workers at its plants in each of the five years of the contract.
On Tuesday the Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union which represents the workers said its members had overwhelmingly voted against the deal. In response to the result Kellogg said that it would hire permanent replacement employees in positions vacated by striking workers.
A Kellogg spokeswoman Kris Bahner said Friday that the company had posted job listings for permanent replacement roles in each of its four locations and that its hiring process was fully operational. The statement added: Interest in the roles has been strong at all four plants as expected. We expect some of the new hires to start with the company very soon.
After Mr. Bidens statement Ms. Bahner said that the company was ready willing and able to negotiate with the union and that it agreed with the president that this needs to be solved at the bargaining table. Ms. Bahner indicated that the company had moved ahead with permanent replacements out of an obligation to consumers and other employees.
Permanently replacing workers who are striking over economic issues like wages and benefits is legal but Democrats including Mr. Biden have sought to outlaw the practice through the Protecting the Right to Organize Act or PRO Act. The House approved the bill in March but it has stalled in the Senate.
I have long opposed permanent striker replacements and I strongly support legislation that would ban that practice Mr. Biden said in his statement Friday. Such action undermines the critical role collective bargaining plays in providing workers a voice and the opportunity to improve their lives.
The statement is not the first time Mr. Biden has appeared to weigh in on a prominent labor action. The president appeared in a video during a union campaign at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama this year warning that there should be no intimidation no coercion no threats no anti-union propaganda  an unusual interjection by a president during a union election.
Mr. Biden has made no secret of his support for unions over the years. He quickly ousted government officials disliked by unions reversed Trump-era rules that softened worker protections and signed legislation that allocated tens of billions of dollars to stabilize union pension plans.
His $2 trillion climate and social policy bill pending in the Senate includes numerous pro-labor measures including incentives for employers to offer union-scale wages on wind and solar projects.
Better.coms C.E.O. is taking time off after firing 900 workers over Zoom.
Vishal Garg of Better.com said last week to the more than 900 employees gathered on Zoom that they were fired.
Better.coms mercurial chief executive Vishal Garg faced swift backlash for his decision to fire more than 900 employees on a Zoom call last week. The mortgage lenders board announced in a memo sent to staff on Friday that Mr. Garg was taking time off after the very regrettable events.
I come to you with not great news Mr. Garg had said to about 9 percent of his staff in a recording since shared widely online. If youre on this call you are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off. Your employment here is terminated effective immediately.
Better.com which is backed by SoftBank has brought on a third-party firm to assess its leadership and culture according to a copy of the boards memo obtained by The New York Times. Several top employees resigned following the firings two in communications and one in marketing. Better.com did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Christian Chapman 41 a former underwriting trainer at Better.com said he was used to preparing for company meetings by making sure his children werent around because Mr. Garg tended to use foul language. But last Wednesday when he received an unexpected invitation to the company call with Mr. Garg he got a sense of foreboding because the chief executive looked so solemn.
As Mr. Garg impassively delivered the news Mr. Chapman said his gut dropped to the floor and he tried to message teammates to ask what was happening but his computer access was shut off almost immediately.
Ive been through layoffs and usually theres closure because you talk to H.R. you go to your desk and grab your personal belongings and say goodbyes Mr. Chapman said. Theres no closure here. Youre staring at an empty screen in your house.
It took about three hours for him to receive a follow-up email reviewed by The Times that explained the terms of the termination Mr. Chapman added. On Thursday the company increased his termination package from one to two months of pay. He also received a Christmas package containing a trophy certificate and company T-shirt (which his wife offered to burn).
Mr. Chapman said that the chief executives messaging about fired employees stealing from the company by working only two hours a day  which the former employee said was contradicted by his teams recent promotions and raises  had made it challenging for them to apply for new jobs.
Mr. Garg has apologized for his behavior on the Zoom call. In a memo dated Tuesday that was posted on the companys site Mr. Garg said he owned the choice to make layoffs but had blundered the approach.
Starbucks workers at a Buffalo store unionize in a big symbolic win for labor.
Starbucks workers celebrated the outcome of the vote on Thursday in Buffalo.
Employees at a Buffalo-area Starbucks store have voted to form a union making it the only one of the nearly 9000 company-owned stores in the United States to be organized and notching an important symbolic victory for labor at a time when workers across the country are expressing frustration with wages and working conditions.
The result announced on Thursday by the National Labor Relations Board represents a major challenge to the labor model at the giant coffee retailer which has argued that its workers enjoy some of the best wages and benefits in the retail and restaurant industry and dont need a union.
The union was leading in an election at another store but by a margin smaller than the number of ballots the union was seeking to disqualify through challenges. The challenges must be resolved by the labor agencys regional director in the coming days or weeks before there is a result. Workers at a third store voted against unionizing according to the board though a union lawyer contended that some ballots had been delivered to the agency and not counted.
Although its a small number of workers the result has huge symbolic importance and symbols are important when it comes to union organizing John Logan a labor studies professor at San Francisco State University said in an email. Workers who want to form a union in the United States are forced to take a considerable amount of risk and it helps if they can see others who have taken that risk and it has paid off.
The unionized employees who are joining Workers United an affiliate of the giant Service Employees International Union received inquiries throughout the campaign from Starbucks workers across the country who said they were paying close attention and were interested in unionizing as well.
I dont think it will stop in Buffalo whatsoever Alexis Rizzo a worker at one of the stores and a leader in the organizing campaign said at a news conference after the vote.
Workers cited frustration over understaffing and insufficient training when they filed for union elections at the stores in late August problems that have dogged the company for years but which appeared to worsen during the pandemic. Such problems are not unique to Starbucks and have been problems for workers across the restaurant and retail industries for many years.
We continue on as we did today yesterday and the day before that Rossann Williams Starbuckss president of retail for North America said in a letter to employees after the vote. The vote outcomes will not change our shared purpose or how we will show up for each other.The election occurred through mail ballots that were due Wednesday. In November workers at three more Buffalo-area stores filed the paperwork needed to hold union elections but it was unclear when votes would take place for those outlets.
Starbucks responded to the union campaign with a sense of urgency. Throughout the fall out-of-town managers and executives  even Ms. Williams  converged on stores in Buffalo where they questioned employees about operational challenges and assisted in menial tasks like cleaning bathrooms.
In a video of a meeting in September viewed by The New York Times a district manager from Arizona told co-workers that the company had asked her to go to Buffalo to help save it from unionization.
Several workers who support the union said they found the presence of these officials intimidating and at times surreal. They also complained that Starbucks had temporarily closed certain stores in the area which they found disruptive and said Starbucks had excessively added staff in at least one of the three stores that held elections. The workers said this had diluted support for unionization at the store.
As of today weve done it in spite of everything that the company has thrown at us and we all know it has been an extensive anti-union campaign by Starbucks corporate Michelle Eisen a barista at the Buffalo location that unionized who also helped lead the campaign said at the news conference.
Former National Labor Relations Board officials have said that these actions by the company could be interpreted as undermining the laboratory conditions that are supposed to prevail during union elections and that they could serve as grounds for throwing out a result. Workers involved in the union campaign and a union lawyer indicated that they might challenge the result at the store where workers voted down the union.
A regional director of the labor board recently overturned a union election at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama on similar grounds.
Starbucks has said that it dispatched out-of-town officials and temporarily closed stores to help solve staffing and training problems and to remodel stores to make them more efficient. The company said that it added staff to deal with an increase in the number of workers calling in sick and that it had taken such steps across the country since the spring when coronavirus infection rates dropped and stores became busier.
Ms. Williams the North America president said in an interview on Wednesday from Buffalo that she did not feel that the run-up to the vote had been especially contentious and that she had spent much of her time there this fall listening to employees (partners in the companys words) and addressing the conditions that partners had pointed out.
The key issue at the store whose vote was unresolved near the Buffalo airport was whether several workers who cast ballots were actually employed at the store. The union argues that they were employed at another store in the area and worked at the airport store for only a short period of time. The company said they were eligible to vote under the labor boards rules.
The outcome could be important for determining the unions leverage when it seeks to negotiate a contract. Under the law an employer is obligated to bargain with a union in good faith but there is no requirement that it actually agree to a contract and the consequences of failing to bargain in good faith are limited.
The incentives to resist bargaining are significant for the employer said Kate Andrias a labor law expert at Columbia Law School. If workers are able to win a good contract it sets a precedent.
Professor Andrias said that the ability to win a contract in such situations often hinged on the amount of economic pressure the union can exert and that having a second unionized store could help in this regard.
Ms. Eisen the worker at the store that unionized said at the news conference that the workers would like to offer the olive branch to the company and say Lets put this behind us. She added: Now is the time lets get to the bargaining table as quickly as possible.
Starbucks has faced other union campaigns over the years including one in New York City in the 2000s and one in 2019 in Philadelphia where it fired two employees involved in organizing a move that a labor board judge found unlawful. The company appealed the ruling and a decision is still pending.
Neither of those campaigns succeeded but workers are unionized at Starbucks stores owned by other companies that operate them under licensing agreements. And workers at a company-owned store in Canada recently unionized.
A handful of the companys early stores in Seattle had a union and were represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers in the 1980s. The union was decertified.
At Amazon Site Tornado Collided With Companys Peak Delivery Season
Amazon which has its highest employment during the holiday shopping season said the tornado formed at the sites parking lot.
Safety personnel and first responders outside the damaged Amazon delivery depot on Saturday in Edwardsville
Nearly every day as Christmas nears Amazons share of online sales typically rises as customers turn to the e-commerce giant to quickly deliver packages. To make that happen Amazon hires hundreds of thousands of additional workers both full-time employees and contractors and runs its operations at full tilt.
One of them Alonzo Harris drove his cargo van into Amazons delivery depot in Edwardsville Ill. after 8 p.m. on Friday after a full day delivering packages north of St. Louis. Suddenly an alarm blared on his work phone. Someone yelled that this was not a drill. Mr. Harris 44 ran into a shelter on Amazons site and heard a loud roar.
I felt like the floor was coming off the ground he said. I felt the wind blowing and saw debris flying everywhere and people started screaming and hollering and the lights went out.
One of the tornadoes that roared through Kentucky Arkansas Illinois and other states on Friday had plowed straight into Amazons delivery station in Edwardsville. The toll was grim: Six people died with 45 making it out alive according to the Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker.
At least six people died after a tornado tore through an Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville Ill. on Friday.CreditCredit...Maxar
On Sunday the authorities said that there were no additional reports of missing people but that search efforts were continuing. It was initially unclear how many people had been at Amazons site and what safety measures could have been taken to minimize the loss of life. The tornado was ferocious ripping off the buildings roof. Two of the structures 40-foot-high concrete walls collapsed.
The tornado coincided with a peak in the companys work force. Americans reliance on Amazon soon turned the deaths at the delivery depot into a focus of the public as the tornadoes toll became clear over the weekend.
At a church service on Sunday at Thrive Church in Granite City Ill. about 15 miles from the destroyed Amazon site clergy and congregants tried to make sense of the disaster and the companys response.
Its not lost on me Lord that this was an Amazon warehouse and I like so many other people in this country get irritated if I cant get my Christmas gifts in three days from Amazon Sharon Autenrieth the pastor said during the service.
That logistical peak also complicated the rescue effort in Edwardsville. The more than 250000 drivers like Mr. Harris who fuel Amazons delivery network do not work directly for the company but instead are employed by over 3000 contractor companies. On Saturday Mike Fillback the police chief in Edwardsville said the authorities had challenges in knowing how many people we actually had at that facility at the time because its not a set staff.
Only seven people at Amazons site were full-time employees said a Madison County commissioner who declined to give his name. He said most were delivery drivers in their 20s who work as contractors.
The delivery center sits in a flat industrial expanse with low-slung warehouses parked semi-trucks and muddy fields a few miles east of St. Louis and the Mississippi River. An Amazon fulfillment center almost directly across the street from the delivery station was largely untouched. On the front windows there next to images of snowflakes and Christmas trees were the words Peak 2021 and Our Time To Shine.
On Sunday Kelly Nantel an Amazon spokeswoman said about 190 people worked at the delivery station across all of its shifts but declined to comment on how many were full-time workers. She said the tornado formed in the parking lot hit and then dissipated.
The tornado struck at the end of a shift as drivers returned their vans unloaded items and headed home. Contract drivers are not required to clock into the building Ms. Nantel said.
Workers there sheltered in two places she said and one of those areas was directly struck. These areas are typically fortified though it was unclear if they were built to withstand a direct tornado strike. Based on preliminary interviews Ms. Nantel added the company calculated that about 11 minutes lapsed between the first warning of a tornado and when it hit the delivery station.
The six victims ranged in age from 26 to 62 years old the Edwardsville police department said on Sunday.
Amazons model of using contractors is part of a huge push that the company started in 2018 to expand its own deliveries rather than rely solely on shipping companies like UPS. The company built a network of delivery stations like the one Edwardsville which are typically cavernous single-story buildings.
Unlike Amazons massive multistory fulfillment centers where it stores inventory and packs items into individual packages the delivery stations employ fewer people. Amazon employees sort packages for each delivery route in one area. Then drivers working for contractors bring vans into another area where the packages are rolled over in carts loaded into the vans and driven out.
Amazon had about 70 delivery stations in the United States in 2017 and now has almost 600 with more planned according to the industry consultant MWPVL International. Globally the company delivers more than half of its own packages and as much a three-quarters of its packages in the United States.
Most drivers work for other companies under a program called Delivery Service Partners. Amazon has said the contracting arrangement helps support small businesses that can hire in their communities. But industry consultants and Amazon employees directly involved in the program have said it lets the company avoid liability for accidents and other risks and limits labor organizing in a heavily unionized industry.
Sucharita Kodali an analyst at Forrester Research said that while the holiday season is critical for all retailers it is particularly intense for Amazon. They promise these delivery dates so they are likely to experience the most last-minute purchases she said.
The Edwardsville delivery station which Amazon calls DLI4 opened last year and had room for 60 vans at once according to planning documents.
On Friday a tornado warning was in effect for Edwardsville as of 8:06 p.m. according to the National Weather Service. At 8:27 p.m. the county emergency management agency reported a partial roof collapse at Amazons delivery depot and that people were trapped inside.
Aerial footage of the wreckage showed dozens of vans many of which had Amazons logo underneath the rubble. Some of the vans were U-Hauls which the contractors sometimes rent to serve demand during busy periods.
Carla Cope and her husband said their son Clayton Cope 29 was a maintenance mechanic contracting for Amazon. They spoke to him by phone on Friday night when he was at work they said and he assured them that he and other workers were on their way to the tornado shelter on site.
About 10 minutes later the tornado struck. The Copes tried numerous times to reach their son again by phone. They eventually drove to the warehouse from their home in Brighton Ill. a half-hour away.
When we pulled up to the building it was pretty devastating Ms. Cope said. There were trucks and rescue vehicles everywhere a lot of chaos.
When her husband saw the damage he immediately feared the worst Ms. Cope said. Mr. Cope works the same job as a maintenance mechanic that their son did splitting the night shifts except on Wednesdays when the two work together. He knew that their son was likely to have been in the part of the building that collapsed she said.
The couple waited at the building until 4:30 a.m. when officials informed them that they had recovered their sons body.
Theres just really no words to describe it when they tell you your sons dead said Ms. Cope her voice cracking. Its surreal unbelievable devastating.
Mr. Harris the delivery driver who survived the storm said that after the tornado passed he saw a green tornado shelter sign still hanging above Amazons shelter.
I doubt anything man-made can withstand Mother Natures force he said. I think it was an act of God that our shelter remained secure.

Confront the Obvious: The Jets Are Bad
Without three top playmakers quarterback Zach Wilson had few good options against the New Orleans Saints. And it showed in a 30-9 loss.
Jets quarterback Zach Wilson who was 19 for 42 with 202 yards passing scrambled against the New Orleans Saints on Sunday in East Rutherford N.J.
Dec. 12 2021 5:42 p.m. ET Our N.F.L. playoffs calculator has an up-to-date look at the latest playoff picture.
Time is a flat circle but we want to help you break it. To that end weve enlisted two experts  one familiar with the ins and outs of New Yorks professional football teams the other a nationally focused football analyst  to answer an essential question as a weekly service to readers: Are the Jets and Giants good yet?
Devin Gordon the author of So Many Ways to Lose: The Amazin True Story of the New York Mets the Best Worst Team in Sports observed the teams from a locally focused perspective.
Diante Lee an N.F.L. analyst at Pro Football Focus offered a national view.
Jets Without three top playmakers the Jets (3-10) lost 30-9 to the New Orleans Saints (6-7) on Sunday afternoon in East Rutherford N.J. The Saints ended a five-game losing streak.
Insiders perspective:Legend has it that James Gandolfini used to steel himself for the psychological torment of performing some of Tony Sopranos more brutal deeds by making thunderous animal noises. And so with a mighty blast mimicking an elephants trumpet I sank into my laziest chair and girded myself to watch the Jets host the cratering Saints who took their five-game losing streak to just the right place.
After the Jets first three-and-out I neighed and whinnied like a horse. After their second three-and-out I snarled like a grizzly bear. Nothing worked. Finally after the third-string running back Ty Johnson dropped his third short pass of the first quarter leading to the Jets third straight three-and-out and with 45 more minutes of this hellscape stretching out in front of me I fell silent and surrendered to my fate.
The Jets offense was without three top playmakers  running back Michael Carter (ankle) and the wideouts Corey Davis (season-ending core muscle surgery) and Elijah Moore (quadriceps)  against New Orleanss excellent defense. That might explain why by the fourth quarter poor Zach Wilson was throwing the ball at empty turf so he could evade sacks.
The Jets only real scoring option was Eddy PiÃ±eiro the teams fourth kicker so far this season and its ninth since 2016 who recently made 36 consecutive field goals for the New England Patriots. PiÃ±eiro supplied all of the Jets scoring nailing his three attempts. Oh my I said aloud each time pleasantly surprised which was better than seeing how long I could hold a whale call.
Verdict: The Jets will miss the playoffs for the 11th consecutive season and they will lose at least 10 games for the fifth time in their last six. On the bright side theyre set at kicker next week.
Its time to confront the obvious: Zach Wilson is bad.
Sure Wilson a rookie quarterback doesnt hold the weight of his teams 3-10 record on his own since he wasnt even on the active roster for a chunk of the season. And we can examine all the ways the front office and his teammates have failed him. Corey Davis and Elijah Moore were hurt entering Sundays game. Without them there werent enough athletes in the receiving corps to get separation against good coverage. On Sunday their replacements dropped Wilsons passes even when they managed to get open.
But for expedience sake here we can focus on the issues Wilson has caused himself.
Wilsons accuracy has been an issue since Week 1. There were some predictable misses for the young quarterback who missed a chunk of training camp in a contract holdout because of miscommunications with receivers. That doesnt explain the more egregious misses that continue to plague him: throws sailing over outstretched arms or falling into the laps of opponents. Wilson has completed more than 60 percent of his passes in only three starts this season and his 19-for-42 outing against New Orleans was his worst effort this season.
Without so much as a whisper of a run game to set up the Jets play-action passes or screens Wilson often bails out of the pocket before working through a progression.
His draft day scouting evaluation sold him as a Tony Romo-esque quarterback able to escape pressure or extend a play outside its structure. Wilson has taken 25 sacks this season tied with Justin Herbert for 12th most in the N.F.L. He holds on to the ball too long in the pocket or tries frantically to escape with no plan.
Whether you believe the offense is broken because of his weak offensive line or a lack of receiver options Wilson has demonstrated that he cannot pilot this rudderless boat.
Verdict: The Jets this season never were good or watchable and theyre even less so now.
The Smaller Everyday Deals for College Athletes Under New Rules
Although players with six-figure deals have attracted most of the public attention thousands of athletes are pulling in just enough for books or date nights under name image and likeness agreements.
Emily ODonnell left and Emelie Curtis center teammates on the Duquesne University lacrosse team finish a lacrosse clinic in Pittsburgh.
PITTSBURGH  Dean and Traci Curtis could have been banished from their Ohio State University teams in the early 1990s had they done what their 19-year-old daughter pulled off one Saturday last month.
Emelie Curtis taught a lacrosse clinic for pay  with her status as an athlete at Duquesne University no secret but instead the selling point for her customers. After two hours of coaching she came away with about $475.
The payday did not resemble the six-figure totals that some college athletes have commanded since the N.C.A.A. pressured by laws in states like Pennsylvania loosened rules that had limited players financial opportunities for generations. But most college athletes who have been earning money since July are like Curtis: pulling in modest sums on modest stages.
The biggest misconception was it was only going to help out the big names Curtis a business student with a tuition scholarship said in an interview before she tutored nearly two dozen girls most of them in middle school on power and finesse shots.
I dont have a Ferrari Curtis who drives a Honda said later. But Im still happy to be here.
The era of name image and likeness as the concept of college players making money off their fame is known in the industry was never going to include equal earnings for or even equal interest among all athletes. At the University of Pittsburgh the athletic director recalled over the summer most football players appeared more eager for a team paintball outing than the preceding briefing on the relaxed N.C.A.A. rules.
But the marketplaces inaugural months have revealed wide-ranging opportunities for willing college athletes  endorsements on their social media platforms autograph signings Cameo messages reviews of game film for high school prospects motivational speeches and meet-and-greets with children for example  whether they were the University of Miamis starting quarterback a hurdler at the University of Central Florida or a far less prominent Division III athlete.
What is similarly clear according to companies that have helped to broker or administer agreements for tens of thousands of athletes is that many participating players are not even making $1000 each.
Athletes are still barred by N.C.A.A. rules from receiving direct salaries for playing sports at their schools but Opendorse said this week that those with deals that passed through its platform had earned an average of $1138 since July 1; it did not report a median. INFLCR said its median transaction value since July 1 was $51 and that its average deal was worth $1306.
Many of the arrangements involve football or basketball players and the majority of compensation has gone to male athletes. But womens basketball Opendorse said accounted for nearly a quarter of name image and likeness compensation it had tracked trailing only football among all sports.
Youve got this probably 5 percent of college student-athletes who are getting these bigger paychecks and then you kind of have the rest who are using the opportunity to make a little extra cash said Keith Carter the vice chancellor for intercollegiate athletics at the University of Mississippi a Southeastern Conference school where students have earned fees big and small.
If you have the opportunity to go back and run a clinic or do something innovative on your phone you should be able to do that like a normal college student Carter a four-year basketball starter at Mississippi in the late 1990s continued.
Until July though N.C.A.A. athletes could have made no such arrangements without risking their eligibility to play sports. Although athletes could hold jobs and sometimes teach private lessons the association long argued that severe restrictions were necessary to protect amateurism and prevent corruption within college sports. Endorsements were forbidden as was just about anything that mentioned a players school team or athletic talent.
The simple advertisement on the website of Vantage Sports for the November event starring Curtis would have broken the rules: Come out and learn with Duquesne Universitys Emelie Curtis as she leads an all skills clinic for beginner and intermediate girls.
Interest soared as the clinic approached at a fitness complex near the Penn-Lincoln Parkway.
By the time the girls began filing into the facility their coach was ready. She had already spent more than a dozen hours planning the session with an Excel spreadsheet drawing on drills she had learned as a young player and talking with parents to drum up attendance and scout the skills of the girls who had enrolled.
She even downloaded a whistle app for her phone. (It did not prove all that loud.)
I kind of thought Why not me? Why cant it be me? she said. Youve put in the work. You know what you have to offer and as long as youre confident in what you have to offer it can take you as far as you want it to take you.
She knew athletes at Duquesne had pursued other options  one for instance had made a deal with a food delivery service  but she had focused on teaching she said because she wanted to set an example for younger players. She did not understand how lessons could compromise her integrity as a college athlete.
I know a lot of people are against it because they see how much money and how crazy the deals are and thats the only thing that you see on the news she said adding This can be such a positive thing for so many quote-unquote regular normal day-to-day athletes who arent those big names.
Although many of the agreements involve students who play in Division I the N.C.A.A. tier that draws the most public attention and money athletes who compete in Divisions II and III may also cash in. Opendorse said the average compensation for name image and likeness participants was $75 in Division II less than 10 percent of their Division I peers and $37 in Division III.
If you want to get it go get it said Shane Bell a center on the football team at Erskine College a Division II school in Due West S.C.
Since July Bell has made about $525 (and gotten free food) from Mamas Sweet Shoppe a local business in his part of Abbeville County in exchange for appearances and social media posts on platforms like Instagram where he has nearly 1900 followers. Wary of a turbulent economy he said he has saved what he has made so far.
I really dont need it right now he said but Im thankful for it.
Industry officials expect that small-dollar deals will continue to dominate the list of options for most students though more may start to benefit from team-wide arrangements that could lift earnings for players who draw less individual notice. Some also believe that many students will continue to avoid any deals at all including group contracts.
You have a certain portion of our student-athletes who just dont get involved in this space at all Carter said. They just want to go to class play their sport get their degree. I think theres probably 25 or 30 percent of student-athletes who say I dont even want to mess with that.

Max Verstappen Wins Formula 1 Title Passing Lewis Hamilton on Last Lap
Formula 1 capped a long season with a hotly debated decision in Abu Dhabi. Mercedes which lodged two protests against the result has 96 hours to appeal the ruling.
Max Verstappen won his first Formula 1 world title on Sunday after the championship was decided by a last-lap overtake of his rival Lewis Hamilton in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Hamilton looked set to win a record-breaking eighth drivers championship as he led Verstappen by 11 seconds with six laps remaining in their winner-takes-all finale which they started tied on points.
But a late crash toward the back of the field caused the safety car to be deployed which slowed the field so the track could be cleared. It wiped away Hamiltons lead and set up a one-lap shootout with Verstappen when the race resumed.
Verstappen was able to catch Hamilton on fresher tires before overtaking him on the inside at the Turn 5 hairpin. He pulled two seconds clear to win the race and secure the championship by 8 points.
Verstappen 24 is the first Dutch Formula 1 champion. His fight against Hamilton 36 has been one of the most dramatic in recent Formula 1 history after multiple crashes and close on-track fights between the drivers. It is the closest championship result since 2012 when Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull beat Fernando Alonso of Ferrari by 3 points.
Its been an incredible season not only this race but incredible battles Verstappen said. Its been tense the competition. Almost every race weve been pushing each other to the limit. The ultimate goal was the world championship. But now that happened. Its just insane.The race result was subject to a protest from Mercedes which claimed that the race director had not followed his own rule book with the late restart and that the result should have been taken from the penultimate lap when Hamilton was leading.
The team lodged two protests but they were both dismissed by the stewards. Mercedes had 96 hours to consider appealing the ruling.
Verstappens victory ended a four-year streak of championships for Hamilton who congratulated his rival and thanked his Mercedes team for doing an amazing job calling it the most difficult of seasons.
The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix ended a unique Formula 1 season. While the pandemic forced the cancellation of many longtime races the racing series scrambled to add new ones. When the checkered flag went down on Sunday it closed Formula 1s longest season.
Events planned in China Canada Singapore Japan and Australia were canceled but races were added in Portugal Turkey and Qatar which hosted its first Grand Prix in November.
We were able to bring home a calendar that will take us to 22 races this year showing how strong the system is and how good the relationships are that we have around the world said Stefano Domenicali the chief executive of Formula 1.
The record calendar up from 21 races in 2019 was positive news for Formula 1 as it tried to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Revenue jumped rising 12 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period last year but the longer season has also taken a toll on teams. The Haas team said workers had quit because of the added workload and constant travel.
GÃ¼nther Steiner team principal of Haas said a handful of his staff members were leaving to find jobs outside Formula 1 partly because of the growing calendar.
A few people just dont want to do the 23-race schedule next year he said adding that one engineer had just started a family and planned to leave. In general I would say we have got a little bit more turnover than the years before but not a lot.

It is not about to get easier. The calendar will grow again in 2022 because of the addition of the Miami Grand Prix. Twenty-three races  including the return of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after its debut last week  are scheduled from March 20 to Nov. 20. About a month has been cut from the season to avoid a clash with the FIFA World Cup. To accommodate that compressed schedule races will be held on back-to back Sundays 11 times up from eight this season giving teams less time to rest. Twice there will be events on three straight weekends.
Andreas Seidl team principal of McLaren said holding more races in a shorter season would make it even more intense between the first and the last race.
But it is positive seeing how big the interest is in the different countries he said. We as a team are highly interested in the commercial growth of Formula 1.
Still senior officials are conscious of the schedules cost to team personnel including the drivers.
Lando Norris of McLaren said it was becoming harder to find time to rest and recover between races as more Grands Prix were added. He called the amount of travel one of the toughest things.
It does take a toll on you he said. Were directly at work less than the mechanics and the engineers. But our side of the job is a lot more physical and its still mentally draining how much youve got to focus how much time and effort you put into thinking about all these things and trying to improve and so on.
Vettel who now drives for Aston Martin warned that Formula 1 mustnt neglect that we are a group of people and human beings traveling around the world.
The objective he said should be that we have a sustainable way to run our season not only for our environment but also looking at the human resource.
he expansion may also not stop at 23 races. Qatar and China have contracts to each host a race starting in 2023 which would create a 25-race schedule the limit under Formula 1s regulations.
Franz Tost the team principal of AlphaTauri feared that the saturation of races could also be too much for fans causing some to lose interest.
This is what worries me more: not because of the workload its because people get overloaded with races Tost said.
FrÃ©dÃ©ric Vasseur the team principal of Alfa Romeo said a potential 25-race calendar should be considered a positive first because it means that Formula 1 is doing well and perception of F1 is improving.
We have to take care that the fans wont lose the motivation he said. That is important. But for the team I dont think it will be a mega issue.
Kimi Raikkonen of Alfa Romeo is retiring from Formula 1 ending a 20-year career. When he made his debut in 2001 the calendar had only 17 races the majority of which were in Europe. He did not finish Sundays race.
Raikkonen 42 said the growing schedule was not a factor in his decision to retire. But he did urge caution over the impact it would have on those working in Formula 1.
They are doing long days especially if there are issues with the cars he said. At the race in Mexico he said they worked overnight. He added Its hard for them.
The problem will burn out a lot of people Raikkonen said and its not going to be good for anybody.
Plagued by Fan Violence French Soccer Asks: Why?
The return of supporters to stadiums in France has been accompanied by a series of games postponed or marred by trouble in the stands.
Only 3 minutes 54 seconds into the match Dimitri Payet jogged gingerly toward the corner flag at  Groupama Stadium. The game between his team Marseille and the host Lyon was young and still formless. There had been no goals. There had barely been time for a chance. Everybody fans and players alike was still settling in.
In the stands above him Wilfried Serriere 32 a food delivery driver looked down and saw a half-liter bottle of water at his feet. It was full. Payet was placing the ball for a corner. His back was turned. In images captured by the stadiums security cameras and later played in a courtroom Serriere can be seen picking up the bottle lowering his hood and throwing it.
A beat later Payet fell to the grass clutching his face. The bottle had caught him flush on the cheek.
Payets teammates rushed to his aid. Anthony Lopes Lyons goalkeeper gestured at his own fans pleading for calm. Later Serriere told a court that he did not know what went on in my head: euphoria I dont know. He accepted he had thrown the bottle that struck Payet but he could not explain why.
The rest of France has spent the opening months of the soccer season asking itself the same question. A wave of violence has washed over Ligue 1 the countrys top division since fans returned to its stadiums in August after a yearlong absence caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Two games both involving Marseille have been suspended  and eventually postponed  after Payet was struck by an object thrown from the stands. In Lyon the players were taken off the field quickly. In the previous incident at Nice there was an angry confrontation on the field between Marseilles players and hundreds of opposition fans. That confrontation also had consequences: A Nice fan was given a 12-month suspended sentence for kicking Payet and a Marseille coach was barred for the rest of the season for punching a field invader.
Those though were only the two most high-profile incidents. Fans have invaded the field during games at Lens and Angers. There have been pitched battles between rival groups of ultras before and after games in several cities. Missiles have been thrown at Montpellier and Metz and the Parc des Princes home of Paris St.-Germain.
In all nine games in Ligue 1 have been afflicted this season by what the newspaper DauphinÃ© LibÃ©rÃ© has described as an epidemic of violence one so rampant that Frances soccer authorities have come to regard it as an existential threat. Vincent Labrune the president of the French league has called it nothing less than a question of survival for our sport.
If that sounds hyperbolic it is at least rooted in realism. There is a fear the violence could have financial ramifications; Roxana Maracineanu the countrys sports minister has said French soccer cannot collectively afford to fail to deliver the content the leagues broadcasters have paid for. But there is also concern that it could make France an inhospitable place for players to work too.
At Serrieres sentencing Axel Daurat a lawyer representing Payet and Marseille testified that the player had suffered significant psychological impact as a result of being attacked twice in three months. The fear will be there every time he puts the ball down for a corner Daurat said.
But while the potential consequences are clear there has been less progress on the causes. Labrune has suggested that the increase in disorder is best read as a reflection of the state of post-pandemic French society: Anxious worried fractured argumentative and  I have to say  a little crazy.
And yet that explanation does not quite withstand scrutiny. France is hardly alone in feeling a certain civic fractiousness as it emerges haltingly and uncertainly into an uncomfortable new reality. Most of Europes other major leagues greeting that same reality have not seen anything like the upsurge in violence Ligue 1 has faced.
It feels a little bit like cod psychology to say that it is to do with a tension in society manifesting in the stadium said Ronan Evain the executive director of Football Supporters Europe. More likely he said is that the violence illustrates a structural institutional failing.
It is like the clubs have lost a little bit of expertise he said. In the incident between Lens and Lille there was no buffer zone between the home and away fans. I have not seen that at a game in 20 years maybe more. The clubs put a lot of emphasis on the Covid protocols for returning to the stadiums. Perhaps there was not enough focus on security.
Evain argued that may be connected to the loss of experienced stewards and security staff members during the pandemic and he drew a parallel between the French experience and the scenes at Wembley Stadium in London in July when thousands of ticketless fans stormed the gates when England played Italy in the Euro 2020 final. A sharply critical report this month documented how policing failures had left stadium security employees in an impossible  and potentially deadly  situation that day. You cannot ask someone who is underpaid undertrained and in poor working conditions to risk their health to stop someone going on the field Evain said.
Nicolas Hourcade a sociologist at the Ãcole Centrale de Lyon who specializes in fan movements suggested that lack of expertise has been compounded by the financial difficulties faced by French teams. France alone among Europes major leagues chose not to conclude its pandemic-interrupted 2019-20 season and its teams are still reeling from the subsequent collapse of the leagues broadcast deal.
It is possible the clubs did not invest enough in security he said which would explain why the measures were sometimes insufficient.
But while that provides a possible explanation for why French soccer has provided such fertile ground for the violence it does not offer insight into the root of it. Maracineanu the sports minister has laid blame at the door of Frances ultra groups urging their leaders to control your troops. But it is not quite so simple.
At Serrieres hearing it emerged that he had been a Lyon fan for 15 years  though news reports noted he attended court in a Bayern Munich jersey  but was not a member of any organized group. He was not in other words an ultra.
There have been incidents involving ultra groups said Pierre BarthÃ©lemy a lawyer who has acted on behalf of the ultra movement. He cited two specifically including the field invasion at Lens which he said had been triggered by the presence of Belgian hooligans among the visiting Lille fans and an incident at a game in Montpellier that the ultras were boycotting.
When the game was suspended at Nice it was because the authorities had let people throw missiles on the field for 40 or 50 minutes BarthÃ©lemy said. These are not organized incidents. They are spontaneous and most are not coming from the ultras.
That however only makes them harder to police. France has some of the most draconian punishments for crowd disorder in Europe Evain said including the ability to close grandstands or even entire stadiums.
He fears the current outbreak will be met by a populist response: increased calls for monitoring of fans in stadiums and the greeting of any incident even an individual action with a collective punishment. At least one club owner has confided privately that he would agree to play behind closed doors if the issues continued.
But perhaps more significant the atomized nature of the incidents in France makes them harder to understand. Violence caused by ultras and incidents caused by other fans are not related said Hourcade the sociologist.
Violence may be an organizational failure he said. Or perhaps long-running grievances between ultra groups are resurfacing after lying dormant during the pandemic.
But threading through it all is the sense that the stadium has become a place where lines can be crossed and taboos broken and 3:54 into a game when the trill of the whistle has barely faded and the game has barely begun a fan can look at a bottle and without ever knowing why pick it up and hurl it at a player and land another blow on the image French soccer presents to the world.
What We Learned From Week 14 in the N.F.L.
Kansas Citys defense could give Patrick Mahomes the breathing room to grab home-field advantage and Micah Parsons made good on the Cowboys promise to beat Washington.
Mike Hughes a cornerback returned a fumble 23 yards for a touchdown on Kansas Citys first defensive play against the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday.
A strange thing happened as quarterback Patrick Mahomes continued to struggle with the Rubiks cube known as the two-deep shell. As he looked so unfathomably human against N.F.L. defenses that played their two safeties deep to prevent long passes the Kansas City Chiefs methodically built a juggernaut in a less celebrated area: their defense.
The teams latest beatdown  a 48-9 drubbing of the Las Vegas Raiders (6-7) in Kansas City Mo.  added a sixth game to the Chiefs win streak gave them the same 9-4 record as the New England Patriots and the Tennessee Titans and gave us our top takeaway of Week 14:
Defense has Kansas City ready to challenge New England for the A.F.C.s top spot.
This has been a cluttered mess of a conference. Titans running back Derrick Henry had been on a pace to set the career rushing record when he broke his foot in November. That was right when Josh Allen of the Buffalo Bills and Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens who had looked like contenders for the Most Valuable Player Award began to stammer against inferior opponents.
One trend over the past two months has been the Kansas City defense hammering opponents which if it continues could catapult the team to a third consecutive Super Bowl appearance.
Mahomes was sharp completing 20 of 24 passes for 258 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions but he is not the most dangerous man in Kansas City right now. That is Steve Spagnuolo the teams defensive coordinator who is stupefying opposing quarterbacks with his endless scroll of blitzes.
On Sunday Kansas City forced five turnovers and hit Raiders quarterback Derek Carr 11 times. With Kansas City up 21-0 at the start of the second quarter safety Tyrann Mathieu picked off a Carr pass that tight end Foster Moreau had dropped. In his ninth season Mathieu remains brilliant playing the back end of the secondary an assuring presence who gives Spagnuolo the freedom to send extra bodies at the quarterback.
Moved back to his natural position on the inside of the defensive line tackle Chris Jones continues to wreck games.
In the last three games Kansas City has allowed a total of 16 first-half points confounding the Cowboys Dak Prescott (57.9 passer rating five sacks) the Packers backup Jordan Love (15 incompletions 69.5 passer rating) and Carr in the process. Its a far cry from the defense that surrendered 30 or more points in four of its first five games.
Now that the defense has given his offense breathing room Mahomes has again looked like his normal meteoric self a sight no team wants to see in January.
Micah Parsons and the Cowboys defense made good on Mike McCarthys guarantee.
The guarantee was odd to say the least. Coaches of first-place teams rarely sound so desperate in mid-December but with the Dallas Cowboys having lost two of their last three entering Sundays game against an N.F.C. East rival Mike McCarthy declared that the Cowboys (9-4) would beat the Washington Football Team (6-7).
His counterpart Ron Rivera didnt like that. He called McCarthys proclamation a big mistake.
The Cowboys of the 1990s could back up guarantees like that. But in the new millennium prognostications have usually been followed by a bunch of things going wrong for Dallas.
Not so in the 27-20 win at Washington.
McCarthy could speak with such confidence because his two top receivers CeeDee Lamb and Amari Cooper were back on the field at the same time after Lamb missed Week 12 and Cooper sat in Weeks 11 and 12. Dallass ascending defense had been historically bad in 2020 but has played with tenacity this season behind linebacker Micah Parsons who had two sacks and a forced fumble on Sunday bringing him to 12 sacks in his rookie season.
Parsonss first sack came on fourth-and-3 at midfield. On a delayed blitz late in the first quarter he shoved the four-time Pro Bowl guard Brandon Scherff into the backfield. Dorance Armstrong returned the sack-fumble 37 yards for a touchdown that put Dallas up 18-0.
On Washingtons next possession Parsons rushed up the middle on third-and-8 at the Washington 38-yard line for a sack.
Unlike pass rushers who predominantly line up at one position Parsons the Cowboys 12th overall pick in this years draft moves all over the field. Any extra attention given to blocking him creates opportunities for other pass rushers like Randy Gregory and DeMarcus Lawrence as it did on Sunday when Lawrence lassoed Taylor Heinicke to the turf with one hand.
Around the N.F.L.
Falcons 29 Panthers 21: Atlanta linebacker Mykal Walker stepped in front of a Cam Newton pass and returned it 66 yards for a touchdown reaching a top speed of 21.05 miles per hour  the fastest speed recorded by a linebacker with the ball in his hands in the last five years. Newton was benched in the second quarter for his backup P.J. Walker who returned to the pine after throwing a pick on his second pass attempt.
Saints 30 Jets 9: Navigating the post-Drew Brees era hasnt been pretty for New Orleans. After beating the defending champion Buccaneers in Week 8 the Saints lost five straight. The teams slide ended Sunday with the return of Alvin Kamara from a knee injury. He punished the Jets with 120 yards and one touchdown on 27 rushing attempts.
Seahawks 33 Texans 13: Too little too late in Seattle. Theres a good chance this is Russell Wilsons final season with the Seahawks so plays like his 55-yard moon ball to Tyler Lockett only tease what could have been in 2021.
Browns 24 Ravens 22: Baltimore lost Lamar Jackson to an ankle injury in the second quarter the one injury the team cannot afford in a season that has been rife with them. The bye week helped Clevelands battered quarterback Baker Mayfield who threw for 190 yards and a pair of scores.
Titans 20 Jaguars 0: Things have gotten ugly in Jacksonville where Coach Urban Meyer threatened to fire whichever of his assistant coaches leaked that he had called them losers last week. Meanwhile the Titans have gone 3-2 without Derrick Henry who could return as soon as Week 18 from surgery on his fractured foot.

Elon Musks Latest Innovation: Troll Philanthropy
Some very wealthy people give their money away in an attempt to burnish their reputations. Not the Tesla C.E.O.
The richest people on earth typically devote a share of their vast resources to charity. That is the bargain and the expectation anyway.
Jeff Bezos until very recently the worlds richest human has been applying himself dutifully if a bit cautiously to the task giving money to food banks and homeless families while pledging $10 billion of the fortune he earned through the online retailer Amazon to fight climate change.
The latest richest human Elon Musk has taken a rather different tack. There was the public spat with the director of the World Food Programme on Twitter for instance announcing If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it.
There was the online poll asking whether he should sell 10 percent of his Tesla shares in order to pay taxes on at least part of his wealth like most people do without running a survey first. And of course there is the ongoing insistence that his moneymaking efforts running both the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX are already bettering humankind thank you very much.
Mr. Musk is practicing troll philanthropy.
Thats what Benjamin Soskis senior research associate in the Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy at the Urban Institute has called it noting that Mr. Musk seems to be having fun with this novel approach.
He doesnt seem to care much about using his philanthropy to curry public favor Mr. Soskis said. In fact he seems to enjoy using his identity as a philanthropist in part to antagonize the public. Before this year one estimate put his giving at $100 million a lot by almost any standard except for multibillionaires like Mr. Musk.

Most wealthy people do the opposite. They use philanthropy to burnish their image or distract the public from the business practices that earned them their enormous wealth in the first place.
When how and why the ultrarich choose to give their fortunes away matters more than ever because so much money is concentrated in their hands and so little of it is taxable under current rules. Society is to some extent presently stuck relying on voluntary disbursements from those with the greatest means.
The idea that philanthropy that any single individual has enough money to affect something at a global scale is a very new phenomenon said Homi Kharas a senior fellow at the Center for Sustainable Development at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Most billionaires have accumulated their wealth because the world economy is now globalized but to sustain a globalized world economy we need to have more inclusive growth.
There are many different kinds of givers like Mr. Bezos ex-wife MacKenzie Scott who has focused her billions on diversity and equity. There are the self-declared effective altruists like the Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna part of a movement searching for evidence-based approaches to find causes where their money does the most good. And there are the traditionalists like Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg who have built institutions to handle their funding.
Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos are with $268 billion and $202 billion respectively the two richest Americans for the time being drawing sharper contrasts between their approaches to giving back.
Earlier this year Mr. Bezos took the stage with United Nations Deputy Secretary General Amina J. Mohammed and listened as former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry sang his praises saying He is stepping up in a way that an awful lot of people who have the wherewithal do not step up.
Mr. Musk meanwhile replied to a tweet by Senator Bernie Sanders demanding that the extremely wealthy pay their share by replying I keep forgetting that youre still alive.
Mr. Musks nontraditional approach to giving doesnt stop people who need his donations like David Beasley executive director of the World Food Programme from seeking his help. The resources at his disposal are so vast and potentially consequential that we have to engage him and accept some of that trolling if we want to try to exert some pressure on him and shape his somewhat inchoate philanthropic priorities Mr. Soskis said.
Mr. Musk did not respond to an email asking him to discuss his philanthropic giving.
The notion that rich people have a moral obligation to give is an ancient one. Mr. Soskis a historian of philanthropy notes that wealthy citizens in ancient Rome tried to outdo one another paying for public baths and theaters. The inscriptions on those edifices could count as a form of early donor lists.
The idea that the richest might need charity to improve their public relations is also longstanding driven home in the Gilded Age by the 1882 outburst by railway magnate William Henry Vanderbilt The public be damned! that shadowed him to the end of his days.
The Feds decision on tapering and data on spending: The week in business.
G.M.s electric vehicle efforts reportedly include a bigger presence in Michigan.
President Biden assails Kelloggs plan to replace striking workers.
Efforts to track the charitable giving of the very wealthy in the United States date to the late 19th century when the ranks of millionaires exploded. Before long newspapers were running front-page lists of who had made the biggest gifts. The original duo to capture public attention were John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie whose feelings on publicizing philanthropy were diametrically opposed.
Cartoons from the era showed Mr. Carnegie often dressed in a kilt to reference his Scottish origin showering coins from enormous bags of money. The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced Mr. Carnegie wrote in The Gospel of Wealth his treatise on giving. Mr. Rockefeller preferred to keep his giving more private and had to be convinced to announce his gifts.
To those who think the trolling started on Twitter philanthropy was never quite as polite as we imagine today. George Eastman one of the founders of Eastman Kodak called those who did not give their money away during their lifetimes pie-faced mutts. Julius Rosenwald the chairman of Sears Roebuck and Company and a major philanthropist in his day insisted that the accumulation of wealth had nothing to do with smarts adding Some very rich men who made their own fortunes have been among the stupidest men I have ever met in my life.
But the idea that giving helps the reputation is at best only partially true. Givers are celebrated at times but just as often the higher profile means their motives and choices are picked apart. The Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and the Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are each worth over $120 billion per Forbes but none of them receives the level of scrutiny that Mr. Gates does for instance.
If you put your head above the philanthropic parapet and say Im interested in the environment or whatever cause area people can start to question it said Beth Breeze author of the recent book In Defence of Philanthropy. Ms. Breeze has pushed back against the recent trend of criticizing philanthropists who she says are regularly described as tax dodging egotistical irritating  criticism they may earn but not comments that she views as useful to the greater good.
My concern is not for the thin skins of the rich people. They can take care of themselves. My concern is if the money dries up said Ms. Breeze who was a fund-raiser for a youth homeless center before becoming an academic and identifies as a left-wing Labour Party supporter in Britain.
A troll philanthropist might be an easy target for criticism. But donating money in all the usual ways is no break from critical rebukes.
There are several different schools of criticism deployed for different kinds of givers. There is the structural argument that philanthropy serves as another means of using wealth to cement power and influence. Large grants are often compared with the givers total net worth to show that as a percentage of their wealth the gifts are much smaller than they appear in absolute terms. Gifts to cultural institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Ivy League schools are now regularly assailed for reinforcing the status quo. Even gifts to rebuild the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris after it caught fire earned significant blowback.
Technocratic institutions that set exacting benchmarks for gifts and place strict limits on how their money can be spent are tagged as controlling and hierarchical. In contrast general operating support without guidance on how the money can be used has been applauded by many lately as the best approach.

Mr. Bezos was named by the Chronicle of Philanthropy this past February to the top spot on its 2020 Philanthropy 50 list even though most of that was for his $10 billion pledge to his own Bezos Earth Fund which had barely gotten up and running. It was a bit like Barack Obamas surprise Nobel Peace Prize less than a year into his presidency in the way that it seemed to sharpen critiques rather than dull them.
But after a slow start to his giving Mr. Bezos has begun to look like the good pupil. He gave $100 million to the Feeding America food bank network and another $100 million to Mr. Obamas presidential center. The money has been flowing more quickly out of the Bezos Earth Fund as well. Just this past week he announced another 44 grants worth a total of $443 million to groups working on issues including climate justice and conservation part of that $10 billion pledge.
You need to have a pretty sharp pencil of analysis in order to allocate funds well said Andrew Steer president of the Bezos Earth Fund in an interview.
Mr. Musk himself started out with what seemed like a somewhat conventional approach to giving. He created the Musk Foundation in 2002 and signed the nonbinding Giving Pledge to give away half his wealth in 2012. (The Musk Foundation website could itself be considered a bit of a troll with its 33 words in black text on a white background.)
For the fiscal year ending June 2020 the Musk Foundation made donations of a little less than $3 million to nine groups mostly related to education and gave $20 million to Fidelity Charitable which operates the kind of donor-advised funds that critics say can function as a parking lot for charitable dollars. That was out of nearly $1 billion available in the Musk Foundation coffers by the end of the fiscal year.
Since then he has announced $150 million in gifts including a $100 million innovation prize for carbon removal and $30 million to nonprofits in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas. Those may have been at least as much about a legal requirement as a newfound sense of munificence. Tax laws require private foundations to pay out roughly 5 percent of their endowments annually.
The particular barrier for donors from a tech background is they dont just think their genius has made them good at what they do they also think what they do commercially also makes society better said Rhodri Davies a philanthropy commentator who wrote a piece on Mr. Musk called The Edgelord Giveth.
Mr. Musk for instance has said that getting humankind to Mars through SpaceX is an important contribution and has written and spoken acerbically about what he calls anti-billionaire BS including attempts to target taxes at billionaires.

It does not make sense to take the job of capital allocation away from people who have demonstrated great skill in capital allocation and give it to an entity that has demonstrated very poor skill in capital allocation which is the government Mr. Musk said on Monday at an event hosted by The Wall Street Journal.
At the same time Mr. Kharas said a more charitable reading of Mr. Musks exchange with the World Food Programme is possible. He could just genuinely want to know how the money will be spent and is putting in public on Twitter the due diligence work that institutional giving does behind closed doors.
I think this idea that he was willing to engage was really good Mr. Kharas of the Brookings Institution said of Mr. Musk. I think his response was extremely sensible. It was basically Show me what you can do. Demonstrate it. Provide me with some evidence. Ill do it. The W.F.P. published a breakdown of how they would spend the $6.6 billion but theres no word yet on whether Mr. Musk will make a donation.
MacKenzie Scotts latest letter about her giving included a lot of philosophical musings most billionaires do not routinely share. But she left out precisely the details everyone was waiting for  how many billion dollars went to which groups? Instead she said stop paying so much attention to billionaires and think about what you can give.
In a winking gesture to everyone waiting for the latest cash tally she wrote the whole thing without using a single dollar sign. Classic troll move.

BuzzFeeds first week on the stock market went from bad to worse Thursday when its stock lost nearly a quarter of its value.
Its shares dropped 23.6 percent to close at $5.87 and at that price they are now down 31 percent from where they closed Monday when it made its debut as a public company.
BuzzFeed which is known for both its catchy lists and its traditional journalism went public by merging with a shell corporation known as a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC a route onto the stock market that was popular earlier this year but has since lost favor among investors.
BuzzFeed raised far less money from the merger than it had expected to after many investors in the SPAC asked for their money back. BuzzFeeds leadership had hoped that going public would make it easier for it to acquire other digital media companies. But doing so will be much harder after its fund-raising came up short and if its stock remains depressed.
At it current share price BuzzFeed which bought HuffPost last year has a market value of $775 million.
BuzzFeeds difficult first week will send a chill through the boardrooms of other digital media companies that have been hoping to go public or raise new money.
The speed and depth of the decline in BuzzFeeds stock may in part be because there is a small number of shares available to trade. It may not take much selling to push the share price down; conversely a small amount of buying would send it higher.

A proposal with widespread political support would entitle drivers and couriers for companies like Uber to a minimum wage and legal protections.

LONDON  In one of the biggest challenges yet to the labor practices at popular ride-hailing and food-delivery services the European Commission took a major step on Thursday toward requiring companies like Uber to consider their drivers and couriers as employees entitled to a minimum wage and legal protections.
The commission proposed rules that if enacted would affect up to an estimated 4.1 million people and give the European Union some of the worlds strictest rules for the so-called gig economy. The policy would remake the relationship that ride services food delivery companies and other platforms have with workers in the 27-nation bloc.
Labor unions and other supporters hailed the proposal which has strong political support as a breakthrough in the global effort to change the business practices of companies that they say depend on exploiting workers with low pay and weak labor protections.
Uber and other companies are expected to lobby against the rules which must go through several legislative steps before becoming law. The companies have long classified workers as independent contractors to hold down costs and limit legal liabilities. The model provided new conveniences for traveling across town and ordering takeout and gave millions of people a flexible new way to work when they want.

But in Europe where worker protection laws are traditionally more robust than in the United States there has been growing momentum for change particularly as the pandemic highlighted the fragile nature of gig work when food couriers and others continued to work even amid lockdowns and rising Covid-19 cases.
While there have been some important legal victories and laws passed in some countries targeting Uber and others the policy released by the European Commission the executive branch of the European Union is the most far-reaching legislative attempt to regulate companies to date.
The rules would affect drivers couriers home cleaners home health care aides fitness coaches and others who use apps and online platforms to find work. As employees they would be entitled to a minimum wage holiday pay unemployment and health benefits and other legal protections depending on the country where they worked.
New forms of work organization do not automatically translate into quality jobs Valdis Dombrovskis the blocs commissioner for trade said as he presented the new rules. People involved in platform work can sometimes find themselves exposed to unsafe living and working conditions.
The European Union estimates that 28 million people work through digital labor platforms in the bloc with their number expected to grow to 43 million by 2025. The commission said on Thursday that 5.5 million workers were at risk of what it called misclassification and that up to 4.1 million of them could be reclassified as employees through the directive.
This is not just bike riders in big cities said Johanna Wenckebach a lawyer and scientific director at the Hugo Sinzheimer Institute for Labor and Social Security Law in Germany. This is a phenomenon with millions of workers and many more ahead.
The rules are part of a broader digital agenda that European Union leaders hope to pass in the coming year. Proposals include tougher antitrust regulations targeting the largest tech companies stricter content moderation rules for Facebook and other internet services to combat illicit material and new regulations for the use of artificial intelligence.
The new labor rules follow a landmark case in February when Britains top court ruled that Uber drivers should be classified as workers entitled to a minimum wage and holiday pay. In the Netherlands a court ruled in September that Uber drivers should be paid under collective rules in place for taxi drivers.

Supporters of the new worker regulations said companies like Uber behave like employers by controlling workers through software that sets wages assigns jobs and measures performance  a practice the commission called algorithmic management.
The new European rules would require companies to disclose more about how their software systems made decisions affecting workers. For those who may remain independent the new rules would also require companies to grant more autonomy that self-employment entails.
The policy threatens the business models of Uber and other platforms like the food delivery service Deliveroo that already struggle to turn a profit. The E.U. law could result in billions of dollars in new costs which are likely to be passed on to customers potentially reducing use of the apps.
Uber opposes the E.U. proposal saying it would result in higher costs for customers. The company said roughly 250000 couriers and 135000 drivers across Europe would lose work under the proposal.
Rather than help workers Uber said the proposal would have the opposite effect  putting thousands of jobs at risk crippling small businesses in the wake of the pandemic and damaging vital services that consumers across Europe rely on.
Just Eat the largest food-delivery service in Europe said it supported the policy. Jitse Groen the companys chief executive said on Twitter that it would improve conditions for workers and help them access social protections.
The E.U. rules are being closely watched as a potential model for other governments around the world. Negotiations could last through 2022 or longer as policymakers negotiate a compromise among different European countries and members of the European Parliament who disagree about how aggressive the regulations should be. The law is unlikely to take effect until 2024 or later.
Enforcement would be left to the countries where the companies operated.
The policy contrasts Europe with the United States where efforts to regulate app-based ride and delivery services have not gained as much momentum except in a few states and cities.

Last year gig economy companies staged a successful referendum campaign in California to keep drivers classified as independent contractors while giving them limited benefits. Although a judge ruled in August that the result violated Californias Constitution his decision is being appealed and the companies are pursuing similar legislation in Massachusetts.
The Biden administration has suggested that gig workers should be treated as employees but it has not taken significant steps to change employment laws. In May the Labor Department reversed a Trump-era rule that would have made it more difficult to reclassify gig workers in the country as employees.
In Europe Spain offers a preview of the potential effects of the E.U. proposal. The countrys so-called Riders Law enacted in August required food delivery services such as Uber and Deliveroo to reclassify workers as employees covering an estimated 30000 workers.
Uber responded by hiring several staffing agencies to hire a fleet of drivers for Uber Eats a strategy to comply with the law but avoid responsibility for managing thousands of people directly. Deliveroo which is partly owned by Amazon abandoned the Spanish market.
The companies prefer policies like those in France where the government has proposed allowing workers to elect union representation that could negotiate with companies on issues like wages and benefits. Uber also pointed to Italy where a major union and food delivery companies struck a deal that guarantees a minimum wage insurance and safety equipment but does not classify the workers as employees.
Kim van Sparrentak a Green lawmaker in the European Parliament who helped draft a report on platform workers that was published this year praised the commissions proposal as quite radical.
It can set a new standard for workers rights Ms. Van Sparrentak said.

A federal appeals court delivered a last-minute reprieve to Apple on Wednesday agreeing to the companys request to delay a legal order requiring it to make policy changes to its App Store that could help app developers circumvent what they say are unfair fees.
If the appeals court had not ruled Apple on Thursday would have had to start allowing companies to include links within their apps directing customers to outside websites where they can pay for those companies services or subscriptions. That would have prevented Apple from taking a cut of up to 30 percent on those transactions.
The order was initially made in September as part of the verdict in a yearlong court case between Apple and Epic Games the creator of the popular video game Fortnite. Epic sued Apple accusing it of engaging in anticompetitive behavior that harmed developers and consumers through its fees and strict App Store rules.
In a brief document three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit wrote that Apple could wait to make any changes until the appeals process for the Epic lawsuit concluded which could take more than a year.
The ruling adds another wrinkle in a lengthy legal battle over whether app developers have the right to inform their customers about ways to pay for their services outside the App Store.
After a three-week trial in May Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in Oakland ruled largely in Apples favor saying the tech giant was not a monopolist.
But she did say Apple was violating California competition law with its so-called anti-steering provision which blocked developers from telling their customers about ways to pay outside the App Store. Judge Gonzalez Rogers ordered Apple to drop the anti-steering rule by December.
Apple appealed the verdict in October and requested a stay of Judge Gonzalez Rogerss injunction about the anti-steering rule until the appeals process played out. She denied the companys request in November but the federal appeals court disagreed with her.
Apple has demonstrated at minimum that its appeal raises serious questions on the merits of the district courts determination that Epic Games Inc. failed to show Apples conduct violated any antitrust laws but did show that the same conduct violated Californias Unfair Competition Law the judges on the appeals court wrote. They added that Apple had also made a sufficient showing of irreparable harm to the App Store if it was forced to make policy changes.
In a statement Apple thanked the appeals court and reiterated its argument against tweaking its strict App Store rules. Our concern is that these changes would have created new privacy and security risks and disrupted the user experience customers love about the App Store the company said.
Epic Games declined to comment.
With Wednesdays ruling Apple bought some time but it could ultimately have to comply with Judge Gonzalez Rogerss order if it loses on appeal.
Face Computers Are Coming. Now What?
Instead of letting Facebook or Apple decide the norms of this new technology we need to do it.
If the tech predictions pan out well soon be wearing computers on our faces and plugging into immersive realms of virtual people and places perhaps blended with the real world around us.
(I dont want to use the buzzword metaverse here because ugh. This term from science fiction has been applied to anything and everything that we should just call the internet. But thats partly what Im talking about.)
I am both apprehensive and excited about the potential next generation of technologies that may further blur the lines between computers and us and between online and real life. I can get into the idea of glasses that let me scroll restaurant menu items and feel as if the sizzling burger is in front of me or into headgear that lets me exercise next to a virtual lake in Patagonia.
No one can predict how long it might take this imagined future of the internet to come true and go mainstream if it ever does. But if computers on our faces and more lifelike digital realities are coming for us lets start thinking through the implications now.
I dont have a fleshed out good humans guidebook for the metaverse. (Ugh that word again.) But I know that instead of letting Mark Zuckerberg or the Apple chief executive Tim Cook decide on the etiquette ethics norms rewards and risks of our potential brave new world of technology we need to do it.
How we use technology shouldnt be left to the companies that dream up electronics and software. It should be up to us individually and collectively. That can happen by deliberate thought and careful design or by the lack of it.
Im writing this now because Apple reportedly plans to introduce its first computers for the face in the next year or so.
Apple appears to imagine that its face computers  similar to Microsofts HoloLens Snaps experimental Spectacles or the failed Google Glass   will blend virtual images with the world around us sometimes called augmented reality. Imagine watching a fix-it video of a car engine while a guide overlays diagrams on the fan belt that youre trying to repair.
Apple has a reputation for making up-and-coming technology go mass market. Well see but its clear that there will be a lot of activity and attention on face computers and immersive technologies in all forms. (Counterpoint: Some tech experts have predicted the rise of face computers for most of the past decade.)
What I want all of us to do  whether we dont get the fuss over virtual reality or love it  is to begin deliberating over where we want to focus the promise of this technology and limit the risks.
Im mindful of what has gone wrong when we allowed technology to wash over us and tried to figure out the details later.
Partly through an unwillingness or inability to imagine what could go wrong with technology we have websites and apps that track us everywhere we go and that sell the information to the highest bidders. We have carmakers that sometimes protect us with clever tech that helps offset human frailties and other times seem to exacerbate them. We have the best aspects of human interactions online and the worst.
We should think about this stuff now before we might all be wearing supercomputers on our faces.
What do we want from this technology? Can we imagine schools offices or comedy clubs in virtual reality? What do we want from the next generation of immersive internet for our kids? Do we want to drive while our headgear flings tweets into our fields of vision? Do we even want to erase the gap between digital life and real life?
It might be misguided to establish norms and laws around technologies that might take many years to become big. But tech companies and technologists arent waiting. Theyre molding their imagined future of the internet now. If we dont engage that puts the companies in the drivers seat. And weve seen the downside of that.

Even as the government expanded aid programs many people faced barriers to using them. That problem is now being addressed with apps and streamlined websites.
WASHINGTON  In making his case that safety net programs should be easier to use Jimmy Chen a tech entrepreneur recalled visiting a welfare office where people on food stamps endured long waits to submit routine paperwork.
They passed the time as people in lines do staring at their phones  which had the potential to do the work online with greater convenience accuracy and speed.
The image of aid-seekers wasting time with a solution literally in hand captures what critics call an overlooked challenge for people in poverty: Administrative burdens make benefits hard to obtain and tax the time and emotional resources of those who need help.
Too much bureaucracy prevents people from getting the help they need said Mr. Chen whose start-up Propel offers a free app that five million households now use to manage their food stamp benefits.
Barriers to aid are as old as aid itself and they exist for reasons as varied as concerns about fraud the bureaucratic tension between accuracy and speed and hostility toward people in need. But the perils of red tape have drawn new attention since the coronavirus pandemic left millions of Americans seeking government help many for the first time.
The government approved vast increases in spending but often struggled to deliver the assistance. While some programs reached most households quickly (stimulus checks) others buckled under soaring demand (unemployment benefits) or daunting complexity (emergency rental aid).
The pandemic highlighted how difficult these programs can be to access said Pamela Herd a professor at Georgetown and an author with Donald P. Moynihan of Administrative Burden which argues that excessive bureaucracy deepens poverty and inequality.
The share of eligible people receiving benefits varies greatly by program: It is about 82 percent for food stamps 78 percent for the earned-income tax credit and 24 percent for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families or cash welfare according to government estimates. That means billions of dollars go unclaimed.
On his first day in office President Biden issued an executive order asking agencies to identify systemic barriers in accessing benefits with the results due in January.
Shaped by forces as diverse as the tech revolution welfare rights and behavioral psychology the movement to create a more user-friendly safety net was underway before the pandemic underscored the perils of bureaucracy.
Code for America a nonprofit group spent years devising a portal that makes it easier for Californians to apply for food stamps. Civilla a Detroit-based nonprofit helped Michigan shrink its 42-page application by 60 percent.
In an age of ambitious social movements the cry of civic tech  power to the portals  may seem obscure but Mr. Chen 34 says democratizing technologys rewards is essential to social justice.
For someone like me a phone is like a magic wand he said. If I want to call a cab theres an app; if I want to book a hotel theres an app; if I want to get a date theres an app. Its just incredibly unfair that we dont apply more of this sophisticated knowledge to the problems of lower-income Americans.
Among those drawn to the app  recently renamed Providers from Fresh EBT  is Kimberly Wilson a single mother in Spindale N.C. who has a 7-year-old son and cleans vacation rental homes. With her work interrupted by the pandemic she turned to food stamps which is also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP.

What Ms. Wilson said she likes most about the SNAP app is the ability to instantly check her balance which she does almost daily. Its a comfort knowing Im going to be able to feed my kid she said.
The app also explains the timing and amounts of her payments better than the state she said and it steered her to a broadband subsidy that saved $50 a month.
But the apps rewards transcend the particulars Ms. Wilson said: It leaves her feeling respected.
It makes you feel like its normal to need help she said which is especially welcome because she has relatives who post memes depicting people on SNAP as lazy and overfed. Its like somebody behind the screen is looking out for us. You feel like they care.
Andrea Young a Providers user in Charlotte N.C. goes as far as to say the app makes us feel like were Americans too.

With 42 million Americans receiving SNAP many conservatives dispute the notion that aid is elusive. They see dependency as a greater concern than red tape and argue that administrative contact serves important goals like deterring people who do not really need help or letting caseworkers encourage the jobless to find work.
The system should be striving to help individuals achieve self-sufficiency through employment rather than maximize benefits said Jason Turner who runs the Secretaries Innovation Group which advises conservative states on aid policy. When you pile benefit on top of benefit you make it harder to break free.
Poverty has long been linked to oppressive bureaucracy. Little Dorrit the 1857 novel by Charles Dickens lampoons the omnipotent Department of Circumlocution whose stupefying procedures keep the heroine down. The 1975 documentary film Welfare offers a modern parallel with footage that one critic called unbearable in its depictions of frustration and anger among caseworkers and clients.
Sometimes barriers to aid are created deliberately. When Floridas unemployment system proved unresponsive at the start of the pandemic Gov. Ron DeSantis told CBS Miami last year that his predecessors administration devised it to drive people away. It was Lets put as many kind of pointless roadblocks along the way so people just say oh the hell with it Im not going to do that he said. (Mr. DeSantis and his predecessor Rick Scott are both Republicans.)
Other programs are hindered by inadequate staffing and technology simply because the poor people they serve lack political clout. Historically administrative hurdles have been tools of racial discrimination. And federal oversight can instill caution because states risk greater penalties for aiding the ineligible than failing to help those who qualify.
To show that Michigans application was overly complex Civilla essentially turned to theater walking officials through an exhibit with fake clients and piped-in office sounds meant to trace an applications bureaucratic journey. Working with the state the company created a new application with 80 percent fewer words; the firm is now working in Missouri.
Michael Brennan Civillas co-founder emphasized that the Michigan work was bipartisan  it began under a Republican governor and continued under a Democrat  and saves time for the client and the state.
Change is possible he said.
With its California portal Code for America cut the time it took to apply for food stamps by three-quarters or more. The portal was optimized for mobile phones which is how many poor people use the internet and it offers chat functions in English Spanish and Chinese. In counties with the technology applications increased by 11 percent while elsewhere the number fell slightly.
During the pandemic Code for America built portals to help poor households claim stimulus checks and the expanded child tax credit. The latter alone delivered nearly $400 million. David Newville who oversaw the work quoted a colleague to explain why web design matters: Implementation is justice.

As the son of struggling immigrants from China Mr. Chen the founder of Propel understood hardship before he understood technology. There wasnt always enough to eat in an otherwise happy Kansas City childhood he said. (The family did not receive SNAP though Mr. Chen does not know why.) He graduated from Stanford worked at Facebook and left at 26 for a fellowship in New York hoping to produce software for people in poverty.
Mr. Chen founded Propel in 2014 with $11000 from a Kickstarter campaign pitched about 60 investors without success and went two years without a salary. After planning to work on SNAP applications he shifted to focus on people who were already enrolled and developed the balance display.
The existing technology did allow people to check their balances but it did not work well on mobile phones and a phone line required a 16-digit number. While studying how poor people shop Mr. Chen saw them buy cheap items  often a banana  to check the balance on their receipts. It struck him as disrespectful one more hassle that they did not need.
In tech terms a balance display was no special feat but reaching SNAP recipients was. Mr. Chen said the apps users checked it on average 17 times a month. Ms. Young 54 said she checked it more frequently than that.
I check it all day every day she said. It makes me reassured knowing that Im going to have food. Ms. Young who gets by on a disability payment of about $800 a month after injuring her back said she had run out of funds at the register; discarding items while others watched makes you feel like youre just pitiful.
Ms. Wilson said the app created a sense of belonging among people used to feeling stigmatized.
Ms. Wilson is so concerned about her balance that she keeps it in her head: It was $14.02 the other day.
While the app does not let users talk to each other she said it still created a sense of belonging among those who felt stigmatized. It just made me see there were a whole group of people out there in the same circumstance she said.
The app also tells people how much they have spent and where they spent it; offers recipes and budgeting tools; and provides news about other benefits. It generates revenue by selling ads often to grocers offering discounts or employers offering jobs; Mr. Chen said the goal was to align the companys financial interests with those of its users.
In early 2016 the app had a few thousand users. A year later it had about 200000. Propel landed investments from Andreessen Horowitz a top venture capital firm and the sports stars Kevin Durant and Serena Williams. Forbes estimated that the company was worth $100 million a sum that Mr. Chen called not far off.
Partnering with a charity Give Directly during the pandemic Propel distributed $180 million to randomly selected app users offering them $1000 each. It also moved into advocacy adding a feature that lets users ask their members of Congress to extend the temporary child tax credit expansion.
The app now offers an account that can receive paychecks and other government benefits prompted in part by the difficulties that the poorest households experienced in collecting stimulus checks because they often lack stable bank accounts.
However they make ends meet Mr. Chen said poor people should know where they stand without having to buy a banana.
We pay hundreds of billions of dollars to fund these programs he said. Why not make them work well?

Science:
Manatees Facing a Crisis Will Get a Bit of Help: Extra Feeding
In a first wildlife officials have decided to provide food for the mammals which have suffered catastrophic losses in Florida waters over the last year.
A manatee and calf in the Crystal River in Florida in November. Statewide more than 1000 of the mammals have died in 2021 a record. 
The starving manatees are easy enough to spot. You can see their ribs through their skin. They surface to breathe more than normal. Those most in need appear off balance listing to one side.
As manatee deaths spike and Florida rescue centers fill up with malnourished animals federal and state wildlife officials are trying something new in an urgent effort to help the species through the winter: They will provide food as needed at a key location on the states east coast where hundreds of manatees cluster when water temperatures drop.
This unprecedented event is worth unprecedented actions said Thomas Eason assistant executive director of Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission at a news conference on Wednesday.
The decision is a fraught one because scientists have found that feeding wild animals can do more harm than good. But Floridas manatees already threatened with extinction have suffered catastrophic losses over the last year. Statewide more than 1000 have died in 2021 a record. (In 2016 about 8800 of the mammals remained in Florida waters according to state wildlife officials.)
A joint task force of state and federal officials has linked the increased deaths to the loss of sea grass in the Indian River Lagoon a 156-mile estuary where manatees also known as sea cows seek warm water in winter months.
The sea grass was killed off by algae blooms fueled largely by human waste and fertilizer runoff from lawns and farms a problem decades in the making. As more people moved to the region and wastewater infrastructure aged more waste leaked into the estuary said Duane De Freese a marine biologist and the executive director of the Indian River Lagoon National Estuary Program.
The manatee situation is a symptom Dr. De Freese said. In 2011 it appears we hit a tipping point.
Since then sea grass has died off year after year he said and is now down by about 90 percent. As climate change brings more severe storms and sea level rise to the region the problem is expected to worsen.
The manatee feeding will be experimental and limited officials said and will likely provide leafy greens such as cabbage and lettuce. Thats similar to what manatees are given to eat when taken into captivity for rehabilitation said Patrick Rose the executive director of Save the Manatee Club a nonprofit group that pushed for the supplemental feeding.
We hope they will take it Mr. Rose said. Theres no guarantee.
The effort comes with risks. Boat strikes also kill manatees so further habituating them to vessels or people could be deadly. The feeding program is expected to include measures to prevent that from happening and to clean up any uneaten produce so that it does not fuel further algal growth.
Wildlife officials urged the public to refrain from feeding manatees. To help the animals they said locals should take measures to improve water quality such as avoiding fertilizer and pesticides on their lawns and switching from septic systems to a municipal sewer or upgrading septic systems if that is not possible.
Research focused on other species indicates that wildlife feeding while well intentioned can disrupt migration patterns spread disease and lead to a cascade of other unintended consequences. Short-term benefits can evaporate over time. A study on mule deer commissioned by Utah wildlife officials after the animals suffered during an extreme winter found increased survival and better reproduction after two years in a group of deer that received food but no difference after five said Terry Messmer a professor at Utah State University who helped lead the research. The deer that received food lingered longer in their winter range and suffered a surprising number of vehicle collisions.
But humans are already drastically altering the ecosystems that animals depend on. The important thing Dr. Messmer said is to proceed with caution and address the root problem.
This is a teachable moment he said of the manatees. Its unfortunate that were having too many of these teachable moments in our country and the world.

Last week after record-breaking rains muddy floodwaters surrounded her along with the stench of rotting crops. She had been trapped for days with just her cat and still didnt know when the sludge would recede.
It seems to take for bloody ever to go away she said watching a boat carry food into the town of Wee Waa. All it leaves behind is this stink and its just going to get worse.
Life on the land has always been hard in Australia but the past few years have delivered one extreme after another demanding new levels of resilience and pointing to the rising costs of a warming planet. For many Australians moderate weather  a pleasant summer a year without a state of emergency  increasingly feels like a luxury.
The Black Summer bush fires of 2019 and 2020 were the worst in Australias recorded history. This year many of the same areas that suffered through those epic blazes endured the wettest coldest November since at least 1900. Hundreds of people across several states have been forced to evacuate. Many more like Ms. Southwell are stranded on floodplain islands with no way to leave except by boat or helicopter possibly until after Christmas.

And with a second year of the weather phenomenon known as La NiÃ±a in full swing meteorologists are predicting even more flooding for Australias east coast adding to the stress from the pandemic not to mention from a recent rural mouse plague of biblical proportions.
It feels constant said Brett Dickinson 58 a wheat farmer who lives not far from Ms. Southwell in northwest New South Wales about a six-hour drive from Sydney. Were constantly battling all the elements  and the animals too.
Theres a tendency to think of such extremes as natural disasters or acts of God that come and go with news reports. But Australias nightmares of nature ebb and flow. Its droughts and floods though weather opposites are driven by the same forces  some of them timeless others newer and caused by humans.
Andy Pitman director of the ARC Center of Excellence for Climate Extremes at the University of New South Wales said the ups and downs of weather had been severe for millenniums on the Australian landmass which is as large as the continental United States and surrounded by powerful climate-driving oceans from the tropical South Pacific to the colder Southern Ocean off Antarctica.
By The New York Times
As a consequence the El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a patterns tend to hit Australia harder than they do other places with harsh droughts that end with major floods. Some scientists even suggest that the way marsupials reproduce with the ability to put active pregnancies on pause shows that the El NiÃ±o-La NiÃ±a cycle has been around long enough for flora and fauna to adapt.
Australia has been hit with harsh droughts that end with major floods a phenomenon caused by the El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a patterns and intensified by climate change.
On top of that already-intense variability Professor Pitman said are now two additional complicating factors: climate change and human decisions around building things.
Both make fires and floods more damaging.
A small change in climate coupled with a small change in landscapes can have a large impact on flood characteristics Professor Pitman said.
The results are already visible in government budgets. The cost of climate disasters in Australia has more than doubled since the 1970s.
Ron Campbell the mayor of Narrabri Shire which includes Wee Waa said his area was still waiting for government payments to offset damage from past catastrophes. He wondered when governments would stop paying for infrastructure repairs after every emergency.
The costs are just enormous not just here but at all the other places in similar circumstances he said.

Boxes full of supplies are stacked in front of photos of previous floods at the State Emergency Service headquarters in Narrabri.
More viscerally the impact of a supercharged climate is drawn on the land itself. Across the vast tracts of farmland and small towns between Melbourne and Sydney where much of the countrys food cattle wine  and coal  are produced the effects of fire drought and flood coexist.
Even in areas that did not burst into flames the heat waves and lack of rainfall that preceded the bush fires killed as much as 60 percent of the trees in some places. Cattle farmers culled so much of their herds during the drought that beef prices have risen more than 50 percent as they rush to restock paddocks nourished (nearly to death) by heavy rain.
Bryce Guest a helicopter pilot in Narrabri once watched the dust bowls grow from above. Then came just a monstrous amount of rain he said and new kind of job: flights to mechanical pumps pushing water from fields to irrigation dams in a last-ditch effort to preserve crops that had been heading for a record harvest.
On one recent flight he pointed to mountains of stored grain  worth six figures at least  that were ruined by the rains with heavy equipment trapped and rusting next to it. Further inland a home surrounded by levees had become a small island accessible only by boat or copter.

The flood plains in what is known as the Murray-Darling basin stretch out for hundreds of miles not unlike the land at the mouth of the Mississippi River. The territory is so flat that towns can be cut off with roads flooded by less than an inch of additional rain.
That happened a few weeks ago in Bedgerabong a few hundred miles south of Narrabri. On a recent afternoon a couple of teachers were being driven out of town in a hulking fire truck  equipment for one disaster often serves another. Across a flooded road behind them three other teachers had decided to camp out so they could provide some consistency for children who had already been kept out of school for months by pandemic lockdowns.
Paul Faulkner 55 the principal of the school (total enrollment: 42) said that many parents craved social connection for their children. The Red Cross has sent in booklets for those struggling with stress and anxiety.
Covid has kept everyone from their families he said. This just isolates them even more.
He admitted that there were a few things they did not discuss; Santa for one. The town is expected to be cut off until after the holidays as the waters that rose with surging rains over a few days take weeks to drain and fade.
Children in the area have been kept out of school for months first by pandemic lockdowns and now by the floods.

Still there were shortages everywhere  mostly of people. In a community of around 2000 people half of the teachers at the local public school couldnt make it to work.
At the towns only pharmacy Tien On the owner struggled with a short-handed staff to keep up with requests. He was especially concerned about delayed drug deliveries by helicopter for patients with mental health medications.
Ms. Southwell 69 was better prepared than most. She spent 25 years volunteering with emergency services and has been teaching first aid for decades. After a quick trip into Wee Waa by boat she returned to her home with groceries and patience checking a shed for the stray cats she feeds and discovering that only one of her chickens appeared to have drowned.
She said she wasnt sure how much climate change could be blamed for the floods; her father had put their house on higher stilts because they knew the waters would rise on occasion.
All she knew was that more extreme weather and severe challenges to the community would be coming their way.
The worst part of it is the waiting she said. And the cleanup.
An unofficial qualification to become chief executive of Patagonia seems to be an interest in extreme sports a strong meditation practice or both. The previous C.E.O. practiced Tibetan Buddhism. The one before that was a ski bum who liked to meditate. Yvon Chouinard the companys eccentric founder was a mountain-climbing Zen Buddhist.
So when Ryan Gellert was named C.E.O. of Patagonia in September 2020 his pedigree was hardly surprising. Mr. Gellert is an avid mountaineer and skier who has spent his career at outdoor retailers including Black Diamond. Though he is not a Buddhist he has a decades-long track record of social and environmental activism making him well suited to lead one of the most politically engaged corporations in the country. And with a business degree from the Florida Institute of Technology and a law degree from the University of Utah he rose to become head of Patagonias operations in Europe the Middle East and Asia.
Mr. Gellert took over in a moment of turmoil. Patagonia was one of the first U.S. retailers to shut its stores at the onset of the pandemic leading to major furloughs and some layoffs at the company which prides itself on taking care of its workers. Rose Marcario the companys C.E.O. abruptly resigned last summer without naming a successor. And in the midst of a global health crisis that shut down so much of the world Patagonias environmental activism sputtered.
Now more than a year into his tenure Mr. Gellert seems to be settling in to his role leading a private company with a big public profile. Patagonias business has recovered from the shutdown though it is now contending with supply chain issues and annual sales are on track to exceed $1 billion. The company which donates 1 percent of its sales to environmental groups has ramped up its activism and went so far as to pull its products from a mountain resort that hosted a fund-raiser for a conservative group. And Mr. Gellert has begun calling out other companies saying there is a special place in hell for those not combating climate change.
While that all might amount to distractions at other companies they are signs that for Patagonia at least things are getting back to normal.
This interview was condensed and edited for clarity.
A lot of people in this industry find their way into it from the mountains. Did you grow up outdoors climbing or skiing?
Thats my story as well but it starts on the beach and not the mountains. I grew up in Cocoa Beach Fla. so its not exactly a little alpine village in the hills. And I grew up in an era that in some ways feels like a forgotten past when as a kid you were always outside. There was an ocean across the street and a river right on the other side with dolphins and manatees and stuff. So I grew up surfing playing at the beach camping on islands.
So many people in Cocoa Beach build their lives around surfing and I was super inspired that some of those people went on to become professional surfers. I didnt share that passion but I always thought that when I got older I wanted to figure out how I could find something Im really into. Right after university I moved out West to Salt Lake to be a ski bum. Then I went rock climbing one time and that was it. That was the point I knew Oh Ill spend the rest of my life doing this. And its defined everything about my life for 25 years.
Did you study business in school?
I studied finance as an undergrad because I had no clue what I wanted to do. So it was a pretty uninspired choice. I did an M.B.A. and then went to law school. But I never took the bar and have never practiced law.
Then why law school?
It didnt have anything to do with being an attorney. It was about social work. I was volunteering with the homeless in Salt Lake City and assisting attorneys and was doing some work in the prison systems. I was really oriented into these social issues.
When I came back to work at Black Diamond after law school I started advocating for the protection of wild lands in Utah because Black Diamond is a Salt Lake City-based company and has a long legacy of working on those topics.
As an environmentalist how do you reconcile the tension between conservation and capitalism?
Were a consumer-goods business that makes apparel people may want and people may like. But were not making stuff that people need to survive. Lets be ruthlessly honest with ourselves about that. Lets also be ruthlessly honest about the fact that everything we do as humans has some impact on the planet. You have to constantly wrestle with this. And on behalf of Patagonia I try to really challenge ourselves on the notion of growth.
Could you foresee a moment when Patagonia doesnt want to grow anymore? What would it look like for a company to intentionally stop growing?
Theres the philosophical dimension of this and theres the operational dimension. What does it look like to either stop growing or move backward? Its really complicated. Holding a business flat might be the greatest magic trick in business. I dont know any example where thats ever been intentionally done and done successfully. Im not antigrowth. But I am deeply committed to making sure were moving at a pace that we think is appropriate. Weve walked away from distribution that was pretty meaningful because we just didnt feel like we could have an impact.

It is absolutely valid and important that people approach what they hear from business with a high level of cynicism.  Ryan Gellert
What makes you walk away from a distribution deal?
There are places where we say this just doesnt make sense for us. Lets get really honest with ourselves. Why are we here? And if the only answer is commercial its probably time that we pack up and move on.
How do you make sure all the activism work Patagonia does is not just marketing? How is it not greenwashing?
It is absolutely valid and important that people approach what they hear from business with a high level of cynicism. And if you do that about what you hear from us good. Thats a healthy posture.
If you really want to understand a business and its intent look at its body of work and make your own decision. I am comfortable with the imperfect but consistently committed body of work that Patagonia has delivered. We try to be relentlessly transparent both internally and externally about the work were doing and our shortcomings.
My belief is that our biggest contribution has not been the money weve given away. Its not individual issues that weve advocated for. Its not scaling grass-roots environmental activism through different levels of support. Its operating from the bowels of business and proving that businesses can exist to do more than maximize the wealth of their owners really consistently proving that in ways big and small over decades.
A lot of companies are getting drawn into political disputes these days. Is there something different about Coca-Colas advocating for voting rights versus Patagonias campaigning for free-flowing rivers?
We have a clear sense of mission. That grounds us. Were not in business to sell carbonated drinks. Our mission statement is: Were in business to save our home planet. That gives us a real clarity of mission.
I always resent the fact that people say We cant do it as a publicly traded company. You mentioned voting and I think it really speaks to how far we have fallen into this polarization trap as Americans that thats a contentious topic. Its insane to me that we make the notion of access and participation in voting something to be debated.
Do you ever consider how the political stances you take which are mostly aligned with Democratic priorities might affect the willingness of Republicans to buy Patagonia products?
I come from a fairly conservative family and I have respect for different viewpoints in general. And there is nothing that bothers me more than when people think that Patagonia is anti-conservative or conversely an extension of the Democratic Party because neither is true. What we are is a company with a set of values that believes in being radically and consistently committed to those and transparent about the decisions that we make  good bad or otherwise. I hate that that gets intertwined so deeply in this political environment. But weve got to move forward and advocate for the issues that we think are most critical.
Do you have faith that governments and big businesses are going to be able to stop runaway climate change?
Do I have faith? No I dont. The problems weve created are big enough and complex enough that we need all three levers of society working in sync to solve them. We need government doing what I would argue governments were created to do which is solve the biggest problems that we collectively face and I think government has consistently come up short of that. We need individuals making decisions in their lives that can have an impact and also showing up as part of civil society to do the same. And we need businesses stepping up. Some companies are starting to say the right things but I think there is a massive delta between what they say and what they do. So Im not optimistic.
The two big existential threats we as humans not only face but have created are the climate and ecological crisis and polarization. And polarization compromises our ability to deal with the first. So Im really pessimistic in that regard.
But we as humans have created this set of challenges and if nature has to solve for them it is not going to be pretty. I think we need to just show up and do the work. Im not a particularly down person. I like to have a good time and I just keep showing up. But you know if you really have me under truth serum and say you know how confident am I? I mean Ive got two young kids. Theyre going to inherit a world that is infinitely worse off than the one I grew up in.
How are the disruptions in places like Vietnam and the broader supply chain issues affecting the company?
The laws of economic gravity apply to Patagonia like they do others. Were feeling the impacts. Theyre uncomfortable. Theyre inconvenient. But we were navigating through them. Im a hell of a lot more concerned about the people in southern Vietnam where the vaccination rates are only now starting to scale than I am about that.
Starting in January space tourists will not receive a participation trophy for flying to space. But everyone will be on the honor roll.
The Federal Aviation Administration in January will retire its program to award Commercial Space Astronaut Wings after 18 years.
Jeff Bezos is officially an astronaut. Really  just ask the federal government.
The Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday that it was ending a program that awarded small gold pins called Commercial Space Astronaut Wings to certain people who flew to space on private spacecraft.
But before the program officially retires in January all who applied for the gold wings after flying to space this year will still receive them the agency said. That means Mr. Bezos the billionaire founder of Amazon who rode a rocket with his space company Blue Origin to the edge of space in July will be considered a commercial astronaut.
So will Richard Branson the founder of the space tourism firm Virgin Galactic who flew his own companys rocket plane to space in the same month. William Shatner the Star Trek star who flew with Blue Origin to the edge of space in October will also receive astronaut wings to go with his Starfleet paraphernalia. Twelve other people were also added to the federal agencys list of wing recipients on Friday.
The changes will help the F.A.A. avoid the potentially awkward position of proclaiming that some space tourists are only passengers not astronauts.
The Commercial Space Astronaut Wings Program was created by Patti Grace Smith the first chief of the F.A.A.s commercial space office to promote the private development of human spaceflight  a mandate from a 1984 law that aimed to accelerate innovation of space vehicles. The program began handing out pins to qualified individuals in 2004 when Mike Melvill a test pilot who flew the Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne plane became its first recipient.

To qualify for the commercial astronaut wings under the original guidelines a person had to reach an altitude of at least 50 miles the marker of space recognized by NASA and the U.S. Air Force and be a member of the spacecrafts flight crew.
Recognizing a surge in spaceflight activity the F.A.A. narrowed its criteria in July a day after Mr. Bezos launched to space. The updated version outlined in a five-page order required crew members to have demonstrated activities during flight that were essential to public safety or contributed to human space flight safety a tweak that aligned the program more directly to the F.A.A.s role to protect public safety during commercial space operations the agency said at the time. It also gave the head of the agencys commercial space flight office the discretion to grant wings to people who demonstrated extraordinary contribution or beneficial service to the commercial human space flight industry.
The advent of space tourism and especially the F.A.A.s new rules sparked debate over who can be called an astronaut.
NASA picks its astronauts through an exhaustive selection process and astronaut candidates endure years of safety and technical training before their first flights to space. By contrast passengers and paying tourists aboard Blue Origins New Shepard rocket train for a few days before launching to the edge of space and back in a fully autonomous mission that lasts roughly 10 minutes. Virgin Galactic Mr. Bransons space tourism firm offers a similar experience on a space plane that launches midair off a carrier plane.
Companies could nominate the private passengers on their rockets to be awarded commercial astronaut wings by the F.A.A. Blue Origin had nominated the passengers aboard all of its New Shepard flights by sending applications to the agency but the company hadnt received a response for months. It was unclear whether Mr. Bezos would meet the criteria for demonstrating activities during flight that were essential to public safety.
But the F.A.A. settled the uncertainty on Friday by tossing out its criteria from July and awarding the wings to everyone who flew to space on private spacecraft this year. The new criteria was outlined in the agencys statement: Any individual who is on an F.A.A.-licensed or permitted launch and reaches 50 statute miles above the surface of the Earth.
SpaceXs first four private passengers who spent three days in orbit aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft in September were also named as wing recipients.
Any private spaceflight passenger who flies to space before the years end will also be eligible. That will include Saturdays scheduled flight of six passengers by Blue Origin including Michael Strahan the TV host and former Giants defensive end.
Although no one will receive the little gold pins after 2021 those who fly above 50 miles on an F.A.A.-licensed rocket will be honored in the agencys online database.
But future space tourists should not despair a lack of post-flight flair. Virgin Galactic Blue Origin and SpaceX have each presented paying and guest passengers with custom-designed wings.
