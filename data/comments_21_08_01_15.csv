2021-08-09 10:22:20,These poor kids. I hope they recover soon.
2021-08-09 10:33:40,"Since we know all this, and we don't know the full long-term impact of the disease, why is it that states like NY and CT are allowing the local school districts to set the mask and other COVID health policies. Just as it is foolish to allow non-educators to determine educational policy, it is more foolish to allow educators to determine health policies. In small suburban districts, superintendents will follow the will of the people to maintain their positions. We should be concerned about the long-term effects on our children."
2021-08-09 10:36:34,"I am very touched by these brave and gifted young people who are telling their very unlucky conditions - which we all hope go away 100%.  Theirs is the time of life when you have the world in your hands.  So unfair.  I’m much older but a blood clot developed in my eye artery, extremely rare for diagnosed Covid or post Covid.   I have no other physical condition to explain it, all the tests.   Initially I lost all sight in my right eye 2 days after Covid illness and 2 weeks later from that  it is about 85% clear - on its own.  As with these young people, this is all new for my eye retina specialist who monitors it and time will tell."
2021-08-09 10:37:35,Thank you for reporting on this. Long covid has been the biggest question and fear I have as a parent of young children in this time and information has been very limited. Not sure why that is and why a better discussion of the risks hasn't been happening ahead of decisions to open up schools with very few precautions in place.
2021-08-09 10:44:19,This article is heartbreaking and makes the anti-mask and anti-vaccine crowd look even more unconscionably selfish than ever.
2021-08-09 11:02:04,"Long covid is real- these children suffering from fatigue, limited lung capacity and brain fog is real.  

The best reason to get the vaccine right now is you can protect children from the delta variant-

Your covid antibodies are not going to help with the delta and other variants- another good reason to get the vaccine today.

I have a young 30’s coworker in hospital today - he has been there for the past two weeks -he was unvaccinated and now regrets it.  Serious disease is preventable with the vaccine."
2021-08-09 11:06:54,"Meritocracy is unforgiving. 

COVID has merely further exposed the fragile — even brittle — nature of our glittering success stories that so easily become a “downward spiral.”

A belief structure that truly honored the equal value of every human, regardless of “mastery” would be fairer, more decent, and much more robust."
2021-08-09 11:09:33,"It's so important for some people to have ""freedom"" from the tyranny of masks and vaccines that they're willing to endanger the immediate and long-term health of children, even those they love. 

It boggles the mind."
2021-08-09 11:10:51,"I’m confused . . . Were these children vaccinated or not?  As I understand it, there is a difference in severity with breakthrough infections.  How does this relate to long Covid?  Either way, it’s terrifying and I worry about my grandsons."
2021-08-09 11:16:41,"As Someone with asthma, I fear long covid as I have bouts of lung inflammation every year that only strong steroids can get under control- I don’t want to get sick and have to enter an overwhelmed medical center and be “under treated” because they can’t see my history. That has happened.  It can take months to get it under control.

Get the jab- do it for yourself -do it because it helps society overall - just do it and let’s all get out of this."
2021-08-09 11:18:40,"Bad enough to pass on COVID to anybody, but responsible for harming a child, a kid?  

So sick of the unvaccinated now saying they are sorry.  Sorry?  They do not know the meaning of the word."
2021-08-09 11:20:08,Can somebody please send this to Governors DeSantis and Abbott?
2021-08-09 11:22:53,"I think it’s pretty irresponsible that this article doesn’t point out that these kids are all old enough to be vaccinated now. I know they all got Covid before vaccines were available, but this article shouldn’t make other parents worry about their teens."
2021-08-09 11:29:49,"The young people featured in this article, fortunately, have considerable medical and educational resources, not to mention parents who have time to schedule and get them to appointments. Through no fault of their own or that of their parents, how many teens suffering from long covid without access to these resources will see their recovery stalled?"
2021-08-09 11:32:16,"Here comes our next pandemic crisis---you can see it coming a mile away, but, the call for ""in-person"" learning, will be the controlling narrative driving local school boards and states to throw caution to the wind and open their schools to less than safe building environments. Having worked in schools for my entire career, you may be able to make a small elementary school somewhat safe--with social distancing, masking, and fully vaccinated staff. But, making a high school safe, the one I worked in had over 3, 000 students, good luck...And, when these break-outs start occurring, those ""in-person"" parent advocates, will be the first to blame/sue school officials for opening an unsafe school."
2021-08-09 11:32:38,"Long Covid is obviously serious, but we must be aware that if you suggest to millions of people that they can have this and that symptom after recovering from covid, a certain portion of the population will indeed have this and that symptom from placebo alone. Read the excellent books Placebo: Mind over Matter in Modern Medicine by Dylan Evans for the science on this or  You Are the Placebo by Dr. Joe Dispenza. That our minds and beliefs create a portion of our reality is not in question. The only question is how much?"
2021-08-09 11:34:52,"I am fifty four years old and suffered Covid in February 2020. They didn’t have a test, but I had all of the symptoms. I went to the emergency clinic and they took my vitals, my blood and swabbed my nose for the flu. I tested fine and went home and slept for 8 days, breathed deeply, woke up at night with a sweat soaked shirt, and had the worst headache every day for 2 months.
Then I fainted 6 times in my house. One of my faints left a hole in my drywall where my head hit. 
I own a business and can barely work and I don’t care.
I tell everyone that Covid can be a life changing disease that doesn’t go away.
It affects a person’s circulatory system and invades the brain barrier to affect your mind."
2021-08-09 11:36:59,"As an adult dealing with long covid since my initial infection in May 2020 I have always been put off with almost every major news outlet not reporting  the full picture of covid illness and in particular long covid.  As the numbers continue to suggest an individual is far more likely to deal with and recover with long covid than to pass from the disease. Why this isn’t being talked about and factored into policy measures is truly alarming. Additionally it is not clear if vaccination prevents the risk of developing long covid. 

So many news outlets (including this one. Just take a listen to the most recent Ezra Klein podcast on Delta) continue to not fully and accurately report on the current risk factors associated with this disease. This article at least pointed out that there are no current treatments that can really aid in recovery (except time/your body healing). A salient point that should be made over and over again to push people to get vaccinated."
2021-08-09 11:41:27,"A poster said: ""Can somebody please send this to Governors DeSantis and Abbott?""

No need.  They are aware and they don't care.  DeSantis is raking in cash and support by selling his ""Don't Fauci My Florida"" tee shirts and mugs, to those who are buying his anti C.D.C. rhetoric.
A warning message on his mugs and tee shirts should state:
"" I want to be president and I don't care if you die."""
2021-08-09 11:45:43,"Didn't have to be so.
Kids are only suffering hospitalization from Covid and long haul syndrome because of the thousands of people who for whatever reasons refuse to be vaccinated.  
It will continue and only get worse unless those people either choose to get the vaccination or are mandated to get the vaccine.
The virus WILL mutate again (and again and again) probably into a more deadly viruses and perhaps even one that will be resistant to the current vaccine until everyone is vaccinated.
And then it will be start from zero again. 
Thanks to all the antivaxxers."
2021-08-09 11:50:18,"This article references a few case studies.  However, where’s the diagnostics in correlating a connection between covid and the manifestation of symptoms months later?   Can the symptoms be associated with another  condition? What tests were performed?   I think every stone must be turned before a definitive correlation is made.  Too many people have had covid and this article will trigger fears that they may continue to suffer in the future.  Thanks for the reporting but if you’re going to interview a handful of people out of the millions who had Covid, you have to dig deeper."
2021-08-09 11:52:21,This shows the US really doesn't care about its kids.  The unnecessary damage being done to these kids is the result of those refusing to vaccinate.
2021-08-09 11:54:55,"Bless these children—I hope they all get better. I wish everyone who is an anti-vaxxer could read this story. Maybe it would touch many of them to change their minds. I feel sad for these kids, stuck in their prime years with such debilitating symptoms, not knowing if or how long it will take to improve. There seems to be so much unknown about this virus; it’s frightening for the rest of us too who haven’t been ill."
2021-08-09 11:57:07,"While is not a kid,  at my work there is a woman who had a relatively mild case of COVID in December. I must say ever since that she is, as we term it “fried”. She is not the same person in terms of her memory, focus, etc."
2021-08-09 12:09:21,"For the safety of our children we must now close our schools, mask up, no close socializing. Or we could let a few suffer the consequences of living normally with an acceptable risk."
2021-08-09 12:11:00,"Throughout the Pandemic, the lie has been promulgated that ""kids can't get Covid-19"". 

It has been amplified over and over, in what some could consider a criminal manner, on Facebook and fox news. How can you say you love your child, and then intentionally expose them to this virus?  

Yes, you can't get the shots (YET) for children under 12; but when the parents refuse to be vaccinated, and then are possible carriers of this deadly pathogen to those same children, one again must ask: Is the life of a child worth making your 'political statement'?"
2021-08-09 12:15:16,"I worry articles like this strike unnecessary fear into people’s hearts. Many people are doing absolutely everything they can short of going into a hole in the ground  and hiding to get through this. My point being there isn’t much more beyond hiding in a bunker for the next five years some can do. We’ve isolated, vaccinated, masked, etc. what else is there to do?? 

I feel like we need a PSA in this country;
1.death and sickness are part of life
2. There is no guarantee you will sail through life to age 90 in perfect health 

I empathize with the concern. had the flu the 2017/18 year and lost 15 pounds, could not work as I had previously for 6 weeks and have never been 100% the same as I was before. Viruses can change your body permanently. But again, short of getting in that bunker, what can we do??  I don’t know what else aside from vaccinating what we can possibly do."
2021-08-09 12:17:16,"A lot of adults have found that their long COVID symptoms resolve after getting vaccinated.  It would be interesting to know whether the kids in this story have tried that, and how it affected their symptoms."
2021-08-09 12:20:57,"Twenty years ago our daughter had mono twice during her senior year of high school. The second bout was much more severe. When she recovered, her illness became exactly like long Covid as described here. She had to go on the homebound program. We got no help whatsoever. The marching band leader kicked her out (she was a section leader). When I suggested she might have chronic fatigue syndrome, the doctor looked horrified. He said if he even mentioned ""fatigue"" in the diagnosis, none of her visits would be covered. Not that he treated her in any way - except to tell her to rest. It was devastating to her self-esteem and self-confidence. Eventually she recovered physically, but it broke our hearts to watch this super achiever spiral and eventually drop out of college in her junior year. She never finished her degree.

Reading this article brought all that pain, fear, and heartbreak back. I'm glad these long Covid kids are at least believed and treated."
2021-08-09 12:26:10,"A poster wrote, ""Can somebody please send this to Governors DeSantis and Abbott?""

Others have responded that Governors DeSantis and Abbott know and don't care; their only interest is the next election cycle. Governors DeSantis and Abbott are even more cynical than this. 

Being well-connected politicians with significant personal wealth, DeSantis and Abbott they know that should they, someone in their family, or their inner circle become infected by Covid-19  they will have access to effective therapeutics and treatment, such as those reported to have been provided to President Trump, his family and his allies, which are not generally available to the majority of the American public.

2021-08-09 12:43:48,"Why didn't I read about any of these kids getting vaccinated after experiencing long-haul symptoms? It's an open empirical question (see <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/03/31/982799452/mysterious-ailment-mysterious-relief-vaccines-help-some-covid-long-haulers"" target=""_blank"">https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/03/31/982799452/mysterious-ailment-mysterious-relief-vaccines-help-some-covid-long-haulers</a>), but getting a vaccine wouldn't hurt them and may help to ""reset"" the immune system."
2021-08-09 12:43:56,"I have relatives living in Jacksonville Florida -- a conservative area where the majority are unvaccinated. They are fully vaccinated but have tested positive. My step grandson is having cardiac issues (rapid heart beat) as a result. Other symptoms of ""mild"" cases include long-term brain fog, sensory loss, and who knows what else. Stubborn ignorance, disinformation and corruption are a threat to public safety and national security. If only we had  capable, principled leadership."
2021-08-09 12:45:01,And people are worried about the almost non-existent vaccine side effects.  Or how about the reasoning that it’s good to get COVID-19 so that you could develop the anti-bodies for COVID-19? I’m concerned about the disease of poor reasoning skills that this pandemic has exposed in the population at large.
2021-08-09 12:49:06,"Other viruses also have such or similar long-term side effects. It is very sad that hasn't been spoken about at a national level, I guess because very large numbers of people have not been affected on this scale before. People had no knowledge of what such a virus is and what it can do, or everyone would have hurried to get vaccinated months ago. Public education in the health care system has been entirely and completely lacking."
2021-08-09 12:50:41,"Just curious, were any of these kids vaccinated before catching Covid? Perhaps it was too early. It would have been interesting just to know."
2021-08-09 12:52:39,The non believers in vaccination must be living on another planet. I wish they were. We are just at the beginning of a fight against the vicissitudes of Nature on other fronts too. Maybe humans should not be at the top of the food chain since so many don’t deserve it.
2021-08-09 12:54:39,"Long-haulers have been well-known since the 1980's but were mocked by the CDC as ""chronic fatigue syndrome"".  Our history with covid is short, but our history with other viral long-haulers shows the condition is often (usually) life-long."
2021-08-09 12:56:57,"A primary school teacher, who I've known for awhile, got covid and it made her less tolerant to noise and choas. She started getting upset and irritant and had to leave the job. Now working as a housekeeper/janitor cleaning floors, toilets and emptying garbage bins.
I'm old enough to say, this pandemic makes me to start believing that zombie apocalypse is not that far-fetched."
2021-08-09 12:57:06,"My neighbor family all contracted covid last December. Parents and 3 teen boys. Bad flu-like symptoms, but no hospitalizations. 

Fast forward to Spring. Eldest son is a terrific baseball player, readying to pitch for a college that recruited him. His age group not yet eligible for vaccine. He resumes pitching practice with his vaccinated coach.

Comes home from practice and his arm is splotchy with purple marks, Then his chest. Rushed to ER; he had thrown blood clots from his arm to his lungs. 

Days in the hospital to stabilize. Docs come back after reviewing battery of test and conclude Covid virus was behind the clots.

This stellar teen athlete now has an array of specialists and is on blood thinners due to Long Covid.

I realize this is an anecdotal story but we're learning of more & more cases like this. And this case was not Delta which is much worse. I fear for the school openings sans masks. How many of today's kids will have lifelong illness due to covid?"
2021-08-09 12:58:27,"Well over a year ago, in the early days of the pandemic, I recall Commenting on these very pages how the ""young"" people who couldn't care less about ""locking down"" would develop long-term issues should they become infected.

This is not ""news"".  This is simply ""confirmation"".

Becoming infected with a virus and ""surviving"" because you're young does not mean you will escape long-term consequences."
2021-08-09 12:59:44,"This is reminiscent of Post-Polio Syndrome, which can occur in healthy polio survivors decades after recovering from the disease. PPS received significant attention from clinical researchers in the 1980's. Its impact continues today.

2021-08-09 13:00:18,"At a school in New Orleans where children had to mask and distancing protocals were enforced, the only problems came in one class where parents allowed and participated in noncompliant behavior at home. Otherwise, the students came through last year just fine. Hopefully, this will protect them this year with delta.
Also in New Orleans, Jazz Fest has been cancelled once again, devasting the tourism and entertainment industry. This blame, as well as the danger to children, goes right to the selfish fools who won't mask or get vax.
Another consideration: how will long covid affect the number of people with disabilities for years to come?
Many things to consider."
2021-08-09 13:04:33,As the headline says this is scary. It's a crime that Governors Abbott and de Santis care more about denialist Republican primary voters than they do about the health and well being of their constituents.
2021-08-09 13:16:30,I had to stop reading at chronic fatigue syndrome. Isn't that diagnosis very difficult to treat? 10-30% of adults infected with covid suffering from long covid! That is a huge number. The potential for long term treatment of these things is not good. Mostly things get better with time. I have not seen many studies on how long it takes to recover. This is not known yet. The potential for a disturbing future for 4-11 million Americans is daunting to say the least. To see children affected is heart wrenching.
2021-08-09 13:19:02,"As a psychiatrist and parent of high school aged kids I what how we are so sure that this ""brain fog"" and acting out in class isn't due to having recovered from Covid but to the stress of being in some form of lockdown and restriction for the past 18 months? In other words, a variation of PTSD. My kids are well adjusted and the stress of daily living with masking and disrupted school schedules and activities has been significant. This level of stress fell after they were vaccinated, but it remains bubbling under the surface. I understand the need of pandemic hysterics to attribute maladaptive behavioral symptoms to Covid but maybe, just maybe, the incredible stress we've subjected our kids to, often unnecessarily, is the real culprit. Let me guess the response: Can't be. It has to be covid!"
2021-08-09 13:21:09,Incredibly sad. Incredibly angry at those how alter the reality for politics.
2021-08-09 13:22:34,"In Florida, as in many other states, parents can be fined or jailed if their children do not attend school. That's what you call a mandate. But Governor DeSantis will not ""mandate"" masks in schools. He will not mandate that the places that he mandates children to attend are safe for the children. What is wrong with this idea of freedom?

Here is another horror to contemplate. The virus is programed to survive and propagate. To survive, it needs human hosts. As the adult population is vaccinated or otherwise develops immunities, the virus per force will turn to unvaccinated children.  There, it will mutate as its survival and propagation compel.

We are not out of this pandemic by any stretch of the imagination."
2021-08-09 13:24:23,"When the next variant starts killing off children, it will too late to talk about vaccines, classroom mask mandates & HEPA filters, and shutdowns. The die is cast. We had our chance."
2021-08-09 13:26:09,"Poor kids. I hope they feel like their normal selves again soon.

I wish states and schools would have stories like this in mind while preparing for classes to recommence. Mitigating risk is a more serious issue than some seem to think."
2021-08-09 13:28:57,I hope these kids feel better and more like themselves soon. But this is really scaring considering I am also apart of the young group. The possibility of knowing that this could happen to mee or anyone is frightening. But I know that soon enough there will be a solution to this problem.
2021-08-09 13:29:14,"If all of this is true, and even asymptomatic  infections in children can lead to ""long covid,"" then I am concerned that breakthrough infections that are asymptomatic, mild or moderate in adults might do the same. Are there any data, any studies on that question? If not, there should be. ""Long Covid"" has been linked to severe disabilities, and could cause long term damage to people of all ages. Yet it rarely comes up when CDC guidelines or discussions around policy arise. Nobody, as far as I know, has discussed it vis a vis the infections among those who've been vaccinated."
2021-08-09 13:29:34,"I’m supposed to send my 2nd grader to his first day of school on Tuesday. He’s been remote since March 2020.  AZ has banned mask mandates in schools and there’s not a great virtual option for his special needs like there was last year. We are about 2 weeks behind the curves in Louisiana and other southern states. This is exceedingly stressful deciding how to weigh the risks and benefits of school. Minimal data on delta and kids isn’t helping. Thank you, NYT for staying on top of this topic. My best info has come from your reporters."
2021-08-09 13:31:27,"The concepts of “personal freedom,” “religious liberty,” and others like those need to be challenged directly in court; how is it your freedom to do something that causes harm to others? In this case, of course, not wearing a mask, not getting vaccinated, etc.

The fact that these arguments have held any water at all in legal contexts is ridiculous."
2021-08-09 13:33:22,"And now little kids are getting Covid-19, the Delta variant, which is far more virulent. They can't get the vaccine and it will, without doubt, spread. It's not their fault, and there was no one to protect them. Their parents and all they came in contact with could have gotten the vaccine and insisted on masks everywhere. But they didn't, it was a political stance in favor of Trump, who told them it was nothing, don't go along with the assaults on their ""freedom."" And now the children are paying the price for a political stance. I'm caught between being furious and heartbroken."
2021-08-09 13:34:25,"With so much about the long term effects of this disease unknown, I feel fortunate to live in a state where masks are mandatory in schools. I also realize that politics will play a huge role in any future decision to relocate to other states. Florida, Texas, and Arizona are places I would never consider moving."
2021-08-09 13:36:41,"At age 7, I was hospitalized with pneumonia during the 1957 flu pandemic.  Doctors would say I made a complete recovery, but my respiratory system was forever damaged.  Not only have I been susceptible to respiratory illness my whole life, but I have a permanent ache in my chest.  Every single breath hurts. The ending of my story - that there were forever aftereffects of a childhood illness - does not have to be your story.  Get yourself and your family vaccinated ASAP."
2021-08-09 13:37:05,"With the terrible potential consequences of Covid-19, it is distressing that vaccines are still unapproved for those under age 12, especially with in-person learning so advocated for the coming school year. Would it be legal for a Covid-19 vaccine to be used ""off-label"" to protect those children? Perhaps lower dosage would be appropriate to take into account the smaller size of children?"
2021-08-09 13:39:45,"Now, ""Suffer unto me the children"" has been perverted by these Republican governors, legislatures, extreme 'evangelist Christians' and anti-public health measurers, into 'make the children suffer'. All for their own political self interests, or misguided selfish personal 'freedom'. I keep hearing now 'if only I had taken the vaccine' and just this week 'my Dad refused to let my mother get me vaccinated' from a 16 year old walking with an oxygen tank...the 'Right to Life'argument should not end with birth but extend to protect ALL children by vaccinating them. They are OUR future after all."

2021-08-09 13:41:13,"We are entering the most violent side of the eyewall that is hurricane Covid/Delta. Kids are starting to die. The long term effects of Covid/Delta are starting to emerge. At least two governors seem to have only ONE constituent, and will do nothing to help the true believing poor saps in their states. Meanwhile, 800,000 ""manly"" men and women gather maskless and unvaccinated to hold a super-spreader event to worship motorcycles and Trump. I have no sympathy for them or the family members they sicken and kill when they return home."

2021-08-09 13:45:45,"I feel for these kids. I had what was probably mono (EBV virus) nearly 30 years ago and since then have struggled with a myriad of symptoms including chronic pain, muscle twitches, tinnitus, tremors and memory and concentration problems. I'm diagnosed with CFS and Fibromyalgia but that doesn't amount to much since  no medication has helped and it took years of struggle for any doctor to take me seriously. It really limited the course of my life and infuriates me that all these kids including my own young son may have to deal with this too, should he become infected before the vaccine is available for his age group. At this point it's unconscionable that all children and adults who are eligible for vaccination aren't. The time is long past for coercive measures on a national level."
2021-08-09 13:48:17,"Unfortunately, it seems more and more evident that certain Republican politicians are gleeful about the spreading devastation of the Delta variant; notably, Governors DeSantis and Abbott,  who do everything in their power to facilitate widespread infection. And Republican pundits openly salivate while opining that this will ""hurt Biden."" They equate this with Democrats demanding that Trump do more to STOP the spread, a bizarrely irrational parallel. 

In 2020, >4.2% of Covid hospitalizations were children, and Delta appears to impact them more. One of the GOP's most tragic lies has been that children are immune to Covid. It has caused -- and will continue to cause -- widespread suffering."
2021-08-09 13:48:53,"Long covid is chronic fatigue syndrome. Chronic fatigue syndrome is not psychosomatic. I have been disabled with CFS for 25 years after having had a minor viral illness. It’s most important not to try and push through long covid or CFS. The best chance for improvement (or at least to avoid getting much worse) is to rest after every physical or mental activity, and thereby avoid post-exertional malaise (PEM), the hallmark symptom of CFS and also a prominent symptom of long covid."
2021-08-09 13:53:16,"And the stats on how common this are are where exactly..? 

I mean look, I feel terrible for these kids, but you can't base life decisions or do risk assessment based on anecdotal evidence. I had scarlet fever as a child- it was an awful experience. But it'd be pretty silly to make that front page news in my neighborhood when I had it in the 90s, let alone on the front page of the news- scarlet fever is insanely rare in this day and age! 

So can we please get some hard numbers on all this, to determine likelihood of facing similar circumstances? I keep on hearing whispers of ""so and so got sick after getting the shots and was hospitalized,"" ""this person died in spite of getting both shots."" Well yeah, we know the shots aren't 100% effective. But how common are these cases and what other conditions did the people affected have? When I start poking around for details with these anecdotes, eventually it comes out ""oh, well, I heard this happened to my brother's best friend's uncle's roommate. And I think he's actually in his 60s, is 50 lbs overweight, and is a chronic smoker that was working in a health clinic."" Nice- so you're saying we need to upend life as we know it with someone who fits every statistical outliner as your data paint. That makes perfect sense."
2021-08-09 13:57:14,More evidence that schools are opening too early. Why not wait until everyone is vaccinated? Why force this? Is it that hard to wait another 6 months or so before making things in-person? Why are Americans so impatient? They have to have everything NOW.

2021-08-09 13:59:42,"Tragic for anyone to contract Covid, sympathy for those who refuse a vaccination is nil. Stories like this

We reduce- eliminate mask mandates for all.

We “reopen “ for summer.

We have a more virulent virus now.

We don’t wear M-95 masks.

Those of us who are vaccinated and run around without a mask, are just as likely to be carriers as those of us without vaccine.

So, seriously folks,  is it truly any surprise that the vast majority of us are acting as if we want to kill kids ?

Bluntly speaking,  looks like the vast majority are accessory to murder of all children 11 and under.

We have not seen anything that distinguishes ""Long COVID"" from the diagnoses above, which are all well-known complications of illness and injury and do not appear to be more common following COVID than similar infections. At a certain point fixating on COVID becomes harmful, the focus needs to be on correcting the abnormal neurovascular responses preventing a full recovery."

2021-08-09 14:32:10,"What bothers me about these articles is that we are never given any sense of what these long-term symptoms are. In the vast majority of long Covid patients, we are talking about mild fatigue that goes away or loss of sense of smell that returns after 8-12 weeks. But in a relatively small number of patients - a fraction of the 9-10 percent having lingering aftereffects -  the symptoms can be long-lasting and truly debilitating. Just like with life-threatening allergies that are lumped in with minor food intolerances, these broad statements actually undermine support for those who really need it."

It is impossible to get them to wear masks properly, and even if they do, what happens when they remove the masks to have lunch and snacks during the school day? I fear that we will see a spate of outbreaks and a return to remote learning. Our first obligation is to protect young lives.

While the article didn’t comment on vaccine status of the parents, in these cases, vaccine hesitancy on part of the parents wouldn’t have affected their children directly. But I can’t help but wonder about the children who are now eligible for the vaccine but who can’t or won’t get it due to anti-vax parents. If those kids get long Covid, how will that affect their relationship with their parents? On top of normal teen angst, imagine knowing that a lifetime of potential health consequences could have been avoided due to science, but your parents denied that protection to you. Most kids grow up and realize their parents were wrong in so many ways, but I can’t imagine having to live with that potentially life-long reminder of a parent’s mistake."

Luckily that improved quickly, but my resting heart rate is still frequently above 100 and I still get shortness of breath going on 9 months after initial infection.

Now that the vaccines have been largely proven to be safe and effective, the argument seems to just have pivoted to 'well its my FREEDUMB to chose whether I want it or not'. I've never been so sure in my life that modern day republicanism is a mental illness. There's simply just too many dumb people who've had it too good for too long in this country."

2021-08-09 15:08:01,"As mentioned there are similarities to the Long Covid symptoms and other health issues. I was on gabapentin (Neurontin) for shingles pain and have the same symptoms as long haulers, even off the drug. I asked a researcher why there was this strange overlap and here's his response ""One of my colleagues has shown that coronavirus spike protein acts on an ion channel complex in much the same way the gabapentin does, so there really may be a very interesting connection there."" My daughter has NCS/dysautonomia so again, I see these symptoms in her. Other medications such as anti-anxiety drugs can produce this same wide range of reactions.

One tiny piece of good news is that now maybe researchers will focus on the neuro systems and how both medications and viruses can harm them. I wish the Long-Haulers good luck. The lower the dose of gab and the longer I've been off it the better I am. However, the memory issues and confusion are still an issue. Let's hope they'll connect the dots for everyone."

It talks about the dangers of long covid in kids while mostly skirting the bigger questions: How many kids have it? What are the odds that kids will get it? Are they significant or miniscule? If very few kids get significantly ill from covid, what percentage of those kids are at risk? And what do health experts think re returning to school? 

A story this alarming needs a l lot more hard data and less purely anecdotal material. This story feels like something you'd see on cable news: A lot of sizzle, very little steak."

Have more children been damaged emotionally, socially and academically (some for life?) by school closures than have been very sick with Covid? 

This choice had to be made by those responsible around the world. Governments, not unions, took their responsibilities. 

Many places (like Switzerland) used creativity & precautions without huge infrastructure investments because citizens understood the dangers to younger/poor/challenged children of keeping schools closed for so long (especially to those least able to adapt, the already underserved). Some had school every other day, others used masks ... but kept the needs of kids first in the calculations early. 

We do know that there have been no great outbreaks of Covid in any of the countries where schools reopened as early as May 2020.  If there had been they would be front page news exploited to the hilt."

Polio killed nerves, others grew to do double-duty, but now those tired-out nerves are dying. The virus's ultimate guided missle target was the brain stem!   Constant pain--like swarms of bees constantly stinging--plus fatigue and brain fog are our constant companions.  Hopefully, further COVID after-effect research will allow any affected organs to heal."

A month and a half later, the symptoms of long-Covid began which included nonstop breathing difficulty and exhaustion. Eleven months after that, our young person who was an athlete is just a little bit better. He is being seen by the long-Covid clinic that has seen more such patients and for longer than for any other group in the US. The numbers cited by Francis Collins seem about right, based on what we are hearing:

""... Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, cited one study suggesting that between 11 percent and 15 percent of infected youths might 'end up with this long-term consequence, which can be pretty devastating in terms of things like school performance.' ""

In the beginning, some people looked (somewhat callously) at their personal odds of death, shrugged and said, I'm under 50 so I'm good. Long Covid is another ballgame -- with the potential to produce lifelong effects on health and functioning. Maybe it's time to emphasize that. Not interested in getting long Covid (I'm vaccinated) and definitely not interested in passing it along to my kid just in time for her to enter early adolescence with long-term health issues to deal with. What parent would willingly pass that on to their child. Child's not dead, but who wants a 13 year old with long Covid effects for an unknown period of time. Until under 12s can be vaccinated, the pandemic still exists for our family and we have continued to operate that way."
2021-08-09 15:50:04,"My friend's chronic fatigue symptoms started 30 years ago, after a trip to Thailand where he developed a bad flu or gastrointestinal illness. He felt like he never fully recovered from that, then over time symptoms would worsen and then get better, briefly. Over time, it's become debilitating. The tinnitus, joint pain without redness or swelling, extreme exhaustion after a moderately busy day, extreme shortness of breath, etc., all seem like a chronic viral infection of his brain and nervous system, or a neurological problem triggered by an immune response. There's basically no research being done that I can see, but maybe interest in Covid will help uncover something relevant. It's been very sad to see the lack of even minimal progress for his condition."
2021-08-09 15:53:02,"I feel for theses kids, I truly do. But the doctors seem so quick to prescribe anti depressants and anti anxiety meds. More research needs to be done on the physical manifestations of long Covid than just the mental aspects. Has anyone studied the effect on the gut biome of these kids?"
2021-08-09 15:54:28,"Long-term damage from tick-borne infections impacts children and adults in much the same way as Long Covid.   Although this is still a debated topic going on for decades.   The funding for research is still in its infancy.

Some will suffer from both, especially those who cannot be vaccinated now or chose not to be.  

 The CDC estimates 450,000 Americans contract Lyme disease a YEAR.  (this does not include the co-infections like Bartonella, Babesia, etc)    I would call that number an epidemic, but the CDC remains ""concerned"".

Now that we have a Pandemic with long-term damage in some cases maybe the funding will bring more awareness to those who continue to suffer from tick-borne infections too.  At least these cases might be taken more seriously now and actually tracked.  

Many of the symptoms are the same as Long Term Covid and overlap in many cases."

There are also recent, large, high-quality studies that indicate far lower long covid numbers than those cited here."
2021-08-09 16:18:56,"As a school nurse, my heart truly goes out to these children. Technically, we are entering the third school year where children across this country are educationally compromised. For many, another academic year has started with strikes against them. Some of these students especially in underserved communities are already grade levels behind starting school with mental health as well as socioeconomic issues. Medication does not resolve a lot of what these kids have to endure. As child advocates, School nurses are definitely going to see and care for much of what this COVID crisis had done to our children academically, emotionally, and physically.

2021-08-09 17:02:51,"I am highly pro-vaccine, liberal, anti-Trump, etc.  However, I think this is one of the most overwrought and, to be frank, irresponsible articles regarding COVID and children that I have seen in this paper.  For example, the article (and possibly the studies) makes no attempt to separate correlation from causation, to tease out the secondary mental and physical effects of social isolation/remote learning/mask-wearing (i.e., headaches, difficulty concentrating, insomnia) on children from those effects brought on by long COVID itself.   The percentages cited by the author are all over the place.  The Nature study, hyperlinked but otherwise unreferenced in the article, states that the ""numbers might not be that high,"" that they may be ""artificially inflate[d]"" due to the conflation of symptoms possibly caused by other ""pandemic related phenomena"", such as ""school closures"" and the ""trauma of seeing family members sick.""   The article also omits a recently UK study published in Lancet, concluding that ""only a small proportion of children had illness duration beyond 4 weeks, and their symptom burden decreased over time.""   It is frustrating to see such a shrill (and, again, highly influential and narrative-generating) headline accompanied by an article so lacking in nuance and context."

2021-08-09 17:46:55,"Thank you Pam Belluck and NY Times for catalyzing conversation about this issue. I have been treating long COVID for more than a year, and seeing children affected by long COVID is always the hardest. 
 
In treating what we think is the largest cohort of long COVID patients in the world, and through our research building on decades of virology work going back to HIV, we’ve been able to gain some insights: long COVID is real, it has a specific cause that can be objectively identified, and it can be treated.
 
Based on our clinical research, long COVID occurs when spike proteins of the virus remain in reservoirs of the immune system within the bloodstream. These spike proteins circulate throughout the body and pass through the blood-brain barrier, causing inflammation and the symptoms we see in patients. The remaining spike proteins also create a unique immune system “fingerprint,” which allows us to reliably diagnose long COVID using a non-subjective measure, understand the underlying physiology and ultimately treat the cause, rather than just the symptoms.  
 
Especially because the delta variant is even more highly contagious and a large percentage of people are already affected by long COVID, the medical community has a responsibility to continue to make long COVID a public health priority and to continue to prevent spread of COVID. This is especially critical for young people as they start back to school in the Fall.

2021-08-09 18:32:56,"Western governments are going to make sure China compensates the families of the dead and injured, correct? Isn’t that part of the social contract?

While I received a vaccine as soon as it was offered, defense is a very, very, very difficult game to play against a virus, hence the emphasis on early containment.  That’s why you see doctors rush to areas when there is an Ebola outbreak - the only way to win against a virus is to defeat it as its source.

The world expected China to live up to Articles Six and Seven of the International Health Regs [IHRs] requiring timely, accurate, detailed notifications in the event of a public health emergency - a Treaty to which China  signed and legally obliged to uphold. 

Viruses are very good at evolving and vaccinating every person on the planet is a monumental task. Delta variant came from India where there are 1.3 billion people to vaccinate.

Moreover, unlike countries like China, the United States does not strictly restrict travel and immigration.

We all recovered without hospitalization, although my newborn had a rough go of it with an extremely high fever.  At my son's next doctors appointment, 3 months later, my formerly healthy, growing son had become lethargic and had lost significant weight (he was below the 1-percentile line).  By the time he turned 1 he was in physical therapy because he couldn't sit up, and eventually we added speech therapy because he doesn't say anything but ""da.""  I'm happy to report that with lots of work, he started walking a few weeks ago, and he is now trying to imitate more sounds.  But this is seriously no joke - protect your kids, wear a mask.

The global patient community of ME has been neglected, marginalized and ignored since it was first recognized. If only, the medical community that is now devoting limitless time and resources to Long Covid, partnered and data shared and collaborated with infectious disease experts worldwide, who have spent their careers trying to solve the mystery of what causes these virtually identical diseases, we may actually begin to get traction in terms of efficacious treatment and potentially, one day, a cure."

ACA (Obamacare) is still around but not for want of trying by Republicans of all stripes, and of course President Trump.  If Senator McCain didn't hate Trump so much, he might have killed ACA. 

Republicans in Congress and state legislatures have waged war against their own constituents by doing their best to kill them off with COVID lies, misinformation, and bans on virus prevention measures like masks, and lockdowns.  The virus has a very potent ally in one special Republicans.   Governor DeSantis has become a fighter for Floridians right to die, a switch from R's usual right to life platform.  

I have no idea what the endgame is for DeSantis when it turns out he helped kill thousands simply to appear more Trumpian than Trump.  It's Trump's base that still believes this is all a hoax.  The purveyors of Conservative porn on Fox are abetting the slaughter.  

It's possible the CDC's changing guidelines are too confusing for the COVID deniers. Maybe a football analogy might help;
'Let's pretend the CDC is the QB, and the defensive line is the virus.  When the virus mutates to stop the QB's planned attack, the QB calls an audible (new guideline) to score a TD (kill the virus).'  Politicians stand up to take a bow, (extra point after touchdown), and the game goes on, calling audibles as needed until the clock runs out."

That to me would seem to constitute being more virulent, but I am not an epidemiologist. But producing that much more virus in a shorter amount of time would explain how it can overrun an unsuspecting immune system, in other words, one that hasn’t been given a heads up alert to watch for it.

Please get vaccinated. We are a very lucky nation in that we have plenty of vaccine. This mutation evolved in a population without vaccines.. the next one will be worse."
2021-08-04 13:26:53,"It's relatively straightforward to apply Bayes' formula to this and see that if the vast majority of older people are vaccinated, then the ones left to be infected and possibly hospitalized are mostly young people.
The reporting on this issue should really improve. Very soon we will have a situation in some states where perhaps 0.3% of all vaccinated people who catch the virus are hospitalized but 5% of the unvaccinated. That will mean that half of the hospitalized people are fully vaccinated, simply because there are so many more vaccinated people. With questionable reporting like this, people will start to think that the vaccines don't do anything, which is patently untrue. They save countless lives, and the sooner young people get vaccinated the better, for their own sake."

2021-08-04 14:01:11,"I’m not understanding the confusion some of these healthcare professionals seem to have. Maybe it’s a different Covid, they say more than once in the article. We don’t understand why patients are sicker, they also say. 

But Dr. Fauci has already stated emphatically that this is a different virus. The CDC has also already stated that the viral load is exponentially higher with Delta than prior variants (higher viral load = more illness), and that it is more transmissible. They have also stated that the unvaccinated are at high risk, even if they got sick with a prior variant, because this is a different virus.

That is a month Delta still has to do damage. 

I am more than certain the CDC is looking on in horror as places like Florida are reporting more than 10,000 infections per day. The horror is that infections are a leading indicator and if you work the numbers, IF ONLY ONE PERCENT of those infected die you are looking at 100 people. A full month at that rate is 3,000 people just in Florida alone! And still young people and Desantis are willing to take that chance..."

It seems quite evident that the timing of such goals came at a time when a stronger Covid variant was proliferating throughout this nation and the world. Foxnews, Newsmax, Facebook, and all the other usual suspects deserve all the credit for creating such renewed havoc amongst so many hospitals and medical facilities across the nation, again!"

Clearly, since grandma and grandpa have been vaccinated this ""smart virus,' in keeping with the science, is mutating, and as it does, is now finding hosts who happen to be younger. What has been proven is that along with the vaccine, non-pharmaceutical protocols do work..and that's what we have to trust. The CDC may have erred with its ""free for all"" approach to unmasking, giving the unvaccinated even more reason to delay vaccination. Looking ahead, the advocacy must continue because the fear, whether real or imagined, still exists.  And it's not enough to say well my family and I are safe so it's everyone else's problem.

But, this inherent error in measurement arising in physics helps us in understanding how difficult it is to prepare for the next biological mutation or variant arising from the evolution of this virus.  The targeted virus is continuously changing, and if we are not careful we will be caught fighting this ""new"" war with the technology and strategies we used in the ""last"" war.

With a US vaccination rate of about 50% compared to a global vaccination rate of approximately 15%, there is a huge universal set of potential mutations with humans acting as their incubators that could eventually break through the vaccine's current ""silver bullet"" protection. If 85% of the world has not been fully vaccinated, and with a global population of about 7.88 billion people, then about 6.70 billion individuals act as potential sources of new mutations which could eventually evolve into a ""break-through"" mutation.

Anyone that believes a virus discriminates is not only misguided but not too swift. 

When the previous administration pushed for schools to open because the numbers did not reflect children were being infected in large numbers, I just shook my head. I knew time WOULD tell! 

When the virus started disproportionately affecting people of color, I shook my head because viruses do not discriminate! 

In the early 80 when dealing with HIV, we eventually learned it was about behaviors. To reduce the risk, you had to modify the high risk behaviors.

Unfortunately, we are behind the curve on COVID. In the same way 45 tried to claim the hurricane would have a different trajectory, he decimated fake news and convinced most Americans that he knew what he was talking about. And, some parents and young people started believing they were not at risk.

COVID knows your body better than you! They are getting sick because they got a virus that knows their vulnerabilities and they are delusional in believing their immune system is strong enough to fight it because they are young. FYI, not all young people are healthy and not are young people know their vulnerabilities."

He was only provided an oximeter, nothing to break the development of the infection, not even Remdesivir, given an EUA by the FDA. Is this proper medical care?

The report says: ""Donald McAvoy, 33, a bodybuilder …toward the end of June, he had a runny nose, which he thought was a cold or allergies…he got a coronavirus test. It was positive, and he was sent home with a small device called a pulse oximeter to monitor his blood oxygen levels.

Within days, his condition deteriorated, and he collapsed on the floor of the bedroom. His blood oxygen levels were at rock bottom: 56. A normal reading is 95 or higher.

At Baptist Medical Center Beaches, he was put on oxygen and admitted to the intensive care unit, where he spent 11 days…His doctor told Mr. McAvoy that he had been infected with the Delta variant.""

   Instead we get articles with
"" It isn’t clear why they are so sick""
"" not like the patients they saw last year.""
Really ? Or maybe they are and the data needed to show it was never collected and still isn't being collected. And the ER doctors and epidemiologists are just left to guess.
But they can all ask, are you vaccinated ? Okay good, that's one data point, how about getting 20 to 30 more and have the statisticians start to get busy. USA didn't really treat this like a war, but more like a bingo beer pong party in an enclosed stadium."

Astonishingly little commentary -- either from the professional pundits or the general pubic -- mentioning that international policy protecting patent rights is creating vaccine scarsity in poorer countries. If universal vaccination is required to protect us, why are we not insisting that patent protection be waived in order to provide affordable vaccines to the entire world? It's not as if the virus will respect our borders.

But let's blame each other and keep the fear levels high. That much better for our corporate overlords."

With over 3000 kids apart from faculty and staff, to have even a small stubborn population of individuals not vaccinated and vulnerable to infection means yet another year of fractured education. The whole masks in class but not outside is a pointless mandate. Kids coalesce into groups with each other and with teachers. It will be looked forward to even more after this long break away from friends. How will anyone be able to differentiate the vaccinated from the unvaccinated? Even amongst the vaccinated, the response to the virus will vary and give the school a reason to test. My son predicts school shut downs within two weeks of school. I predict shut downs in the first week. This need not be. If everyone except for those with medical exemptions were vaccinated, if masks were uniformly mandated within school premises, inside and out, we might make for a less confusing and safer atmosphere.

2021-08-04 15:46:46,"The Delta variant is “as contagious as the chicken pox.” How contagious is that, exactly? 

I’m 35- old enough that I got the chicken pox from a friend, but young enough to have no context at all for its level of contagion. The chicken pox vaccine went into circulation in the US in 1995, making this a pretty outdated comparison without additional supporting data."
2021-08-04 15:47:36,"Does anyone feel any responsibility toward the nation’s children? Do we not collectively have an obligation to them at this point after last year? To help get them back on track, into school, offering services and mental health treatment?

They are all of our future."
2021-08-04 15:47:53,"This is more bad news for the unvaccinated persons getting COVID. It is no surprise that the Delta Variant is making younger adults 'Sicker, Quicker' Each persons would be expected to respond differently, not only on the basis of age, weight, lifestyle, nutritional and immune status, health checkups, compliance with safety precautions like masks and reasoning for vaccine hesitancy. Since comprehensive data is lacking, no conclusions can be drawn but as a virologist I can say that amount of viral exposure can vary and a higher exposure could well result in a severe illness. Although previous data on older adults did suggest that those with certain underlying conditions would also become severely ill and even die. It makes perfect sense for all those who have never had a previous COVID or never been vaccinated before should get themselves fully immunized at God speed. This way a key variable will not make interpretation of the limited data much easier so that better public health measures could be introduced on sound scientific basis. Wearing proper masks properly should be required as a first time and educating the younger generation of the value of vaccines could go a long way in eliminating vaccine hesitancy."
2021-08-04 15:50:20,"Personal perspective as a US research physician: We are stuck with this for years. Reasons:
1) Insufficient vaccination, below 80%. Many Americans reject science, vaccines, masks, and are prey to demagogue politicians and broadcasters.
2) Numerous other countries with poor vaccination rates; there will continue to be a trickle of immigrants or travelers who will unknowingly bring the disease with them
3) Without eradication of the virus, more opportunity for mutation to new variants that will be less responsive to current vaccines, which will mean we will fall behind in the arms race.

Implications: Mounting widespread chronic disability, which will erode the workforce, tax revenues, strains on the health care system, hospitality field, restaurants, museums, sports, concerts, movies, education, military forces.

Perhaps the pattern will eventually become similar to the 1918 influenza, may become a more docile form of the virus. But no sign of this so far. Expect years of masks, vaccine boosters, reduced socializing.

Meanwhile, we are vulnerable to further pandemics by our close interacting with other species, and we do not have a preparedness task force."

I'm not worried about what conservatives are doing as they're out of my orbit. 

The same logic should apply for all not just those on the opposite side of the spectrum."
2021-08-04 16:05:11,"The evidence increasingly shows that even the young and supremely fit - and fully vaccinated - can get the Delta strain. Several young NZ athletes in the US on track and field scholarships, all fully vaccinated, have contracted covid. One said it was like going 20 rounds with Mike Tyson. 

But the fully vaccinated are at least far less likely to get seriously ill."
2021-08-04 16:06:58,"I was told by an older family relative that when the Polio vaccine came out in the 50's, they were told that on this day to wear short sleeves to school because that was the day they were going their Polio vaccine.  No questions asked.  What happened to Polio?  What happened to common sense?  What happened to listening to those who are doctors and scientists?

If people would take responsibility for themselves, family, friends, co-workers and everyone around them and do the right thing, it could be a more seasonal thing but instead - ""It's all about me.  I'm not going to get it, that's way I have an immune system.""  I have heard them all and to that I say -  ""Survival of the fittest, smartest and less selfish""."

2021-08-04 16:15:24,"I’m still unvaccinated. Not by choice, but because there are no vaccines available where I live except for ineffective Chinese vaccines available for high risk groups. 

Yet all I see in the US is constant moralizing about unvaccinated right-wingers and young people within the US. But the virus knows no national borders. If people were genuinely concerned about the virus continuing to spread and mutate, and if people were concerned first and foremost with getting more needles into arms, that moralizing anger would be directed at rich governments and BigPharma and their catastrophic failures to provide access to billions of people around the world who want vaccines but can’t get them. 

But that really doesn’t seem to be the primary concern on the contemporary American left. Instead, the primary concern of the contemporary left seems to be moralizing and hatred as ends in themselves, giving rise to an equal and opposite reaction from the other tribe. By constantly stoking this mutual hatred, the people in actual power get off with complete impunity. Stop taking the bait."

2021-08-04 16:40:22,"This seems pretty obvious.

Its survival of the fittest from the disease’s POV.

The disease is mutating and because so many older people have been vaccinated the mutations that now ’thrive’ are those that attack unvaccinated people and a lot of younger folks are unvaccinated and engaging in ‘riskier’ exposure behavior.

2021-08-04 16:49:17,I just read in another Times article about a drummer who was dropped from his band because he wouldn’t get vaccinated. However he had had the virus and his doctor recommended that he not get the virus because of an auto immune disorder. Why are no exceptions made for people who have had the virus. Couldn’t an antibody test show whether they have some protection? Isn’t that one factor in the herd immunity equation? Also perhaps he would have been willing to get frequent Covid testing and wear a mask rather than lose his job. Lumping all non vaccinated people together is not helpful.
2021-08-04 16:52:57,"My fully vaxed younger sister was infected by someone who lied about being vaxed and shared indoor space briefly while they were both unmasked.

Don't trust that people are vaxed. Ask. And if you're unsure, walk away. And wear a mask indoors always. It driving me insane to see how many people are unmasked in stores and on the subway."

How quick or how sick a person becomes after infection, again depends on the individual. It's lunacy not to get the vaccine by choice but ""quicker"" and ""sicker"" are largely dependent upon the individual. What we do know is that people who are vaccinated have far milder cases, if infected at all, from this delta variant. Yes, most of the patients that I am seeing with Covid-19 who are hospitalized are unvaccinated and are very sick. Yes, many of them are younger. My fear is that these are the people who are going to have long-term Covid-19 effects which could have been prevented by simply getting the vaccine. There's plenty of data but there is no question that the vaccine prevents severe illness from Covid-19. This is a sad state of affairs."

NY Times (including Tom Friedman) had played up the ""reopening"" like GOP media - the pandemic was history!

Earlier (last year) Thomas L. Friedman had told us that taking drastic public health measures was a mistake, and we had best take the advice of a Beverly Hills dietician,  David L. Katz, instead; that we dont need to worry about people that then seemed ""less vulnerable;"" and that (in March 2020) we should aim for herd immunity  (and it could only be achieved by allowing the virus to spread among young people).

This material which appeared numerous times here, has not been retracted or apologized for, is starting to look worse than the ""breaking news"" over Hillary's emails.

Folks, everyone in science knew from the start that this was a ""novel"" virus and that it was mutating rapidly so that nobody could predict that its characteristics would remain stable in different strains.   (This is part of what made the ""lab leak"" theory so stupid as well - viruses with 98 percent DNA similarity were previously found thousands of miles from Wuhan - plus other factors, eg, the first case in Wuhan had no connection at all to the market there).

I remember spring breakers saying things like: “I’m not going to stop partying — it only affects old people.” I remember parents saying things like: “We’re young and it doesn’t affect children, so we want our kids in class, we are having our birthday parties and vacations, and we are sending them to summer camps!”

Then, when it was time for those in their 20s-30s to get vaccinated, most did not. Most still have not. I’ve said from the start that the majority of people won’t care until or unless children start suffering and dying. Bravo to parents who have inoculated their 12 year-olds. 

To everyone else, beware: No one is safe until we — young adults and children too! — are all vaccinated, distancing and wearing masks. Just hope that your elders and medical staff still have some empathy for you even though you had none for them."

The article does state there's a lack of ""comprehensive"" data, which also seems misleading, as there doesn't seem to be any data at all. I think a lot of readers or people glancing at the article will easily misinterpret this. I've noticed this with the Times lately, publish a click bait-y headline but avoid corrections by adding a question mark to the title and a perhaps sort of fine print qualification toward the end of the artlcle (see the subway tuna lawsuit article)."

You’re a smart dog. You beg at the table (Covid). Soon, your owners don’t like it and make you stop (the vaccine) So then you beg when guests come over (variant 1). When they say no (vaccine), you beg when you meet strangers on the street (variant 2), and may even bite to get food. So you’re abandoned on the street. 

But you have puppies. Your puppies are smart enough at birth to bite to get food (variant 3). Those puppies have adapted to survive. 

You shouldn’t let dogs beg or bite, but these dogs will, even if you say no, in order to survive. 

She got this immediately. Then she said “Why don’t they explain that stuff so people can understand it?”

It is time for the Democrats to wake up - the Republicans don’t like you nor do their constituents - and play hardball. Freeze federal research funds for any university that refuses mandatory vaccinations.

(Yes, I know the unvaccinated were supposed to retain them, but anyone with even a few working brain cells knew that wasn’t going to happen.)  Thus there is a lot more Covid flying around out there, and younger people tend to socialize in larger groups of more varied people.  Perhaps they’re just getting a larger dose, hence the more severe illness."
2021-08-04 17:27:14,"I am old enough to remember the terror of the 1950s: Poliomyelitis. It was highly infectious and a scourge of children. Young people ended up dead, permanently crippled, or lying in huge 'iron lungs' - the ventilators of that time. The late Ian Dury of The Blockheads was one of polio's victims. We saw the crippled walking with iron leg supports and cruelly called them 'spazzos'. Then came the Salk vaccine, and we were freed from fear, all of us.
Just today in The Guardian newspaper a story related the death from Covid of an incredibly fit 42 y.o. mountain climber who thought he was too young and fit to be badly harmed.
At the beginning of last century we demanded that young men sacrifice themselves for war. In 1940 we asked them to do that again. And in the 50s in Korea. And in the 60s in Vietnam. And now we ask you again to take up arms in a world war, but this time we're offering you a suit of almost indestructible armour: the vaccine."
2021-08-04 17:28:08,"If the delta variant is more serious for younger healthier individuals (we still don't know this) the example of 1918 Spanish flu may shed some answers. As we are taught history may not repeat but it often rhymes. And during the 1918 pandemic it was the younger healthier individuals who were more at risk and died at higher numbers than the old and very young. Why? As John Barry in ""The Great Influenza"" writes the cytokine storm  that occurred to fight the virus often overwhelmed the immune systems of the healthy and young devastating the respiratory systems and wreaking general havoc.  The elderly had weaker immune systems and did not 'turn on' their owners. Instead, their immune systems were just strong enough to clear the virus. Given that the present Covid virus is much less lethal than the Spanish flu variety, we may be seeing similar reasons for young/healthy individuals having a difficult Covid experience, but without the extreme mortality. All of this is still speculation; we need to see the data."

The answer is irrelevant. Highly effective vaccines are available to   young adults.

Those young adults need to go out and GET VACCINATED, along with EVERY unvaccinated adult in the U.S. who doesn't have a medical reason  which precludes vaccination, which would be a tiny percentage of the U.S. adult population."
2021-08-04 18:37:36,"Enough of these articles stating the obvious! While vaccines do not stop someone from getting the virus, they are supposed  to make the symptoms less severe. The much-covered Provincetown ""super spreader"" event shows that yes, even vaccinated spread the virus, but people did not get terribly ill. Here, unvaccinated people not only got the virus, but got terribly ill. Looks like the vaccine does its job."
2021-08-04 18:37:58,"You can parse the statistics about new cases, deaths and the numbers in select countries overseas until you're blue in the face. The bottom line is that we're still seeing too many needlessly severe infections and deaths and no doubt incubating new variants, the longer the inexcusably  unvaccinated remain so. The epidemiological jury may still out on the new Delta+ variant, but you can be certain the virus is not going to wait around for the verdict before it mutates again."

2021-08-04 19:01:52,"If keeping yourself and those unvaccinated around you from serious illness or worse isn't enough to get vaccinated, maybe it's time to think about some very real facts of present life about getting infected. 

One of those facts is that treatment for serious COVID-19 infections which are now increasing with the Delta variant, has basically plateaued and advances in identifying medications and other treatments that work in an outpatient setting are few and far between. So essentially, we are working with the same arsenal against a variant that is almost twice as transmissible and more likely to cause hospitalizations among the unvaccinated. And that's just with the variants with which we now dealing.

The other fact of present pandemic life is the very real possibility of insurance shock, as was pointed out in a recent piece in the TIMES.  Apart from rolling back previous waivers on such items as copays and deductibles, private insurers may very well begin to penalize the unvaccinated for risky behavior with far higher premiums."
2021-08-04 19:13:21,"The sad underlying fact is that guys like McAvoy don't read the newspaper, they don't watch the news on TV, and they don't view non-biased, informative web sites on the topic, i.e. the CDC.  Either they get their information from their equally uninformed friends, or they watch Fox or Fox-like derivatives, which do not cover the pandemic with any valuable information or honest facts/data.  Thus, while this is a great article, those that should be reading it most, are not."
2021-08-04 19:19:24,"We don't need long term studies and tons of data to know what the anecdotal evidence is showing: Delta variant virus wants to survive and thrive and will find hosts wherever available. We don't have time to wait for months or years of clinical data to confidently assert today's problem and the solution. 

Everyone over 12, with very few true medical exemptions (no religious exemptions!), must get vaccinated!

Do we really want more years like the last 18 months? Because of people like Mr McAvoy, we'll be stuck in this perpetual rollercoaster of virus & vaccines (boosters, maybe completely new ones as virus mutates), mandates and shutdowns.

I find it hard to feel any sympathy or empathy for McAvoy. He's had ample time to get the vaccine. He works in a close contact environment, breathing on clients all day. He lives in a low vax state so who knows how large the web of potentially infected citizens are wandering around FL being infected by this guy.

Selfish and entitled. No sympathy."

2021-08-04 19:24:05,McAvoy’s oxygen level desaturates to ~50% from 90%.  Children <10 yo in respiratory distress can desaturate rapidly and enter respiratory failure due to their reliance on fatigable intercostal muscles and a weak diaphragm.  For an adult male - especially one who workouts - these muscles are a non-issue.  I suspect he wasn’t wearing his pulse oximeter consistently because his oxygen levels would have been progressively dropping. I would have expected him to notice issues with worsening dyspnea with or without a monitor or if even if he was wearing the pusleox and he was at <<90% oxygen.   Too many protein shakes not enough reading.
2021-08-04 19:31:10,"People really seem to want to hate on McAvoy.  Yes, I too am very angry about the number of unvaccinated people, especially those who eschew masks and other safety precautions.  They are the reason we have Delta, and Gamma, and are facing rising infection rates nationwide. However, I appreciate that McAvoy is willing to be public about his ordeal and admit that he was wrong, to help others.  Not many would be so brave. Just think how different things would be if people could admit they were wrong and do the right thing?"
2021-08-04 19:31:19,"Is the delta variant selectively striking down the young and healthy or do they represent the largest percentage of the unvaccinated with most elders and high risk vaccinated?

If delta strain had been the original alpha, perhaps we would have seen severe disease across all age groups."
2021-08-04 19:32:31,"To anyone who specializes in virology, immunology or infectious disease do repeated infections within <72hrs  of the delta strain in sars-cov-2 naïve non-immunized adults contribute to increased severity of symptoms?  If the delta strain has an Ro=8 and the original an Ro=2.5, the growth rate is exponential and significantly faster than the original strain. If the initial exposure didn't elicit symptoms then multiple hits would definitely contribute to worsening symptoms, right?"
2021-08-04 19:32:32,"Wait till a mutation which evades current vaccine immunity and has 30% mortality develops, and it will at current rates. The mRNA vaccines can be made in less than 48 hours based off the variants base pair sequences, our current moderna and pfizer vaccines were made in 2 days followed by 9 months of ""trials"",  which we can skip once the crazy variants arrive. The problem will be complete disorganization and incompetence with a dash of self serving selfishness. I advice everyone get as ready as possible it's going to be fun to watch."
2021-08-04 19:37:07,"I love these folks who are so cavalier in their attitude - based on a combination of ignorance and magical thinking - that the docs are wrong, the science is skewed, and they will not be affected by this worldwide pandemic.  Until they are.  Then all of a sudden, they lament “had I known it would be this bad I would’ve gotten the shot.”  They all must live in a bubble.  You’ve had to be living under a rock these past 18 months not to have realized that this thing is real, and that by not getting vaccinated, these “anti-vaxxers” are really putting those of us who had the good sense to get vaccinated at risk too.

And now, a GoFundMe page, so that other people can pick up the huge tab for the hospital bill.  This was so unnecessary, so PREVENTABLE!"
2021-08-04 19:46:49,"Delta is beginning to sound more like the Spanish Flu pandemic, which hit young people fast and furious. Maybe what is needed are testimonials like this plastered all over Instagram and Tik Tok. We have to fight fire with fire, and the deniers are doing a better job there. Even the tags on antivaxxing Facebook post, to encouraging people to look into the facts, are serving as a badge with certain people, causing them to trust the misinformation. Younger people feel invincible, and it will take a huge effort to convince them to be vaccinated."
2021-08-04 19:47:59,"Why does anyone think it is a mystery that Delta gets folks sicker, quicker?

The virus load coming from someone with a Delta infection can be 4000 times higher than the viral load shed from the initial strains. This is why vaccinated people can get Delta-COVID--their immune systems get overwhelmed for a bit. 

The entire point of a vaccine is not to fight the disease like an antibiotic, but to prime the body's defense system to be able to counter-attack more quickly and effectively. 

The virus is not ""trying"" to hurt those it infects. All it ""wants"" to do is reproduce as quickly as possible (like any other virus). Delta is 4000 times more ""efficient"" at reproducing--meaning it will be using far more of its victim's resources to reproduce itself--and likely also spreading more deeply into the body, destroying the cells it penetrates. 

All a vaccine does is allow the body to react faster and more efficiently to incoming virus. The illness seriousness is determined by a race between your body's defenses and the virus's reproductive drive. Delta hits 4000 times harder. Without a vaccine, Delta gets a big head start. With a vaccine, the fight is engaged much more quickly and efficiently. 

It would be astonishing to find that younger Delta variant COVID victims do NOT get ""sicker, quicker"". 

Wear your mask, get an m-RNA vaccine, make yourself less unsafe. The enemy just (figuratively) up-armored from swords to AK47s. Up-armor your response."
2021-08-04 20:03:04,"We need to get everyone in the US and then the World vaccinated as fast as humanly possible.

We are failing in this challenge.

We must get vaccination distribution to remote rural areas in the US and to people’s homes and workplaces and make it as convenient as possible to get the vaccine.  Mobile vaccination units like ice cream trucks should be prevalent.

We need to restrict public activity in crowds indoors to only those who can show proof of vaccination.

Employers must mandate proof of vaccination to return to offices.

The FDA must conduct all the proper due diligence but also put all possible resources to work to fully authorize the vaccines as soon as is practicable.

We must do all of these things NOW.

If we do not the eventual Omega variant will kill us all."
2021-08-04 20:08:22,"Evolution of this virus doesn't favor exploiting the most difficult marks - the more cautious and more widely vaccinated demographic of people 65 and over.  Instead, the virus is going to evolve to exploit larger, more reckless, less protected populations - the young.

A successful virus doesn't kill, as much as spread.  Now that older people are protected, it can afford to be more deadly if the greater viral loads can help it to spread better.  So in the delta variant, we have a virus with far greater viral load that infects larger numbers of people and sickens them to the point that many are dying, but most are living, just as previous variants were with the older population.

Expect our young school children to be the next easy mark."
2021-08-04 20:28:51,"The photo at the top of the article says it all.  People are so desperate for ""normalcy"" that they are now in full denial.

As for the willfully obtuse 20- and 30-somethings... we cannot be more concerned about their health than they are."
2021-08-04 20:32:44,"There are a several point's I'd like to make. Young adults don't think it will be them that will get sick or die from this virus. If you are not vaccinated and get sick from this, you should pay out of your pocket for treatment. Even if you have medical insurance. It should be mandatory that that in order to eat in an establishment that you show proof of being vaccinated twice."
2021-08-04 20:39:15,"It's very difficult convincing the 20-somethings.  They think it's all bogus, a conspiracy, and that since the FDA had not authorized the vaccine, it cannot be safe.  My own kids were vehemently against it.  It took constant coaxing to get them to receive the vaccinations.  We were so frustrated and scared for them and for us.  Maybe this Delta variant will wake up the younger generation to the fact that they are not immune from this virus, and that the results can be life-threatening.  We are back in lockdown mode now although everyone is vaccinated."
2021-08-04 20:50:41,"As soon as the vaccine is approved for elementary age kids, I will make sure my children get the shots.   We have them wear masks, although their school district says they are optional.   We’re now avoiding the indoor venues as much as possible. My child will have to wear a mask at an indoor birthday party.  My 13 year old is vaccinated & I feel she is so much safer attending middle school with protection.  I can’t imagine taking the risk with being unvaccinated in public.  I’m considered “underweight” and don’t want to take any chances."

This is the essential position of the nursing home owners on a vaccine requirement."
2021-08-04 15:38:59,"Can you imagine how absolutely incompetent the administrations and government oversight for any nursing home is to even think about employing a working who isn't fully vaccinated ?

2021-08-04 15:42:05,"My grandchildren have already lost a grandmother to Covid.  Sandra was in a care facility, and the virus had been controlled in that facility for months.  Visitations were still limited to outdoors, or through glass windows.  But it seemed they had finally turned the corner on this pandemic.

However, not all staff were vaccinated, and someone brought it in.   Sandra was immunocompromised from a kidney transplant years ago.  She died at a local hospital soon after, completely alone.

It was a horrible death, brought on by a selfish action.  If a healthcare worker refuses to vaccinate because of some perceived fantasy 'risk', they transfer all the real risks of Covid to the people they promised to care for.

Shame on the American Health Care Association, and all healthcare workers who refuse to vaccinate.  Shame and eternal shame."
2021-08-04 15:42:35,"People do not understand the nature of a pandemic. The virus is a moving target; it is not static.

It “learns” and develops defenses and workarounds at unknown paces and ferocities.

Thus, whenever the humans manage to eke out an advantage,  it is imperative that they maximize it — for the duration that they are able to.


We did not maximize our temporary vaccine advantage."
2021-08-04 15:54:52,"In reporting increases in SARS CoV2 infections in nursing homes, it would be helpful to give separate numbers for infections among staff and among residents. The vaccination rates are likely different between these two grouops. 

Two vaccinated, nursing home residents died from this virus recently. Let's have more information on serious, fatal breakthrough infections among nursing home residents and seniors in general. When does the expectation of only minor illness with breakthrough infections break down?

That cases are again spiking in nursing homes even with more than 80% of nursing home residents nationwide are vaccinated suggests that elusive herd immunity is likely to be near 90%."

The breakthroughs had happened in the same homes where unvaccinated staff were testing positive, seemingly carrying the virus into the home from the community.""

I find it utterly incredulous that places like this, with especially high risk patients, did not mandate that ALL employees get vaccinated.  Those two deaths were most likely preventable if ALL employees had been vaccinated.

Nursing home residents should not be sitting ducks, hoping to live through another day while various employees continue to live their lives recklessly which ultimately impacts some of those residents.

Those individuals should be charged with manslaughter.  Their defiance in not getting vaccinated ultimately led to the death of two of those residents they cared for."
2021-08-04 15:57:52,"I see in the comments lots of blaming of nursing home administrators for their employees' not having received vaccines.

Vaccines are free to all in the United States.

Am I to swallow the line that nurses' aides and orderlies are somehow being prevented from receiving shots?

That's like telling me that people of color have no access to Covid vaccines and therefore aren't taking them when all the major vaccine hubs were deliberately placed in neighborhoods largely comprised of people of color. 

Or that Trump supporters are not getting vaccinated because they're the brightest lights in the room."
2021-08-04 15:57:59,"Now that we live in a time where anyone and everyone feels they are entitled to any behavior they please, it’s time for the government to step in and require all health workers to be vaccinated.

2021-08-04 16:00:30,"We can no longer tolerate those who are unvaccinated among the general population and certainly not at nursing homes. We need a national mandate, you must be fully vaccinated and have proof of vaccination to get a job or hold a job anywhere. These unvaccinated people are infecting and killing the rest of us."

I am a retired teacher who taught, among other things, information literacy.  I was part of the effort to first bring information technology to schools. Now part of my good work is undone by fools and the weak-minded. At least that is my “rage narrative”. I wish I could be more sympathetic, but the body count and economic costs are too high.
It is time to get tough. It is time to speak out.  It is time to pressure advertisers and social media companies. It is time for those who suffered a needless loss to file wrongful death suits against those who “choose” to be unvaccinated (not those with a legitimate reason). It is time for corporations to ban unvaccinated workers who don’t have a legitimate reason for exemption. 
I don’t like doing those things at all, but some people won’t change their minds unless they are threatened in some way. Sadly that is human nature. 
So many who use the constitution as a cudgel for their selfishness and egotism are wrong. They forget the words of the preamble “to promote the general welfare”. That is among the purposes of the constitution.

We shouldn’t have to resort to this- people should just get the jab- I couldn’t live with myself if I was the cause for someone else’s death.  It never had to be this bad.  These workers were the very first in line - to remain unvaccinated 9 months later is just inexcusable."
2021-08-04 16:08:26,"Unless all staff are vaccinated, nursing homes are death traps for residents, so who cares if nursing homes are shut down?

2021-08-04 16:12:48,Why in the world did we think that vaccinations would work when not requiring/mandating it?! It is outrageous to read these articles showing the spread of the virus through unvaccinated employees. No lesson has been learned. What is wrong with the United States?

He still needs a lot of rehabilitation and was going to transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a few weeks. The place we chose was “the best” in our area. I went on their website to schedule a visit to check it out and there was a notice of “No Visitations for 14 days” due to an infected worker. No way was I letting him go there. I will be caring for him at home. Why is it not mandatory for people who work in healthcare facilities to be unvaccinated?
2021-08-04 16:21:48,"Meanwhile,  in Oregon a law actually PREVENTS the state from mandating that health care workers get the vaccine.  It's a carveout for the health care industry.  State legislators refused to take up the task of changing the law in the just completed legislative session... this from the ""progressive"" state.  However, the ""progressives"" aren't immune to the health industry PAC money that comes almost exclusively to the Democratic party in Oregon. The Oregon Nurses PAC alone has given almost $300,000 in just the last 18 months - almost entirely to Democrats.  Even worse, in some ways, is that a number of these state legislators come from health care backgrounds.  They're happy to urge others to get vaccinated, take the PAC $ from organizations of nurses, dentists, various county doctor groups, Oregon Hospital PAC ... and walk away in 2021 from amending a bill that could help keep the most vulnerable in nursing homes and congregate care facilities safe."
2021-08-04 16:23:24,"I understand how difficult it is to get minimum-wage healthcare workers for Nursing Homes, but WHY OH WHY is it permitted to let ANYONE come in contact with the most vulnerable people WITHOUT VACCINATION? That is nothing short of CRIMINAL!

I am a Doctor and I have been on staff at some of the finest Hospitals in the world. ALL of them have required vaccination against ALL communicable disease in order to remain on staff - the primary concern being for the best possible medical care of our patients. I TOTALLY agree. If WE can set these standards for ourselves, since WE know ALL the facts regarding vaccines, why is there reticence to require this of EVERY healthcare facility, or EVERY American in the midst of a Pandemic that has already claimed over 600,000 lives in this country alone and millions thought the world.

The vaccines are SAFE, EFFECTIVE and FREE FOR EVERYONE. Has incredible ignorance become a hallmark of the 21st Century in America? Judging by an average 7th Grade reading level for Americans, and an illiterate, ignorant, impotent ex-president (and that's giving him the doubt of Russian collusion) I would say so.

Also, families might be more likely to chose for their elder family members homes with mandates."

Seems ridiculous saying you want the government to mandate it so, what, you can't be blamed? What kind of leader are you?

The article also mentioned major organizations on workers and nurses want to work on further education rather than mandates. At what point do they just admit, further education, will not sway anybody who hasn't gotten the vaccine. They know what needs to be known and still won't take the step necessary to protect themselves, their families, their neighbors, their work associates, their country, etc.

It's past time to mandate vaccinations. We're well into the fourth wave. I have no doubt there will be other ""waves"". We need, as a nation, to understand we must not allow this virus to continue to mutate. The only way to just end the pandemic, is to require those who refuse to be vaccinated, to be vaccinated. I believe in personal rights as much as the next person. However, when the security of the nation is at stake, we lose, temporarily, some of those rights. It's really no different than the government mandating blackouts during war time or issuing ration coupons prohibiting consumption of certain items. The time to act is behind us. We have no time to waste."

I also suggest that healthcare employers look carefully at the workers who refuse to be vaccinated. Are they the same population that is reported for abuse or suspected of theft? I suggest this because all clients know there are good and bad, honest and dishonest, caring and mean workers. Does the population that knowingly puts vulnerable clients in their care at risk include the same people who engage in unhealthy lifestyle choices? It is only fair and responsible for employers to put the spotlight on those people who deliberately flout the basic facts of disease prevention and deliberately choose to put the vulnerable in their care at risk of what would likely be a fatal disease for the elderly."

We supplied N95 masks to the ones who work directly with my sister. They are mostly unvaccinated and think they are safe because they socialize with each other. 

It makes me so angry I want to scream. They know they have families over a barrel. It really is a dangerous mindset in the caregiving subculture. 

They are funded by Medicaid dollars and I feel the federal and state governments should enforce vaccination."
2021-08-04 17:05:03,"Visiting my 93-year-old aunt in skilled nursing care has now been disrupted on three separate occasions for weeks at a time because someone in the complex tested positive. Residents of these facilities have a suppressed immune response, even with the vaccination￼. Healthcare workers of all stripes must be held to a mandatory vaccination standard. Anyone avoiding this vaccine without a valid medical reason demonstrates some combination of a selfishness, lack of ethics and the basic ability to discern fact from fiction.￼ Any combination of these traits should disqualify them from working in a healthcare setting. Who granted vaccine avoiders the unwritten right to interfere with the liberty of everyone else? The vast majority demands it’s freedom from the irresponsible. Everyone who recklessly continues to spread this disease is inflicting unacceptable costs on the rest of us in both dollars and lives, it is now time to vote them off the island.￼"
2021-08-04 17:10:48,"Our political leaders at both state and federal levels have been slow to call for mandates, fearing political reprisals. And some governors have actually banned them. How much more death and misery must occur before these ""leaders"" develop some spine?"
2021-08-04 17:10:51,"""Growing calls for vaccine mandates among health care workers have gained urgency but also met resistance in the nursing home industry, where some homes say it will cost them staff members...""  Maybe they figure that if they have significant numbers of unvaccinated staff, residents will die and they won't need as many.  Sarcastic, I know, but it really seems that that's the call they're making."
2021-08-04 17:13:21,"One of the most infuriating aspects of this pandemic, is how long (and how much argument) it takes to implement the most common sensical, no-brainer measures.

OF COURSE nursing home (and assisted living, and hospital) staff should be required to vaccinate. Why, in August 2021, is this even up for discussion? We're a year and a half into a pandemic, and we've made so much less progress towards eradicating Covid-19 in this country than we should have. 

I believe in personal freedom as much as the next guy. But I understand full well that my freedom ends where the next person's begins. And I could NEVER live with myself if I knew I infected another person, let alone an elder of the exact age cohort to have a terrible outcome."
2021-08-04 17:17:08,"Where, one wonders,  are the lawyers vying for a class action lawsuit on behalf of nursing home residents? You want the nursing home industry to mandate vaccinations? A big, fully justified class action lawsuit will provide the impetus to invoke a mandate by the industry's operators."
2021-08-04 17:21:07,"If we want higher quality nursing home workers who understand the importance of vaccination then we need to pay these people a living wage. The aides who bathe, dress and feed the elderly in nursing homes often make less money than fast food workers. Better wages linked to vaccination and health insurance would attract workers who want to vaccinated."
2021-08-04 17:21:36,"Of course anyone working in healthcare, especially caring for the most vulnerable patients, should be vaccinated. Could it be that they hesitate to mandate vaccines because they fear losing nursing home workers who are typically underpaid and overworked?  I would also point out that there may be another reason why cases are ticking up after dropping precipitously in early Spring. The Delta variant only accounted for about 10% of new cases just 2 months ago. It is now the predominant variant. The vaccine, while over 90% effective in preventing infection with the Alpha strain,  is showing less effectiveness in preventing infection with the Delta variant."
2021-08-04 17:25:49,"All employees of healthcare institutions, whether they be nursing homes, hospitals, clinics, testing facilities, or doctor's offices should be REQUIRED to be vaccinated by federal law. People who are particularly susceptible due to pre-existing conditions and those who cannot take the vaccine because of medical conditions should not be forced to choose between not seeking needed health care and risking COVID. People who are so opposed to vaccines that they refuse to get one can find other professions. Working in a light house or herding sheep comes to mind."
2021-08-04 17:28:36,"This was completely expected.

If you had half a brain, you could see this coming.

Who DIDN'T expect some frail elderly patients, WHOSE IMMUNE SYSTEMS ARE WEAK DUE TO AGE, who need direct physical care, to be among the first to get breakthrough infections and die from them?

Place your loved one in a facility when you have no other choice.

But open your eyes to the reality of the kind of care they will receive.

I am a skilled healthcare provider.  I have no intention of being in a facility of any kind.  There are other plans made.  And I have the means and the will to manage them.  I know what the alternative looks like, thanks to my career."

2021-08-04 17:31:46,"I'm progressively more angry and disgusted for the impact the unvaccinated are having on me, personally.  

However, I've spent most of the past 6 months helping my mom get into assisted living, and am feeling something far beyond anger in dealing with the unvaccinated/antimaskers. 
 I'm feeling vengefully litigious that it's somehow okay for the unvaccinated to work in what was the most dangerous place in the world, last year.

In addition to being stupid, the unvaccinated are a shrinking part of the US population. They can bark all they want about our wickedness in making sure we all take our medicine and don't die.  How do they think that's going to go over as their numbers shrink further, but we see our loved ones getting seriously hurt in settings like this?

Give it up, and take your medicine.  Or don't be surprised if serious penalties start to come into play for refusing vaccination and/or spreading COVID.  

You spoiled children!"
2021-08-04 17:32:37,"Last week, the American Health Care Association, the nursing home industry’s main trade group...stopped short of endorsing a vaccination mandate.... (That, in a nutshell, is the bad news.)

“It’s terribly frustrating,” Mark Parkinson, the chief executive of the industry’s main trade group, said of the hesitancy of people to resist vaccines, including in the nursing home industry. It's not, of course, the hesitancy to resist vaccines that's frustrating: if anything it's the opposite. Anyway, Mr Parkinson doesn't represent these people, does he?

What appears to be frustrating to Mr. Parkinson is that he's certain that “If everybody would get vaccinated this pandemic would end.” But he seems either unwilling or unable to do anything about it.

This made me wonder about who the American Health Care Association is. It turns out to be ""a non-profit federation of affiliated state health organizations that represents more than 14,000 non-profit and for-profit nursing homes."" (I don't get that: a non-profit association represents for-profit nursing homes?) 

There MUST be something the non-profit AHCA can do other than ""continue to educate workers."" Yes, if one nursing home did the right thing (mandate), they might lose workers to another--but the very point of a non-profit association should be to work through that sort of thing to the benefit of all."
2021-08-04 17:32:41,"Based on CDC reporting daily, 80% of all covid deaths are among those over 64. Only 13% of all cases were among that age group. 95% of all deaths are among those over 49. This disease represents a somewhat classic distribution of cases and case fatality rates; older is logarithmically worse. 
Parental ages, 18-50, have had 54% of all cases but only 4.9% of all deaths; they are the carriers. They are also the most profligate group of deniers. If you are 40 years old and see 11% of those around you getting sick, recovering and coming back to work, you might reasonably conclude COVID isn't dangerous...and for you, it likely isn't. 
Kids: so much agonizing over kids but to date out of 71 million kids under 19, only 10% have caught the bug from spreader mommies/daddies, and fewer than 600 have died; CDC says 526. That's 7 per million kids. CDC numbers don't extract preexisting risks/comorbidities. UK data, after extracting comorbidities, puts kids' risk of death at two per million. 
The conclusion is that older people are at huge risk; I'm 75 and I'm an early vaxxer; my son is an immunosuppressed med school student is vaxxed. 
Several states and even CDC have published ""breakthrough"" statistics showing cases, hospitalizations and deaths among the vaxxed. Deaths range from 7/million (CDC) to 26 (Illinois). Even at 26, our deaths now would be less than 9,000 vs over 620,000 actual.

2021-08-04 17:34:06,"If nursing home employees are unvaccinated or fail to wear masks, vaccinated residents will catch Delta from them. The Delta virus will pick up mutations as it continually does.  Those Delta viruses that have mutations that help it to escape the vaccine will have a survival advantage.  A new vaccine resistant or vaccine impervious Delta will develop in the nursing homes.

We will all be back to square one and not have any vaccine protection.  This is why vaccines and masks must be mandated in nursing homes."
2021-08-04 17:34:28,"One of the great unreported truths abt Covid is that nursing home workers, many of them undocumented, were a principal vector for the disease, at there very front end of the pandemic, allowing it to infiltrate poorly defended care facilities, killing more than 100K elderly. As the Delta variant surges, we are once again conflicting an uncomfortable and unreported truth: Nursing home workers, many of them undocumented, are again poised to visit harm on the people they are supposed to be protecting b/c they mistakenly think the government is going to put them on some master list that will be used against them some day---or reveal that they have been in the country using a stolen or fraudulent identity. This is perverse. And the least you can do is connect the dots and not go along with the convenient fiction that immigration status has noting to do w/ vaccine hesitancy or refusal.

2021-08-04 17:38:08,"Although the number of weekly new cases at nursing homes is insufficient to convey much statistical comfort, anyone who wants can download the CMS weekly nursing home data and analyze it to distinguish between ""breakthrough"" and other new cases that occur among residents (for weeks ending after May 23).  The CMS dataset in question appears at <a href=""https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data"" target=""_blank"">https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data</a>.

I suggest taking care to exclude observations for nursing homes that fail to report the few data items needed to distinguish breakthrough from other cases (i.e., homes that report their weekly resident positives but do not report whether they occurred before or after vaccination; the CMS quality assurance check for the report is not comprehensive)."
2021-08-04 17:43:19,"I find it interesting that Tyson draws from roughly the same employee pool, yet has decided that making vaccination a requirement for employment. If enough large companies requirement vaccinantion, at some point anti-vaxxers will run out of employment opportunities."
2021-08-04 17:44:52,"The obvious conclusion here is that the US needs to follow the lead of Israel and Germany and start administering booster shots to the most vulnerable populations, starting with the nursing home residents, immediately. Blaming things on the unvaccinated staff and other unvaccinated members of the general public won’t help and vaccine and mask mandates won’t be sufficient either. The virus is endemic now and it is circulating widely among the fully vaccinated population who were vaccinated during the winter and whose resistance against infection by the delta variant had now waned. The only viable solution here is provided by the booster shots."

Now my Uncle needs a rehab facility but they're not allowing any outside people, because basically they don't have their stuff together. These nursing homes are terrible places.

Why are people working in public health that are not vaccinated?"

(they wear masks all day, except when eating, and disinfect constantly)  Many of the adult clients have underlying health issues and no one knows for sure what could happen if they get the delta variant, even though they are vaccinated.  I am disgusted with people who refuse vaccinations (unless they have a medical problem). But no one seems to care; not the state, the board of directors, or the director.  Everyone is too afraid of the anti vaxxers, lawsuits and bad press.  I wonder how many of them consider themselves pro life?"

Five workers, all vaccinated, and six of the 65 residents, all of whom were vaccinated.  So, this entire issue, is far more complex than the simple injunction to vaccinate all the workers for safety's sake would indicate. And I still believe that all persons, medical personnel included, need to have the right to either take or refuse any vaccine--or drug, without any coercion or pressure."

If after all staff and patients are vaccinated, there are still breakthrough cases, there will still be a benefit as the individuals will be far less likely to be hospitalized or die from the virus. The public good in this case far surpasses the alleged ""right"" of the individual to both work in healthcare and choose to remain a virus vector."

And they should be wracked with guilt - forever!"
2021-08-04 18:36:40,"Two things are absolutely clear about this dilemma.
FIRST is that every nursing home staff member, management person, delivery service, and government or association inspector--black, white or Latino--should be required to be fully vaccinated asap except those with religious or individual medical reasons to be exempt. Would we allow any of these people anywhere near a nursing home if they had active tuberculosis or pneumonia?

SECOND is that African American employees, who are rightly suspicious of the intentions or effects of medical care or vaccines because of the history of racist, poor quality, or destructive medical care, should nevertheless be required to be vaccinated.Why?

It is true that as far back as the 1930's Tuskegee syphilis experiments--and for many years before and since--many African Americans have been killed, maimed, or allowed to suffer unnecessarily at the hands of racist American doctors and scientists. But the COVID vaccine is not one of those situations. Just the opposite. 
African American staff at nursing homes are protected by the vaccine, as are African American residents of nursing homes, and their families, friends, and communities which COVID has hit particularly hard.
Strong action should be taken by state and federal governments, medical societies, and insurance providers to end racism in medical care. Now. Requiring ALL workers associated with nursing homes to get the COVID vaccine now is one way to stop medical racism."
2021-08-04 18:41:56,At a minimum booster shots should be given to previously vaccinated nursing home residents.  It is likely their immunity was well below average to start.  My wife has a family member in a senior residence in Canada.  The adjacent nursing home had an outbreak of 19 new Delta cases.  18 fully vaccinated with 2 doses of Pfizer.  Five residents died!

Then require use of any federal funded facilities including airports, trains, national parks,courthouses, etc to provide proof of vaccination or go home.

We should also have medical privacy regulations clarified.  If asked by a customer for vaccination status it is not a personal information issue.  Customers have a right to know if they are being endangered.  The current approach uses privacy to protect the dangerous person at the expense of the safe one.

Finally, the federal government should roll out a vaccine passport.   States, municipalities, industries, and stores could decide how to use it.  The cruise industry would love it.  Many of us might choose to not stop in unsafe stores.

We, the vaccinated, have rights, too!"

How many have had life threatening reactions to the vaccination?  (very few!)

About 48 million or 15% of Americans are 11 or younger and can not be vaccinated.  

Yet our hospitals are full; they are running out of beds and staff to man them. 

The average of COVID hospitalizations is now around age 50.  Some are dying, many are uninsured or underinsured, at risk of losing their jobs, homes and cars.  That can’t be good for our economy or the kids who are falling behind in school; kids we badly need to replace an ageing workforce and keep Social Security and Medicare solvent.

Meanwhile Congress is on another unearned vacation on our dime  and states have failed to distribute allotted funds to keep COVID victims in their homes.  Evictions likely to spread COVID!

If you had a serious accident, heart or gallbladder attack could you find a hospital bed?   Maybe not and you should be concerned.  

We should all be concerned about the misinformation that  got us here, the tourists who attacked our nation's Capital and the effort to make it harder for eligible voters to vote and throw the bums out!  

It is self interested Authoritarians who got us here and want to keep us here!   That includes like minded people like Trump and Como, it is not partisan."

2021-08-04 19:01:19,"By definition, all nursing home residents are at high risk for breakthrough Covid infections. They are elderly and sick with compromised immune systems, leaving them with only questionable antibody responses to the vaccine. Clearly, vaccinating nursing home residents does not have the same effect as vaccinating the general public. This makes vaccinating every nursing home employee absolutely mandatory. One employee or visitor carrying the virus can wipe out every resident, and failure of an employee to accept vaccination should lead directly to his or her firing. Just as a nursing home employee who refuses vaccination and causes the death of a resident from Covid should be prosecuted for murder. By now, everyone knows the effects of the Covid virus, and everyone knows that vaccination is the key to control. So, if a nurse, an aide, a therapist, or even a physician who is unvaccinated brings the virus to the most vulnerable amongst us, then that person must be taken to task. In short, then, no individual involved in the care of nursing home residents or of patients in a hospital setting should be allowed to refuse vaccination and retain their job. No individual excuses or rights should supersede the need of the sick and vulnerable to be treated in a medically safe environment. Unions, religion, misinformation, or whatever claims the unvaccinated make cannot be allowed to endanger those whose lives are held in a very delicate balance."

Any nursing home worker that has been vaccinated gets a $5 an hour raise and choice of shifts plus an extra vacation day every year. Plus, the nursing home management company should give them an additional subsidy to get health insurance on the ACA exchange, because I'm assuming none of these nursing homes offer health insurance to their employees. 

Same thing for any home health care aide employed either by the government or private company."
2021-08-04 19:13:06,"One thing to bear in mind is that for older persons, and particularly those in memory care, it is difficult to remember to mask or to mask correctly and so protect themselves from the unvaccinated. Older people also have degraded immune systems. Often they need close contact with staff, who help with dressing, bathing, feeding and so on, and who often need to speak loudly, producing more aerosols. 

All these factors make such care home residents particularly threatened by unvaccinated staff, who have no grounds for refusing the vaccine. Given that residents in care facilities usually have very high levels of vaccination, it should be obvious to staff that the vaccine isn't killing residents and is no threat even to the very frail. 

It's time for nursing homes to band together and insist all staff are vaccinated or leave the industry."
2021-08-04 19:18:02,"These shots should have been mandated from the get go. This population is so vulnerable, and anyone who is entrusted to care for our elderly should care enough to get themselves vaccinated without a mandate - and it's very telling of the true priorities of those who refuse to get their shots.

For the thousands of dollars it costs to live in these facilities each month, the last thing they should be subjected to is being murdered by the negligence of the staff."

2021-08-04 19:32:23,"Yes, staff need to be vaccinated.  If someone gets a shot today, (and most won't of course) it will take 5-6 weeks to achieve decent immunity to the delta variant.  If, however, a resident gets a booster or third shot today, he or she will have increased immunity in 2 weeks.  

Where is the CDC recommendation for third shots for nursing home residents?   Most of what I'm hearing is that the elderly are just fine, and we don't want to discourage all the unvaccinated, so the US (unlike Britain, France and  Israel) isn't going to be authorizing boosters any time soon."
2021-08-04 19:33:59,The article suggests unvaccinated staff are to blame for bringing the virus into these homes when the CDC has said that even the vaccinated are able to carry and spread COVID. Please do not scapegoat people when the science is proving otherwise.
2021-08-04 19:34:57,Folks who work in nursing homes and refuse to get vaccinated should find another line of work. State governments need to mandate vaccinations for all workers in nursing homes and healthcare settings. Enough is enough.
2021-08-04 19:42:57,"Meanwhile, in another headline: ”W.H.O. Calls for Moratorium on Covid Vaccine Boosters.”

The W.H.O. guidance reminds me of the food on my plate as a child and the “starving children in India.”  No matter how badly I felt about it, the food on my plate wouldn’t magically transport itself to where it was more needed.  Solving that problem invoked a supply chain that didn’t include my supper.

It’s clearer every day that immune compromised individuals remain vulnerable, particularly to the delta variant, despite vaccination.  Evidence from other countries indicates they would be better protected with a booster.  Meanwhile in this country, due to the perversity of Republican politics, we have vaccine doses going to waste.  

We could repurpose vaccines reaching the end of their shelf life here as boosters for the immune compromised, while pursuing better distribution of vaccines in other countries.  One strategy need not impede the other."
2021-08-04 19:47:28,"Why isn’t there a mandate to vaccinate nursing home workers? Maybe because recent cases and research found that vaccinated people are also transmitting the virus. If the elders got their vaccine then they have nothing to worry about since they are protected from severe illness and death. While the unvaccinated worker is at risk of severe illness of caught the virus. Get the vaccine as soon as possible, that’s what CNN is telling us and I trust them."
2021-08-04 19:48:19,"Your primary concern is ALWAYS THE PATIENT NOT THE EMPLOYEES. It’s not that the employees aren’t important but even they know the patient comes first. 
 How did you lose sight of that? I tell fresh nurses that they should be willing to be fired to protect the patient always. Your the patient advocate, if not you then who?"
2021-08-04 20:01:40,"First, a nurse is the first line of defense for the patient.  A nurse is a patient advocate.  Also, perhaps if the nursing homes can't find employees to staff the home; you should pay them adequately."
2021-08-04 20:06:40,"All nursing home workers in direct or indirect contact with residents need to be vaccinated immediately.  

No exceptions."
2021-08-04 20:10:16,"There was a time in living memory when people were cared for at home . Now home care is much easier than ever what with services  and supplies available through  Medicare. IV's can be set up by staff and  tests of many kinds can be done at home. There may be many of these people who could be cared for at home by family. 
     If Joe's  plans are passed  you might actually be compensated financially to some degree for the time spent in caring for your loved one at home."
2021-08-04 20:14:22,"I am disgusted by the Colorado nursing director (which means she is an RN) who hasn't gotten the vaccine because she is worried side effects could be worse than Covid.  People should not work in healthcare if they don't understand science and how to evaluate risk versus benefit.  Vaccination should be mandatory for all healthcare workers who have access to patients.  Nursing home staff need to be paid a decent wage (they work HARD!), and they should be given two days off with pay to get the mandated vaccine.  This is common sense, people."
2021-08-04 20:14:41,I'm still confused on why countries are not mandating vaccines for everyone. This discussion on whether one group of people should or should not be required to be vaccinated is incredibly odd to me. I'm thanking Macron and some other world leaders for at least going in the right direction.
2021-08-04 20:15:55,"If nursing home workers were paid a decent wage, there would be no labor shortage in the market.

Unfortunately, too many people entrust the care of their elderly family members to for-profit homes that pay their workers as little as they can get away with. They also try to get by with as few staff as possible and overworking the people caring for, feeding, and housekeeping for the residents of homes."
2021-08-04 20:20:11,"Private equity acquisitions of nursing homes is a pressing topic: Total private equity investment in nursing homes exploded, going from $5 billion in 2000 to more than $100 billion in 2018. 

Given the rich history that private equity has shown in protecting the weak, the elderly, and the infirm versus their attention to their own bottom lines, what do you think are the odds they're going to raise the pay of their staff so as to attract intelligent, vaccinated employees?  

Your grammy doesn't stand a chance if it's a choice between her health and safety and private equity's profit margin.  

Me, personally?  Private equity frightens me more than Covid.  I can protect myself from Covid.  I can't protect my loved ones from the avarice of private equity."
2021-08-04 20:20:24,"Perhaps those commentators who are criticizing nursing-home workers should apply for positions at their local nursing homes.

I’m pretty certain there are openings throughout the country."
2021-08-04 20:20:45,It is crazy that nursing homes have not mandated vaccines long before this
2021-08-04 20:24:19,"Nursing homes should have mandatory vaccinations for their employees.

That said, a major factor in enforcing the mandate is wages: many of those employees are working at minimum wage. They have nothing to lose by going somewhere else to work."
2021-08-04 20:24:59,"There was no alternative to vaccinating the elderly and it made perfect sense to vaccinate US residents over 75 first, along with the front line health care workers. It has been now 8-10 months since the second wave of COVID infections began around Nov 03, 2020 and 7 months since 75+ elderly received their vaccine. Without a doubt there could be many elderly who could have lower antibody levels than average due to age related diminished ability to mount a robust immune response. Therefore it is very critical to determine antibody levels so that the level could be compared to those who have received the vaccine in younger groups. 

Just claiming that one has been fully immunized and received the requisite doses of the vaccine is not adequate to rest on one's laurels. One needs to be able to say that the antibody levels are most likely to provide protection. Proof of vaccination should not be just that the vaccine was received. but also that the vaccine actually raised the antibody levels similar to vaccinated healthy adults with a robust immunity. 

With vaccinated elderly susceptible to breakthrough infections one needs to know why. Is it because of low antibody levels or generally lower ability to mount a robust immune response. Sooner rather than later, antibody testing should be done on elderly after 6-12 months of receiving vaccine doses to decide whether an additional booster dose will be required to ensure that immune protection is optimal. Israel already is doing that."
2021-08-04 20:39:48,I hope all nursing homes have a ready supply of monoclonal antibodies which were approved for post exposure prophylaxis. They are extremely effective in reducing spread in a nursing home.
2021-08-04 20:42:12,"Guns are not permitted in Congress, SCOTUS or the White House but unvaccinated healthcare workers are allowed in nursing homes?"
2021-08-04 20:44:01,"My sister-in-law’s elderly father, isolated from everyone for months in his nursing home, contracted and died of covid. Obviously, an unvaccinated employee gave it to him. Now that vaccines are freely available to health care workers, nursing homes should mandate that employees get the vaccine. Otherwise, they are complicit in killing vulnerable patients they are supposed to protect. Even if they don’t care about their patients’ welfare, one would think that they would mandate employee vaccinations in order to protect themselves from the negligence  and reckless endangerment lawsuits that will no doubt be filed by outraged survivors of the deceased."
2021-08-04 20:44:05,""" ... unvaccinated staff were testing positive, seemingly carrying the virus into the home from the community ""

What? .... Unacceptable.   No slack on this one.  ALL staff must have PROOF of vaccination, or they don't work there.   I can't believe after losing 600k+
many of whom elderly in ""nursing homes""  - that this is even possible.    Get the shot or get another job."
2021-08-04 18:49:53,"I’m not buying the sob story about a labor shortage. The care home industry has a labor shortage because it pays its aides and cleaning staff appallingly low wages. Pay your employees a living wage, with full benefits, and watch the “shortage” disappear. That said, the federal government needs to mandate the vaccine for anyone who works in this setting. We cannot allow the fear of some to imperil the most vulnerable."
2021-08-04 20:40:37,I have been in assisted living for about sixteen months. What a bummer. Help me please. Get Vacintated.
2021-08-04 19:30:38,No brainer.
2021-08-04 19:07:05,"The 40% nursing staff who are not vaccinated shd be put on leave w/o pay! Their actions are medically stupid, dangerous and selfish and do not honor the Hippocratic Oath."
2021-08-04 19:43:54,"Back during WWII, there was a poster that read, ""Loose lips sink ships."" Meaning that people with knowledge critical to the war effort should use the utmost discretion in casual conversations in case a spy or Nazi sympathizer was listening.

Our attempt to bring the coronavirus under control is no less a nationwide battle. And we all need to put aside petty differences for the  common good to win the fight.

Maybe we need a new poster that reads, ""Unvaccinated arms cause harm!"" Do your part and get the shot!"
2021-08-04 19:47:08,"Trump, maybe 610,000 Americans' deaths ago: ""It just goes away."""
2021-08-04 20:06:55,"absolutely unbelievable that care workers, nurses, frontline people did not get vaccinated and are not required to. insane and stupid and selfish. awful."
2021-08-04 19:39:57,"Nursing home staff are bare minimum wage workers, not careerists. They are typically women of color. Tell them you are to going to force upon them a vaccine they have every right to refuse, and they will find another job. And then who is going to take care of Nana when you’re too busy?"
2021-08-04 19:21:13,"Why do people need incentives to get jabbed? My incentive was the prospect of staying healthy and protecting my loved ones. The kind of folk who will accept a jab in exchange for a cash incentive or similar are the same folk who have been flouting the rules all along and if they have waited until this late in the day to be jabbed  they don’t really give a hoot anyways. Please, let’s make being stupid a criminal offence!"
2021-08-04 20:07:23,"The trouble with your sense of smell is that it makes you see a conspiracy (and “heroic” vaccine-resistant people) where there’s a good faith, international effort based on good science to protect the world’s population against a virus, which, contrary to your assertion, kills people."
2021-08-04 19:54:35,"I see all the New York Times and it’s commenters shaming direct care workers, and my blood boils. They are predominantly poorly educated women of color, barely making minimum wage. Try and force upon them a vaccine they have every right to refuse, and they will find another job barely making minimum wage. And then who will take care of Nana when you’re too busy?"
2021-08-04 20:51:10,Nursing homes put their owners private profits before the health and safety of their partients and staff.
2021-08-04 21:13:38,"Nursing homes are worried about losing staff if they require them to be vaccinated?   I question that assumption, but even if it's true, the nursing homes should be more worried about literally losing both staff and residents from Covid."
2021-08-04 21:14:13,"Well yes, it would be great if every nursing home worker would get vaccinated but we could start by charging them with negligent homicide if they bring Covid into the workplace and someone dies.

Then their choice would be a little clearer.  Get vaccinated or risk going to jail for murder."
2021-08-04 21:26:38,"I checked in today on one of my new hires - he answered the phone and told me he was in the hospital- had been for the last two weeks-  he’s a smoker and a young guy in his early 30’s.  

 He is Coughing -really choking- he said he was stupid for not getting the vaccine. He just didn’t think it was real or that he could ever be this sick.  I am very worried for him and I told him I would pray and I will."
2021-08-04 21:30:33,It is malpractice to allow  unvaccinated workers inside a senior care facility. Likewise it is malpractice to allow  unvaccinated workers inside any hospital or rehabilitation care facility or doctors office or dentists office.  Any facility that fails to require full mandatory vaccination of all staff should be barred from reimbursement by the Federal government.
2021-08-04 21:36:13,"I agree with most of the commenters that all staff at long-term care facilities should be vaccinated as a condition of work. (I also believe wages should be raised to retain employees, but I believe in higher wages whether we have a pandemic or not.)

However, wherever we have COVID surges, all visitors should also present proof of vaccination. And everyone should be masked. We can't lock the front door and leave the back door open.

I don't think regular testing is sufficient because there's still a significant risk of a false negative, in which case a worker could be infecting residents for a week before her infection was detected. That's what happened at the White House in the Trump administration."
2021-08-04 21:36:51,"""Only about 60 percent of nursing home staff members are vaccinated, and some states report an even lower rate.""

This is simply deplorable.  Family members will now be kept out of nursing homes again and will not be able to see their loved ones and many residents will probably die as their immunity wanes.  

Where is the respect for humanity itself?"
2021-08-04 21:39:06,And I have a relative who works in a nursing home complaining about losing the job for refusal to vaccinate.
2021-08-04 21:43:19,"Why not just implement widespread testing for all nursing home employees and visitors? Since vaxxed people can transmit the virus either way, doesn’t it make more sense to just test everyone? Then the nursing home won’t have to turn away unvaccinated workers who are very much needed."
2021-08-04 21:55:39,"Low wages may be a problem in nursing homes, but also is low education.  Let this be a clarion call to institute employee education programs on a regular basis."
2021-08-04 21:58:11,Un-vaccinated health care workers- unethical and immoral. Anyone working in a health care facility must be vaccinated or they should find other work. This is grounds for wrongful death suits.  Unbelievable;
2021-08-04 22:00:21,But this is hypocritical without mandates for the wider population if the vaccinated can still transmit the virus. At the end of the day it seems we need to have a mandate for everybody to get vaccinated to protect the most vulnerable.
2021-08-04 22:02:22,It seems to me that the kind of worker who's happy to continue working in one of these places unvaccinated is the kind of worker they should be getting rid of anyway.
2021-08-04 22:06:37,It costs money to fix this problem. Federal money. State money. Nursing home profit money.  Set a date known to all workers at a home explaining when a pharmacy with a cold storage van will bring the vaccines to the nursing home. Pay a $200 bonus and  raise in pay to all who have been vaccinated in the past and to all who  are  vaccinated on that day. Having the vaccine at the work site coupled with the monetary reward should be a good motivator.  Those who refuse vaccinations should know in advance that they will be terminated. All vaccinated new hires will receive the $200 bonus and the increased pay.  Those who aren’t at the nursing home on the designated day can take work time to be driven to the pharmacy to get the vaccine. Make it easy and profitable for workers.  Main problem - getting new hires in time for a home to remain in compliance with state mandated staffing requirements.
2021-08-04 22:11:17,"The time for insurance companies and healthcare providers to start requiring the Pfizer or Moderna (mRNA type only, thank you) is now.  This one requirement could dramatically decrease the numbers of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.  It amazes me how few healthcare systems, even the largest ones, don’t require their employees to become vaccinated.  Do they have a death wish for themselves or their patients?"
2021-08-04 22:15:47,"Any health care worker who refuses the benefits of our health care system because they have irrational fear, and are too gullible to understand the truth should have every one of their certifications revoked."

Only about half of the staff I work with at a nursing home are currently vaccinated.  It is certainly not because it hasn’t been offered to them.  I don’t understand why they don’t get this vaccine for their patients if not for their friends and families.  My company put out an email Friday saying they will mandate vaccines for all employees by September.  I say about darn time.  If you won’t do this out of compassion for your patients then I think they should find not only a new job but a new industry to work in.  We have also had to close down to visitors as staff have passed this to our patients again, even vaccinated patients have gotten ill.  Although all have survived so far, thanks to that vaccine."
2021-08-04 22:17:06,"We keep hearing the ""freedom fighters"" yell and scream about their rights not to be vaccinated and not to wear masks.  Shouldn't employers and patients also have ""freedom""?  Freedom to choose safety and science.  Freedom to err on the side of caution.  Freedom to decide whether or not they want unvaccinated people anywhere near them."

2021-08-04 21:55:56,"I just read on CNN that the U.S. government is ""contemplating"" to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations for active service members of the military.

Yappi-da-du-daaah!

Most of you are too young, but there is a movie from 1994, with  the title ""Renaissance Man"" and Danny de Vito as lead actor. In that movie ""Mr. Bill"" becomes a teacher, against his will, to a group of ""Double-D"" soldiers. It's very funny!

But one scene in the movie keeps popping up in my mind when it comes to Covid-19: Mr. Bill is shown around the base and sees a lot of recruits getting ""shots"". Some of them have to lie down after the shot. He goes over there, concerned, and fans them with the file folder he has in hand.

He asks the CO he's with (from memory): ""Is this really necessary? What are they going to catch in Texas?"". And the CO says: ""Don't worry, they all survive it"".

So, that was 1994. What has changed in the U.S. military?

I read a lot about ""wokeness"", but that's not it. I read that the U.S. military - on the basis of the average soldier - is now inferior to Russia and China in terms of ""toughness"", but that's not it either.

I believe it's a lack of shouting.

""Hey, you, over there, get in line to get your Covid-19 shot! On the double! Now! Faster! Don't look at me, get in line, you stupid whatever! Man, if I would have been so slow during my training my Drill Sargent would have made me clean the whole camp with my toothbrush!"".

2021-08-04 22:16:09,This is criminal to allow unvaccinated staff to be working in nursing homes.

But right-wing infotainment has convinced many of them that they are being patriotic are doing the right thing by fighting the Liberal machine and refusing a dangerous “experimental” vaccine.

2021-08-04 22:36:50,"As an epidemiologist and privileged white woman, I'm compelled to comment. From the pandemic's early days, my job was to do risk assessments and advise LTC workers how to isolate or quarantine. If they had a high-risk exposure, they had to stay out of work, often unpaid, and report their temperature and symptoms everyday for 14 days. For some English was not their primary language and some did not have internet access. It was not unusual to receive calls at the end of 16 hours shifts, while I assessed their risk from the comfort of my home. These folks suffered physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially - on multiple occasions. At least during the early months, most were cooperative and appreciative. Pay was poor and work was challenging, even back when families were there to help. My point is that the workers I spoke with seemed every bit as concerned about spreading Covid as they were about contracting it. Yet, back when a vaccine was still a pipedream of sorts, there were several who told me they would not be vaccinated if a vaccine became available. Though I can't begin to relate to their resistance - especially these days when it's clear that the benefits far outweigh the risks - I believe at least some fear is very real and perhaps is based on experiences that are unfamiliar to me? Unfortunately, staffing shortages are real and people have never beat down the doors to work in these facilities. What a complex, perilous situation."

The facility tests all staff regularly and adheres to all mask regulations. 

The first was a breakthrough case in a vaccinated staff member. 

Given the virulence of the variant and the breakthrough cases it is unfathomable to me that there’s no vaccination requirement. 

Enough is enough. Unless it’s contraindicated get the vaccine or find another job."

2021-08-04 22:55:23,"I have a niece in another state who is a nurse and works in a nursing home. She is refusing the vaccine for a few reasons 1. She has some health issues that she believes came from the HPV vaccine she recess a teen and is wary of vaccines now 2. She and her significant other are conservative and pro- gun, pro ""freedom"" and live in a red county in a red state.  3. She would rather quit than get vaccinated which would be extremely short- sighted considering that most healthcare facilities will most likely mandate the vaccine eventually.   While I can on a certain level understand her POV, it's a no-win situation for her and others like her; they are hired to care for frail, elderly and often sick patients- and if someone's elderly relative catches Covid from an unvaccinated caregiver or nurse, the facility should be liable."

I just don't understand the lack of oversight and not having a strict contingency plan in place given the risks of transmission and the fact they are caring for the most vulnerable of humanity."

Definitely pay people more BUT ONLY if they get the vaccine."
2021-08-04 23:17:03,"I work in a nursing home.  I lived through the horror of the spring 2020 surge, when we lost many patients in what was the most traumatic and horrifying experience of my life.  We were working in a petri dish ripe for rampant infection, but unlike the ER and ICU ""heroes"" the industry was blasted in the press for ""not protecting our elders""---so sad that people do not understand what it is like to work in a setting where everyone was putting their hearts into this work as well as putting their own lives at risk.  Families were devastated being separated from their loved ones; people were dying in a terrifying fashion.

To see unvaccinated staff now test positive makes me enraged and numb with discouragement.  It is coming back, and would be largely preventable with this miraculous little vaccine we've had since December.  Today Massachusetts mandated nursing home workers to be vaccinated by October.

Better now than not at all, but too little too late.

I can't do this again, and certainly our families and elders cannot.  My heart is heavy with rage for the unvaccinated."
2021-08-04 23:19:30,"If a nursing home has a significant amount of employees who refuse to get vaccinated, it's a big warning sign.  They don't care about your loved ones.  You should seek other accommodations."
2021-08-04 23:20:10,These unvaccinated nursing homes staffs are optimal protoplasm for Delta variant to replicate more transmissible more virulent more fit mutates dangerously and more deadly.
2021-08-04 23:24:29,Nursing home patients and everyone should have their antibody response to the vaccines tested. Those without an   adequate response should receive additional doses of the mRNA vaccines to achieve the best protection we can offer against the delta variant.This is more than what Dr Fauci is suggesting when he says the additional shots are not really boosters in people who did not get the desired response with the initial vaccinations. We should ignore the W.H.O. Everyone does not need “booster” shots as Pfizer has recommended just the people who did not get the optimal response with initial vaccinations . I have been testing antibody responses in all my vaccinated patients and 72% of them had the maximal detectable response and those people do not need additional doses. But those with lesser response may need them to prevent the delta or new variants from causing breakthrough infections.
2021-08-04 23:27:01,I would think that having unvaccinated employees would raise a nursing home / assisted living’s liability. Any feedback from the insurance sector on this?
2021-08-04 23:27:31,How can you be a competent director of a nursing home and still be so confused about the safety of the vaccine?
2021-08-04 23:32:25,I wonder why they don't fine people who have not gotten their vaccination yet. As a matter of fact fine them some percentage of their income every week until they are vaccinated.  If they don't  care about their neighbors then perhaps they will act to protect their money.
2021-08-05 00:11:00,"With nearly 35% of covid deaths occuring in long term healthcare facilities, everyone going into one of those places need to be tested everyday.  With the availability rapid testing, there is no excuse for not doing it.  With all of the break through cases occurring in both the vaccinated and previously infected, testing is STILL needed."
2021-08-04 23:57:44,"Its really simple. Get vaccinated. Get vaccinated. Get vaccinated.
Its not political, its not religious. Its science. The vaccine does not change your DNA , it does not make you sterile. Read the science, the media needs to explain the vaccine. Its not witchcraft,the vaccine tells  your body to make a protein that protects you from Covid 19 Get vaccinated. Just do it."

2021-08-05 00:26:15,"The latest buzz (via NYT) is that the FDA is aiming for full approval of the Pfizer vaccine by Labor Day.  Expanded Federal unemployment benefits have ended or will end soon.  These two facts, respectively, put governors in a good position to mandate vaccination of ALL long-term care staff, and would seem to put workers in an increasingly likely mood to do right by their patients and get vaccinated.

No one has a right to put our fragile elders and disabled at risk--again!  And if mandates are across the board, facility owners' concerns that by mandating  they'll lose a scarce worker to the facility ""across the street"" evaporate.  And workers or would-be workers' concerns that a care facility is a dangerous Covid workplace should be alleviated.  Win for elders having a safer home, win for workers having a safer work environment, and win for facilities doing right by their residents.

Mandate."
2021-08-05 00:31:17,"If it’s legal under the emergency mandates, then I agree with requiring all nursing home staff to accept covid vaccination. 

And not only them.   We should require all public school staff to accept vaccination.  Many teachers, in LA and NYC, are not vaccinated."
2021-08-05 00:35:35,"I remember the horror at the Kirkland, Wa., nursing home in January/February in 2020. Honestly, it didn’t occur to me that unvaccinated people would feel that they have a right to put elderly, vulnerable residents at risk in a nursing home. That’s intolerable."
2021-08-05 00:38:02,"I agree wholeheartedly with the fury against the unvaccinated, especially those who work with the most vulnerable.  
But many commenters seem to have missed the point (that should have been highlighted much more in the article) that it is VERY hard to staff nursing homes - has been for years.  It's an extremely challenging job that pays peanuts.
Many of these places are likely in a position where they're having to choose between unvaccinated workers or no workers.  And for those of you who haven't spent much time on Memory Care floors, let me tell you that it's a tough call.  Residents need a LOT of help.  Leaving them alone is a death wish and arguably torture.
Staff need massive pay raises AND there need to be vaccine mandates."
2021-08-05 00:53:59,After all the uproar over nursing home deaths last spring I find it shocking that the staff is not required to be vaccinated and anyone visiting also. Where are the folks who were so upset last spring now?
2021-08-05 00:53:41,"Why is this even still a discussion? Why wasn't every elder care facility, hospital, doctor and dentist's office in the Country required to vaccinate all staff months ago?

If you allow medically unfounded nonsense to endanger the people entrusted to your care you have NO business in the healthcare industry what so ever. 

It's both shocking and disturbing (not to mention disgusting) to see large numbers of Nurses and even some Doctors protesting vaccine requirements and spouting absolutely insane conspiracy theories and misinformation. 

No one can force you to take the vaccine but that doesn't mean the rest of us should tolerate your continued employment in the healthcare industry. 

Your ""Liberty"" doesn't extend to killing your patients just because you watch too much FOX News and don't read enough medical journals. 

(Sickly Ironic is the fact that FOX News was actually the very first large corporation to mandate vaccines for all employees months before any other corporation did.)

If you trust Tucker Carlson over Dr. Fauci you just have no business in healthcare. 

Find another career, preferably working from home."
2021-08-05 00:59:31,"This makes those who refuse to take vaccine out of their own freedom especially absurd. For staffs working at hospitals, nursing homes and schools, they are facing vulnerable groups. Their personal choice is not personal, it can be fatal! 
I can’t express how frustrated that people are abusing their freedom and rights without acknowledging the very basic fact that they are also part of a society. Their rights and responsibility are bonded. Their kindness and consideration is not a sacrifice, on the contrary, it’s a contribution to the collective goods, which in return will benefit themselves. Alas, is this really an intellectual gymnastics?"

2021-08-05 01:15:36,"I work in hospice, we haven't had any COVID positives since April. Now, many of our facilities have Covid positive employees and it's spreading through our vaccinated patients. Dying from Covid is gruesome, with delirium and suffocation.

One of our home patients had a Dialysis Nurse visit, and turns out she was Covid positive. Now that patient's family won't allow anyone in to care for patient. They're terrified. Don't blame them.

My mother was in a facility, due to mental health issues. I wasn't allowed to visit. A worker brought Covid to her, and she died.

The hospital nurse that cared for her as she was dying wasn't vaccinated. Didn't believe in it.

You can't make this stuff up.

All the visiting nurses I work with risked their lives caring for dying Covid patients last year. Now they have to do it again.

It's a horror show, and starting all over again. Vaccines have to be mandated for health care workers. No exceptions."

Time line to be decided, this from Reuters and now the NY Times. Another opening of the boarders ...at a time when even those vaccinated may carry the delta virus with them into this country, makes no sense.

Just another example of how we are not solving this pandemic, but more than likely expanding it. Why.

When schools open shortly and all school districts have different ways of dealing with the pandemic with your politicians/administrators/parents, how do you expect this pandemic to stop spreading?

When States like Florida/Texas and their governor's decide what's best for their states and their citizens alone, how do you expect the pandemic to stop spreading? 

This is how we are handling this pandemic in all aspects of our society from nursing homes to travel, and if you think the program is working at this time, really look around...and see what is actually being done. 

And since one has received two shots and been told it works, is effective, and now need a booster or can catch and spread delta, can you sue them because it is not, or should one just blame the ""unvaccinated""? What about those who received just one shot from say J&J or one from Pfizer/Moderna. 

What about the mandates and testing costs now? 

It's spreading, and we are closer to flu season again.

What are we going to do?"
2021-08-05 02:11:40,"I’m surprised this article—and the NYT in general—isn’t covering the comparable crisis with regard to elder care agencies and in-home health care workers. The agencies, by and large, do not require their workers, who work in private homes of people most prone to severe COVID and breakthrough infection, to be vaccinated. In fact, most agencies refuse to assign aides to elderly patients/clients who request vaccinated aides. Of over twenty agencies phoned in the NYC area, none agreed to take onto their roles an elderly vaccinated person (my mother) with relatively light but crucial care needs who would accept into her home only vaccinated aides. One agency told me I was putting the agency in a terrible position by making this request for a vaccinated aide. No thought to the position my mother is in.

The state (NY) mandates that elder care agencies report the vaccination statuses of their aide staff to the state regularly but the state does not enforce this mandate and care coordinators cite aides’ privacy as a reason not to take vaccination status into account when assigning aides.

So my mother has had to choose between risking exposure to COVID and not getting needed care that could extend her life and improve her quality of life. And that is care the state itself, through Medicaid evaluators, has determined my mother needs.

On top of it all, there has been almost no media coverage of these issues affecting the homebound elderly. (I’m looking at you, NYT.) Nobody cares."
2021-08-05 02:12:13,"Last week my sister, a resident in a memory care facility in Massachusetts, tested possible for covid, though she was vaccinated.

Memory care and  assisted living facilities do not fall under the definition of nursing homes in Massachusetts.  So here's the thing - nursing home staff who don't want vaccines can easily switch to working in other forms of long term care facilities, who also have a desperate need for staff. Some Massachusetts ALFs have mandated vaccines for all employees - I hope that others will do that as well."
2021-08-05 02:13:19,"Here’s a solution: state licensing boards suspend licenses of any healthcare professional (doctors, nurses, dentists, OT, PT, etc.) who doesn’t get vaccinated.

At first, I had tolerance for those who chose not to get vaccinated. Now I’m fed up. Unless you have a valid medical reason, just go get vaccinated. That and only that will relegate this scourge to a manageable, seasonal, respiratory disease.
Notwithstanding breakthroughs, actual data demonstrates that once vaccinated your chances of getting seriously ill is less than a tiny fraction of one percent. 
Feel good measures like mandates to wear completely ineffective cloth masks are useless. You might as well shovel sand against the incoming tide. And such measures may only serve to give some people excuses.
Delta or no delta, there is no reason why we can’t be in the position we were in only a month ago, but this time long term.
Get vaccinated- now !!"

There are no reports I’m aware of citing the Tuskegee syphilis study as a parallel, rather it was the possibility of side effects causing absence that often came up; granting a couple days’ paid leave might help with this. Fears about the care home environment should abate once everyone’s vaccinated.

I appreciate the work they do. Heavy lifting is required and salaries are low. But we need Americans getting the vaccines, not just in the homes but all of us who are eligible to receive them. The procrastination we’re indulging is why the virus keeps coming back."

2021-08-05 03:11:20,"I suspect many nursing home patients did not have an effective antibody response to the vaccine and may benefit from a third dose. Indeed, third doses are being used elsewhere in the world, and we need to quickly find out who should be getting them and then following them.

In the meantime, if you work in health care, you have to be vaccinated before you are infected with delta, which you will be, and either spread it to others, die, or both."
2021-08-05 03:13:06,"The nursing home industry deserves to collapse. Every person and every family needs to figure out a way for its members to age at home. If nursing homes and their workers don't have the common decency (and respect for medicine) to get the Covid-19 vaccine and ALL basic vaccines, including flu  - and at the appropriate age - pneumonia - to protect their vulnerable - and most important - CAPTIVE - charges, they should get new jobs in the out-of-doors digging ditches or building roads where they will be less of a menace."

This should include ALL staff at nursing homes, including non-medical staff such as drivers, cooks, receptionist, janitorial, etc. The residents and their families have a right to know if there are any unvaccinated staff. Secondly, all visitors should be vaccinated or have a recent negative test to enter the building. Otherwise, visitors should be refused. My mother-in-law was in a nursing home for three weeks, had to be quarantined for 14 days and was limited to one visitor for only two hours a day. Since the vaccines have been available, there is no excuse for this situation to exist."

If you work with frail, elderly already sick people-  get vaccinated or get another job.  If you can’t find employees, increase wages.  This nursing center was chronically short-staffed because there were so many unvaccinated staff who had to be sent home after every round of testing for 2 weeks of quarantine.

Long--term care is one of the most broken areas in the healthcare ecosystem. The high cost of care results in 2/3 of residents ending up on Medicaid. For-profit chains understaff facilities and underpay workers to maintain profits. Nonprofit chains barely break even. Baby boomers are stressing the system more than ever.

Every US workplace had the legal duty to protect the health and safety of workers, yet the CDC has limited OSHA's ability to inspect and enforce, Biden's much touted Emergency Standard ended up being limited to healthcare.

If we jump to judgement without first getting to the root issue, we solve little. The crisis of the pandemic has illustrated many of the weak points and failures of our society.

The effectiveness of the vaccines received during the winter against preventing new infections and retransmissions has degraded considerably by now, particularly when dealing with the delta variant. Vaccinating 100% of staff, contractors and visitors is not going to change that fact. The only viable solution is to provide the nursing home residents with the booster shots.

I lost a friend in a nursing/rehab facility outbreak in Florida last year. It could be argued they were caught without recourse, and no weapons to fight back with, but this is absolutely not the case anymore. Not this go round…

You need to not have a serious criminal record, you need certifications, and now you need to prove you understand science, and your professional responsibilities to not kill your vulnerable patients!

At this point, this looks like ghastly dereliction of legal and medical duty. Anyone could sue one of these places into oblivion, for a preventable death.

It’s a no brainer: get vaccinated, or go find other work, on your own time, and take your feckless and reckless behavior elsewhere!"
2021-08-05 10:40:45,"Having lost my mother-in-law to a nursing home that provided inadequate care during the pandemic, my heart goes out to the poor souls left in their care.  No caregiver to others anywhere----within hospitals, nursing homes, doctor's offices, schools (including teachers) should be unvaccinated.  The risk to all involved in the facility from caregiver to recipients is just too high.  

I voted for Biden and supported him all the way.  But his failure to issue a mandate is weakness and may turn the tide for me in my next presidential vote.  He can not blame the current state of affairs as only Trump's doing.  This may be where those who oppose Biden can rally:  he puts an incompetent over the CDC who too quickly tells people to take off masks before science supports that decision; the CDC leaves confusing, horrific guidance; and the president is too weak to demand masks of the citizenry.  It is a Trump redux of sorts.  Democrats can win elections, but they simply can not govern."
2021-08-05 11:53:07,"The Government can not mandate COVID vaccination while the COVID vaccine has not approval behind emergency. The delay in the full approval of the vaccines only increases the doubt in the unvaccinated community.

It is necessary to establish a clear difference between long-term residential, rehabilitation units, and true long-term medical care."
2021-08-05 11:54:27,Vaccine refusal is likely just a hint of the anti science attitudes present within the staff at a nursing home or hospital. If you think that essentially everyone who works in a hospital-like setting will be naturally pro science you might want to think again and again. If you see evidence at the bottom it may well be much the same at the top. If your hospital advertises itself as deemed the best or one of the best by some magazine I suggest you think twice.
2021-08-05 14:20:00,"It makes no sense to me that vaccines are not mandated for anyone that works in a healthcare setting-from physicians to phlebotomists to nurses aides.  Hospitals and care homes are always trying to prevent nosocomial infections and take amazing precautions to keep patients safe from getting a hospital or nursing home acquired infection.  COVID isn't any different that MRSA in that it can be easily spread in hospital or home and knowing that simple two vaccine regime can prevent this should be a requirement for employment, just like any other prevention control method."

Out of a group of 7 poker players at least 3 were infected last week.  One is hospitalized and my uncle is now very weak.  They were all fully vaccinated with Pfizer.

Sure enough, I tested positive for antibodies! And my bloodwork is returning to the state it was in before I did this, so I seem not to have suffered any harm.

Rituxin, one of the most problematic of the immunosuppressants because of the way it works, is given IV every six months. That means that patients have a window of opportunity every six months to get vaccinated while their Rituxin is at its lowest point. Miss that window and take your next dose of Rituxin when it is due and you have to wait another six months for a chance to get vaccinated and have it work.  That six month wait is a lifetime in this pandemic.

Do we really need more information, though? There are multiple countries giving booster doses to the immunosuppressed. Tens (maybe hundreds) of studies confirm the necessity. 

Doctors at every level are completely baffled, can't interpret anti spike antibody tests and give incorrect information (saying you're safer than you are to prevent fear/panic) or if they do acknowledge the need, they have no idea how to execute on it. Pharmacies won't accept prescriptions for an additional dose. You literally have to go to another state and/or flat out lie to get one. And even then you're burdened with 2 vaccine cards and the conundrum of how to consolidate them for upcoming vaccine mandates.

Meanwhile staying at home and doing nothing is not a viable solution because of how transmissible Delta is even amongst vaccinated people. You can catch it in the hallway of your apartment complex because no one wears masks anymore (thanks CDC). Isn't the viral load 1000x the original?

There is something called Vaccine Failure caused by inappropriate administration of the Covid19 vaccine and I am one of many experiencing this. When you look at the millions of videos of vaccinators injecting the vaccine you will see many differing techniques of injecting.  The correct technique is flattening the arm tissue to ensure the vaccine is injected into the deltoid muscle. When you see vaccinators squeezing the upper arm flesh and injecting the vaccine this often results in the vaccine being deposited subcutaneously into the fatty adipose tissue. The vaccine is not effective when injected into fatty tissue instead of the deltoid muscle because enzymes in the fatty tissue render the vaccine denatured. So, potentially thousand of people are thinking they had 2 good doses when in fact they did not. I tried and failed to convince the authorities to give me a properly injected second dose even six months later but no one will help me.  I want to get another dose of Pfizer which would in truth just be my second proper dose but it would look illegal on my CDC card if I could convince anyone to help me. So instead I sit home,

 Given the fact that many other countries (like Israel and Germany) and  San Francisco are already administering additional doses without any apparent mass side-effect disasters, and more people are getting additional vaccines on their own, the scientists waiting for neat results become less and less relevant as time goes on. And this is not to mention the people who received the J&J  vaccine for whom there is every reason to believe an additional dose would increase their immunity and no reason to predict harm. 
 The Delta variant is here. It takes weeks for an additional vaccine dose to reach peak effectiveness. It is a virtual certainty that not acting now to administer additional doses to people who are likely to be inadequately vaccinated, will lead to more disease and deaths than could ever result from administering an additional dose to immunocompromised people.

Common sense seems uncommon. If an immunocompromised patient did not seem to be protected after being considered fully immunized what is the assurance that another dose or 3 more doses will make a significant difference? 

After 165 million US residents fully vaccinated we still don't know what exactly is the reason why vaccines protect against the original COVID strain that escaped from Wuhan, China but not so well against the delta variant? Greek letters go from alpha to Omega. Delta is only the 4th after alpha, beta, and gamma. Why not develop a combination in 1 vaccine specifically combining the messenger RNA against all the current strains? I just had a seasonal flu shot for the 2021-2022 flu season. While flu shots will NOT protect against COVID, we can learn something about vaccine design. The shot that I have received has a combination for protection against 4 different flu strains all in one shot and that is based on the WHO's forward thinking prediction of what the strains could be that may be likely to make their rounds in each of the 2 hemispheres. 

A CDC study shows Unvaccinated COVID survivors twice as likely to get reinfected. Earlier there were reports that reinfection with COVID is rare. Confusion?"
2021-08-07 03:45:48,"I take a TNF inhibitor and methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis.  I began wearing a mask when the practice was being ridiculed by Trump and actively discouraged by the CDC in early February of last year. After a year of isolation and scrupulous mask use and distancing I remained CoVID free and received the Pfizer vaccines this February.  Today I got a 3rd dose of the Jenssen vaccine and will skip 2.5 weeks of taking methotrexate in the hope of producing more antibodies and T-cell activity. When Pfizer’s mRNA ‘booster’ that targets the Delta variant is available (hopefully) early next year, I will likely get it. I have switched from double-masking with a  KN95 mask to N95 masks now that they are plentiful. 
The WHO has made serious missteps in the pandemic so I take their finger-wagging about 3rd doses with a grain of salt.  All those Missouri geniuses who are exercising their ‘right’ not to be vaccinated? I just used one of their rejected doses.   
As long as the vaccination rate in NYC remains appallingly low and the governor and mayor don’t have the collective guts to reinstitute mask mandates and the CDC and FDA are unable to keep up with scientific findings and recommendations, I’ll be devising my own strategy to stay safe."
2021-08-07 04:17:09,"Could the CDC please advice us what the nature of our immunity will be at if we get mild covid after two vaccinations? Does it extend the immunity already afforded by the two dose vaccination? Is it as effective as a booster? Does it make sense to take an extra dose if one is not immunocompromised, especially in the light of the certainty we will come into contact with delta? Is it worth actually getting exposed to the infection when we are safely vaccinated? Obviously I mean the medically fit people."
2021-08-06 20:36:50,"Perhaps, if we'd had a real president from 2017-2020 we would have had scientists that remained at the CDC and we'd have herd immunity and we'd be evolving instead of de-volving and, and, and.... But it was not to be."
2021-08-07 07:42:13,"The CDC could have given a simple message of  “Masks are REQUIRED a indoors and optional outdoors.”  But no, they were still trying to entice the unvaccinated with the “honor” system.  Public health is based on science but only implemented successfully when human behavior is taken into consideration.   What genius at the CDC decided anti-vaxers would be truthful and cooperative?

I have been been patiently staying home for the past 17 months but lifting the indoors mask requirement as the Delta variant blazes through the country has seriously affected my mental health.  Being immunocompromised  I am powerless to increase my immunity while a good percentage of Americans refuse a miraculous vaccine due to entitlement, stubbornness and plain stupidity."
2021-08-07 08:26:52,"This country as a whole seems to be effectively ungovernable and the FDA seems to be part of that. This is an emergency situation where you aren’t going to get and don’t have the time to, perfect data. They should use the current available information combined with COMMON SENSE to give approval for these and other booster shots, along with overall approval of these several vaccines."
2021-08-07 08:54:26,If you want a fully approved vaccine  they are readily available: Sinovac and Sputnik V on.  Have a ball.
2021-08-07 09:11:26,"The best way to determine who needs additional doses of vaccines is through the spike protein antibody test. A recent study in the NEJM, showed low levels of neutralizing antibodies did correlate with low spike protein antibody levels also and supports using this test to determine who actually needs an additional shot at this time. Every immunocompromised does not need another shot at this time and can be monitored thru the spike protein antibody test levels to determine if and when they will need an additional dose. 10 percent of all the patients I have tested so far had undetectable spike protein antibody levels and should be eligible for additional doses of Moderna or Pfizer— not just those designated to have impaired immunity. This could be you—ask your doctor for the test."
2021-08-07 13:57:37,"Last thing we need now is a rush of customers lying to get a third shot, as any deterrence measures that arise in response will impact efforts to get the unvaccinated into the clinic for their first and second shots. Our immunization campaign simply can’t afford to have policing problems threaten turnout. Yet that’s what irresponsible reporting laced with comparisons to chickenpox contagion and waning immunity after inoculation for flu, along with the instant experts shouting on Facebook, might bring. Transplant patients or the very elderly may be candidates for expedited boosters, but the general population should wait until told to get them."
2021-08-07 14:12:21,"Every country in the western world uses the same data essentially, the same types of analysis over basically the same drugs. And yet each country feels like it has some special insight that the others don't. So much wasted time."
2021-08-07 06:06:09,"You know what is certainly not safe for transplant patients?  Catching Delta.  The CDC has done enough to harm the immunosuppressed what with deciding foolishly that we could do masking on the honor system.  (Has there ever in the history of mankind been a more predictable reaction?). It’s time they did something to help.  My family member is an essential worker as well as a transplant patient.  I think he deserves whatever protection we can give, don’t you?"
2021-08-07 12:10:44,"I am a physician, elderly, immunocompromised and puzzled by the slowness in resolving this issue for patients like me. I get the need for data but I got the vaccine in January( Moderna) and that is almost 7 months ago, enough time to assess the risk to this group. 3% of 330 million Americans is 10 million people. I read comments like there may be flares in our conditions if we take a booster and enrollment in a clinical trial is best but a clinical trial may involve randomization with a placebo group and we have not heard anything about trials. I have read also there is reluctance to give boosters because those who have delayed getting a vaccine will then conclude that if boosters are needed then why get vaccinated at all. I am not impressed with that logic. One thing is clear: The advisory group should be meeting more frequently and transparency improved."
2021-08-07 13:39:45,"Obviously, FDA needs some changes, on one side they approved the use of a drug for Alzheimer's that the majority of the medical field does not approve, and at the same time, they only approved vaccines that save lives on an emergency basis."
2021-08-07 14:34:09,"FDA approval of additional vaccine doses for the immunocompromised would be a welcome and much-needed development!  Recognition of the needs of this population -- the *most vulnerable* of those among us -- is especially important given the recent pressure from WHO and others to donate vaccines to elsewhere in the world vs 'boosting' the US population.  This latter objective is clearly worthy and important, but it is inherently unfair for policy makers who have themselves had the privilege to be fully vaccinated successfully by the current one or two dose regimens, to deny this status to the immunocompromised who, through no fault of their own, may require additional doses to gain protection.  This group has had to live in hiding for their own protection for far too long, while watching the world around them become increasingly unsafe with the loosening of public health restrictions and the rise of more dangerous variants -- driving them ever deeper into isolation and fear."
2021-08-07 15:55:07,"I am not surprised that these people vaccinated with Pfizer had breakthrough infections. This is consistent with the data on my own patients and I have tested close to 500 so far. Pfizer is excellent in generating strongly positive results on antibody testing and 93% showed positive responses but 7% had none and are effectively unvaccinated. Those people and the low level responders to Pfizer /another 10 % need another shot—my patients who received a 3rd shot of Moderna had the maximal detectable response in less than 4 wks on retests. Not all Pfizer vaccinated need another shot but you have to test them to know who does.The CDC has continued to discourage testing of antibodies but this is the most cost effective, low risk way to use a 3rd dose strategy."
2021-08-03 01:16:19,"Whiplash, really? Many of us knew it was a mistake for the CDC, when the dr,ta varian was already on the upswing, to advise vaccinated people to stop masking indoors. My husband, daughter and I haven’t stopped masking (double masking most of the time) even though we have been fully vaccinated for quite some time."
2021-08-03 01:15:58,"Gosh, so many of us are so uneducated."
2021-08-03 01:10:11,"Count me in as skeptical.  I know the narrative is just to agree with whatever the “science of the day is” but this is ridiculous.  If your vaccinated, which I am, these restrictions, masks make no sense.  The guidance including god like Fauci is all over the place.  Disaster is an understatement."
2021-08-03 01:14:05,"Please everyone..no name calling, no politics, just get vaccinated if you haven't already. Please!"
2021-08-03 01:20:35,This should not be that hard. Get vaccinated AND wear a mask! Why can't Biden and the CDC just say so?
2021-08-03 01:19:46,"How it could also read: 
Americans suffer whiplash from Covid Politicization.
Social media, GOP-led State Legislatures and Governors have created a needless mess and put the US way behind on recovery."
2021-08-03 01:21:02,History will show that the CDC guidance of masking by “honor” system was a catastrophic error. The unvaccinated have proven over the last year that they have no honor. They cannot be trusted. Now we are mired in a new nightmare.
2021-08-03 01:19:56,"Does anyone else besides me know of breakthrough cases among your circle of family, friends, colleagues and acquaintances? Based on what I've seen, it's inaccurate to call breakthroughs ""extremely rare."" We need to get back to wearing masks, avoiding crowds, and postponing travel plans. Vaccines alone won't fix this."
2021-08-03 01:23:00,"Maybe funnel all appropriate information to a scientific group, have it digest the input, and let them through a spokesperson, not Wallensky, not Biden, give updates/advisories in relative lay terms.  Will irritate those who like to have their moment in the limelight but provide a steady incremental update to the public,
perhaps promoting more compliance."
2021-08-03 01:25:30,I don’t see how this is a surprise to anyone following the science. We predicted back when a bunch of us college professors got vaccinated in March that there would be a brief decline in cases followed by a complete disaster in the Fall due to low vaccination rates and the variant. We were only wrong in predicting things wouldn’t go south (literally) until Fall.
2021-08-03 01:25:44,"Let’s be clear. Masking is because scientists think vaccinated people can spread it, not so much because they may get sick. Most vaccinated people are safe, let’s be clear about that. Current reporting seems to neglect that part. We’re being asked to mask mostly for the safety of those who haven’t been vaccinated, including children and those with immune challenges, and of course the stubborn ones who refuse to get vaccinated just because they can! We need to be clear that most vaccinated people are safe. Also, this was foreseen. That’s why mask mandates were dropped months ago. They reasoned that it would be easier for people to accept them again if they saw an end to the pandemic in the tunnel. We now know there’s and can be an end if we get more vaccination."
2021-08-03 01:21:45,"I have listened carefully to what the CDC says, but i also use my own judgement. I have continuously worn a mask when going out. Those who aren’t wearing masks…..there is no guarantee that those folks have been vaccinated. When we have Trump, his cohorts, FOX, OAN, and Newsmax  (and Q) making up conspiracy theories and spreading them to millions of people, we can all see why people do not know who to believe. Surprising how many people are not capable of thinking for themselves. It makes me wonder how long we people with the ability to think and seek the truth have to put up with these folks who care nothing for their fellow Americans and instead pledge their allegiance to Trump."
2021-08-03 01:15:54,"Unless we have a vaccine mandate, covid will be here to stay. It’s simple science."
2021-08-03 01:21:34,"Let's see  if the  non vaccinated can fight  this  virus, I  have  no  empathy  for them"
2021-08-03 01:19:17,"I seem to recall that the stated reason for my wearing a mask was to protect others from exposure to droplets coming from my nose and mouth.  If that is so, then how is my wearing of a mask considered a way for me to be protected from the virus?  It protects others, but not me, correct?  Did I miss something along the way here?

I'm not saying I won't wear a mask; I will.  But isn't it to protect others?"
2021-08-03 01:26:29,"Look we see all tired. I can see on social media now that even previously non-skeptical/fully vaccinated friends are now plowing forward to travel and attend crowded events and they are questioning whether Delta/renewed masking/renewed mandates are really necessary. People feel like they have done and gone through enough.

This Magical thinking concerns me. We are going to need to realize that we are still not in control - the virus is. Until more people are vaccinated, then we may need to accept more restrictions."
2021-08-03 01:27:02,"The rush fo re-open Restaurants, Bars and Sports events, with the “Honor System” of the the unvaccinated wearing masks was a mistake.  Perhaps things would have been better had a National Vaccine Passport been initiated, with admittance denied fo the unvaccinated unless they wear a mask.  This would have also increased the vaccination rate. While I’m told that my vaccination will protect me from hospitalization and death (though not sickness), can I really trust that based on the lack of information on breakthrough infections? 

I’m back to take-out and home entertainment."
2021-08-03 01:30:07,"It was clear back in May that when the CDC announced fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks, that this would be heard as ‘mission accomplished’ by the the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike.  Presumably this announcement was intended as an incentive for the latter to get vaxed. But why get jabbed for what many saw (and see) as a “hoax”?   I’ll give the CDC a B+ on the science, but, with sorrow, a D- on social psychology."
2021-08-03 01:31:45,"People are making this far too complicated. 

There are only two things that need to be done:

1.  Get everyone vaccinated
2. The disease only lasts about two to three weeks. If everyone practiced really strong social distancing for four to five weeks, this would be over. Look at New Zealand. 

Stop trying to finesse this."
2021-08-03 01:31:41,"I don’t have an advanced degree in epidemiology or medicine, but all the news & history of similar pandemics seemed to indicate that unmasking prematurely was a bad idea. I was vaccinated but still wore a mask, especially indoors, even though I was in a highly vaccinated area and even though others around me stared as if the pandemic didn’t happen. 

I don’t really understand why the CDC has made a series of blunders, even under the current administration. It appears to be related to trying to get “back to normal” for the “economy” as fast as possible… which appears to only be threatening more lives and causing more insecurity for us all.

While I know the Biden administration inherited this preventable mess, this CDC announcement in May was a serious mistake that may continue to haunt us… news reports are now talking about the next vaccine-resistant variant and employers and universities (hotbeds for substantial spread) are largely acting like we should be acting like everything’s normal. (No need to require masks! Everything’s fine here!)

We needed mandates yesterday. Hopefully, we still have a chance to see normalcy return in the months / year ahead if we institute something now. With all the politicizing and disinformation, the alternative seems catastrophic!"
2021-08-03 01:32:08,"'Whiplash'?  

And this is the nation that conducted to ultimately successful conclusions armed conflicts against tyrannies that spanned the globe? That sacrificed, bled and died through four years of daily, weekly and monthly uncertainties towards the goal of victory?

I use these military examples because of the (shameless) use of military metaphors throughout the course of the pandemic by the journalistic class. So compare the 'whiplash' of the experience of the Second World War to the 'whiplash' experience of the pandemic--and think about what it reveals about the nation."
2021-08-03 01:24:25,"Again classic case of the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing when it comes to the government and covid. Get vaccinated,no mask. Wait now vaccinated people can infect others. Now vaccinated must wear mask. Confusion, misinformation. They are sending mixed messages. The CDC should've never lifted the mask mandate. It should be mandatory for all. Period. Until infection rates drop below to a safe threshold. Keep in place what works.Dont keep changing the rules to suit the governments needs."

It’s that we could have been done with nonsense but for a block of overgrown babies that wont take the needle and inflict their bad choices on the rest of us. Joe Biden treated us like adults. 30% of this country acted like spoiled babies. And that’s saying something, because the kids have born the brunt of this pandemic.

2021-08-03 01:29:26,“Left Americans”? Well maybe some Americans but there are many of us who do not have the reaction you characterize. If scientists are having a challenging time understanding the virus then the rest of us need to understand that not all answers are simple
2021-08-03 01:29:02,"I sure wish more Americans had a decent science education. Let's recap: the virus is SARS-nCoV-2, a variant of the SARS family, which has been around quite a long time. It is flu-like, but not influenza. COVID-19 is a disease--a set of symptoms--caused by the virus. Just like HIV (the virus) causes AIDS (the disease), and poliovirus (the virus) causes poliomyelitis (the disease), coronavirus causes COVID-19.

The polio vaccine, which is a live virus but ""attenuated"" to eliminate a lot of the problems with the ""real"" virus, does three things: First, it exposes your immune system to the virus, so your system produces antibodies. Second, the ""fake"" virus programs your GI tract to not reproduce the poliovirus when--WHEN--you get infected with it. Third, it does not attack the nervous system.

ALL THAT SAID, the CDC and the NHS admit: It takes only one person infected with poliovirus to come to the US and start an outbreak. Why? Because the vaccine does not prevent you from getting sick. It only prevents extreme sickness.

Does this sound familiar? Of course it does. The Covid 19 vaccine prevents extreme sickness. Issue is, mRNA technology does not prevent the reproduction of the virus -- and the delta variant reproduces WAY faster than the original. And it certainly doesn't reduce transmission.

So yes, even if vaccinated, you need a mask. Unless you want to hear about the lambda, rho, and tau version six months from now."
2021-08-03 01:29:52,"STOP!

There is no ""ever-changing pandemic messaging"".

There is one message: GET VACCINATED."
2021-08-03 01:28:52,"Whiplash is an understatement. Our political leaders in both parties have NO CLUE as how to handle this.

To mask or not?  Stay tuned because in five minutes there will be another mandate.

Get the vaccination and do it right now.

What do you have to lose?   Only your life."
2021-08-03 01:31:51,"I’m concerned Obama’s birthday party is going to become a super spreader event for breakthrough infections - I hope they at least tweak their protocols for safety accordingly.

2021-08-03 01:29:53,"Articles like this don’t help. Very misleading, as if it’s the doctors and scientists fault. It’s a NOVELcoronavirus. “Novel” means “new”. Doctors and scientists are learning on the fly. The information given is fluid. Imagine where we’d be if they weren’t around? But instead, articles like this “lead the jury”, and everyone starts whining like they know more than the professionals."
2021-08-03 01:40:02,"Public health authorities are certainly not to blame for the fact that scientists keep learning more about the virus.  It is not surprising, as a general matter, that the advice would change.

But the CDC must accept blame, as the article points out, for some very bad decisions.  It was reckless to issue the May guidance, which in practice meant everyone could take their masks off in most public places, when scientists already knew about the delta variant and it was ripping through India.  It would have been far more sensible to wait to learn more about what that variant could do before easing up on masking in public.

In addition, the new CDC guidance is very confusing.  Are businesses and their customers really expected to consult maps every day to see whether their area is currently categorized as a ""high"" or ""substantial"" transmission area?  Businesses can't change their mask policies from day to day or even week to week.  And how are national chains supposed to implement this new guidance on a county by county basis?  The CDC should have acknowledged and rectified its earlier mistake in stating that vaccinated people could take off the masks.  It keeps punting the real decisions to people who aren't doctors or public health experts, and it's no wonder that so many of us are now confused about what we should or shouldn't be doing."
2021-08-03 01:35:41,"Thoughts and prayers to the unvaccinated. 

Now if you all excuse me, I'm ready to party."
2021-08-03 01:36:05,"I masked obsessively from late March 2020 through June 2021. I followed rules and guidelines and even went beyond what was recommended throughout the pandemic. I was fully vaccinated in June and took off my mask in public the first time thereafter. If the prospects of going back to mask mandates or restrictions fill me with anger, can you imagine how people who are anti-vax or never followed guidelines in the first place feel? They’re not going to follow anything the CDC or local officials say just like they haven’t all along. And if they don’t, what is the CDC and Biden Admin actually accomplishing? It seems mass vaccines are the only way to getting this under control. Either the Biden Admin figures out a way to get shots in every American’s arm or they lose this battle. Sorry, that’s the truth. I say that as Biden supporter."
2021-08-03 01:35:56,"It’s not complicated or confusing.

There is no whiplash.

It’s straightforward and simple.

If you got vaccinated you are fine to do anything you like as normal without a mask.  Even with the Delta variant of you got an mRNA vaccination breakthrough infections are extremely rare.  And even if you get one, going to the hospital with serious illness or dying is rarer even still.

You do a ton of things in your day that have a greater risk of death than Delta COVID if you, take a shower, drive a car, or cross the street.

It is quite simple.

Don’t slam those who acted responsibly for themselves and for others by social distancing and masking and getting vaccinated as soon as possible with restrictions that do nothing but protect the unvaccinated.

The unvaccinated have had plenty of time to get vaccinated and plenty of information to do so.  By now they have made an active choice to remain unvaccinated.  And they will likely because of that not abide by any restrictions put in place anyway.

Time to move on.  If the unvaccinated get Delta and get ill or die, they dug their own grave.

To stop the spread of further variants vaccination should be mandated and any group public activity should require proof of vaccination.

Otherwise let’s move on.  

No one should be confused and those who acted responsibly should no longer pay the price for those who continue not to."
2021-08-03 01:39:43,"The desire of many to wish away the pandemic and all its uncertainties has apparently caused some to blame the government for misinforming them. 

Testing isn’t perfect. The vaccine is not 100 per cent effective. The virus is not going away quietly. Confusion is a byproduct of an unpredictable, invisible, enemy. 

It’s our duty to educate ourselves. Anyone who blames government agencies for their confusion is not looking after their own health seriously enough."
2021-08-03 01:41:13,"I am mildly happy that I got vaccinated, both for my own safety, and for other people's safety.  But I really do not care what harm COVID-19 causes, any more.

My mayor (of Los Angeles) closed City Hall, the libraries, and the zoo to the public.  Yet he lets crowds pack Los Angeles International Airport for non-essential travel.  He shuts essential businesses, but he does not make his police department. enforce public health laws.

My public transit district asks us to socially distance, but it does not provide enough space on the buses for us to do so.  It orders us to wear face masks, but it does not force our fellow passengers to comply with that law.

My county board of supervisors closed restaurants.  Yet one elected supervisor was caught eating dinner at her favorite restaurant.

My state governor said to quarantine.   Yet he went to an expensive dinner party with lobbyists, whom he should not have been associating with in the first place.

President Trump ignored the COVID-19  pandemic.  President Biden is somewhat better, but he and Vice President Harris still engage in non-essential travel outside of the Washington area.  Both presidents should cut non-essential travel, and protect federal employees by  paying 3/4 of the air traffic controllers and airport security screeners to stay home.

Half of my fellow citizens disregard public safety by not getting vaccinated.  They also disregarded my right to vote by supporting the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6."
2021-08-03 01:37:47,"The course of science and scientific facts is never straight, and rarely black and white. There are often twists and turns before the facts are truly known, understood, and appreciated. The unfortunate fact is that these changes are happening in real-time in front of a large audience--often unsophisticated to the reality of science. A large portion of the media has acted irresponsibly. What we do know for sure is that Vaccination is the one solution we should trust, the rest is noise."
2021-08-03 01:38:09,"Well the virus has no qualms about spreading  and mutating , get vaccinated and wear a mask , if that's too difficult then you deal with the consequences , in the hospital or six feet under . pretty simple."

2021-08-03 01:52:25,I don’t understand the delay in the FDA approval of the vaccine? Why hasn’t this process been expedited? So many people say they have been waiting for the FDA final approval. If they had approved it a month ago- where would we be.
2021-08-03 01:39:35,"Social media, legitimate news media and the healthcare system need to have their messaging reflect the latest information but qualified that the pandemic, like the weather, can be well forecast only in the near term. We hate uncertainty, but nature is full of uncertainty."
2021-08-03 01:47:12,"Masks have been a way of life for me, for 18 months.  I didn't listen to any message to abandon them.  I got vaccinated as soon as I could and felt relief then.

Please get over the confusion.  Masks indoors and outdoors in a crowd.  Enjoy times with vaccinated friends fully."
2021-08-03 01:47:44,"The facts seem to now be, everyone, no matter if you are vaccinated or not, can get and transmit the delta variant of COVID.   Masking mitigates this; the vaccine apparently does not.  However, the vaccine mitigates the symptoms by rendering the virus to a less lethal state, at this variant.   A booster will most likely be needed to continue this state.  So, it is a continuum that needs maintenance.   Not a convenient state for news or spin cycles, in fact our media and political cultures have few tools to address this state--that seems to be the crisis here.  For now.  We need to take advantage of the time we have to move as fast as possible.  The culture needs to catch up to the science, continuously.

Finally, breakthrough cases do not seem rare, and in any case, the CDC undermined itself by not tracking them, so rare actually means rarely reported, so it would be refreshing to clear that up, rather than insist on something for which they have no compelling evidence outside of that which proves otherwise, as the Provincetown and U.C.S.F. outbreaks seem to make clear."
2021-08-03 01:48:03,"We know two things: 1. Vaccinations reduce hospitalizations.  2. While the virus is present and mutating, wearing a mask reduces the chance of infection (for yourself and others). 

For those who refuse to do either, good luck... You'll need it."
2021-08-03 01:49:52,"The issue isn’t an evolving virus, but driven by human behavior. Political leaders want to remove containment measures as soon as possible, just as their constituents do, but the right answer is to follow the science and keep up the containment measures until success has been actually achieved rather than wishful thinking. Weak leadership is the real culprit."
2021-08-03 01:51:27,"It’s only whiplash if you don’t understand science, observation, and the fluidity of viral mutation and human evolution. 

It’s whiplash if you’re just reacting and not being an active, participatory advocate for your own health and that of your family.

It’s whiplash if you let politics get between you and your health and well-being.

It’s not whiplash if you continue to take the science seriously; I see it this way: I wear sunscreen and a hat in a sunny day. Why not have a vaccine and a mask until Covid is over?"
2021-08-03 01:55:22,"I don’t understand why scientists and the media don’t address the lie that the vaccine development  was rushed, when in fact it has been ten years in the making due to a similar virus years ago that petered out. That should be stressed at every opportunity with those who are hesitant."
2021-08-03 01:47:00,"Once in a century health crisis. What I'm ""exhausted"" with is people complaining about the inconveniences of wearing masks etc.  They feel entitled to the ""normal"" last seen in 2019.

(Like 2019 was such a great year)

Dating myself but my parents manned and womaned up through the Depression and WWII without bellyaching why it was taking so long and when could they get back to the""normal"" of the 1920s.  

This is our war, our proving ground.  Less bloody and probably far shorter than a world war.  Stick it out, whatever it takes."
2021-08-03 01:44:55,"SF Bay Area RN here, feeling like I'm re-reading a chapter of a bad novel.  I was in a big box store on Saturday in the worst hit of the Bay counties (Contra Costa - 75% fully vaccinated) and more than half the shoppers were without masks and employees were giving out food samples!!! Our hospitalization rate is up almost 70% for Covid in the past 2 weeks, and our patients are younger.  I am petrified I'll get a case with minimal, or no symptoms - and kill some of these folks that still haven't been vaccinated."
2021-08-03 01:43:28,"I stopped taking what the CDC was saying as “advice” from way back at the start when they told the public that there was no need for the public to wear a mask. Supposedly, it was to insure that there were enough masks for first responders. Of course, first responders needed them but it wasn’t right to fool,the public into thinking they didn’t need to cover their faces. I happened to have boxes of masks & gloves I use for home improvement purposes and I started wearing them when there were only 3 reported cases in our state. People looked at me like I was a freak. I’m fully vaccinated but have never stopped wearing my mask inside crowded stores. I haven’t eaten in a restaurant yet. I trust nothing when it comes to this virus. I trusted my own gut from the beginning and I never got sick. I intend to keep doing so for as long as I must."
2021-08-03 01:54:04,"Politicians need to level with us, now.

Is the plan to put the lives of the majority on hold indefinitely to avoid an elevated death rate over the medium-term?

If so, the public needs the facts, so they can decide if that's a price worth paying for reduced risk.

Two weeks, four weeks, then a year, now two - most were happy to do their part.

But, three, four, five years of this? People in their prime having their lives put on ice to protect the very old, very sick, and obese?

I'll happily take my chances instead - with mine and your health. 

And I'd vote for a politician that offered that."
2021-08-03 01:48:40,"Initially Biden said we expected to be normal by Christmas then changed to July 4th to CDC's drop mask in May. What were they thinking?

Nobody seems to care about the society."

Without that campaign, the ""confusion"" the article describes simply would not exist.

Bad faith right-wing disinformation campaigns depend on falsely ""neutral"" reportage such as this to succeed.  It has been so at least since Nixon.  And alas for the country, there appears to be no sign of it changing."
2021-08-03 01:46:27,"Pandemic fatigue… YES! But what really fatigues me to no end is the whack-a-mole, putting-out-fires, helter-skelter behavior of our childish citizenry, who just can’t get over themselves enough to wear a mask, wash hands frequently, make space between themselves and others, and get two simple painless shots. We just need to be of one focused and determined mind on this or it’s just an endless cycle. This virus, in all its mutations and adaptations it’s making in trying to kill us, doesn’t care about our personal freedoms and individualistic liberties. Nor should we in fighting it."
2021-08-03 01:51:14,"I got vaccinated therefore wearing a mask really is for others' protection. But these others don't deserve my protection and my inconveniencing myself because they are willfully prolonging this by refusing to vaccinate.

Why should I inconvenience myself by wearing a mask to protect some low-wattage recalcitrant who is endangering society?  If I infect that person, and the person dies, I am going to be blunt:  Given the circumstances I couldn't care less."
2021-08-03 01:53:35,Please everyone just use some common sense! The virus is not going away any time soon. Get yourself vaccinated. If my 95 year old father can get vaccinated and wear a mask so can you!

2021-08-03 01:42:17,"What I don't get is how people refuse to understand that this thing has been a moving target since day one.  Why get so flipped out because guidance changes?  So what?  Just try to keep up and keep informed!
Then you throw in the half of the country who are whacko, and what more do any of you expect than all this very fluid, ever-changing situation?
Vaccinate and masks on.  Period.  It's just not over, even though we hoped for it.  Get on with it."
2021-08-03 01:49:44,"I have real contempt for the aggressively-ignorant and selfishly, willfully unvaccinated. The propagation of the delta variant and continued mutations of the virus, and the consequent stress on health care workers and drag on the economy, are primarily on them. 

It would be just if the only people who suffered were the selfish anti-vax nuts, but given that ideal won’t ever happen, we should do everything ethical and legal to raise vaccination rates as quickly as possible to protect the vulnerable and to help everyone — even those who don’t deserve it."

Nor will I ever enter a red state again. 

I'm really into self-preservation. 

And I mean REALLY."
2021-08-03 02:03:17,"I wrote to the White House in May to ask why the CDC would relax its masking policy, as any idiot would know that it would result in the unvaccinated taking off their masks.  I received no reply, and we are now back in a surge. What has become clear to me is that Dr. Wlaensky should be removed as director of the CDC and replaced with somebody with more basic common sense. First we get Dr. Birx and now Walensky. Is this the best that we've got?"

2021-08-03 02:12:17,"I do not understand people saying they don't know what to do. Get vaccinated as soon as you can. Wear a mask. Keep a physical distance from others as much as you can. If we would all ACTUALLY DO THIS, to the extent we possibly can, this would end, and it would end soon. This has been the message since April 2020 and not one bit of it has changed.

I'm starting to wish the media would drop this theme of Americans being so helpless and confused. To anyone paying attention, what needs to be done has been extremely clear for many months, and hasn't changed. The media's always got to find some new angle, but unfortunately this is actually old, boring news. We'll go on this way, endlessly imposing and then lifting restrictions and then -duh!! - imposing them again when cases and deaths soar once again, until we either buckle down and actually FOLLOW the clear and simple public health advice, or until the virus kills millions more and is finally done with us.

I don't feel ""whiplashed."" Stop inventing drama, don't we have plenty of drama already? I feel sad and sorry and weary."
2021-08-03 02:07:21,"""Whiplash?"" Oh please. How about ""I told you so,"" instead? 

No one in my immediate circle is at all surprised by any of this. It is playing out exactly as expected (and we've all kept masking in public while we waited for the shoe to drop).

Apparently officials at the CDC have never met any members of the general public if they truly thought a lot of people would do anything but think only of themselves and their own perceived inconvenience. And of course one political party did everything in their power to egg on the irresponsibility.

The cattle stampedes to jam planes , vacation destinations and restaurants has been incredibly bizarre, but not the least bit surprising. You can't just flip a switch and have a pandemic stop on a dime. It was always, always going to gleefully seek out new hosts while too many ignored vaccination and safeguards. Because of them, here we are again - not startled, not shocked, just fatigued. Very, very fatigued."
2021-08-03 02:09:51,"It’s called science, microbiology, virology, medicine and many others. As you receive new information about a problem, you understand more and can make better decisions.

2021-08-03 02:03:35,"The government erred in not shutting the border immediately for anyone coming in from India.  Instead, it waited a week even though the concerns over Delta were known.

Then Walensky does an abrupt, ""Off with the masks!"" making it seem like the pandemic was over.  Everyone is ready to party.

These two actions are why we are where we are right now.

Finally, is it really such a big deal to wear a mask in public?  Many societies do this out of respect for one another.  Maybe that's something we could try in the US."
2021-08-03 01:57:35,"The advice to vaccinated people, who if they get covid won't be severely impacted, to wear a mask is intended to minimize the risk of them transmitting the virus to unvaccinated people who will be seriously impacted and possibly die.

2021-08-03 02:05:50,"Nope. No whiplash for this Thinking American, NYT.  Just profound empathy for the health officials struggling to crush a wily virus in the face of massive organized sabotage by those they strive to protect.

2021-08-03 01:58:45,"In regards to Pres. Biden continuing Trump immigration policies in regards to covid and vaccinations. Those who disagree with the policy in Congress, they need to step up and start seeking and initializing immigration policy reforms not only in our general immigration laws now on the books, but also how we handle this pandemic and future ones today in regards to immigrants/immigration issues. 

We need immigration policy reform and laws and enacted before 2022 elections. We have had enough time...take a political risk and do so.

And stop blaming the unvaccinated for this outbreak. They are not the cause. Thinking it was the 4th of July, because Memorial Day, we were still kind of locked down. But on Labor Day we'll all be masked, either vaccinated/tested more than frequently, or given the mandated booster shot, and still not in the offices, but the blue collar workers will be in the plants serving your needs everyday. Come Indigenous Day in October...the ventilation systems in schools/day care centers and your children's health and the beginnings of the new flu season will be to blame.  Doesn't this sound like a broken record?  

Open up America, and never lock down again. Show us where there has been a reopening and not a increase in cases/deaths/ variants.

So please it's a pandemic not a US endemic. 

Don't you feel we should be helping each other thru it instead of how we are working and have been working the program thus far? It's working this way isn't it? NO?!!!"

My seething anger is directed at them, not the CDC."
2021-08-03 02:11:20,"In all the messaging there is one clear cut sure fire way to end this. Stop the lines of transmission by whatever means possible.

2021-08-03 02:01:26,"I don’t think many have caught up with the news today.  We could only hope that Delta circulates, Lambda is just starting.  Vaccines will not cover Lambda.  A mask without a seal is worthless if indoors."

2021-08-03 02:35:36,"It’s clear that guidance on masking and distancing should have been lifted only AFTER vaccination levels hit critical marks like 70%, not before. I don’t understand the logic that telling the vaccinated they could stop masking would work by “incentivizing” vaccination. Everything we know about human behavior tells us that it’s the unvaccinated who would take this as permission to do the same without getting the shot. It was totally predictable, and now delta is ravaging the country."

It took an outside study after a super spreader event in Providence, Rhode Island to show the obvious- there are many undocumented asymptomatic or mild breakthrough cases- intentionally undocumented. In July, the CDC and Biden administration blundered by de facto ending masking for both vaccinated and unvaccinated- they share major responsibility for the current spike."
2021-08-03 02:14:36,"As a middle school teacher and parent of three young children -- my patience for the willfully unvaccinated has gone from thin to non-existent. We will now begin another school year with masks on ... an exhausting prospect for teachers (I can tell you all about it) and students.

2021-08-03 02:17:46,"The confusion on the Coronavirus started during the Trump administration and continues to this day. 

Too many uneducated people have not been vaccinated. In addition, there are a large part of the population who think they are making a political statement by not getting vaccinated. 

So the coronavirus is back and expanding in those areas with low vaccination rates. I’m not surprised. 

There was so much misinformation last year and inconsistent information this year it is no wonder people are fatigued and frustrated when comes to how to remain safe and healthy.

Guidelines are useless.  Safety measures need to be made mandatory. 

Putting up signs at store entrances stating that no mask is required if you are vaccinated are useless.  I don’t trust the unvaccinated in our country to act in a civil manner that is respectful of everyone in our country. 

The only way to wipeout the coronavirus in our country is to make vaccinations mandatory (with medical exceptions as needed), and make masks, social distancing, etc required at all public places."

I’m double vaxxed with Pfizer and now I’m back to wearing a face mask when I go somewhere inside. I’ll probably get a test for the Delta since I’ve been suffering with sinus problems lately.

His leadership, or lack thereof, is going to cost  the democrats the mid terms and millions of people around the world their lives. Biden needs to create strong mandates with real consequences to get this country vaccinated. That would be real leadership, sending Jill to the Olympics with a mask on doesn't cut it."
2021-08-03 02:51:48,"Some great comments here, thanks All.  

Time for us in the developed world to wake up.

The virus found a good host in populations of bats which flourished in expanded habitats as a result of climate change. Climate change is indisputably a result of developed human societies burning fossil fuels. 

The virus jumped species as a result of human markets and the need for some to resort to eating bush meat.

Then it found a world where structural inequalities meant that it could ￼infect human hosts with impunity in areas where there are mass populations and few resources to limit its spread.  One after another.  

Because some refused to heed science and common sense, the virus now has fertile ground to refine itself and become resistant to vaccines.  Never mind the delta variant…fear the gamma variant! 

Meanwhile, climate change marches on as we are late to mitigate disasters on many fronts.  Babies born now will struggle for survival to old age in a very different world.

Instead of whining, we need to see the pandemic as good preparation for the ensuing decades.  You ain’t seen nothing yet!"

We will reach herd immunity one way or another. Either people contribute with by getting vaxxed getting COVID-19."
2021-08-03 02:19:21,"Though this sounds selfish, at this point my focus turns to the booster.  Israel gives boosters to all over 60.  I have done all that I can to follow directives and continue to do so.  I will be furious if decisions regarding  the need for and efficacy of boosters in USA are held up because they might provide an additional disincentive for vaccinations among the hesitant.  

In the meantime, please get your vaccinations and mask, etc.  The sooner we work together around prevention the better it will be for all.  I don't think answering questions regarding possible break throughs, needed to swamp the essential message that we should all get the vaccine.  Not so much a transmission (pun intentional) as a reception problem, albeit one that has been subject to partisan manipulation."
2021-08-03 02:55:30,"I teach advanced math and probabilities. Mathematically, the more people who get COVID, the greater the opportunity for the COVID virus to morph into another variant. With enough opportunity, it is entirely possible COVID will morph into a variant the drug companies can't fix.

It is understood that the people who refuse vaccines are endangering themselves & everyone around them. But, more significantly, they are also improving the odds that a variant will emerge the vaccine cannot mitigate. Logically, a national vaccination mandate should be ordered. 

IMHO, Trump should be prosecuted for his malfeasance because this disaster could have, and should have, been nipped in the bud."
2021-08-03 02:13:59,"We are still in a Worldwide Pandemic. Just because Americans want it to be over so they can go back to ""their regular lives"" doesn't mean the actual deadly, mutating, Coronavirus will comply. I cannot believe how much coddling is involved to get people to do what is in their and the World's best interest. This isn't a game. It is real life. A life we created because warnings were ignored. Folks need to be ready for the ""whiplash"" of their new normal, especially, if they can't follow rules dictated by science.

Meanwhile, the majority of the world would love to have access to our relatively stable economy, government, healthcare systems and above all plentiful first rate vaccines. The whining just needs to stop."

2021-08-03 02:50:08,"I don't understand why people keep condemning the unvaccinated. This virus is being carried by vaccinated & unvaccinated. If you get the shots it seems you are unlikely to get very sick. But everyday now I read about some notable person, athlete, politician, who has the virus even though they were vaccinated. . I am not advocating not getting the shots. All I am saying is the virus is spreading anyway. Plus take into account the billions around the world in poor countries that can't even get the vaccination. .. 

It may be we just have to live with this. I hope not but ..The best thing really is to eat good & keep your immune system strong. It sounds weird but I stay away from people  that make me uncomfortable. But I did that anyway .. If I go inside anywhere now I wear a mask, esp if it is crowded. I want to go to bars to hear & play music but I still am very hesitant to do that. I honestly don't think the people in power know what to do."
2021-08-03 02:53:58,"Why are we still making vaccines targeting the viruse that is almost nonexistent?  Why are we even discussing a potential 3rd dose targeting that variant?  We should be producing vaccines targeting the delta variant, distribute and put it into the willing arms asap! The mRNA technology is supposed to enable us to the stay with the curve if not ahead the curve.  We need to rethink about everything here."

2021-08-03 02:54:49,"Just found out that my employer will require masks for all employees starting tomorrow. It’s infuriating, because it removes one of the biggest incentives for getting vaccinated and punishes the responsible people for the actions of the irresponsible ones.

And let’s remember that people who are unvaccinated by choice aren’t exactly the ones doing their part in terms of mask-wearing."
2021-08-03 03:01:15,"How could anyone be confused or upset by this uptick in cases? It was entirely predictable and the nation was warned to expect it. What did people expect with so many unvaccinated? Of course we would have a second wave. There will probably be a third wave after this, and maybe even more as long as people resist vaccination. It's not public health specialists or the government who have fallen short, or who should be held accountable. No one is to blame for this but the American citizens who refuse to protect themselves and stubbornly refuse to accept that Covid is a deadly virus."

2021-08-03 03:19:34,"What I would have liked to see from the CDC in May, and still would like to see, are mask mandates tied to local vaccination and infection rates. Infection rates going up? Time to put masks back on. Want to get them off? Get vaccinated.

Even with the Delta variant circulating, if everyone were vaccinated, transmission rates would be low enough that soon, we could suppress new outbreaks by contact tracing and quarantining -- as we should have done from the beginning."
2021-08-03 03:00:28,The damage done by Trump’s months of lies snd denial is incalculable. Science and reason made a comeback under Biden but then the Delta variant afflicted the US with unpredictable results. What do Americans expect? The virus doesn’t care what we think about it. If the only thing we can do to fight this disease is lessen the severity of sickness through vaccination. This is now obvious to the majority of adult Americans.
2021-08-03 03:00:55,"Hard get it right in this evolving awful event. Easy to cast blame.  

I suspect all along less strict mask and gathering mandates are a result of having to walk a tightrope with so many refusing to get a vaccine or wear a mask. The many who refuse have been treated for a long time with deference in hopes of swaying their opinions. 

I don’t suspect how so many came by their opinions."

2021-08-03 03:10:22,"How did Biden even appoint a head of the CDC who has no prior experience in government? It is the President's responsibility to the people of the US to appoint the most qualified people to every position for the good of the country, absolutely without respect to color or gender.  The job is hard enough even if the most qualified people were appointed. With hundreds of millions of shots already given globally and government officials using vaccination without reservations, how can it be at the same time that the Federal FDA has not even approved of any Covid 19 vaccines on a regular basis. Not on an emergency basis. One reasons vaccinations are so low is the very mixed messages from the Federal government."
2021-08-03 03:15:58,"Living in a naturally recurring retirement community (some 90% of our residents are over 60 and even more, with few exceptions, are vaccinated), I am not aware of any ""breakthrough"" infections. But most of us mask when we leave the community for the grocery store or for a big-box store. And we can dine outdoors when we go out.

All that said, I wish the US would start offering (as Israel has) a third shot to senior citizens. We have the doses at our local pharmacy. An appointment and a booster would give added protection.

In that sense, the CDC always seems very stodgy. Doses of vaccine are expiring, tens of thousands of them. Why not place them where they might do some good, rather than throwing them out?"

The way the scientific method works is you make the best recommendation based on the data you have.  You keep getting data.  You revise your recommendations based on the data.  OUR PROBLEM IS NOT CHANGING RECOMMENDATIONS.  OUR PROBLEM IS WE HAD A PREVIOUS PRESIDENT WHO MADE FUN OF THE VIRUS/DIDN'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY BECAUSE HE FEARED IT WOULD HURT HIS ELECTION.  OUR PROBLEM IS THOSE WHO FOLLOW TRUMP'S LEAD.  Here's one recommendation that will not change - get the vaccine.  When enough people are vaccinated, our lives can return to some semblance of normalcy.  Until enough people get vaccinated, you can expect changes in recommendations based on the data we get in.  It's called SCIENCE, and this science has to deal with an ever evolving/improving virus and people who are anti-science."
2021-08-03 03:17:16,Vaccines are here to prevent infections and deaths. I think the CDC made a big mistake by telling people that they should take a vaccine to avoid wearing masks.I still see no problem with taking a vaccine and wearing a mask when needed. It is simply the responsible thing to do.
2021-08-03 04:08:30,"100% of the focus, effort and resources should be dedicated to getting people vaccinated asap.  

That is a simple, straightforward message — and does not require the CDC to leak slides and prevents them from making conflicting statements  and engaging in fear-mongering by citing data without any context. 

Stick to the most important task  — get people vaccinated."

Clearly we are unable to change our culture and I wonder where we go from here."
2021-08-03 04:02:48,"It was readily apparent that Biden’s ‘Declaration of Independence from Covid’ in July was equivalent to Bush’s Mission Accomplished on the aircraft carrier. The assumption seemed to be that Covid was on the way out, when it plainly wasn’t.

The Delta variant is different. It has caused a large increase in cases in the UK but with much lower rates of hospitalisation and death compared to previous waves due to vaccination. Unfortunately the US has lower levels of vaccination in the most vulnerable groups of people. This August is going to be rough."
2021-08-03 04:00:11,"4 months ago, Rand Paul told Anthony Fauci in a Senate hearing that he thought Fauci was engaging in some shameful sort of ""theatre"" by continuing to wear masks in public even though he was fully vaccinated.  Paul lambasted Fauci for doing something the science (or at least the only science Paul cared to be aware of) said there was no need for Fauci to be doing.  Fauci said that continued mask wearing made sense given the emergence of new variants that were more contagious and against which the vaccines were somewhat less effective.  Paul was not interested in listening.  He insisted that if Fauci wanted people to get vaccinated, he needed to offer them the incentive of not having to wear masks (because the incentive of not dying of Covid isn't good enough, apparently).   

One cannot help but think Fauci and the CDC made the truly terrible mistake of listening to Rand Paul - something no one should ever do.  During a pandemic, wearing a mask is just basic common courtesy and basic human decency, regardless of whether one is vaccinated or not.  Unfortunately, we now live in a country where such courtesy and decency apparently exceeds the capacity of a very significant portion of the population."
2021-08-03 04:02:35,"I’m an American living in Tokyo. When the CDC and Biden admin announced that vaccinated people can go maskless indoors and mingle with unvaccinated people, medical doctors on television here were perplexed. They said that vaccination is mostly to protect oneself but when mingling with the unvaccinated, viral spread is still possible. And this was before delta. They pondered that this messaging was to incentivize vaccination and said it was not consistent with medical understanding of vaccinations. 

This recent incident reminds me of when Fauci (no disrespect) initially told Americans not to wear masks. What was actually going on was that he knew they were effective but he lied to us in order to preserve the mask supply for nurses and doctors. In hindsight what he should have done was to encourage homemade masks. 

Oh, and the whole “lab leak theory” was guardedly denied but now it’s a distinct possibility. 

I understand the sentiment of this article. Clearly, the CDC and government public health officials are very comfortable with being untruthful to the public as long as they can justify the ends. However, now distrust towards them is at an all time high, and they are not blameless. If they had been straight to the public from the onset and didn’t try to strategically manipulate the truthfulness of their messaging, perhaps they would be a better counterweight to the barrage of conspiracy theories out there. They should have been straight with us from the very beginning."
2021-08-03 03:36:00,"Giiving cash or other rewards to vaccine holdouts to induce them to get vaccinated sends the wrong message.    It tells people that the longer you refuse responsible behavior, the better  your reward will be.

Instead, some of the unspent COVID funds should be used to provide bonuses to people who are inoculated, and therefore responsible to themselves and their fellow citizens.   It could be called a ""health care cost dividend"" representing money saved to society by choosing inoculation.

And leave those who choose to refuse vaccination without any share of the spoils."
2021-08-03 03:56:33,"This is not rocket science folks--if you don't vaccinate, wear a mask, and social distance, you let the virus win because all the virus wants to do is replicate, even mutate to make this possible. Why is this so hard to understand?"
2021-08-03 04:25:04,"When the numbers cratered and the warm weather arrived in early summer many thought the worst was over. That was before science had a true grasp of the Delta variant. 

We never relaxed our masking indoors and have reverted back to take out. 

We see the numbers now and changed course without anyone telling us to do so."
2021-08-03 04:25:16,"I didn't get vaccinated so I could stop wearing a mask. I got vaccinated to lower my chances of dying from Covid-19 and to help stop the spread of the virus. So the reversal on mask-wearing is not frustrating to me. I understand we have to change tactics as the reality on the ground changes.

Instead of complaining about uncertainty  and the changing realities we face, we should be grateful to all the scientists who devote themselves to assessing the situation while admitting their   inability to always get things right the first time. We have come a long way in developing vaccines and finding ways to treat the disease. To get even further we should offer our support and quit putting down those who are only trying their best to learn what it is we are facing."
2021-08-03 02:20:06,"The scientists have said all along that, if people don't get vaccinated, the virus will mutate and spread. And somehow people are shocked that that actually happened? The problem is those who foolishly refuse to get vaccinated, NOT the scientists. 

The headline of this article is a problem as well as it perpetuates the idea that things have changed. They haven't, except in exactly the ways that the scientists said they would."
2021-08-03 02:37:21,"While I a big fan of Ms. Psaki, there no data behind “cases like Lindsey Graham’s being exceedingly rare.”   The CDC stopped tracking breakthrough infections so we do not know this.   I know of someone who was vaccinated in April, and he has severe covid.   We are so afraid for him.   The EMTs came to his home and basically said they get diverted so there is no hospital bed for him (MN).   How many people like me know someone like that?  We don’t know.   And we should.    It is time to treat policy on covid vaccination and masking in public like we treat policy on smoking in public and other vaccinations.  We do not allow people to smoke indoors in public because we know it harms the public.   We do not allow health care workers to opt out of flu vaccines because it harms others.   We do not allow children to opt out of measles vaccine and go to school, because it harms others.   Stop letting these masses of people harm those who got the vaccine and are masking.   And don’t let them harm our kids under 12.  

Lead.  Plain and simple.   Just lead.  And thank you to public health officials who are trying despite threats."
2021-08-03 03:04:49,"""It's as contagious as chickenpox"" is as clear as mud.
With an MD and MPH in Epidemiology, I wondered well, how contagious is chickenpox? With 91% of children vaccinated, we hardly think of chickenpox any more. 

It was NYT 2 days ago that printed a graph showing a person with chickenpox can pass it onto 8 people (estimating the distance between marks 5 and 10 where chickenpox was plotted). The term for the average number of people an infected person can pass an infection to is called R naught (Ro). To get a sense of Ro=8, you need to know the original SARS CoV2 was thought to have Ro of 1.5 to 3. So do the arithmetic of working out several passes of these different Ro numbers and you'll know how bad this Delta is. I wrote the calculations in my local nextdoor, in response to a person asking why we're masking again. Several people said my posting clarified their understanding. 

In the initial wave of Covid 19, JAMA and Lancet praised Taiwan's response. It was noted their VP at the time was a renown virologist/epidemiologist. That he gave daily updates on the pandemic, including all the bad news was seen as effective in building trust in the nation's public health response. I wish our CDC would speak to us as intelligent adults (even if we aren't) and give frequent briefings. What was right yesterday may be wrong tomorrow. Patients follow medical advise better if they understand, so I pitch my explanations to whatever level the patient is at. It's not so hard to do that."
2021-08-03 04:37:52,"My wife and I never stopped wearing our masks indoors, in stores and other public venues.  We're both vaccinated but not taking chances with a constantly mutating novel virus that scientists still find to be anything but predictable."
2021-08-03 04:16:10,"On saying that the vaccinated didn't need to wear masks: “That was scientifically correct from a virology standpoint,” Dr. del Rio said of the earlier recommendation. “It was wrong from a behavioral science standpoint.”

I was disheartened when the CDC said that.

Those words completely reversed the message that the CDC had been giving, that each of us wore masks to protect those around us. Saying that only the unvaccinated needed to wear masks implied the CDC now believed that wearing a mask protected the wearer - a complete disconnect."
2021-08-03 04:17:49,"Breakthrough infections don’t seem all that rare. In Provincetown, 75% of those infected were vaccinated. In the hospital in SF, 75% of the people who tested positive in that outbreak were also vaccinated. I personally know a bunch of people who were vaccinated but caught delta at a conference. Clearly the CDC messed up in easing up on masks last month. It looks like the only way we’ll beat this is vaccines AND masks. Given that fall will soon be upon us, I really hope we don’t have additional waves of this pandemic."

2021-08-03 04:35:37,"It’s very simple. Get the shots, and use a mask in public places. Avoid high-risk venues such as bars, restaurants and house parties if possible. Those steps offer the best odds.

All of us face likelihood of a bout at some point as this agent moves through society without much regard for efforts to stop it. But vaccination reduces the probability of hospitalization or death even if hit, and the vaccinated have better chances to escape the virus, or to dodge it long enough to see new treatments become available. Mask use and minimizing potential exposure augments the defenses vaccines provide. It’s like having antitank barriers in addition to your antitank gun. Who wants to go to war without all the weapons in their arsenal?"
2021-08-03 04:40:28,"It's really not that hard to understand the messaging switch. When officials lifted the mask mandate, they predicted more people would be getting the vaccine, at a faster rate than they ended up doing so, and Delta didn't loom as largely as it does now. 
The problem is, not enough people continued getting vaccinated, and without a mask mandate even the unvaccinated quickly doffed them. I clearly remember the first time I walked into a store without one, and not knowing who among the shoppers around me was vaccinated like myself, but also not feeling overly concerned because I felt protected and, more importantly, that I wasn't a danger to others. How wrong I was. (And yeah--I'm back to masking.)
What the article doesn't--and should--state is that if more people had been vaccinated sooner, the virus would have stood less of a chance of mutating into something more dangerous. That what IS hard to understand: We knew viruses, when given enough hosts, will mutate--so why didn't we, collectively, do something about it? It's really sad. More will die, unnecessarily. THAT is the message: More vaccination, less mutation."

2021-08-03 05:03:31,"Here’s a a question I keep trying to answer. 

Given the populations of vaccinated and not, given that the Delta variant is twice as transmissible and also more likely to cause sickness, how do you get to a 7-day rolling average of cases and deaths that are now as high as the last third wave ?

I don’t mean to suggest that the vaccines don’t significantly lessen serious illness and deaths. But I am confounded as to the current levels we’re experiencing. It’s disconcerting…are there other reasons we either don’t know or is this virus a constantly moving target ?

Whatever…get vaccinated, mask up and be careful and considerate that your actions impact so many others."
2021-08-03 05:06:06,"I'll say what Democratic officials haven't dared to say explicitly: that this 4th wave featuring the delta variant is a crisis that was man-made and avoidable. Three main morally reprehensible blunders have jointly contributed to the delta variant gaining a foothold (and quite possibly leading to the proliferation of new variants that will elude our vaccines): 1. Trump's trivializing, politicization, and horrible mismanagement of the pandemic, 2. Americans' selfishly turning their nose up at the vaccines in large numbers, and 3. Biden's failure to push hard for waiving vaccine patents so developing nations could vaccinate their populations in a timely fashion. What we are witnessing now is a case of the chickens coming home to roost."
2021-08-03 05:16:08,"The CDC needs to find someone who understands Piaget’s stages of cognitive development to better tailor the message to the typical unvaccinated American. In the CDC’s defense, it is hard to communicate scientific data to people who can’t think abstractly. 

As a teacher in the Deep South, I can tell you that some adults never transition out of the concrete operational stage of cognitive development. These are the people most confused by the CDC’s messaging. A child will usually transition to formal/abstract operational thinking by age 12, but when reading deficiencies exist, or when science instruction is lacking (not being taught the scientific method and how to test hypotheses), being stuck in the concrete stage for the rest of his life is typical. 

So, you have to present concrete facts to adults in this stage of development, facts that require little to no interpretation. Imagine that you’re speaking to a class of third graders. No older than 5th grade. There’s a reason that Jeff Foxworthy show was called Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? — that’s when the human brain usually grows the ability to entertain abstract thinking. 

In the concrete cognitive stage, a person can see things from different points of view and imagine events that occur outside his own life. But, he will still have trouble with hypotheticals. When the CDC didn’t explain the purpose of urging masks once again, people who can’t think abstractly genuinely didn’t understand what was going on."
2021-08-03 05:32:04,"It is well established that the unvaccinated are a diverse crowd. As for those who downplay precautions, they are the same crowd that always opposes government intrusion into their private lives. And it’s not about privilege. It’s about opposition to rules and regulations and faceless bureaucrats telling them what to do. 

Privilege is all about claims of superiority. Those hostile to the government are motivated by an entirely different sentiment. It comes down to the most simple of values. 

“Leave me alone.”"
2021-08-03 05:36:20,"“the thing that hasn’t changed is that masks do work and they protect you.""

The last part of this statement is a little misleading. The masks most Americans are wearing (i.e. non N95) do not protect the wearer, they protect *others* from the wearer when the wearer might be infectious.

The biggest issue with not wearing a mask isn't that the non-wearer is more at risk of getting sick, it's that the non-wearer puts everyone else more at risk of getting sick. Everyone is a potential ""typhoid Mary"".

IF we had rapid, cheap, COVID tests and knew who was infectious, then we wouldn't need universal masking as much. I really think ""spit on a stick"" tests would be more helpful; but no one seems to be talking about those any more."

And as far as 'inconsistent messages,' blame them on Republican leadership that has been doing its utmost to muddy the message. And blame the crowd that refuses to get vaccinated for no sane reason. And finally blame the crowd that seems to consider wearing masks as being equivalent to living under a North Korean dictatorship."

2021-08-03 05:47:58,"One of the challenges for public officials like President Biden is that on the one hand they have the responsibility to confront the pandemic, while on the other they must try to ensure that they survive politically.

2021-08-03 05:30:41,"I'm a physician and this is how I explain the Covid situation in America to my patients: There are 165 million people fully vaccinated in the United States. There have been 125,000 breakthrough cases, most asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, and 1000 of those people died from Covid. This is almost statistical zero. So, get vaccinated and go live your life. The pandemic is over for the vaccinated. That doesn't mean you may not get a positive test one day or mild to moderate symptoms. But the odds of hospitalization and death are vanishingly low. As for the unvaccinated, they fall into 1 of 3 categories: 1) Healthy kids under 12, who will likely not even get asymptomatic disease, and if they do have symptoms, they will almost certainly resolve rapidly (of course there are exceptions but don't mistake anecdotes for data); 2) The severely immunocompromised such as chemo patients or those rare people who can't get vaccinated at all due to an allergy to a vaccine ingredient. They should wear masks and distance, especially in areas of low vaccination: 3) Those who choose not to get vaccinated. They are playing Russian Roulette. I wish them ill health and pain because they are putting group 2 at risk. But the bottom line for most people is to get fully vaccinated, preferably with 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine, wait 2 weeks, and live like it's 2019. Living any other way is just hysteria and is as antiscience as the Covid deniers."

We have vaccination, we just hit 70%, it’s time to get the heck on with life. Being unvaccinated carries high risk, so get vaccinated.

2021-08-03 04:21:52,"President Biden needs to make a prime time Oval Office address. It would have to be as simple as possible while still conveying key facts.

Possible topics include: 

—discussing that there has been a change in circumstances (the Delta variant) not a ‘change in the science’;

—  the increase in chances that the virus will continue to mutate as long as it has infected individuals in which to grow and mutate (maybe not using those terms);

— the best way to prevent this, as well as not become seriously ill from COVID, including the Delta variant, is to get vaccinated;

—- President Trump himself initiated ‘Operation Warp Speed” to accelerate the development of the vaccines and has been vaccinated along with numerous other Republicans, and; 

— refuting a few of the bogus arguments against vaccination (such as it is ‘new” so we don’t know the long-term effects — well all newly introduced medications are, surprisingly, new! And patients almost always prefer them!). 

That list itself may be too long, but a carefully crafted, well-organized, short address, perhaps using a poster on camera  that summarizes the points, could be somewhat effective even though it would inevitably be pilloried by FOX and other incorrigible naysayers and misinformation merchants. Every additional vaccinated person counts."
2021-08-03 04:45:58,"Unfortunately, Biden's July announcement that if you were fully vaccinated then you could go maskless presupposed a rational response on the part of unvaccinated Americans, which was obviously a serious misjudgment.
  
For instead of responsible behavior, what subsequently happened is unvaccinated Republicans, egged on by COVID deniers, took Biden's wishful thinking as a signal to immediately stop getting vaccinated and to wander about in the general population without due care and caution.
  
Sadly, now everyone is paying a long-term, heavy price for this widespread, illogical response, for when expectations are not met, subsequent confidence wains, and often disastrous consequences result, which is where we find ourselves today in the middle of a growing pandemic."
2021-08-03 04:57:24,"The science of the Delta, and future COVID variants all the way to Zeta, is unpredictable. What is predictable about COVID is that the virus will mutate in unpredictable ways.  A failure of public health leadership is the CDC's issue (and unfortunately, Dr. Wollensky's). The CDC made the obviously erroneous assumption that the unvaccinated would continue to wear masks and would eventually get vaccinated because they want to stop wearing masks.  When the US reopened, without an enforcement mechanism for mask wearing, it was completely knowable that Delta would explode because everyone took their masks off. CDC wants to paint this as a mini-crisis for unvaccinated. This is a disingenuous deflection of responsibility - and a failure of leadership.  While this may be true - there are plenty of unvaccinated who the CDC failed protect (immunocompromised, children), and now the risk of further COVID variants (which may defeat vaccines) is greater. No one would ask CDC to predict the direction of COVID. But, this is a public health failure of the highest magnitude.  Rochelle Walensky needs to go. Bring back Tom Frieden.  Or, ask Paul Offit. Please, CDC needs better leadership."
2021-08-03 05:42:31,"The only sure way to end this prolonged crisis once and for all is that the USA Gov. open the patented vaccine -making knowledge to allies and friends, allowing those countries with ample manufacturing capacities to mass produce vaccines for all peoples across the globe at cost.

The public release of advanced vaccine-making skills may be likely to adversely affect American interests in its rivalry with China, which would quickly emulate the skills while on the lookout for ways to catch up to the United States. After all, over time the vaccine knowledge may be obtained by China with espionage.

But American leadership to be demonstrated in sharing patented vaccine-making skills and coordinating the mass production of vaccines for all peoples across the globe would defintely expedite an end to the pandemic, thus casting the United States as the savior of a moaning world--a country for the rest of the world to turn to in difficult times, giving it unsurpassable soft power. 

That prestige would leave in a shame China, a country that throws its weight around with much less effective vaccines, trying to burnish its image after inital cover-ups of an initial covid-19  breakout and massive spread.

A fully vaccinated world would not see more variants. And the United States should be at the forefront of that effort. To that end, all the U.S. needs is confidence in itself and magnanimous humanity for the world. 

What is the United States waiting for?"
2021-08-03 05:40:54,"It has been known for many months that the Delta variant would be hugely problematic. But yet, the USA chose to bury its head in the sand about it.

On a side - but connected - note, I am very unhappy that Canada is opening up its borders to ""vaccinated"" Americans from August 9. This is all shades of wrong. The pandemic is far from over and it's now been established that the Delta variant is incredibly contagious, even in the vaccinated.

We've yet to see any real data on the efficacy of the one-shot J&J vaccine! And you don't recognize 2 shots of AZ as a bona fide vaccine?

Why does you doctor or dentist use a mask? To reduce but not eliminate this exchange. 
Do masks work? Absolutely. Are they fool proof? No. 
Should it come as surprise that the threshold of using masks varies by the situation?  I don't think so. Prior to vaccines masks worked to reduce the spread of the virus which was out of control.  After Vaccines masks still have value.   
This whole pandemic is driven by outcome.  As citizens we must adjust as the trends become obvious. Hospitals are at a breaking point in many parts of the country and the world.  Using masks is doing your part when asked.  As the virus ebbs and flows so does the need for masks - the threshold changes.  It is not a personal decision to not wear a mask when it is mandated any more than it is personal decision not to water your lawn in a watering ban.  A mandate is society saying we are at a threshold where we need to deploy all means to curb the disease.  It only becomes political when our leaders pick on the mask and vaccine messaging not recognizing the value vaccinations  and masks bring."

We have seen the proof that there is more than one virus in the land -- it is the political RNA and nucleoproteins called Trump, the GOP, white supremacists and other domestic terrorists and insurrectionists -- that virus has been with us for a lot longer and has mutated over the years into a highly toxic mix.

Not one county in the country had reached the appropriate vaccination rates to follow that advice. We also knew at the time that breakthrough infections could occur. Right now the advice is mask up in areas of high transmission. We need universal masking or the areas of low transmission will eventually become areas of high transmission.

The medical illiterate who was president at the time had not yet meddled in public health policy.
The CDC still does not understand that much of the spread is aerosol, not droplet. The president himself uses a surgical mask rather than the more protective N95 which seal to the skin of the face.
Of the workers shown in the photo for this story, only one appears to be using the more protective N95, the woman with the red top. If any of the other three are infected, they are projecting aerosol  through the gaps in their masks (and I have not mentioned dilution ventilation). But CDC will never talk about aerosols, only vaccination.
The much-touted Biden ""Emergency Standard"" applies only to health care workers and not the general workforce. Wallenberg might be a great scientist, but when she called ""masks off if vaccinated"", she showed that she doesn't know how people behave.

The various mutations are surprises. We know there will be surprises but what we do not know is if, or how destructive the next mutation will be.
The other factor is the human’s response to scientific recommendations. 
Medical data states wear masks. Certain leaders reject that. A percentage of the population copy that behavior. Science says maintain distance. A percentage of people, including leaders, ignore that. A small miracle happens and a vaccine is produced that results in fewer deaths, sick people and hospitalizations. A certain percentage of people reject that for a number of reasons.

It is understandable that people are angry and exhausted with the disruptions and demands of living through the pandemic. But that the trajectory of the pandemic has translated into skepticism of public health advice seems to indicate other endemic problems - such as the contradictory desires for authoritative answers and absolute liberty. 

It is not surprising.  The Founders bequeathed us a government based on coming to consensus through the reasoned debate of empirical evidence. And confounded by notions of self evident truths and god given rights. We have been bedeviled by these contradictions from the start. But by separating state and church, the Founders tried to protect government institutions serving the general welfare - the legislature and judiciary particularly -  from the irrationalities of religious thinking. The practical matters of government need to be based on knowledge not belief. Republicans have turned this upside down.

The Republican 'small government' agenda has compromised America's response to the pandemic, most disastrously by depriving us of an comprehensive national health care system. But Republican anti democratic religious extremism - its bent for authoritarianism and religiosity in government - has also deprived us of the ability to reason together to find communal solutions to shared problems."

Currently, only about 0.02% of vaccinated folks are experiencing breakthrough infections. From the sound of news stories, one would assume that the number was several times higher and that such infections are fairly common. That, in turn, certainly must lead the unvaccinated to wonder 'why bother?' 

Beyond that, it is confusing to know what to do when the gov't issues an advisory that everyone wear masks indoors. It's not a mandate, as of yet, but a recommendation. That, in turn, leads to odd situations. In my grocery store about 1/2 of the shoppers had masks on Sunday. That's up from virtually no one a few weeks ago. Still, it's an odd feeling for a vaccinated person like me to be (again) walking around in a mask and looking at lots of unmasked folks (or folks with chin straps etc.).

No one is calling covid strategic, of course, but the same level of reconceptualization and denial of reality is taking place by a population of people on average that is less educated, thus it is not hard to understand how this could happen but it suggests the near and intermediate future may be very bleak absent some heretofore clear thinking.

The May CDC mask guidance therefore clearly implied that rises in cases might happen and therefore shouldn't be used to go back and forth on policy.

This is a typical response today.
What is that is so difficult to understand, compared to the original virus the Delta variant is about 100 times so infective.
Why because this new strain compared to the original producing 10 times as many viruses in your throat and at the same time for 5-6 days instead of 2-3 days.
That is why it is so important to wear a mask. 
The vaccination is very effective to protect you from sickness and not dying from the (Delta) virus (as it did with the original). But it does not protect you from spreading the virus to others.

And by the way, as a European living in Spain. 
Why do you not learn from other countries, and what has happened here. 
Here where I live, in early June we had a rate daily of 45/100 000. Today in my community it is 842/100 000.
Why, because we needed the tourist from the rest of Europe to come here and spend their money. So we opened up, except from masks indoors. And look at the rates now, I mean this is in about 6 weeks. It is not many deaths, because about all the people at high risk are vaccinated. But there are a lot of people in Hospitals. The capacity on the ward s about 22% occupied by people with Covid, but the ICU has an occupation of 35%.
And 92% is occupied with people that are not vaccinated or have only one dose.

That is how good the vaccination works."

Yeah, well, the epidemiologists knew this virus and pandemic could change in many ways and turn on a dime. And pop up and explode seemingly randomly. And a lot of them said so. But the governments, federal and state, dropped the ball on educating the populace about what a nasty pandemic is, and how unpredictable it is, and preparing them for its unpredictability. Some did so deliberately, for politics. Some did so out of incompetence.

The pandemic handbook - and this was said at the beginning - calls for two equally important pieces to quell a pandemic, the medical piece and the communications piece. The communications piece has often been sorely lacking. Everyone in this country should have been given an effective and persuasive message about the nature of viral transmission, what exponential contagion is and how exponents work and are reduced, and the nature of viral mutation and preventing further mutation. And unpredictability and the need for flexibility.

The communications piece is still lacking. Look at how the political ""leaders"" dropped the ball on the eviction moratorium, and how hardly any of the existing funding for assistance to renters and landlords has been disbursed. Is this any way to run a railroad?!"

The numbers of infections are up yet I will go into a classroom and risk it. Masking on my face and vaccine in my body as my protection may stop the virus from killing me but I will get sick. I know it and accept this. It’s the unvaccinated student that will get sick and spread this evil virus to the campus and yes some may die. For what, freedom. We have a responsibility for each other and getting the jab for the nation is part of it."
2021-08-03 08:17:44,"Get the vaccine.  Mask.  Social distance as much as possible.  Wash your hands.  Don't touch your face.

One of her brilliant insights that stayed with me was something like this: ""It was the first time in my working life that I gave people exactly what they asked for."" 

This isn't McDonald's, it's science. It's messy and people are doing their best to keep the public informed and up-to-date. Americans need to get over it a recognize that the answers will not come immediately and in a prepackaged and predictable form. Like the virus, we must persist and adapt. And by the way, it doesn't help that the Times frames the confusion as justified and understandable because in this instance it's mostly just politically entrenched obtuseness."

Vaccine no longer prevents contagiousness.  The virus doesn’t care if we don’t like masks or social distancing.  If it can replicate, it will.  

That’s reality, and if we don’t get our act together we will lose the ground we’ve gained."

2021-08-03 06:12:43,"The corona virus has a potential of changing American lifestyles, permanently. What the nation is faced with is a mass virus running head-on into a mass culture, the former potentially destroying the latter. Masks, social distancing, and restrictive public spaces countering an ongoing evolution of COVID variants might prove a fatal blow to that consumer mentality, the one engendered by President Reagan, the interdependent world economy. 

There is always a lag effect between the decision to change behavior and actions. I believe it is time for our leaders to preempt the future, start talking and writing about a new way of living, one that encourages local innovation. America was never a mono-culture. Perhaps it is time to return to our more natural roots."

Messaging must adapt as fast as the virus does. Stop expecting consistency in a world we’re there isn’t much and it might reduce the childish anger and frustration over changing messaging a bit. Arguing about these things is beside the point, really. Be careful, wear a mask, get vaccinated, beat the virus. Deal with it."

If not for the ill-informed doubters, the messianic Trump believers, the sheer obstinates, the deniers, and the gobsmacking gullibility of half of our fellow citizens, we could have had this thing nailed in six weeks back in March of 2020. Now, because of them, we are not only back at square one, we are backsliding while the virus continues to mutate and will end up taking the vaccinated along with the unvaccinated as it rampages. I have no problem wearing masks even though I’m fully vaccinated; I’ve actually come to appreciate how they can hide my anger."
2021-08-03 10:22:10,"We will continue to get bounced around until more people get vaccinated. We have always known the virus can mutate, resulting in a more dangerous strain and that the only way to beat this is through vaccination. The CDC may have erred by backing off on masking, but if we're going to focus on who's responsible for ""pandemic whiplash"" and exhaustion, shine the light on those who refuse to get vaccinated as well as those who allow proliferation of misinformation and those who are riding this awful wave for political advantage."

2021-08-03 09:02:23,"(I'm a scientist) The situation more than 18 months ago was: ""There is a respiratory virus that is very contagious, about 10-20 times more deadly than flu, and no cure exists"".

The biology courses in public schools, reasonably well taught, should have been sufficient for every child on up to realize that ""sanitation and confinement"" is what needs to be done. And this was the main advice from medicine and science.

""Sanitation and confinement"" is not just to prevent infections, but to lower the probability of the constant mutations to produce a more virulent strain. 

The first wave was an indication that the citizenry did not understand a classic epidemic well enough to take action, and that many politicians were at least as ignorant.

The second wave was an indication that children on up -- and including politicians -- were not being taught to notice, to think, to check things out, etc. This was a much more dire lower level than simple ignorance.

Every part of this is both tragic and need not have happened.

New Zealand, with very different leadership and a citizenry willing to learn and understand, was able to seal up, confine, sanitize, monitor, etc. over the same 18 months of time. 

New Zealand's results have been: 5 total deaths per million population and 579 total cases per million population. 

The US: 1863 total deaths per million and 106,624 total cases per million population.

The factor of 372 better results aren't because New Zealand is smaller than the US."

It’s been very clear to many of us that we needed to mask-up and socially distance until the vaccines came out when the virus first hit us. When the vaccines were made available, we signed up for our appointments, got our shots, suffered through a few days of flu symptoms, got better and carried on. It wasn’t difficult unless we were confronted by the conspiracy theorists and non-believers of science at grocery stores who only concerned themselves with their own “personal freedoms” at the expense of the public health and, ultimately, as well as their own.

I wound up settling for a hardware store $40 device brand name RZMask. The wife and kids didn't want to wear it.

By now, there should be 5 or 6 masks, each design tested by 10,000 people. These masks should have an actual safety rating.

Furthermore, by now there should be masks with a virus detecting color changing chemical. Or there should be a virus detecting color changing tablet.

There’s been a lot of talk about whether Sweden made good or poor choices during this pandemic, but what I can tell you fist hand is that life is normal again here. This leaves me unconvinced that America with its hair on fire about the vaccinated masking up again and social distancing is really the right choice. I get the big concern regarding the unvaccinated but for the rest of you I’m just not sure that it isn’t time to get on with life. That’s what we are doing here."
2021-08-03 09:45:01,The governor of NJ announced that it will require all workers in certain state and private health care facilities to be fully vaccinated against COVID 19 to protect the vulnerable.  This proclamation comes in reaction to the Delta virus being able to allude vaccine effectiveness and lead to break through cases which are happening in all different types of settings.  If this virus can be spread by the vaccinated it can also mutate and evolve in the vaccinated.   Given this information how are you protecting the vulnerable by mandating a vaccine that is already showing a decline in efficacy and the ability to slow transmission.
2021-08-03 07:20:59,"We have weakened immune systems with no expositions to virus, with lack of physical activity, with anxiety. We are going to pay the consequences of not being humble, rational, balanced enough.

The strategy facing the new coronavirus should be the same that facing the flu (a very similar illness once a first herd immunity is being acquired): vaccinating only the most vulnerable.

And we should stop encouraging young, health people (sometimes already immunized naturally) to be vaccinated while old, sick people in poor countries don’t have access to vaccines. Of course, we should also waive patents for producing much more and knowing precisely what is in. 

So many downward slides… In particular, what is being done by president Macron in France (i.e. to force people to get vaccinated, through a health pass compulsory for virtually any activity, with vaccines still under experimentation and whose long-term effects remain uncertain) is just totalitarian. A line of health apartheid and digital mass control has been crossed, and the international community should be mobilized to preserve such beautiful values such as liberty, equality and fraternity, now under attack."
2021-08-03 09:03:41,"Can anybody say ""vaccine mandates""? Or limits such as the French have imposed.

President Biden is no doubt counting the political costs of stronger action. I understand. But this is just wrong, and in the long run will be disastrous for him politically, as the Republicans go after him for failing to control the epidemic.

Because even at that point in time, and even since then, there have never been any disputing that vaccinated folks are just as capable of getting/giving COVID,  as the Unvaxxed.  The only difference being that the vaxxed are Less likely to get very sick.

People need to stop taking these yes/no, stop/go,  on/off directives so literally, and go with common sense.  And the common sense is that we should all err on  the side of caution and continue to wear masks in public, indoor spaces.

Ok, discounts on pizza at Foxboro Stadium if you just got vaccinated or even being entered into a state wide lottery each time you get a shot is passable.   But direct payments when  you get vaccinated is going to backfire severely in the long run.  When boosters become available or new vaccines for the new variants, or new pandemics occur, people who were on the fence about vaccination or who need the money, are going to wait for an offer before being vaccinated.   The practice of paying people will, with one-trial learning, teach people to wait to be vaccinated, with more virus spread resulting and more virus mutation opportunity.  The practice of payments is just dangerously short-sighted."

Just because you have been vaccinated doesn't mean that the vaccine has taken. Also, it doesn't tell anyone how long your immunity may last. Or whether you are one of the people who are still very infectious and so on.

Passports are a political sop ... and the idea of people being forced to carry such a flawed document, by law, is surely a nonsense?

As so much with Covid it has exposed the weaknesses of our political, corporate, community, social and individual decision-making. Especially in relation to risk assessments (you can't make a rigorous probability-based risk assessment for a novel event - though you can judge possibilities if one knows the criteria).

As ever, levels of education are key to individuals being able to make informed judgements ... and there's much work to do there, especially in relation to scientific matters.

Thanks for reading.

2021-08-03 10:24:42,"Novel coronavirus pneumonia has been diagnosed in nearly 35 million people in the United States as the most developed and mature country in the world, and the United States has not controlled the epidemic in China. More than 610 thousand people have lost their lives, and the virus has spread to other countries and become worthy of the name of the virus. This naturally has something to do with the leaders.

Ignoring the opposition of the international community and paying no attention to international morality, the United States repatriated illegal immigrants on a large scale, resulting in the intensification of the epidemic in Latin American countries. U.S. personnel stationed abroad regard other people's health as a child's play and do not abide by local epidemic prevention regulations, resulting in the spread of the virus.

The situation is still very critical and I hope it will improve"

Yawn."
2021-08-03 09:20:39,"Confusion or is it stupidity? Delta is dangerous, the vaccine is an important tool, but it’s just one of several. If this were something like Ebola or smallpox where the infections have external indicators, have to believe people would continue to wear masks and socially distance. The fact that people refuse to get vaccinated is insane when the rest of the world is crying out for them. These people are endangering my family and friends.  Because we’re selfish with some off the wall ideology or not smart enough to do it it for ourselves, we need to Stop the carrot approach, and keep it simple with mandatory measures, either get vaccinated or lose your job or government benefits. Even better, put them in the detention centers to quarantine...I’d like my life back, and as long as we play games this nightmare won’t end."
2021-08-03 10:48:01,"As much as I consider myself a lifelong Democrat, I constantly have difficulty relating to the N.Y. Times’ reporting on Covid —  the sole exception being articles written by David Leonhardt, who I believe is highly rational and levelheaded. 

My view - which I absolutely have seen echoed in other comments on this website, and by those I speak to in everyday life — is that the extraordinary effectiveness of the vaccine has removed the real threat of this virus, has made it nothing to fear any more than we feared the flu before March 2020.   In my mind but contrary to the tone and framing of almost every article in the Times, the virus is barely newsworthy anymore.  In particular, I see nothing newsworthy about breakthrough infections.  After all, the vaccine has restored adults to the same statistical reality of risk that we were in and that we accepted pre-Covid.  

For all intents and purposes, it no longer matters if a vaccinated person gets Covid, any more than it matters or is to be feared when an otherwise healthy adult gets the flu.  We need to stop buying into and perpetuating what has become an irrational and largely media-driven fear of catching this coronavirus.  The constant headlines and disproportionate attention given to a virus that poses no severe risk to the vaccinated is grotesque.  I can understand an occasional article about the effects of the virus on people who for whatever reason have chosen not to get the vaccine.  But for the rest of us - it’s over."
2021-08-03 11:25:31,"Shame on the Times for repeating the false notion that “messaging” has been “inconsistent.” Really? How many times have we heard that COVID is a novel disease in humans and we learn more as we go? How many times have we heard public health officials say that as new data comes in we react and change policies? And how many times have we heard encouragement from public officials for people to get vaccinated. 

Just because people don’t like the “messaging” does not mean it’s inconsistent or wrong. Perhaps some people need to listen more carefully, as well as comply, and we will all be better off. It’s non compliance, not inconsistent messaging that is the problem in America. Stop the complaining and start the complying,"

My postal worker told me their union is against mandating the vaccine, hence why they were spared by President Biden’s federal vaccine mandate. 

He explained that if he has received the vaccine & gets ‘breakthrough covid’ he has to use his own sick/pto/vacation time to cover the 14 days he has to be off to recover (even if he isn’t showing symptoms).
If he doesn’t have the vaccine & gets covid, he is paid in full for the 14 days without having to use his own time. 

Apparently some people are willing to risk death to not be penalized and have all their benefits eaten up for getting this horrible virus."

Overall, U.S. authorities stopped migrants about 210,000 times at the border in July, up from 188,829 in June and the highest in more than 20 years.

The irony is that it’s very easy to receive a COVID vaccination and a PCR test in Florida. If the right hand could get together with the left hand the virus could be contained. But the political benefit of massaging conspiracy-addled minds, telling lies people want to hear, is too easy to pass up.  

The Broward County school board wanted to mandate masks when schools in Florida open. DeSantis is proposing a ban on mask mandates. Claims he wants to see his children smile. 

The changes in CDC guidelines regarding wearing masks seems to be the tipping point for Republicans. First the CDC said no, then yes, then not necessary, and now necessary despite being vaccinated. Oh, my poor head is going to explode!  They can’t deal with a fluid situation. When fighting a forest fire, when the wind shifts, you need to shift, otherwise you’re toast. 

Lastly, from Sen Ted Cruz, his attack on the CDC, Dr. Fauci, science, critical thinking, and the only thing separating man from sponge, a functioning brain, claimed no other body in government has acted worse than the CDC. 
He forgot the Republicans in the Senate and the House pursuing a political agenda over the bodies of sick Americans."

Managing a PANdemic by focusing on your country's current stats, is like driving in the dark with headlights off. You have to look at where you're going AND what's coming at you. The media, instead of questioning the 'normalcy' narrative, went along for the ride. Twitter, ironically, was the place to get a prophylactic dose of realism directly from the few public health experts willing to dispense it.

It’s fairly direct—

With the emerging of the Delta variant and the recognition that it was highly contagious, beginning to overtake all other variants in the United States—

Health experts pleaded with Biden (and his administration) weeks and weeks and months ago, to use the pulpit of his presidency to urge that universities and organizations and corporations REQUIRE vaccination. Not just tell people over and over that they should be vaccinated.

But political calculations reigned supreme.

1) Trump’s full on assault on truth, reason, science, candor, decency - and basic reality.

2) Republicans backing that play for months - many even continuing to today!

3) Right Wing media: a shrieking Greek chorus of sneering doubt, violent rage, and mocking anger… every step of the way.

EVERY problem we have today was planted and cultivated in that garden!

Public health officials must tread a minefield of caution, left with little credibility from battling Trump and Republicans all song, just to try to save a fraction of the at risk Americans. Even now, each message has to be smoothed over as much as possible, to not choke a public wounded with endless Republican cynicism.

Are they too cautious? Yes, probably. They should be telling people plainly that many of the old rules don’t fit anymore - now that a more brutal, uglier COVID-19 variant is dominant… thanks to months of willful Republican pushback, and cancerous falsehoods, which sewed defiance and doubt. Make no mistake: Delta took hold, because the Right made darn sure it would!

Now, brutal truth is needed:

Most people can likely catch the Delta variant. What’s different is how it will hit you: a glancing blow for the vaccinated - and a ghastly game of Russian Roulette for the unvaccinated, with great suffering, reduced capacity, or death as the outcome.

Mask protocols and social distancing for all, is the only immediate answer, with vaccination for all as our only weapon."

That should reduce hospitalizations. Second, we need to take measures to reduce transmission including continuing to work/school from home for those who can. If increasing transmission increases mutations this seems like a reasonable pathway to reduce new variants.

Too many vaccinated people are shopping, on public transit and will be going back to work, likely without masks. Though rare, we don’t want mutations that could be vaccine resistant. Everyone in the US going back to work or school in the fall is a large enough number of people to raise the incidents of transmission and increase the risks of new mutations."

This pandemic won’t be over until we have herd immunity by either most vaccinated Or infected.  It is time for those holding onto their freedoms at the expense of the rest of us start paying up.  I am with Macron on this one. Get vaccinated or lose your job and assistance. Pay for your regular testing and you can’t go anywhere indoors.  The world is laughing at us and even worse people are dying unnecessarily. Shame.

Now she's getting an antibody shot because she can't shake this thing on her own.

The days of trusting my fellow citizens is over---I continued to wear masks in stores, even if I looked stupid.  Well, stupid is as stupid does: I remain in good health.

Rachelle Wollensky should never have made her May announcement until further study of Delta offered data.  Her eagerness to offer relief to weary Americans has resulted in even greater anger and cynicism about the pandemic than before.  Her whiplash communications style has really damanged her credibilillty, and while I'm sorry (she is a renowned expert in infectious diseases), her lack of political savvy is made Biden's job harder.

The pandemic was already highly politicized when President Biden came into office, and his CDC has to contend with that. With regard to vaccinations, I think a major messaging failure was calling the vaccine development program Operation Warp Speed, along with Trump pushing for FDA approval before the election. It gave the impression that the vaccine was being rushed into production without the necessary safeguards, for political reasons.

What gave me confidence to get the vaccine as soon as I was eligible were Dr. Anthony Fauci's words and his willingness to publicly get the vaccine himself. It's too bad that so many right win ranters and politicians saw fit to denigrate him."

The reality of this pandemic is that vaccines, masks, hand washing, and distancing all help to reduce a person's risk. However, the amount of need to get a vaccine or wear masks indoors or out depends largely on the person's personal risk factors and area's vaccine and transmission rates.

There is no single one-size-fits-all message or strategy appropriate for every person or location. The Delta is a new problem that requires revisiting practices. Who knows, there may be an Epsilon variant developing out there and we'll have to respond to that as well.

It's just ignorant for people to say that because the government has been adjust the message to the conditions, that the messages are invalid. Until the pandemic is over, expect that conditions will change. Not everywhere and not in the same way. That's just the way it is."

By over stating the slim possibility of vaxxed people getting infected the CDC played right into the hands of the anti-vax and disinformation battalions both domestic and foreign.

Right away they gave fodder for the social network savvy saboteurs to challenge the efficacy of the vaccines and feed into irrational fears already generated on Facebook, Twitter etc.

The science folks at the CDC have got to be instructed on how quickly their professional cautions can be distorted by various nefarious forces.

In an age when Russian hackers can easily shut down a US gasoline pipeline and hold companies, organizations etc. hostage to ""ransomware"" the making of such cautionary comments will quickly be distorted.

Add to foreign forces the domestic far right-wing elements on both social networks and Fox News and one can see how the CDC fell right into the hands of these groups.

Yes, there is a very small (teeny!) number of ""breakthroughs"".  A rarity that pales to insignificant in relation to the actual number of vaccines administered.

But the CDC, with foolish transparency, has both added to the confusion of well-meaning people and fed into the hate-impelled anti-vax groupings."

Yes, people can drive but I wager it’ll limit many trips cross-country that are over 400 miles."

I have a friend who honest told me that he thought the vaccine with change his DNA.  There are others that wear masks in cars by themselves.   I may be right leaning but I've had my shots and just can't believe how some people are acting.  Kids have to have all sorts of vaccinations to enter school, adults should have the same mandates."
2021-08-03 11:58:01,"The CDC needs to be better studying breakthrough infections to determine if we should “care” about them from a public health perspective. We “don’t care”  about breakthrough flu infections ( in terms of altering our lifestyle) though a few  thousand die of such infections post vaccination (40-60k die of the flu in a typical year and at least 5-10 percent of those are vaccinated) and a small number  have long term problems post flu. If this is what numbers post vaccine COVID looks like we may be able  to accept that and not ask people to alter their lifestyles because of it once vaccines are available to all.

We know we are in a fast-changing environment amidst a global pandemic caused by a previously-unknown virus, where the scientific and medical communities are racing, as quickly as possible, to learn how to respond to each new situation.

Since this is all so new, and rapidly changing, it is incumbent upon us, the public, to maintain an open mind and realize that advice will change as conditions change.  The messaging has not been ideal, but what is in a crisis?  Nothing.  No need to freak out."

Consequently I have been physical distancing like a hermit, and I wear a mask as if my very life depends on it.
You’d think I can’t catch anything now, but since March 2020 I’ve had both the mumps and a cold bad enough I lost my voice; and there’s a real chance I’ve already had and recovered from Covid and never knew it. But you just never know."

2021-08-03 09:25:29,"According to latest news, the vaccinated can transmit the virus to the unvaccinated who are not protected and have high complications rate when infected. The vaccinated will not die while the unvaccinated will maybe die. Yet, I see they vaccinated are the ones complaining, why?

We know the vaccinated can also transmit the virus, and therefore, they will contribute to the virus’ mutations. This mean that virus variants will be here forever and vaccines will be needed every few months until they stop working. The immune system will also lose its effectiveness.

I wish the Times will allow me to state my non medical personal opinion. The only way to beat the virus is to let it go. Vaccinate the high risk if you want and let the rest of the population get natural herd immunity. It has worked before; the Spanish Flu ended in just two or three years and they didn’t have advanced medical equipments."
2021-08-03 11:56:51,"The problem seems to be the messaging. Science evolves as new facts are discovered. Most reasonable people understand that. Stick with one message: when a majority of people get vaccinated or when cases decline, then we can go without masks I. These situations. If we find that isn’t true, or if a majority do not get vaccinated, then masks will continue to be needed. The media needs to stop overplaying the extremely rare breakthrough incidents affecting vaccinated people. Politicians and civic leaders, stop coddling the unvaccinated. Wearing a mask isn’t nearly as difficult as storming a beach in Normandy or fighting a war in the Middle East. Many of us vaccinated types shoulder the burden of trying to explain the necessity of vaccines to friends, family, even strangers. Help us out. Tell it to us straight. And by the way, France will begin to require proof if its citizens want to do anything: take a bus, attend school, shop in. Let’s be more like France."
2021-08-03 11:58:55,"Being old, my friends and I remember before we had the protection of vaccines we have today. As one said there was never a question of not getting our shots. Our parents marched us off to the doctors’ and that was that. Perhaps it was because they remembered growing up and losing friends and family to illnesses that we rarely see today. They saw what happened to kids who had a bad case of measles and lost their hearing, people who were in iron lungs,women who got German measles while pregnant, homes quarantined because of some contagion.How many of our grandmothers lost children to what is now preventable. 
The greatest problem that many people have is not having to deal with some of the hard realities that our forbearers hade to. It has given us a false sense of security (it can’t happen to us). 
My friends and myself have also discussed the nature of viruses and how fast they can mutate so that the new variations we hear about are no surprise which is why we all have both our shots and our masks."
2021-08-03 12:10:04,"There's a lot of 29-20 hindsight here. The difficulty is we're dealing with probabilities and too many people want certainties. ""It's it safe to do X unmasked?"". At best the only technically correct answer would be an estimate of the probability of getting infected which itself could only be an approximation. We want a YES / NO answer that will always be wrong by somebody's reasoning.
So it all has to be the fault of the CDC or the FDA or the White House or the governor that we have at different times different answers. 
Maybe it's time for us to grow up. Bigger and more confusing challenges are coming."

2021-08-03 12:52:14,"I just read a article in The Atlantic about Covid which said that public health experts say that the most important job of public health officials is messaging.  If that’s correct then obviously the CDC has failed in doing its most important job.

It is not 20/20 hindsight to say that the CDC never should have changed it’s maskless indoors for the vaccinated guidance when they knew that delta was here and even I knew that it could break through the vaccines.  They had to have had data from the U.K. and India.  Other public health officials, and many ordinary individuals including myself, immediately pointed out the error.  

It is not 20/20 hindsight to say that the CDC should have been, should still be, aggressively tracking breakthrough infections to see what variants can break through, at what rate and why.

It is not 20/20 hindsight to say that they CDC should have been emphasizing from the beginning that the vaccines were never designed to be able to prevent infection or transmission but were amazing when it came to hugely reducing the chance of hospitalizations and death.  They already had that data.  They appear to have not done so because they thought that this information would disincentivize vaccinations and yet this information is finally being widely reported and the rate of vaccinations are up. 

Now the CDC has little credibility while we are still in the middle (hopefully at least the middle) of a pandemic.

Dr. Walensky needs to be replaced."
2021-08-03 12:54:40,"I'm a vaxxer, mask wearer, science believer, etc. However, I am indeed growing suspicious of the messaging, specifically the messaging around the efficacy of the vaccines. In various groups I'm part of - all of them small, the largest is 50 people - there have been breakout infections among the vaxxed, on the order of 5%- 8% of the group. That's a lot of people for a small group . In addition , the so-called ""mild"" symptoms are awful, and the person is then left to face the prospect of long COVID. It's anecdotal, but it really makes me wonder what else the CDC knows that they are not sharing with us."
2021-08-03 13:02:39,"The messaging has been pretty clear on that vaccines work, and the only way to prevent serious illness and death is to be vaccinated, furthermore herd immunity can be reached when 70% or so of the population is vaccinated. That says very clearly that this virus will not in the near future become like the seasonal flu unless 70% or so of the population is vaccinated.  

I have 5 medical doctors in my family, and I have known of person vaccinated in quasi war zones with what were more or less homemade vaccines. I have never heard of anyone dying from being vaccinated. I am clueless as to where exactly any confusion might be, excepting in the minds of individuals who because of what can only be mental health issues don't see the issue as it is. In a situation such as this, I would say it is justified to grab people confused about vaccines on the street or go to their homes in order to directly address what exactly their issues might be."
2021-08-03 13:05:04,"The language in this article is part of the problem. 

The CDC did not do ""an about-face"" with mask requirements. It was not a ""public health reversal.""  

The requirements are driven by the virus. They will change as the need changes, as the virus mutates, as we become more vaccinated. 

Language like this makes it seem like the CDC is flip-flopping and confused. The reality is there are clear mechanisms we can use to control the virus and as the virus becomes more prevalent, these tactics must be applied, consistently, to contain it."

The second thing is to find the cheerleader you need to replace Trump. They haven’t got one, accent the positive, stop dwelling on the negative. And for goodness sakes stop berating people who are not vaccinated, they have legitimate reasons. 

We have a President that calls them “stupid”, a man that can’t even make his way through a 4 minute speech. That CNN “town hall” was an embarrassment of Global proportions.

And stay away from the word “mandate”."

Then watch him ruin our economy and kill hundreds of thousands  of Americans with his stupidity dealing with a simple pandemic that could have been aborted by universal face masks for 6 months or less. The incompetent tyrant refuses to accept the fact that people reject him because of his failure to deal with the pandemic and attempts a freebie coup attempt using his gullible supporters. Life saving vaccines are developed in record time and our own citizens refuse to take them out of ignorance and spite. We don’t need to worry about the Chinese or Russians anymore the real enemy is ourselves."
2021-08-03 02:33:14,Dropping the mask mandate in May (especially for indoor activities) when you hadn’t reached a critical mass of vaccinated people AND you did not have vaccines for children under 12 AND you had Delta on the loose was absolutely idiotic.
2021-08-03 08:47:41,"Anyone who has been paying any attention isn't surprised. We have been told for over a year that there was a race to get people vaccinated before the virus could mutate and become even more deadly but more people trusted ""medical experts"" Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham and randos on Facebook who said the virus is a liberal hoax and not Dr Fauci or the other experts from the CDC and gosh, big surprise, the virus is real and has mutated and is now laying waste to red staters and fans of Fox.

We are here again because half of the Population of the United States are selfish narcissists.

Of that half, half again are people of color and naturopathic Whites who distrust government but will ultimately get vaccinated — now that it is too late to stop an outbreak — because while they may be dumb, they are convincible by personal tragedy. In other words, they will get the shot now that Billy is dead.

The other half of the half are the ideological retrogrades that, under our ancient, slaveholding, useless Constitution, have a veto power over every decent thing the rest of us try to accomplish in this world.

Whiplash? These are the entirely expected, narcissistic, stupid chickens coming home to roost."

""Oh, the rain has stopped. I don't need my umbrella any more, but I see dark clouds just over there.""

""Oh, it's raining again. I need my umbrella. ""

Pro tip #1: Pay attention to what's going on around you, out in the real world.

What makes me nuts us all the liars, especially young people saying they got the shot so don't need to wear one. With such high rates of no shot amount 18 to 40, There is a whole lot of llying going on. And enough of looking to leadership if they take their cues from Trump or his idiot base.

2021-08-03 06:36:07,"I think the CDC suffered from wishful thinking when they relaxed the mask requirements a few months ago. 
Did they actually think that the anti-VAX, anti-science wackos would wake up and get the jab like the rest of us?  Who knows.

Anyway, consider yourself lucky you live in a country where vaccines are available and masks are available. Take advantage of your good fortune and if you haven’t already put a mask on and go get vaccinated. If you’ve been vaccinated quit your bellyaching and wear the mask for a few more months. What is it going to kill you?? You would think the CDC was asking you to cut one of your legs off.  We need to quit the bologna and get this job done.
Onward,"

2021-08-03 13:17:42,For those who have weighed the risks of the virus versus the vaccine there is no confusion.  Vaccination and mask wearing -preferably N95 - indoors was the way to go before there was a delta variant.
2021-08-03 02:36:26,Get over it. The virus mutates and we have to adapt. Stop whining about it. Do what you think is right and get on with it. Who promised you that you’d have all the right answers immediately and things would never change. The Times is complicit in this as they publish all the whinging and the ‘woe is me’ baloney. Hundreds of thousands of people have died from this virus. It’s real and it will not behave the way you want it to just because you expect the world to be kind to you. Life doesn’t owe you jack. So stop the whining and adapt when you need to.

2021-08-03 10:26:55,"Vaccination should be mandatory for our national security. How stupid are we, as a society, to allow people to roam freely spreading this plague. Unvaccinated children and young adults are dying and we’re about to sent them back to school with thousands of other infected kids and adults. This is just plain idiotic."
2021-08-03 08:20:32,"It is time to stop infantilizing the US population. Either one will get vaccinated or one will get Covid. And so long as one has had a choice, either is fine.

The Biden administration needs to come out with a strongly *Anti-Paternalistic* position and welcome people exercising their freedom to choose. If you have been protected by the vaccine, respecting other people's choice not to get vaccinated costs you nothing. You are already protected.

The truth that everyone knows – at least here in Europe – is that half the United States is in the grip of a Fascist Ideology. This moment is tantamount to when Americans attempted to denazify Germany after WWII; all they had was government newsreel. However, we have Covid, and it will be a miracle worker if you let it. Every family that comes down with this illness will face the humiliation and pain of realizing that they have followed liars and con artists, and they will come out changed.

And if they don't, that's fine too! What matters is that we let these people choose there moment to die, and if that is today, I can respect their decision. Most liberals support some form of assisted suicide. But here they can't swallow the idea of people facing death from a virus? It's not honest. Call it assisted suicide if you prefer. Trumpers can't bear themselves any more than you can.

So get over yourself, let people live their miserable lives, you're vaccinated, and move on. Zeros masks, zero vax passports. Freedom and liberty, and death!"
2021-08-03 11:40:33,"The notion that Americans are suffering whiplash or confused is a shameful artifact of newspapers looking for a snappy headline.  

But outside of Right Wing Media where educated folks pretend to not understand what is going on, in fact most of us do.  And it is not unlike what happens in a heavy rainstorm that was not predicted.  At first you barely notice and might leave windows opened.  Then you do notice - and rain is coming in, so you shut the windows.  

Maybe the rain lets up.  You go outside - carry an umbrella but the umbrella is closed.  Then the downpour starts up again.  

We deal with this all the time.  This headline is damaging.  

We saw the storm let up, but the downpour returned."
2021-08-03 12:30:16,Americans have to just grow up and work together to beat this thing. Whiplash indeed. Just do the right thing already. Use common sense.
2021-08-03 12:47:05,"Another misleading headline. Americans have had a golden opportunity—many golden opportunities—to put the health and safety of the nation and their communities ahead of warped personal interests. And some 45% have intentionally chosen not to do so. They’ve chosen to not get vaccinated, to not wear a mask, to socialize after having made those decisions. They’ve chosen to extend this thing. They’ve chosen to self over country. They’ve chosen selfishness and confusion. They’ve created the situation we’re in. Americans are “suffering whiplash” because fellow Americans have repeatedly upended plans and programs created to end the pandemic. Sometimes the problem isn’t government. Sometimes it’s us. We should act like adults and recognize that instead of always always shoving off the blame onto institutions so large and complex that they’re an abstraction. We had choices to make and we chose poorly. Period."
2021-08-03 12:58:10,"I love how the policy makers and CDC are constantly being accused of giving people ""whiplash"" with ""constantly changing advice"" and ""sudden changes in policy,"" when the fault lies squarely with the people who have sabotaged our recovery by their refusal to follow that advice.

Masks and Social Distancing were always a good idea, even before COVID as a way to combat cold and flu season.

Getting a shot was/is always a good idea.  This has not changed.

Re-opening was/is always a good idea in areas where the great majority of people are vaccinated and for people who are vaccinated.

If you are vaccinated, your risk is minimal.

If you are not vaccinated, you are a public health risk to yourself and others.  This has always been the case and has not changed.

Stop blaming the policy makers for failing to anticipate the level of stubborn/stupid in this country.  The current problems are the fault of the unvaccinated, PERIOD."
2021-08-03 11:47:32,"Unfortunately, Americans don't nuance well. This is clearly an evolving situation and so our response is evolving as well.

2021-08-03 12:10:46,"President Biden needs to stop ""urging"" people to get a vaccine and start ORDERING people to get a vaccine.  I do not know the laws regarding such matters, but we have a highly infectious, lethal disease ravaging parts of America.  Over 500,000 people have died from COVID-19; scores of others are sick and permanently damaged from it. 
Something has to be done to stop it!  We need Congress to create laws making vaccines against such diseases mandatory, and let President Biden sign it into law.
There is no other way. 
When it comes to a pandemic, ""My body, my choice"" does not cut it.  Think of the greater good and get vaccinated."
2021-08-03 12:51:48,"Americans get what they deserve. They don't want whiplash, as this article states? Then you know what? Get a vaccine. Simple as that? Do you want to be able to go out in public, restaurants, stores, visit family, etc.? The get vaccinated

Do you know why we are in this mess? One word. Trump. He caused this backlash against vaccinations. He promoted it as a hoax, along with his minions and lemmings over on Fox News. The GOP still promotes the lies about vaccinations and is causing this pandemic to continue far beyond where it should be at this time.

If America had hit 80-85% vaccination level by July 1, we would be in far better shape right now. Instead, we are going backward. Not all of us mind you, just those who have refused to get the shot. A recent study of hospitals showed that 99% of new Covid cases are those who have not have one dose of the vaccine; the same holds true for new deaths.

If these people continue to refuse to be vaccinated, let them get sick. The problem is they are putting the rest of us in danger and not allowing, yes, allowing America to move forward. 

These close-minded individuals are stopping the very thing they have been riling against - freedom to do what we want to do."
2021-08-03 12:17:28,"Maybe reporters, headline composers, the ignorant and the right wing tail of the republican party are suffering whiplash, but the rest of us are not.

The science is clear.  The virus is adapting.  We need to adapt.

If you use a war analogy, you might better understand.  When the enemy, in this case the virus, adapts to your tactics, you change your tactics to address the changed circumstance.  Then you continue to press forward your strategy to win the war.

Same same with the pandemic.

Great travails require leadership and clear thinking.  It also requires accurate communications which is something too many in positions of political and media power too often ignore."
2021-08-03 12:27:52,"Baloney.  If people take the time to really sit down and carefully listen to the experts, there would be no confusion.  Unfortunately, it does take time and the announcements are at differing times.  Most, it seems to,me, take the advice that best suits them.  They want “freedom” to do whatever pleases them and there is ample choice available from non-experts like politicians, the media (who sometimes mangle the CDC advice as well), and others.  A pandemic is as stable as a changing weather forecast.  When people hear that the “numbers” are down, they interpret this as “pandemic over.”  I have never heard the CDC say this.  There is now the Delta variant and others to come as long as the virus finds a warm host to nestle in (the unvaccinated) and change.  That is its nature.  Change in order to survive—overwhelm the latest attempt to eradicate them, i.e. a vaccine.  So, good luck, anti-vaxers, spread your joy to the innocent.  However, remember that just might be one of your own."
2021-08-03 12:12:52,"Imagine if Trump was still in office? The headlines would scream incompetency with the spotlight on Trump. Instead we get a nuanced headline with Biden's name nowhere and blame placed on ""leaders""...whatever that means. Also interesting that we're blaming Trump people for not taking the vaccine, yet with was Trump that fast tracked the vaccine. The truth is somewhere in between given many minorities, especially in the south, don't want any part of the vaccine. Would be nice if the reporting could rise above the mess we have today."
2021-08-03 12:14:09,"People didn't cooperate by wearing masks and isolating to get it under control.  Then they read one article on the internet and refused the vaccine based on 'research'.  

Now it's mutating and ravaging anti vaxxers.  So yes, the guidelines have and are shifting, but this is a wildly misleading and unfair headline.

Drs and nurses haven't had a break this whole time - long days in full PPE - and now they have to treat people  who willfully did this to themselves. Imagine how tired they are."
2021-08-03 12:31:38,"I parked next to a man at the grocery store yesterday who asked me why I was masking up before going in.  I told him that even though I was fully vaccinated against Covid-19, I knew I could still get the virus and pass it on to others without even knowing it.  He said he didn't need the vaccine because he took care of his own health.  He was smoking a cigarette and appeared to be about 50 pounds overweight. All I could say was ""good luck."""
2021-08-03 12:57:20,We the vaccinated have to bough down to the anti vaccine herd  except those with a legitimate reason to not be vaccinated.

Again the the cult is winning but the virus will eventually get someone they love but will it change their minds or will they drink the poison.

When depoliticized facts are no longer readily accessible to the hands of the majority, America, you have an occupying force, a morally and ethically illegal system of governance — by America’s own historical standard of identity and purpose.  

The will of free, self-governing, enlightenment-seeking Americans will prevail to comprise a vast majority or America will fall under the weight of its own hubris, arrogance, and self-aggrandizement led by a corrupt few.  America,  replace your constitutional representative system of democracy."

2021-08-03 12:43:46,Oh please! The messaging has been the same all along: Wear a mask; social distance; get vaccinated. Some simply didn’t like it and created their own.
2021-08-03 12:44:59,"I am tired of messaging that doesn’t trust us with the reasons for the message. When this started, we were told “masks don’t work.” Then we were told we needed to save all masks for front line workers but masks wouldn’t work for us. Why not just start with “we don’t know if masks will help stop the spread, but as long as we save the medical masks for front line workers, feel free to wear homemade ones — they won’t hurt”? That could have saved lives and might have given the anti maskers less to stand on. This kind of messaging has continued until now, when vaccinated people were told they should probably wear masks indoors, but not given a reasonable explanation. Why didn’t they tell us about the chicken pox study? Why did we have to learn about it because of a leak?

I know this virus is new and mutating and epidemiologists are learning more about it every day and recommendations can charge based on new findings. I’m fine with the guidelines changing as new information comes in. Please just trust me with the information behind the messaging."
2021-08-03 12:23:05,"Relaxing the mask mandate was correct from the standpoint of ‘virology’ but not ‘behavioral science’. So says a quoted public health expert.

This sort of double talk ruins whatever credibility the CDC has left. As a scientist I honestly don’t believe much of the ‘data’ peddled by public health experts, as I have a good idea how hard the data is to collect, and how limited the workers to collect it. 99.999% of vaccinated people have not gotten a serious delta infection ? Seriously, how did they cook that number up? 

Now the CDC as much as admits they are hiding information about transmissibility of the new variant, it has to be leaked by the NYT.

Science should be an important input to making decisions about public policy, but it is foolish to pretend that ever-shifting data, much of it of poor quality, can serve as a guiding light to thoughtless follow."
2021-08-03 12:37:24,"At the few indoor places in Chicago I have gone to this summer, or have walked past, I have seen almost no one wear a mask.  Often even children weren’t masked, and we know that children aren’t even eligible for the vaccine.   I can do the math - it is impossible that 100% of maskless people indoors were vaccinated, given nowhere near 100% of people here were vaccinated.  Obviously unvaccinated people who didn’t want to mask to begin with were going to take it off, and did so.   Thanks for that, CDC. 

I am curious to see what it is like this week in Chicago with the voluntary mask “guidance” now.  Will anything have changed?"
2021-08-03 13:01:39,"Do you know Delta can infect you in a matter of seconds? Yes, Australia documented it. Two people passing each other in a mall I believe, one infected one not, and the infected one gave it to the uninfected one. There is a video of it. It is 1200x more infectious, lives in the air for hours. Forget social distancing. We no longer record break throughs here, think about that! And finally those in charge are admitting fully Vaccinated people with no symptoms can spread it as easily as unvaccinated people. It is only a breath away. The symptoms are different, when I last looked CDC has not updated. First is headache, then runny nose, then sneezing, then sore throat and in UK you are told if you have these symptoms get a test ASAP and if positive stay at home for 10 days. Many vaccinated people are immune compromised, Israel is giving them a third dosage. Long covid is possible for those with no symptoms, always has been. On twitter a number of doctors and nurses have reported alarming uptick in children, even newborns and infants in intensive care with Delta. This is a new virus as far as I  am concerned. The thought that one of my vaccinated friends can unknowingly give it to me and I may unknowingly spread it to another friend who is vaccinated but did not mount an immune response is really scary, not to mention the blockheads who will not get the shots. And yes I still care about them too."
2021-08-03 13:00:16,"I like to read comments on social media on the subject of vaccines. These are not comments from my friends - they are strangers responding to posts from the media or local government PSAs. I think they are very indicative of how people think.

Here's what I'm reading in the past few weeks: Unvaccinated people saying the vaccines clearly don't work if the vaccinated can get Delta; that Delta came from the vaccines themselves, and that the CDC clearly has no idea what they are talking about since they keep flip flopping. 

This is all very dangerous thinking, and I blame the CDC for being all over the place with its messaging."
2021-08-03 12:52:57,"I can empathize with the confusion as to what covid protocols we should follow since the news seems to change every hour of every day. This is one of the pitfalls of instantaneous dissemination of news that we enjoy today. We must learn to discern what we read rather than merely being poised to react. One message remains steady: GET THE VACCINE! If everyone were vaccinated there may be less anxiety about viral mutation. As for the mask, I'm again posing as the masked marauder despite being fully vaccinated."
2021-08-03 12:38:57,"We aren not “all in this together “. If we were, all  over the age of 12 would be vaccinated.
My spouse and I are both 2x vac, with 2nd dose in mid-April. He developed a slight cough last week which turned out to be a “breakthrough infection “. He is in isolation for CDC recommended 10 days; I too am in isolation in a separate area of our home, and while CDC guidelines recommend 3 to 5 days for me as I exhibit no systems, I am still in isolation on day 8. Why would I still be holed up in only guest bed & bath? Because my regular group of walking/tennis/book club friends have shunned me-they are literally afraid to take a walk in the park with me. All because my spouse tested positive 9 days ago. Yet they aren’t afraid to play tennis or participate in indoor book club with unvaccinated people, or visit unvaccinated relatives.
 
I can’t believe my outstanding tennis skills or literary critique abilities are what scare them. Time for me yo make new friends.


If you don’t get vaccinated and get sick, don’t come crying to me. Maybe you can spend the last 10 days of your life in isolation."
2021-08-03 12:37:43,"These are not reversals!  When the facts on the ground change, the advice changes.  We could use the media's help in making that clear rather than sowing more doubt and confusion."
2021-08-03 12:28:20,"It is exceedingly short-sighted to blame any confusion on the CDC — an agency making good faith efforts to keep up with the science — without once mentioning the appalling behavior of Republican governors in the South and West, nearly all of whom have demonstrated a blithe indifference to public safety and who have at times actively attacked it. There is no message the CDC could issue that would stop them from being political opportunists, eager to land a three minute afternoon segment on Fox News."
2021-08-03 12:23:50,"We need to understand that this is an unexpected virus. The CDC and the medical community were not prepared. As in the weather, you can try to prognosticate what is going to happen, but too many times will not be what actually will happen. Also with a large amount of misinformation the unvaccinated people do not help either. It is already difficult for the CDC to have to make recommendations when at the same time for political reasons or simple misunderstanding some people will oppose anyway"
2021-08-03 12:29:51,"In a real sense, the Delta variant has reset the pandemic in the US  to where we were in the April 2020.  Then, without a vaccine in place, the responses were social distancing, masking, and contact tracing. The idea is to prevent the spread by isolating the virus from the uninfected, who might then spread it further.   With a vaccine in place, ""herd immunity"" is  reachable.  This occurs when a large majority of the population has antibodies through vaccinations and prior illness. The virus has no place to go.  But the virus mutated, and Delta can spread through the vaccinated and previously ill.  The superspreader in MA that infected protected people proved this point. For now, herd immunity has vanished until a new vaccine or effective booster is available.   But we are fighting on multiple fronts. Not only are we fighting the virus, but also the misinformation and the outright stupidity of lawmakers who are shouting for individual rights instead of promoting safe practices.  It is the people who listen and obey who will suffer the most as the pandemic spreads.  And in so doing, they impinge on the rights of others by putting everyone else at risk."
2021-08-03 13:06:54,"The only way for the madness to end is to make consequences for the unvaccinated. They should pay higher health care premiums.  They should not be allowed in public places (restaurants, sports arenas, museums, etc.) where they put others at risk.  They should be publicly shamed. Asking the vaccinated to mask up to protect the unvaccinated will not end this pandemic.  It's time for the unvaccinated to step up and protect themselves, their families and their country.  Until the federal government and our society takes a stronger stand against the unvaccinated, the pandemic will continue to control our lives."
2021-08-03 12:34:06,"I am fully vaccinated. I have absolutely no problem continuing to don a mask when I enter a place of business. 

I am also fatigued, frustrated and generally tired of our situation (and I hate wearing masks, but I'll do it anyway). 

I don't blame the officials and scientists, who are human, who are often doing the best they can with an overwhelming, unmanageable, world effecting crisis.

I am an adult. I try to think of my fellow human in conjunction with thinking of myself."
2021-08-03 12:44:52,"I remember the day the CDC announced at a press conference, without warning, that the vaccinated could ditch their masks, effective immediately. Even the newscasters afterwards were like, ""Wait, what?"" I couldn't believe they did that without any warning. Then to invoke some type of ""honor system"" for the unvaccinated to keep masking? That was the height of naivete and it was why I continued to wear my mask indoors and among crowds even though I got the shot. We have no way of knowing who is vaccinated because people think it's an invasion of privacy (it's not BTW when someone's life is on the line or during a pandemic). Thank goodness in California they said, ""slow your roll"" and kept the mask mandate for everyone until we officially, fully re-opened in June. Though, fat lot of good that did us thanks to Delta and the anti-vaxxers.

I will never understand why Rochelle Walensky and the rest of the CDC didn't come up with a timeline and a clear message that the timeline would ONLY work if more people got vaccinated. They could have come out that day and said they were working on new guidelines to reopen in X amount of days, provided the vaccination rates keep rising. If they don't increase, then we'll have to adjust the plan. Until then, keep masking. 

It's really not that hard to be clear and upfront."
2021-08-03 12:55:43,"I’ve read that people who are vaccinated but have symptoms of Covid & test positive for the virus can pass the virus to the unvaccinated. Asymptotic people(who probably aren’t even going for a test…because they’re not showing any symptoms) aren’t pass the virus on to others. So…if this is correct…why not have the directions be…”If you are showing even mild symptoms that could be Covid, wear a mask everywhere.” Have a temp? Have a cough? Have a headache? Having generalized malaise? Etc Wear a mask."
2021-08-03 13:34:34,The messaging of the CDC of late has been especially confusing. One day they say the best and quickest way out of the situation we find ourselves in is to GET VACCINATED. But then the next day they say GET VACCINATED. And then they continue to say GET VACCINATED. No wonder people are confused about whether to get vaccinated.
2021-08-03 13:37:17,"I'm astounded by the number of people who claim they can't cope with the changing data about covid and the delta variant.  Weather changes, and we daily may need to adapt how we dress, and where or whether to go out based on the elements.  How is this different?  To me, it's all in the attitude.  Those who have a political stake in denying the impact of the virus are the ones who seemingly can't cope.  I go out prepared and willing to mask up when necessary, just as I bring a layer in cooler weather.  I'm an adult."
2021-08-03 12:12:32,"Two things that are related, yet very different from each other, have caused hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in the US alone: ignorance and stupidity. Ignorance simply means a lack of awareness, like if you didn’t know a vaccine existed or how easily the virus spreads. Stupidity is being aware (in this case, of the vaccine and the spreadability of the virus) and you actively choose to not get vaccinated and not wear a mask.

Of course, this situation is more complicated than that, since there are so many sources of disinformation, that people who would do the right thing are being led by their “information” sources to do the wrong thing (looking at you, Fox News, Facebook, etc.). It doesn’t help that we have 75,000,000 people who voted for the loser of the last election and follow his lead. Add to that, the lack of both knowledge (why do I have to know things, if I can Google them?) and critical thinking skills (how to determine if what you hear is actually true by looking at different sources, etc.), make a lot of misinformed people think that they are more knowledgeable than they are (thus, the deathbed horror stories).

It doesn’t help that the CDC messaging doesn’t (and, for a year, was prevented from) give current news (science takes time and lags what’s going on), as well as making missteps (e.g., the May guidance).

If so many people were not ignorant and/or stupid, this virus would not have gotten the traction it has, including the opportunity to mutate."

Really, how does such a cute statement of opinion belong in a news report? I read it to my wife and asked if she thought we were in a ""summer of confusion."" No, she said. ""Where is that from, Fox News?"" she asked. It's a new disease and it is evolving and we must roll with it as intelligently as we can. That is all."
2021-08-03 04:49:51,"After 18 months of sporadic leadership, few consistent facts and no direct communication from the CDC, their decisions appear to be made almost whimsically. It is increasingly difficult to trust them. 

There is excellent data showing efficacy of the vaccines, with dramatic reduction of serious illness and deaths via breakthrough infections. Sources include CDC itself, online and available to you and me with a little bit of effort and simple math. Also from states such as VA, MA, IL, NJ which publish breakthrough information, in better detail than the CDC. CDC, with limited tracking resources even a year later, stopped tracking breakthrough infections some months back; they only track hospitalizations. That’s bizarre. 
All these sources show that vaccinated patient deaths from COVID are miniscule versus unvaxxed. Why no public discussion of that?

Provincetown breakthroughs: little or no serious illness or deaths. That’s a win for vaccinations. CDC reacts like it’s a fail. 
So it's back to 100 year old masking, with ineffectual cloth masks to ward of submicron virus. And we still dither about mandating vaxxing. 

Delta has not persevered in India or UK beyond a few weeks, and UK data, which is quite good, has yet to show it to be more deadly. Contagious: yes; more deadly; not so sure. 
People have common sense, and don’t trust the CDC any more. Sadly, CDC hides behind their wall of silent science, making it look like they’re reading tea leaves. No one has your back."
2021-08-03 11:36:58,"“Has there ever been an institution in American public life that has more discredited itself more rapidly than the CDC?"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said on the Senate floor this week.

Yes, Sen Cruz. The Trump administration, the Republican Senate and the Republican House. They, not Democrats nor the CDC, have politicized the Pandemic, twisting CDC guidelines from public health measures into political talking points. They chose economics over public health, they demonized masks, distancing, lockdowns to keep money rolling in while over 600,000 Americans died in one year. 

As with the lie about ‘Trump’s stolen election,’ they lie about everything COVID related. They can’t handle a fluid situation, so if the CDC says wear a mask even if you’re vaccinated, everything is a hoax. They’re behavior is infantile, and moronic, and they’re killing people with their misinformation and lies."
2021-08-03 11:41:15,"The problem we face is explained in the headline here. ""Leaders"" means politicians. Their first concern is holding on to power. Policy should be set by medical professionals who know the facts are not as scary as the ""leaders"" make out. 
Politicians cannot look ""brave"" unless everything they paint as horrible. How many times have we heard career prosecutors proclaim, ""This is the most heinous crime we ever saw!""? Same thing.

2021-08-03 13:27:23,"I’m fed up. If the virus is as contagious as the chicken pox, and breakthrough disease is also common ( you’d have to have your head in the sand to not recognize this regardless of what “they” are saying), why are we not back to square one?  Why does the economy win this time?  Why were we not told in time so that we could protect ourselves by voluntarily shutting down? I don’t believe a word at this point. My only recourse is to again become a hermit. Unfortunately I must travel to see my aged mother who I have not seen for 18 months. Plans were made at the beginning of the summer when we were told vaccinated people could “live their lives again”.  Now I cannot back out or she will be crushed. I am vaccinated but other relatives are not. I am in the precise position I spent 18 months avoiding. All because of terrible messaging and attempts to manipulate the unvaccinated into getting vaxxed. Well it didn’t work. Not only do they not trust you CDC, neither do I."

""Americans angry, exhausted and skeptical of public health advice."" Why? They have been offered the best advice possible. So it changes from time to time, but that's because out here in the real world the virus has changed from time to time. Have we Americans become so infantilized that we can no longer cope with reality?

Maybe that is the attraction of the GOP, Fox and Trump - they offer the prospect that people can live in a pretend world where everything is controlled and nothing would go wrong. 

If only Those people would go away."
2021-08-03 13:17:38,"Unfortunately, Americans have very good reasons to be skeptical of ""public health advice"". We've been lied to multiple times by these so-called authorities.
1) Initially, we were told there was no reason for masks. It tuned out the reason was only a desire to horde masks for the health industry, nothing to do with whether or not they would help other Americans.
2) When multiple vaccines were developed, we were told it didn't matter which one we got, they were all the same. A vaccine that is 95% effective is not the same as one that is 67% effective.
3) We are not told, or at least its very hard to find out about, basic measures that can help prevent COVID -- proper selection, fitting and use of masks, good hygiene for handwashing, public doorhandles and toilets, avoiding vitamin D deficiency, etc. -- and, that if you do get severe COVID, there are drugs which can help."

Real case counts are probably even higher due to less testing, as we are running around 1/2 the tests we ran last November (remember when Biden advisors said we should be testing 4-7 million people a day!).   Forget four years, are we better off than we were 9 months ago?   Biden gets a pass though, as nobody had their feelings hurt."
2021-08-03 13:26:30,"Those who think that viruses and science are going to stay the same are just kidding themselves - both evolve.  As an epidemiologist and licensed health professional, I do not view CDC as flip flopping.  They are simply trying to keep up with the evolving virus and the science behind it. Where I do think they made a mistake is telling fully vaccinated persons that they did not need to mask up indoors.  After they made that declaration, I noticed in the stores and coffee shops that I entered here in Texas, most people were unmasked.  The problem with that is a high proportion of Texans are not fully vaccinated.  I decided to wear my mask again indoors a couple of months ago even though I have been fully vaccinated since March.  Many of the anti-maskers earlier in the pandemic are now the unvaccinated.  The two disease-spreading behaviors go hand in hand.  At this time, Texas is paying dearly for that.  Yesterday in Central Texas (population 2.3 million), we had only seven ICU beds for persons with any critical illness/injury, not just COVID-19.  Meanwhile, Governor Abbott has banned businesses from mandating masks.  It looks like he is conducting a natural experiment without our consent."
2021-08-03 13:14:28,The FDA dragging its feet on approving the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines isn't helping.  Government agencies want Americans to comply and don masks out of a sense of urgency but the FDA has no sense of urgency in approving vaccines already in the arms of millions of Americans.

Can we all agree that we can actually cooperate to wear a facemask if we want to at least reduce the chance to get infected?

I double masked and practiced social distancing hand washing hand sanitizer and surgical gloves when warranted and remained at my post at work throughout the early days of the virus.  I got vaccinated the instant the Pfizer Biontech vaccine became available to me, promptly got my second dose and continue to use proper PPE including doubled surgical masks.

After vaccination I continue to follow the full PPE protocol in and outside of the office at stores and where ever else I go and have absolutely no intention of changing this protocol until the vaccine is fully under control.  I expect it to be years.  

I want my public officials local, state and federal to put in place mandatory vaccination requirements for employment, commerce interstate and intra-state and local public transportation and travel and education on the all levels from preK to post doctrinal and I want to see effective and mandatory international vaccination passport instituted in the United State and internationally  not just for SAR-CoV-2 but for all childhood and adult vaccines.  I want to see the FDA & CDC clear the mRNA vaccines for full use including for children from 6 months to 12 years ASAP.

-if someone has had Covid all of the published studies state they only need one shot to give long lasting immunity. I was antibody + last fall, and have had one shot, yet I am only counted as “partially vaccinated.”  This needs clarification.
-In talking about “anti-vaxxers” why has no one called out our current president and VP? During the 2020 campaign they both stated on national tv that they wouldn’t trust any vaccine developed during the Trump administration.
That would include every current vaccine given FDA emergency approval. Biden and Harris should share some of the blame for questions about our current vaccines."
2021-08-03 08:53:14,"Interesting…

On the one hand, Biden has done a superbly effective job of human leadership, by putting a target out there (70% vaxxed) that has now been reached, and is being surpassed…

He led a changing of the conversation about vaxxing in the US, and a consensus view is forming…

The media for their usual – at best – alarmist part, all harped on the milestone happening several weeks late…

At less than best, they continue to shill and carry water for what is the most dangerous try at a Leninist coup in this country in the last 80 years – and fearmongering about COVID is one of the most potent arrows in their quiver…

Notice how they barely talk about the almost-complete absence of hospitalization and death – after touting the number of new cases in headlines and lead paragraphs…

What Biden should do now, simply raise the target to 80% by Labor Day…

That – and send Walensky packing…

If Randi owned a sock-puppet, it’d have pushed harder for public K-12 fall semester normalcy than has Walensky…

I no longer heed Walensky – her cited science, her guidance, or resolve to get us back to normal…

Or trust the FDA to accelerate approval of mRNA-based vax tech…

The fact is, a study was cherry-picked to ostensibly show that the vaccinated were hospitalized and contagious at pretty much the same rate as the unvaxxed – using a cohort that was largely male, younger, and healthier than the typical one…"

Nevertheless, if you are confused about the transmissibility and lethality of the Covid-19 virus, as well as its mutability within the human petri dish, then you simply have not been listening and intelligently processing the information that you have been given.

Simple information like this: the virus is a living, mutable pathogen; the virus is easily transmitted in aerosol form; the virus can cause severe, sometimes long-lasting illness and death; masks are effective prophylactics; the FDA emergency approved vaccines are highly effective in preventing infection or severe illness and death, but they do not by themselves stop the virus from spreading, infecting, and/or mutating, particularly among the unvaccinated, of which there will be a significant population around the world and in the United States.

How can you be informed of those simple facts (and if you have been paying attention, you have been) and not understand the need to get vaccinated and to continue to wear a mask indoors and in crowds until such time as a definitive ""all clear"" has been issued?"
2021-08-03 13:39:37,"""Pandemic Whiplash"" sounds dramatic in that it implies unexpected surprise and injury, as in a car accident.  I'm not the most intelligent person and it's been obvious to me (I'm sure many others) since early January that we would be where we are today because of the politicalization of the virus and a large segment of the population refusing to do what is necessary to end this pandemic.  That the CDC recommendations fluctuate (""whiplash"") is due to the unpredictable and uneven response of the population and is in no way the fault of the CDC nor Biden."
2021-08-03 04:02:28,"The CDC has failed miserably in its risk communication and leadership. The failures were more understandable during Trumps’s tenure when the agency was manipulated and strong-armed to do his political bidding, but there is no excuse now. Walensky is an absolute disaster and the decision to abandon masks before COVID was under control and before vaccination was near what it needs to be to prevent the brewing of increasingly dangerous variants was short-sighted at best and reckless at worse. 

The great promise of the COVID vaccines were that they could prevent serious illness and fatalities (a promise kept), NOT that they would prevent transmission and infection. To tout them as such was wishful thinking that was seized upon by politicians and the public. Shame on the public health community for its role in the “reopening” and “back to normal” craziness.  

Walensky bemoaning the reinstatement of mask mandates is absurd. That an effective, accessible prevention method is available to bring reproduction rates and case rates down should be seen as very fortunate rather than some unbearable burden. The real tragedy is that messaging from the CDC is such a hot mess that employers, schools, and families are unsure what to do or what to believe. (No wonder the whack-a-doodle anti-vaxer/anti-maskers have gained such traction.). I don’t think that this once great institution will ever regain its former stature or the trust of the American people.  This is heartbreaking."

So, Sean Hannity is now recommending you get vaccinated! Isn't that called the 'flip flop'? How to erase the messaging from the past Administration is what is going to be the real hurdle."
2021-08-03 13:57:31,"Dr. del Rio is wrong in saying that ""breakthrough infections"" ... are still very rare. He should examine the increase in positive testing, symptoms and even hospital admissions among the vaccinated ('breakthrough infections') which while less than among the unvaccinated, are still unexpectedly high.  They are far more common in places like Florida with its anti-mask mandate governor who also prevents employers from even asking employees if they are vaccinated.  Fortunately, this increase in infections appears, according to this newspaper,  to be bringing the vaccination rate up to the targeted 70% having at lease one shot.  Whether this target number applies to the Delta variant seems to be an unknown. Once again, Dr. Fauci should be brought to the forefront of, if not assume the lead in our battle against Covid19.

2021-08-03 14:04:54,"We're going to have to learn to live life with COVID because it isn't going away.  Our culture has a very tough time with that kind of thing; our default is that with enough human ingenuity and dedication and agency we can ""defeat"" anything.  Well, we've ""defeated"" neither the flu, nor the common cold.  (Nor a myriad of other things, but that's a bit off the current point.)

My starting point would be to try to gain some perspective and comparison by looking at the flu numbers.  (OK, I'll start -- 30,000 flu deaths a season is a low number historically.  Over a 180 day flu season, that's  167 deaths per day.)
I'm assuming that, since we lived life maskless and crowded with the flu, that if we can get COVID down to roughly the flu -- very doable; it's close now -- that things will get back to roughly the way they were pre-COVID.  No one pre-COVID ever said ""I'm not going to the movies tonight without a mask because I might have the flu coming on and I could give it to someone who could give it to their 85-year-old grandmother who might die.""  No one ever said that.

If that assumption isn't true, there should be a society-wide debate and discussion about it.  It should not be a situation where we just get there through inertia and the usual tribal back and forths on social media and message boards.

But no mouthpiece with any influence gives us this kind of context.  It just never happens.  That's looks more like the sign of an ungovernable country than anything else."
2021-08-03 14:10:53,"I've said from the beginning of the pandemic, many of the folks guiding decisions about public health understand viruses very well, but people are apparently a complete mystery to them. While even I'm surprised at how far the anti-vax rhetoric has spun out of control, much of what's happened over the course of the pandemic, in terms of people resisting or flat-out rejecting recommendations from healthcare professionals, has been predictable. In general, people need to hear consistent messages. They need to understand what's in it for me (WIIFM) when they're asked to do something, and the more granularly that can be explained, the better people will understand. People need to be met where they are. Many of the epidemiologists, virologists, and other scientists guiding public health decisions seem to have a vision in their heads of some kind of ideal population (they never seemed to do any work around creating personas that would have helped them individuate within the masses, and understand an individual's choices vs. a population-level choice) where everyone is compliant when they hear a guideline; people do not question authority; and people take what they are told by a government agency as gospel. We haven't lived in that America in decades, if we ever did. Please, let's get some behavioral scientists, psychologists, and even some marketing people involved in these conversations about public health. It can't hurt! What we've tried to this point isn't working."

The real head spinner is why unvaccinated people have the temerity to expect any such protection."

Why I, vaccinated, should experience all this nonsense with masks, etc, because of those who don't want to vaccinate?! Let them face the consequences! For vaccinated people Covid is no more serious by consequences than a common flu. We haven't close the country and declared emergency in the past because of the common flu season! Stop this nonsense!

That’s the reality; we all (including scientists and medical professionals) are in an unprecedented situation with COVID’s unknown behaviors, and now with delta. (And what variants await us?) We know far more about our available vaccines then about delta. Let’s grow up as a nation and face reality. This virus, and therefore our response to it, must be fluid.

It can change on a dime, as it did yesterday when Cuomo and de Blasio did a 180 degree turn on face masks. Of course, they didn't actually require masks. That would interfere with dumping responsibility for managing the pandemic on individual businesses. Anybody but them.

Because I have interests in Canada and plan to travel there soon, I also follow what's happening there. It's like night and day. Justin Trudeau, the Premiers of Ontario and Quebec, and the Mayors of Toronto and Montreal are hands-on and proactive. Last Friday, I learned more about Covid Delta and its growing impact from watching a 30 minute briefing by Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, than I have from the CDC's Rochelle Walensky and Tony Fauci in the last month.

No wonder Canada is 9% ahead of the U.S. on full vaccination and 14% on one shot, has the tools in place to deal with the imminent increase in cases this fall, and has the confidence to open its border six days from now.

The difference in leadership and results is instructive, to put it mildly."

I've never stopped wearing a mask indoors though I was vaccinated long ago. Well maybe a little angry at those who decided to let this roll on forever. Exhausted? no, lost my ""freedom"", no. I am free to wear a mask and do other preventative measures. I just hope those who feel so ""free"" not to wear a mask or vaccinate truly appreciate their freedom, and why people ""discriminate"" against them. You bet I do."
2021-08-03 14:10:55,"Dropping the mask mandate was a marketing carrot to get the reluctant vaccinated.  It was a gamble that backfired.  The vaccinated went out and partied like it was 1999. 

People are angry because they bought into the vaccine marketing:  ""get the shot and get your life back!"".  From the government to the vaccine manufacturers, no one believed that was true because they know the science behind viruses.  SARS-CoV-2 isn't going away because of a vaccine any more than the influenza virus is conquered by an annual flu shot.  Yes I know the flu is not a coronavirus, it was just an analogy.

The reservoir for SARS-CoV is in wildlife just waiting for the opportune moment to jump to humans again.  That's how zoonotic disease works.  

Do some research on SARS-CoV vs. SARS-CoV-2 and you'll find interesting differences and similarities.  The first virus was more deadly but SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious, i.e.  better at binding to human cells, and seems to be more closely related to bat coronavirus than to SARS-CoV.   SARS-CoV showed higher viral loads early in the disease, while higher loads happen later with the current virus, allowing for better transmission.  Kill your host too quickly and you don't survive.  Maybe that's why SARS-CoV was 'conquered' in less than one year. 

The outbreaks are separated by 16 years.  

MERS showed up around 2012 and is still around.  There were 45 cases is 2020.  While uncommon, it has a 35% death rate and no vaccine.

SARS is here to stay."
2021-08-03 14:11:01,"I don't understand the reluctance to mandate vaccines and the resulting misplaced focus on masking, social distancing, and lockdowns.

The correct answer to address this public health crisis is to mandate the vaccine. Yes, of course the vaccines must first be approved by the federal government. Had the prior administration not traumatized virtually every competent scientist in those agencies, that approval might have already been done.

Those who remain unvaccinated should face skyrocketing health insurance premiums, no access to federal benefits -- including unemployment, social security, Medicare, Medicaid, and so on, and similar ""incentives"".

When the consequences of an 18 year old drinking age became apparent, it was not hard for the federal government to force a 21 year old minimum nationwide.

This anti-vaccine hysteria is lunacy. It's proponents should bear the brunt of the resulting chaos."
2021-08-03 14:15:20,"Mandate the vaccines period everywhere, not just high transmission areas. Without the possibility of weekly testing as an alternative. Every school child must be vaccinated for contagious childhood diseases. Vaccine mandates is nothing new.

We were informed beginning well over a year ago by government officials & medical professionals that this Covid-19 virus is an ongoing medical crisis; its behavior, like all viruses, as we were told repeatedly, is slippery, unpredictable and deadly.

Therefore, messaging about our need for adaptation is going to be flexible as this changing situation warrants. There are no guarantees or solid answers in a pandemic--like life itself, it's changing.

As part of our human response to this virus, miraculously, as of last December, a powerful, easy-to-access, highly effective vaccine became available for public inoculation--but, instead of eagerly lining up to make a dramatic change for the good, some people have instead responded with self-centered, balky behavior that has now seriously changed the nature of this deadly virus for the very worse--I say to you all: ""how dare you!""

However: a huge ""Thank You!"" to those scientists & lab personnel & health professionals who developed & administered all of the vaccines we've had available & at our disposal for almost 8 months now--Bravo!

If most Americans understood basic biology - which must include evolutionary biology - it would not be so confusing. Very basic: most of the time, the more something multiplies, the more DNA changes occur; and usually the smaller the organism, the faster it multiplies. With this understanding, you don't need an expert to tell you that the path of a virus is not predictable. It can become more or less lethal, it can become more or less transmissible, it can change the way it takes over cells or which cells it gravitates towards. 

If we're expecting the expert advice to change, we won't get angry or frustrated or distrusting, we'll just know that's the path reality takes and adapt ourselves."

number one failure in our country was a failure of leadership. (see Trump) 

 Second that the country (see Trump) had “weakened” the very institutions, like the CDC, that needed to respond to a pandemic. And that the CDC was sidelined. (see Trump) 

Third was the politicalization of the pandemic ( see Trump. Nearly all republicans, Fox News, Hate Radio) The failure he said was that we did not let science rule the day. We let politics guide the response…and that a face mask became a political symbol. (see Trump. Fox. GOP Congress. The rightwing. The South.

This means our response to the virus needs to keep changing as well. 2 + 2 = 4.
We understand that conservatives are opposed to change on general principle. Unfortunately for them (and the rest of us), change is the most basic principle of the Universe. Change is ubiquitous , constant and eternal. Being opposed to change is like being opposed to oxygen. We can't live without oxygen and we can't live without change. We could live without all this stupidity, though, a lot longer and a lot happier."

But the beautiful  mountains are crawling with people from hot unvaccinated Texas and other Red states . Last year these tourists were cramming into the dressing room of the aquatic center to take showers, too.( For better or worse the old pool went belly up with no money to replace it so they aren't there now.) I think interstate travel by car may be part of the problem. But it might be too difficult and costly to put a vax checker at every border plus  every restaurant and shop is too desperate for business to risk checking  as well. How about big signs that say, "" We are a pro-vax community  You aren't welcome here if you aren't vaccinated?""  I dunno. Problem with this country is that it's too large. And you can't see or enforce political boundaries."
2021-08-03 14:41:35,"I’ll tell you what I’m sick of: Governor Abbott refusing to allow anyone to implement mask mandates or any kind of precautions, as he continues to cater exclusively to “his” conservative, rural voters — as if no one else in Texas matters at all, as if no one’s health or safety is of any consequence whatsoever, as if it doesn’t matter how many hospitals are overwhelmed or how many health professionals, or retail and restaurant front-line workers are endangered. The brains of state officials here have been turned to mush by their right-wing political infection and worse, these politically infected officials continue to victimize everyone who is doing the right thing."

The data are out there, and being updated all the time. So even though I am vaccinated, I never took off my mask in May.  But nor did I ever wear a mask while walking on my nearly deserted street, unlike other people in my neighborhood. In the doctor's office, I turned off a table fan that was blowing air directly from him toward me. This fan was supposed to be ""ventilation"". Duh. It doesn't take a specialist to get here."

I really wish you'd get away from using that phrase because some experts think the world is flat.  If you have actual facts, link them.  Otherwise, I'm am completely uninterested in what 'some experts' that are unnamed have to say about anything.

It's understandable with anonymous sources when that's the only way to get the story out.  It is not okay when talking about public health.  Either go on the record or don't report it.  Some experts still think that hydroxychloroquine is a good treatment for COVID, just as a for instance."

2021-08-03 14:41:11,"Why is this difficult to grasp?  It's called the ""novel coronavirus"" for a reason.  Everyone - from the person on the street to the most eminent scientist - is figuring it out as we go along.  Just about everything we know about the virus today is something we didn't know 18 months ago - and 18 months from now there will be exponentially more understanding than we have today.

What is the point of being angry about shifting knowledge?  Does that change anything, or make policy-makers' responses less fluid?  Exhausted, yes; we're all tired of this and wish, by some miracle, that it would be over - but if we've learned anything from the COVID juggernaut it's that we have to be able to adjust (""pivot"" is the pandemic word of choice).  Our lives depend on that."

How many Americans, with the USA's stupid healthcare 'system', could go to a doctor for a sinus infection? Isn't it past time, Congress and the Federal Gov't do something about the lack of healthcare here? This missing safety net has to contribute to the continuance of the pandemic."

2021-08-03 14:44:11,"In all situations, but particularly ones as fluid as those imposed by a pandemic with a novel, and mutating, infectious agent at play, the following should go without saying:

Well when events change, I change my mind. What do you do?
         ~ Paul Samuelson, winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Economics

Why on earth is anyone surprised, or distrustful, when experts change their opinions and advice based on changing conditions?  Who ever expected there to be a ""one way trajectory"" when it comes to this pandemic?

And when public health experts change their minds, and advice, again due to changing conditions, I'll listen then just as I've been listening all along.  It's what rational adults do."
2021-08-03 14:44:32,"My family has all been vaccinated, except our 4 year old grand daughter. We have all worn, and Continue to wear, our masks everywhere here in NYC.

 People. We are still in the middle of an international Health Crisis. What part of that do we not understand? Put your mask on, get vaccinated, protect your community."
2021-08-03 14:50:47,"I've started to wonder how much the reluctance to be vaccinated is connected with sub standard or a complete absence of health care. People who get a yearly checkup, with all that it can entail, are accustomed to interactions with health care professionals. Those who never have a checkup because of poverty and poor health care have little experience with these people. That can lead to irrational fear of doctors, needles etc. I'm sympathetic if that's the case. Too bad that each of us can't take someone by the hand and say, I'll come with you and you'll be alright."
2021-08-03 14:54:10,"What so many people don't understand is that, functionally, a disease variant is a New disease organism.  It's part of what is essentially a family of diseases, each having the same family surname.  

Think of it like a human family, where each member has the same parents yet each family member is unique.  John Smith is not Roxie Smith is not Robert Smith is not Jane Smith, etc., etc.  Each new birth brings a new human organism and personality into being, and what works in raising John may well not work in raising Roxie, Robert or Jane.  One size does not fit all, just as one vaccine is likely to not be effective again stall disease variants.  Delta is the latest problem child of the Smiths, and vaccinations do help in combatting Delta."

Bad science is when fundamentalists build theme parks with cavemen and dinosaurs romping around together.  Granted, those that wrote the Bible had no way of knowing the truth, but today's fundamentalists have the option to learn these things, but their rigidity blinds them to the truth.  I think a greater problem is that right wing Republican have been to undermine the credibility of science generally and they have had considerable success doing so"

2021-08-03 14:51:18,"I find it highly disturbing that Democrats are allowing Teacher's Unions and other special interests like Police and Fire Unions to push back on Vaccine Mandates.

Moreover it is not helping that the evaluation of what is dangerous seems to change depending on who is doing it.

See Obama's big 60th Birthday Party. Director of NIH answered a question about ""is a 300 person wedding dangerous"" in the affirmative this am on CNN and 5 minutes later responded to the question of Obama's event which will have 700 people (including staff and security) with a bunch of hemming and hawing, refusing to just say what we all know... With Delta floating around the way it is gathering 700 people indoors or out at this particular time is a poor idea. 

Or see the Mayor of DC or Governor of CA or dozens of other leaders who make and then publicly break the rules.

Rules for Thee, Not for Me has become a Battle Cry on FOX because Democrats are giving them that club with their own hypocrisies. 

Republicans are what they are. That's a given. And we are all sick of COVID and want our lives back. But we aren't helping matters by having Democrat Leaders proceed on Do as I Say Not as I Do in their own lives for all the world to witness. 

I am very disappointed in this development.

I expected more, especially from the Obama's. 

I really HOPE Joe Biden isn't going to attend that thing.

He has a Responsibility to us all to set the Example."

Not after the fact with masks after it has landed here.    How long ago did you read about the delta variant in India?  Then in the UK?  Or another country?

2021-08-03 15:00:15,"The Government shouldn’t be blamed for “whiplash” in its messaging.  It’s just trying to thread the fine line between the masked and vaccinated, who understand science is an ever changing discovery process, and the unvaccinated, who live in an ill-defined, uninformed haze.  Since ‘45 and Fox News have created a large, GOP-based population that are highly-excitable and unhinged, the only way forward is to treat them with kid gloves.  Not too much truth at any one time, please.  Anyone who follows the numbers knows perfectly well what’s going on and has never unmasked in spite of being vaccinated.  As for the rest?  They know what’s happening but their anger keeps them in a state of perpetual ignorance.  Not only are they hard to deal with and won’t respond to logic, they’re also getting more depressed as the futility of their uninformed lives play out.  I don’t think they’re living with themselves very comfortably at this time, and for some reason they can’t admit they’re headed down a very dangerous path.  Call it the ‘45 pathology.’"

Instead, they cast blame upon the Biden administration's efforts to undo the damage done by the previous administration by their lies about Covid-19 and lies about so-called cures.

The fight against Covid (and its variants, and its ability to mutate) is being fought on American soil. 

Even so, to too great an extent we’ve been counting on a select few—nurses, doctors, public health officials, and pharmaceutical companies—to win it for us. While some Americans have willingly masked up, social distanced, and gotten vaccinated, the country haven’t knuckled down. 

Certainly, it hasn’t knuckled down to anything like the extent it did—for years(!)—during WW2. It’s not at all clear we’re willing to. On top of that, it’s not even clear that our elected officials are prepared to lead in that direction. Trump certainly wasn’t, and it seems Biden isn’t, either. 

Biden is forever saying we can do anything, if we do it together. That “if” is huge, and it appears to be getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger. So big, in fact, that to say we can’t do anything may be more to the point. 

We see a similar lack of togetherness—and resolve—in our response to climate change."

Pfizer is also working on a booster, which is desperately needed, as data out of Israel, which is highly vaccinated, show effectiveness drops (this, from Reuters), and they’re giving third shots there now.  Moderna hasn’t even asked for expedited approval.  Variants were out there when Dr. Walensky told us we could take our masks off in most settings, now, the indoor recommendation “ weighs heavily her heart.”  The federal government has messed up.

Furthermore, with each new mutation/variant, the current vaccines will become less efficacious.  Furthermore, with approximately half of the nation choosing not to be fully vaccinated, even if the pharma-companies can try to keep us with the new variants, many people are just not interested.  For these reasons, the government and the press needs to bite-the-bullet and stop using language that suggests there will be a time when we can finally put this behind us. There won't."
2021-08-03 15:22:53,"Although it's tempting to blame the CDC for fluctuating messaging, a Times article the other day highlighted the difficulty of their task, which is that the unvaccinated remain so for myriad reasons. Further, because this is a novel coronavirus, we can't be certain how it will behave, especially with emerging variants every few months. The proliferation of social media, which amplifies the voices of those sowing disinformation, has also made it harder for official voices to be heard.

Because the ultimate goal is full vaccination, all messaging should aim to accomplish this goal through the following steps:
1) Vaccine Passports: At this stage, people can elect to remain unvaccinated, but at a penalty. No vaccine, then no restaurants, stores, working in an office, or boarding a plane. Falsifying a medical record such as a vaccine card should be a federal crime with a stiff fine for a penalty. This should encourage vaccination on those who just haven't gotten around to it yet.
2) Full FDA Approval for Vaccines. The FDA has already shifted its priorities to make this a reality within weeks, not months. Once fully approved, those who have been waiting on that hurdle should be persuaded.
3) Vaccine Mandates. Although it is tempting to skip right to this step, allowing the persuadable to make the decision on their own will minimize resistance and increase pressure on the defiantly noncompliant to do the right thing."
2021-08-03 15:18:43,"The primary confusion seems to be in those who relied on right-wing media/social media for their COVID information. President Biden and the CDC have done their job by providing the vaccines.

2021-08-03 15:34:24,"Have you checked today's new Covid case numbers? And the number of deaths? Numbers are going way north, meaning the situation is rapidly going south. There is no mystery as to what people should do, ignorance, stubbornness and unwillingness to do so."
2021-08-03 15:25:48,I don’t have whiplash. Viruses mutate and scientific knowledge builds over time. I also don’t get my information from the CDC (anymore).
2021-08-03 15:33:35,"Let’s be clear, any confusion about the policies and recommendations are the direct result of the large proportion of the population that has chosen not to get  vaccinated and the amoral and cynical politicians who encourage them. If not for them this pandemic would be quickly receding, at least in the USA."
2021-08-03 15:33:57,"It is painfully evident that people will not get the vaccine. There is a small minority who cannot get the vaccine due to health issues, such as being allergic to PEG. We needed a National Mask Mandate 18 months ago, and we need one now. That is the reality of this ever changing situation."
2021-08-03 15:36:02,"Most of the 'confusing' messaging was generated by those who chose to create 'confusion' or worse deliberately generated or relayed known lies and untruths. To illustrate: the CDC never said that if you were fully vaccinated that you couldn't become infected with Covid-19 but now those wanting to blame CDC for 'miscommunication ' act as if this is suprising 'new' information. Let's focus on those who willfully spread false information or who cleverly imply that CDC and public health statements may be false without actually asserting that they are false. Just listen to Tucker Carlson or Laura Ingram who have consistently undermined public health whether it related to the existence of the virus, masking or vaccinations. Let's put the blame where it belings: Trump who politicized the pandemic and all those who then followed Trump's lead."
2021-08-03 15:36:26,"The Biden administration is completely rudderless and in disarray in managing COVID.  Just check a graph of the diminishing number of tests that are being performed compared to when Trump was in office. Biden's national strategy for testing that he falsely campaigned on has been to diminish monitoring, testing and reporting,  There is also disarray with mask mandates among locations, poor messaging that is discouraging vaccination and no known plans to implement boosters. Instead there has been focus on the false pretenses regarding the eviction moratorium.  Yes, the US has become a full fledge banana republic with Biden and the progressives now in power.  Hopefully it is transient."
2021-08-03 15:42:05,"I do not agree entirely with: 
""An evolving virus and 18 months of ever-changing pandemic messaging have left Americans angry, exhausted and skeptical of public health advice""

Had this country done the following in a timely manner, we'd be in a much better place. 

Social distance
Wear masks
Get vaccinated

Granted, there was at least one major misstep regarding the public not needing masks when everyone in medical profession was wearing them. But overall, had we done 1-3 above, the data implies we'd be in a much better place."
2021-08-03 15:48:17,"At this point, focusing on getting the under 12 set vaccinated and getting FDA approval for the vaccines across the board should be our top priority. Perhaps mandating employers to not only give PTO for the vaccination itself, but also for 2 days to cope with any lingering side effects from the vaccine will encourage a solid number of the reluctant that we are likely to encounter in our day to day lives (store clerks, Uber drivers, etc)"
2021-08-03 15:50:00,"I'm not angry or exhausted.  I wish Covid was behind us, but the virus is new to us and things change as we learn and cope with it.  I have opted to wear my mask though I'm fully vaccinated.  I have also been more cautious about crowds and public places than my friends.

I watched my father die on a ventilator.  In comparison, wearing a mask is nothing."

Those who were wise about this are now much safer, and those who thought reality could be replaced with slogans, hate, victim blaming, ignorance, etc. are putting the rest of us at risk.

The pandemic is following the age-old rules of contagion, and those who think they don't apply are having a hard lesson in reality.

Next stop: global warming/climate change, which is a threat multiplier for the virus and everything else

Time to get wise and start working together to solve problems. No cults need apply."
2021-08-03 15:41:09,"Biden isn't leading in this crisis, he's following polls and what people's feelings are at the moment. That means he will always be behind this pandemic. He needs to create strong vaccine mandates, actually enforce them and be willing to make a bunch of people angry in the short run. He's focused on an agenda that doesn't include solving covid. Putting 5 G Internet into rural areas isn't the priority right now. Sending Jill to the Olympics in a mask is a joke. This country needs real leadership, not a feckless President."
2021-08-03 15:41:53,"People aren’t confused. Instead, they want “yes/no” answers and want others to do their thinking for them. 

In other words, they’re being lazy.

We have most of the information we need in order to make daily decisions. “Is it safe to eat in a restaurant?” you ask. Answer: It depends. Are you in an area where there is high transmission and low vaccination, or the reverse? Is the restaurant full of coughing people talking loudly over the sound system, or are the tables separated, people are seated and talking quietly? Is the staff wearing masks? Does it seem as if there’s adequate ventilation? Are YOU vaccinated?

Once you’ve made this assessment, make a choice. Lather, rinse, repeat.

Good grief, people, it’s not so hard. Stop the equivocating. Understand that there are no guarantees when it comes to COVID, only varying degrees of smart decision making.

Do the work, do your research, be safe, take care of others. Simple."

2021-08-03 15:43:23,"The messaging has been a disaster. There should be no more lockdowns, restrictions or mandates to protect the unvaccinated adults who have chosen to roll the dice with their lives and their health. Unvaccinated under-12s are not at any real risk from the virus (the flu is significantly more dangerous to that group, and we didn't require flu vaccines or masks to protect them before). If you are vaccinated, your risk of becoming seriously ill is negligible and your risk of dying is basically zero. It is not a public health concern, let alone a crisis, to have Covid being spread among vaccinated people. This is the only public health message that matters. The group responsible for 80%+ of Covid deaths (65+) are now largely protected (80-90% vaccinated in NY), so our hospitals are not going to be overwhelmed here. Let's get back to living and stop re-arranging our lives to protect the unvaccinated adults who have chosen not to protect themselves. (Immunocompromised can take extra precautions like wearing N95 masks and avoiding crowds if they feel the need to do that. If you look at the number of COVID deaths among the fully vaccinated population, it is clear that the vaccines are even effective for this population, despite evidence-less statements to the contrary.. Immunocompromised have always existed and have always had to take extra precautions to protect themselves.)"

Like asking your kid if you can pleeeease not serve candy for dinner. What the heck.

Add cynical politicians and TV entertainer types who vaccinate and then lie about this for political gain and you have a breeding ground for absolute stupidity and ignorance for the public. Why aren't these folks fined?"
2021-08-03 15:52:10,Let's be clear - we are suffering whiplash because not enough people got vaccinated up front and now we're swirling in variants and increasing hospitalizations. Hard to message in self-induced chaos.
2021-08-03 15:57:13,"The  C.D.C. is to blame for the  confusion regarding it's recommendation that the vaccinated resume wearing masks, for it's  reckless recommendation  that vaccinated  Americans could stop  wearing masks,  for the resultant spread of the highly contagious  Delta variant,  & for allowing the virus to mutate and spread further.

It was foreseeable that those of the unvaccinated  would be the first to toss their masks, & that the result would be catastrophic. 

 Biden's  announcement  that unvaccinated , but not vaccinated Federal employees , will have to wear masks, will contribute to the spread of the Delta variant.

 Biden  has contributed to the spread of the virus , including by  declaring  victory over the virus  & by holding and encouraging large July 4th gatherings.

Obama is well aware that the vaccines are not 100% effective, & that Delta is as contagious  as chickenpox, and doesn't care.
He thinks that his birthday is more important that are American lives.

The NYT quoted nurses quoting   COVID patients' last words  as  being : ""I can't breathe.""

Why  are  the desperate, gasping pleas  "" I can't breathe"" of COVID patients who wouldn't be hospitalized or dead had a mask mandate & vaccine mandate been issued less important that George Floyd's desperate ""I can't breathe""?"
2021-08-03 15:56:01,what did they expect? we should have learned the lesson from India where they proclaimed victory early and were then devastated by thr delta variant. we should have learned from Italy before that. we will never learn. i am all for just letting the masses fend for themselves ( the unvaccinated will just deal) but not everyone is unvaccinated by choice and one can still get the virus even aftr vaccination. it is a tough choice but mask mandates arent going to be the answer. refusing to pay for care for the unvaccinated who choose not to vaccinate or in some way enforcing fines is the only way to do this. hit them where it hurts since they are not smart enough to value their lives...
2021-08-03 15:59:20,"I wish they would stop saying breakthrough infections are rare when they have no evidence to support that claim. It harms their validity, particularly when people are seeing breakthrough infections all around them. 

In our multigenerational household, 4 fully-immunized adults, 1 fully immunized teen, and 3 children under the age of 12 all got COVID-19. We know of several other families with the same situation. But, know what? It was like a cold or mild flu. Focus on that (which is enough!) and stop saying it’s rare… which isn’t true, hasn’t been proven in research, and gives anti-vaccers more ammunition. Have they not learned after maskgate at the beginning of the pandemic?

Repeat after me, “No corroborating research means no claims,” otherwise you give confusion to the masses and legitimacy to the boneheads."
2021-08-03 15:57:18,"People lose trust when there's a lot of shift in decision-making. We know the virus is a moving target and science is still studying it. However, the media, CDC, and feds are to blame for lifting restrictions and allowing people to go unmasked. Mask and social distancing work. People need to follow procedures and do their part. The honor system doesn't work here nor anywhere."
2021-08-03 16:01:02,"This is not a big deal. We are dealing with a previously unknown disease and as doctors and researchers learn more about it and its mutations requirements will change.

Sort of a tennis game on caffeine.

2021-08-03 16:11:22,"It should come as no surprise that Americans would be ignorant about science.

2021-08-03 16:05:11,"Maybe it’s the whole concept of “public” health that has us as a nation off balance. Not what is convenient and expedient for ME or MY tribe, but rather, to be forced to consider OTHERS, the public risks and well being.  To protest over wearing a mask?  Really? That’s a hardship?  To doubt and parse the incredible achievement of a vaccine for a deadly contagion?  To not see all the efforts as pointing in the direction of trying to save lives, get through this without more mutation of the virus and costs to lives and livelihood?  If we were to look at the vaccine as the miracle that it is, the access to masks and sanitation as the gifts that they are we would get through this whole thing a lot faster.  Head spinning changes?  Seriously? It’s called nature! We are so used to controlling much of our lives with pushing buttons and clicking on and off. Life is complex and nuanced, nature is proving it has the upper hand.  We either get our heads out of the sand and do what we need to do or we will pay the price.  The virus isn’t interested in our inconveniences and “rights.” Having experienced the raging fires here in California for the past 2 years, i liken it to the ever changing situation on the ground, the ever changing warnings and instructions that we have to follow in order to stay safe till the fires can be put out.  We have to pay attention, be ready for change and we have to look out for one another.  The public."
2021-08-03 16:09:59,"The three electronics store employees in the photograph are standing way too close to one another.  I don't care that they are wearing masks, and being vaccinated is irrelevant at this point,  people need to spread out.   

Young people may not understand what ""as contagious as chicken pox"" means since most are now vaccinated with varicella but I am of  the generation that actually had chicken pox and my entire 5th grade class came down with it at the same time.  It was the norm for scores of children to be infected at once."
2021-08-03 16:14:59,"I don't have any confusion about this at all.  It is the people who refused to get vaccinated and became infected which allowed the virus to mutate into a more highly contagious form.  The CDC guidelines about not masking for those who were vaccinated were  before the Delta variant had gained a foothold, and before it became clear that the viral load harbored in the nasal passages in those who are infected is much heavier than with the previous strain, and therefore easier to spread through sneezing, etc.  The masking rules have been revised to reflect that change.
We have to remain flexible as we continue to navigate this pandemic and change as the virus itself changes.  Right now booster inoculations are being considered (some countries are going ahead with them), and if it is determined we need one, we have to roll up our sleeves.
One thing remains crystal clear and that vaccination remains the number one defense agaisnt this virus.  One young man stated to me (I and I don't know if it were original with him), that he thinks of the vaccination as a suit of armor and the mask as a shield.  I thought that was very well stated."
2021-08-03 16:14:56,"The ""enemy"" in this fight is not the scientists and politicians and business owners calling for indoor masking, distancing and vaccinations to protect and save lives. 

The Enemies of the State are the anti-vaxxeers, anti-maskers, social media conspiracists, Republican Trumpists, and money-sucking right-wing media who pretend that the moving target of viral mutation doesn't exist. And do everything possible to make sure there will be more out-of- control mutations, more ""confusion"" and more illness and death. And they do it with no accountability."
2021-08-03 16:13:38,"I’m not insanely mad at the passel of idiots who won’t get vaccinated, won’t just stick a simple darn mask on before they go into the store, and won’t stop hollering down the aisle. 

After all, I’m fully vaccinated, in decent health, and darn skippy do have a mask on. 

But I am some mad on behalf of the nice folks working in the local store and the farm stand; and, at the county and city pols who gutlessly duck out on their clear responsibilities, and the national politicians like deSantis and Abbott who actively make sanity harder so they can get stuff for themselves and their cronies and funders. 

Sorry, but yeah: mad at that is what mad is for. I just don’t let it drive me to belting some fool with a whole fresh chicken. 

And also sorry, but I’m oretty disgusted with the drivel I’m hearing from the anti-vaxx Fredonia brigades. Especially their phony questions.

Not a big fan of the “Why doesn’t Biden jist issue an edict and then make FDA skip the review and then force Congress to do what I say and then everything will be fine and we all get ponies for Christmas,” crowd, neither.

In their way, they’re just as unreasoning—and as scared—as anybody else."
2021-08-03 16:15:39,"Masks are a big request.  Mandates are going to be even more useless now than they were before.  

Might as well let this run its course among the unvaccinated.  For the vaccinated, the risks appear to be the same as dying from the flu (up to 30,000 deaths a year).

And let's be clear about all these stats:  Show me a pie chart, and on it:

-1 will be a child who died of COVID;
-1 will be a healthy fully vaccinated person who died of COVID;
-9998 will be unvaccinated, likely with some preventable health condition.

In other words, the risks to the unvaccinated and the risks to children don't even rise past the level of noise for overall risk in life."
2021-08-03 16:16:22,"The blame lies squarely on the main stream media who love a bad news story.  Of course, abetted by public health authorities, such as the CDC, who know that good news will undermine their ""authority"".  Here are good news points, which would never be advertised by the MSM and CDC:
--The death rate from COVID, even in the face of the supposedly catastrophic delta variant, is as low as it's been since March 2020.  
_--For children, seasonal influenza, even with the free availability of the flu vaccine, is about as deadly as Covid.
--Masking recommendations for any out of doors situation is frankly ridiculous and has never been shown to have any value whatsoever.  

It's  easy to blame vaccine refuseniks, who live in an alternate universe free of rationality.  But we should circle back to public health authorities who continue to issue useless guidelines designed to keep the public misinformed and in fear."
2021-08-03 16:17:17,I wouldn't use the term whiplash.   Are you trying to make your article sound more sensational so that more people will read it?  Anyone following the course of the pandemic would understand why they will need to adjust the level of precautions when the virus changes.
2021-08-03 16:17:28,"Have the unvaccinated SIGN UP to stay unvaccinated. 
Raise their insurance rates accordingly. Vaccinated first for hospitalizations.

Vaccinated not charged for public costs incurred for anti-public health behaviors- get private insurance for non-vaccination status.

Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, has said most gain-of-function studies “have done almost nothing to improve our preparedness for pandemics — yet they risked creating an accidental pandemic.” And here we are, helpless victims of inept scientists, who still think they have the gravitas and authority to tell us what to do to resolve the death and economic destruction that they created. Oh, and lose the cutsie slogans like, “Mask up” and “We’re all in this together!” We most definitely are not all in this together. Ask those folks about to be evicted from their homes."

2021-08-03 16:47:15,"A deadly virus is spread through respiratory routes.  The response?  Masks until vaccinations are available and continued mask wearing until the disease has been extinguished.  The messaging should have been clear and straightforward.  The firefighters leave when the fire has been put out.  The masks stay on until transmission ceases.  
My wife and I started wearing masks early on and are still wearing them in public places indoors even after full vaccination.  It's not hard, it's not strange.  You just feel good about protecting yourself and others.  Isn't that motivation enough?"

2021-08-03 16:40:04,"""Just the facts, ma'am."" The problem with the CDC is that they are too political, not dispassionately scientific enough. I blame it on Trump, but Biden hasn't changed it enough. They tell us what they think will make us behave as they think we should- not the facts on what those recommendations are made. So when the facts change (as they do so often in science- something new is discovered) and the old RX no longer the best one- they change it, without full explanation why. ""Dr."" Rand Paul is raising millions persecuting Dr. Fauci. It's no wonder everyone's confused. I'm not. I saw through their fairy tales about the N95, which they told us to keep us from hoarding, black marketing, stealing, counterfeiting and driving up the price while hospitals and the government were bidding against each other to control the available supply. Fauci should admit what they did and why, and maybe then Americans will start listening to his (good) advice. It's really very simple (in Biden's words) ""wear a mask whenever you're indoors with strangers until you can get vaccinated- and get vaccinated as soon as you can."" Then, when they change the message to ""wear the mask, even if you've been vaccinated"" they can explain that they've learned the Delta variant can be spread by vaccinated people, putting unvaccinated people at risk. Then it all makes sense."
2021-08-03 16:45:14,I knew when the Delta variant was wreaking havoc in India that it was only a matter of time that it would do the same here. That was enough warning for me.

2021-08-03 16:35:33,"Yes it was a huge mistake for the CDC to trust the unvaccinated to mask up, but the new guidance really isn't a flip flop on their part.  
Covid rates are going up and that's driven by the unvaccinated/unmasked. The CDC is now reacting to the  dramatic increases in Covid by asking everyone to wear masks.

I just hope they don't make the same mistake twice."

Since we don't or can't know who around us had been vaccinated, wear a mask to protect yourself until this virus dies out - no exceptions.

All this hand wringing and finger pointing by various media outlets and a populace that is intent on being spoon fed at every given moment plays a large part in diluting and obfuscating their messaging.

This is a complex virus that causes an equally complex disease. The molecular and cell biologists, virologists, public health scientists and physicians working on the virus and disease are doing a remarkable job. Despite the obvious profit motive, it is almost certainly true that a booster vaccination will help - it will typically increase antibody production but more importantly is likely to result in production of new higher affinity species of antibodies and to bolster the population of memory B and T cells - immune cells that will ensure a rapid response to a future infection. If given the opportunity to get a booster, I would do so without hesitation."
2021-08-03 16:59:28,"I’m really tired of hearing how tired people are of the changing guidelines. The virus changes, so must we all. If anyone had taken Covid seriously during the first outbreak we probably could have avoided the bulk of the whiplash."
2021-08-03 17:09:18,"It never went away, it didn’t go anywhere. People saw what they wanted to see. We have zero experience with a pandemic and very little with highly transmissible diseases. We need Fauci to keep to his job and we need to form a coalition of the best medicine, intelligence, bio defense among others. People think the CDC knows everything? They were the same ones telling us not wear masks March 2020."
2021-08-03 17:10:08,"People have to realize that the virus is changing and mutating (due to not enough people being vaccinated) so messaging will keep changing. Republican disinformation is responsible for people dying. Stop being wimps, use you brain, wear a mask and stop complaining! Government needs to get tough about needing proof of vaccination to participate in activities with other people."
2021-08-03 17:13:25,"Let's keep the message straight.  The CDC has provided generally good, clear guidance but it was often overshadowed by a pompous, self-absorbed President who advised otherwise.

We would not be where we are today - or have been for the past year - had it not been for the gross negligence of President Trump who did not fight the pandemic when it was small.  His stands against masking and social distancing let the pandemic run wild and kill over 600,000 deaths.  I think Trump's gross negligence makes him criminally liable for most of those deaths.

Trump does get credit for following advice on supporting vaccine development.  Biden also gets credit for working to make vaccinations more readily available.  The problem we now have is not due to a shortage of vaccines but to the shortsighted and selfish behavior of those refusing vaccination.

The failures of Trump and the non-vaccinators provided the Petri dish to incubate the Delta virus.  I hope they don't continue the pandemic until an even more deadly virus is created."
2021-08-03 17:18:12,"Me and the people in my bubble never came close to experiencing ""pandemic whiplash"" because, even after being vaccinated early on, we never significantly changed the protective measures we adopted.  We continue to wear  high-quality (N95) masks, shop early or on line, dine at home or on take out, etc.

One of my girlfriend's relatives from Queens who worked in the NYC school district contracted Covid  and died early in the first wave, likely in the days when de Blasio failed to acknowledge the threat and lock down the schools.  Fundamentally we are the left/progressive version of the distrust of politicians and their motivations in protecting our health."
2021-08-03 17:20:01,"It was rather difficult in February-March of this year to get vaccinated in NY using the internet, even if one tried multiple times for long hours. Finally, I was able to get an appointment  by telephoning a state number in the morning. In general,  NY has done a good job with 68.7% of New Yorkers  receiving the full cycle of shots.  but now the large centers are shutting down.  If so many are in need of booster shots, is this a wise decision?"
2021-08-03 17:18:03,"This whining about changing recommendations is grating; the world changes and we must change with it. How do people think the world works?

I'm imagining a platoon of soldiers whining ""you said we didn't need to take cover 10 minutes ago"". Yes, because 10 minutes ago no one was shooting at you...."
2021-08-03 17:16:03,"Well, if everyone had done what was safe and right to get vaccinated we wouldn't be whiplashed and probably also could have damped the mutation that created the Delta variant and curtailed its spread.
That's the past, now every unvaccinated person has to be vaccinated by whatever means it takes.  Just saying ""please"" and handing out $100 bills isn't enough."
2021-08-03 17:21:31,"It’s unclear as this article seems to imply that infections in vaccinated individuals with the delta variant are rare, given the experience in Provincetown, the fact that the C.D.C. is not tracking mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in those who are vaccinated, and the likelihood that the vaccinated elderly adhere more strictly to mitigation measures.

It also seems misguided to suggest that mitigation measures in vaccinated individuals need to be practiced only in areas of high incident infections since it is virtually certain that infections with the delta variant in every corner of our nation will increase ineluctably until rates are high everywhere.

Given the high viral titers documented in vaccinated individuals, it seems far more prudent to recommend that all individuals adhere to mitigation measures until vaccination rates approach 100 percent and case rates approach zero to minimize the transmission of this infectious scourge.

Is there any doubt that universal vaccination and indefinite mitigation are the safest and most socially responsible practices for the foreseeable future?

The messaging is pellucid."
2021-08-03 17:20:47,"The only way we are going to win this battle withe the virus is for vaccinations.  If you refuse to be vaccinated then you should lose the right to be allowed to be in any locations inside.  This includes your place of work, airlines, movies, restaurants and bars.  I realize this seems extreme but we need to do something to stop the spread."
2021-08-03 17:26:27,"What people are suffering from is ""whiplash"" they've largely created for themselves, the result of irrational expectations and premature conclusions drawn from incomplete evidence and constantly changing conditions. 

Science, and the policy advice drawn from it, is always conditional. The virus is always mutating. People's behavior is always changing, thus causing alterations in the behavior of the virus. Observations, data, and interpretations of them are always being revised accordingly.

When a vaccine is found to be 90-something percent effective against severe illness, what part of that is so hard to understand? Those odds are considerably better than with most of the vaccines ever devised -- including the annual flu vaccine (the formula for which has to be revised every year because that virus is always mutating, too).

Individual doctors and other experts disagree all the time, even when they're looking at the same set of facts. Anyone who's ever been hospitalized and dealt with more than one doctor knows how your own diagnosis and treatment can change from one shift to another. Sure, it's frustrating -- and often counter-productive. But it's how we learn.

We're dealing with medicine, which isn't an exact science. It's as much a matter of weighing risks and probabilities as anything. Don't treat it as if it were monolithic oracular dogma handed down by infallible gods. Because it's not."
2021-08-03 17:28:00,"The virus continues to mutate, thanks largely to unvaccinated individuals. The messaging has to evolve along with circumstances, so public health officials are just trying to keep up.

People need to tune out the un-social media noise and just use some common sense."
2021-08-03 17:30:19,"""Whiplash""? The virus is causing the whiplash thru its variations as expected. Wearing masks can be uncomfortable but what a small thing when one considers the possible consequences. Medical science will change constantly based on the results and impacts that occur along the way. People need to understand this and adapt, not rebel or ignore direction."
2021-08-03 17:24:55,"If everyone got the flu vaccine when it first became available, we most likely wouldn't be dealing with the ever-mutating strains – all of which emanate from the Spanish flu a century ago – to this day. And here we are with Covid-19, an even more transmittable and far more potentially fatal virus, leading to the same rate of vaccine resistance, or worse. When will we ever get it through our heads, unanimously, that personal preference should never overshadow public health? Probably never."
2021-08-03 17:41:30,"Here is my conundrum. I HAD Covid in late March and was infused with Regeneron at the hospital ER. The doctor there told me to wait 3 months and get the test for antibodies BEFORE I got vaccinated. MY doctor said otherwise, but I thought since the ER dr was on the front lines of dealing with the virus, he knew better. So, I went and had the antibody test at the 3 month mark and my number of antibodies was EXTREMELY high, per the individual who drew the sample(a pharmacist). I asked if I should get the vaccination and she said talk to your dr. I tried to get a straight answer from the CDC as to whether the infusion of Regeneron had acted almost as a vaccine since my antibody level was so high 3 months after my diagnosis and I got an email back referring me to their website WHERE there is ABSOLUTELY no information addressing my inquiry. My next call is to Regeneron.  I have no desire to take the vaccine if I am loaded with antibodies and will be going for another test shortly. I wear a mask and wash my hands constantly and only associate with people I know who have had the vaccine.  Since there is so much misinformation or questionable information being proliferated, I will wait to get the vaccine. I had a virus, of ""unknown"" origin in late April 2019 and I CLEARLY believe now that it was COVID19!"

2021-08-03 17:39:06,"First, I had to mask to protect myself from the Covid deniers.  Now, I have to mask to protect the unvaccinated (a.k.a. Covid deniers).  There is no shortage of irony in these unUnited States."
2021-08-03 17:33:54,"Americans must stay vigilant during this pandemic by wearing a mask outside of their homes, social distancing, and washing their hands. Now that it is easier to obtain the COVID19 vaccines it is incumbent upon all to get them or be tested frequently. The medical field is giving guidance as quickly as they can identify trends in the variants. I follow all advise given at the start of this pandemic and I do not intend to stop until the fat lady sings. I drove 520 round trip miles for the vaccines two days after they were available."
2021-08-03 17:39:44,"I'm not ""angry, exhausted and skeptical"".  Because I was able to get a working vaccine for this virus within about a year, and that's an amazing scientific and medical success.   These ""experts"" the media would like to get us angry at have done an amazing, and historically unprecedented, job even while working under disfunctional political systems.   

Americans, rather than reading this article and nodding, need to grow up, quit whining and face reality.    But if you'd rather spend your life being ""angry, exhausted and skeptical""  then be my guest."
2021-08-03 17:33:31,"Trump downplayed the seriousness of the virus and that message has since been amplified by Republican governors and their media.  Reporters and other pundits believe that the threat of violence, which was briefly condemned but grudgingly accepted later, has played no role in these mandates are not looking at this situation honestly. This new spike could have been predicted as the administration was expected to open up the country by the 4th or earlier. Republican officials and all of media made it clear that vaccination status really played no role in whether the pandemic would end or not. It has been an utter failure."
2021-08-03 17:35:04,"It's not my job to mask up again to protect the unvaccinated.  I did my part and got vaccinated.  The unvaccinated feel justified and safe because the citizens who did their duty did it to protect both themselves and their fellow humankind and if we are forced to mask up, they will feel safe in still not getting vaccinated. Those with compromised immune systems should stay home as much as possible and mask up when they do have to leave the house.  The unvaccinated can figure it out.  I am living my life. COVID will probably be here forever, so do what you can to protect yourself."
2021-08-03 17:39:44,"There's not a lot of whiplash going on for people that are paying attention. Distance and respiratory protection continue to work, just like they did before. We now have an even more powerful tool to add to that repertoire:  Vaccines. If these tools and strategies are broadly adopted, cases go down and life gets more normal. None of this is too complicated.

In other news, water is wet."
2021-08-03 17:35:30,"Why do we expect that the best plan of action should never change? In particular, why do so many in the press feel this is in some sense a scandal (as the tone of the article and headline conveys)?

The best public health response to the Covid threat changed not only as we became more knowledgeable about the behavior of the virus but also as we became more knowledgeable about the behavior of the populace and popular leaders. Who could have predicted that so many would actively sabotaged our public health response?

That is the scandal, not scientists' inability to tell a consistent story."
2021-08-03 17:43:16,Only people who were not paying attention are getting whiplash. Anyone with a brain cell realized the people that were against masking would also not get the vaccine and would most likely lie about it and be the most reckless once things got relaxed. I got the vaccine and even though I live in CA I never stopped using masks cause I stopped trusting my fellow Americans a few years ago. I even recently upgraded to N95 which I did not do last year. Variant D is no joke.
2021-08-03 17:44:43,"The advice changed when we learned more about the disease. Are you really suggesting that Americans are so whiny and ignorant that they cannot deal with evidence based updates. If you really believe that, then we are not ready for democracy."

2021-08-03 17:56:35,"The simple fact is that the CDC pulled the mask mandate too soon, probably in response to political pressure. Now, when I wear a mask inside in the mostly Republican area where I live and where the vaccination rate is only 49%, I get weird, even angry looks from some people.  I get where the public health community is coming from, they want to get more people vaccinated so they emphasize the advantages, like not having to wear a mask. But now feel like the CDC cannot really be trusted and I am on my own in trying to protect myself and family. Agree with this article that public messaging is an essential part of a public health response. Yes you need the science, but we all know that scientists do not always agree, and are constantly modifying their positions based on ever changing data. Unfortunately, an  effective public health response  requires consistent messaging that tells it like it is, even if it is not what people want to hear. And that requires political skill which many scientists lack. Scientists have an essential role to play in dealing with the pandemic, but they cannot be the whole game."
2021-08-03 17:56:37,"The Headline to this column as in many others of Americans' Pandemic knowledge and experience seems to be superficial and very misleading. For those who claim confusion over the subject's topic are either telling stories to conform to Right Wing audiences or are deliberately adding to the outright skepticism of medical science. For everyone else the messages from front line hospital staff is quite clear and concise: Get vaccinated, wear a mask, socially distance, and quarantine as rates of infection rise in your community. 
This is not complicated. Refusing to comply to these simple guidelines is foolhardy at best. And everybody knows about the worst outcomes. People who minimize, cry freedom, beg personal choice, cite conspiracies, age and prior infection immunity are passing false information on to their families, friends, and peers. 
And then their are the outright liers from the top republican broadcasters, politicians, and yes, even their own clergy.
And now, as predicted a thousand times greater version of Covid-19 called the ""Delta Variant"" is upon us with a vengeance. 
Wise up, stop fooling yourself and get vaccinated now. The wait and see time has been long gone. Don't follow it to an horrific ending for you and your loved ones."

And while it might be tempting for journalists and news organizations to infantilize ""the public"" we are indeed capable of reading between the lines, thinking, and dealing. You are expecting government agencies and scientists to function as truthsayers and seers. In real life, stuff is confusing. Stop creating drama. Report the facts. Let us judge. My thinking has not changed in over a year. I mask when I am inside or around folks I don't know. I got my vaccine as soon as I could. I will continue to mask. I understand agencies and scientists, who are people, don't know everything. I deal with it."
2021-08-03 18:05:23,"It's tough to put the genie back in the bottle as far as mask behavior is concerned. At the gym where I exercise (which has not resumed its own mask requirement), I'm one of a small number wearing masks -- and in a heavily vaccinated (and blue) part of town where the residents lean toward caution. At the grocery store (which has also not resumed its mask mandate), I'm one of 20% of shoppers and employees with masks on. I understand the rarity of breakthrough cases, but I'm still surprised that the latest CDC warnings haven't broken through."
2021-08-03 18:03:03,"I have no problems with the government. I understand that a pandemic isn’t a static situation and that the public’s behavior will often affect and change of the government’s response…. 

If people had actually done as asked and first, sheltered in place as much as humanly possible for a few weeks we might have tamped this down…. But that didn’t happen, so we went on to a solution with a term longer viability- masking and social distancing, but people wouldn’t or couldn’t do that effectively…. Then we got the vaccines - hurrah, right? Well only if everyone steps up and gets theirs….. so backward we go…

I’m fed up personally. As soon as the kids can be protected too, I am absolutely finished with bending over backwards to protect anti-vaxxers and COVID deniers."
2021-08-03 18:05:01,"I looked up the CDC mission statement

Says nothing about “behavioral science”

That’s because they are virologists and risk management is to be left to the people we elect to make these decisions

It’s not the role of Dr Rochelle Wallensky or Dr Fauci.

It is a cheap and easy way to fill their 24/7 air time. 

The virus is not going anywhere and will continue to mutate; get vaxed.

I'm vaxed.  I'll avoid any place that mandates masks as much as possible, but know this, the hand-wringers are meme-ing us down a road where masks are forever.... Once we get enough people vaxed; they will start hand wringing about the people that can't get vaxed (~4% of the US population).

Emails to our Covid officer and health director last week have gone unanswered. The CDC recommends everyone in our county should mask indoors now.

This is the height of confusing messaging and it feels like no one is charge other than the Delta Variant."
2021-08-03 18:23:14,We were advised at the beginning of the pandemic that this would happen. No surprise...
2021-08-03 18:25:48,"I am writing to comment on the headline and general tone of the article. Looking for guidance from those who know more is an ingredient to human growth... but we all know the consequences of un-checked obedience, and whiplash is one of the least worrisome results. We grownups, willing to reflect upon the general situation and the particular COVID situation, know 2 things: (that the headline and tone seem to subvert) 1. The leaders (political/governmental, in particular) don’t know any more than any other citizen and science leaders at least know this is an experiment on the fly... 2. If Americans look deep, past the surface talking-heads, trust their compassion for family, neighbors, local community and themselves... they do know what to do. They know the difficult, but righteous action.
We are continually learning what the consequences of our leap to Democracy are... and one lesson might be that when we get whiplash... we have given too much credence to our ‘leaders’ and not taken enough responsibility."
2021-08-03 18:23:34,"This headline and lede are a great example of the failure to communicate well - I think the only people who have “whiplash” and are confused are ones who cannot process information (in abundance yes) and make logical decisions. Bottom line, viral infections are stymied by people wearing masks or face coverings… Since the virus never went away, logically minded people kept their masks on… and we understand that a small portion of the population may not be able to wear masks, so it was also important to wear our mask not only to protect us but them too. 

I emphatically agree with mask mandates, but just because the mandate is lifted doesn’t mean we don’t retain some personal responsibility for our health… For example, purchasing and smoking cigarettes are perfectly legal everywhere but I don’t smoke because I hear it’s bad for my health; looked fun and cool when I was a kid but I’d heard the health experts on the dangers of smoking so I never started. We cannot abdicate our responsibility to ourselves by ignoring the science."
2021-08-03 18:26:34,"I'm not angry at the experts or even at imperfect messaging or good-faith errors in guidance we can recognize in hindsight. This has been an unprecedented health emergency and the people handling things, whether from a public health position or on the front lines, are mostly doing the best they can in a very difficult situation. 
I *am* angry at the millions of Americans who are so addicted to simple narratives and easy answers that they're citing the (predictable) changing reality of an infectious diseases as ""proof"" that there's too much uncertainty to take any of the recommendations or guidance to heart. It doesn't help that one of our major political parties has gone all-in on ""skepticism"" towards anything they find inconvenient or in conflict with their fairytale ideology of ""free markets"" and ""personal freedom,"" and has been modeling the most irresponsible leadership since day one."
2021-08-03 18:30:01,"When Republicans play politics with our pandemic, everything done by everybody with respect to the pandemic is unavoidably politicized.  The CDC messaging was bound to change because the virus is a changing foe and our understanding of it also grows.  But the changing messaging gives an opening for politicization and for partisans to seek partisan advantage.  

We are at war with an enemy that learns and improves.  This learning occurs through evolution rather than conscious planning, but the effect is much the same.  The virus will discover new, more effective ways to come at us, and we must be mentally prepared to change our strategies to meet it.  Those who do not believe in evolution should think of the virus as an intelligent alien organism continually developing more effective weapons with which to equip its billions of foot soldiers to capture parts of our bodies and turn them into virus factories.  Whether our eyes and ears were designed by God or evolution, they enable us to see and hear.

The CDC was torn between presenting the best truth it has, presenting a truth with the best chance of acceptance, and presenting a truth that will not get the truthteller muzzled or purged or discredited.  This third factor makes its job absolutely impossible.  

We need to be skeptical of politicians and businessmen and advertisers who talk about science; science is hard enough by itself."
2021-08-03 18:33:24,"Changes in approach to Covid have been necessitated by the understanding of how it works as medical research has learned more and more about it.  Americans are largely science ignorant, so if something isn't black and white and unchanging, they can't deal with it, or think somebody is fooling them for some reason.  Put this together with craven politicians and right wing propaganda media using Covid for their own purposes, and you have massive refusal to take life-saving vaccines, which 50 years ago, would have been unbelievable in the face of the medical miracle that they provide..."
2021-08-03 18:34:35,One of the realities research scientists deal with on a daily basis is that conclusions change based on new data.

2021-08-03 18:40:52,"But if communications IS the response, why doesn't CDC have its own communications branch and experts? Why does the White House has to provide them, and therefore make them seem tainted by politics? 
On another topic, as a general measure, a default measure, it is good to keep in mind that expert advice changes because the situation is fluid. I am glad I am vaccinated and I believe that vaccinated people are pretty much protected, but that may change, or a new discovery made, so it is good policy to be cautious. I generally mask and social distance, even if I am vaccinated as a precautionary measure. Even when Walesky said masks off for the vaccinated, I did not, at least indoors. Anyway, some of these measures have become pretty normalized so it is not such a big deal. Just like wearing seat belts. We're in for the long haul while that virus keeps circulating and mutating."

I find it interesting that it seems that people have such a hard time understanding that this is an ever changing situation and there is no one size fits all solution. It is also idiotic for so many people to get angry at an ever changing message with an ever changing virus and yet refuse to accept and do the few things that have been proven to work. I’m not mad at the CDC, Fauci, Biden etc… I am angry with my fellow Americans who can get angry at everyone else but cant walk and chew gum at the same time."

You would understand that information changes because we will know more facts about the ""new"" virus as time moves on. It's the same principle that we use with astronomy. We used to think that Saturn had a few moons (the big ones we could see with land-based telescopes, then when we were able to send probes into space we learned that it has dozens. Does this mean I should be skeptical of astronomy? Did they lie? No, science is always changing as we know more."

2021-08-03 18:49:16,"Why is trust in our institutions breaking down?  Probably due to several interrelated factors but I can think of a few:

The phenomenon of the Noble Lie -- see the recent Slate article.  Officials are treating the public like children, lying to them for their own good, and the result is an erosion of trust.  We can handle uncertainty and debate.  We are adults.  

The phenomenon of the Agenda-Driven Media -- recall the CNN chyron that became a meme:  ""Fiery Yet Mostly Peaceful Protests"".   What started on Fox News is now ubiquitous across the media landscape:  agenda driven reporting to advance a narrative, not wrestle with difficult truths and complexity.

The phenomenon of Trump and a Post-Truth Democracy.  Trump may have ushered in a post-truth age in which there is little political accountability for lying. Trump's unique combination of boorishness, narcissism and lack of curiosity and focus crippled his administration but may have permanently degraded our national discourse.

The phenomenon of the Trump resistance at all costs.  As bad as Trump was, it didn't justify abandoning critical thinking and truth-seeking in order to thwart or oppose him.

On the contrary, there is absolutely no cause for surprise.  We are experiencing exactly the outcomes we asked for with our behavior.  We refused to wear masks and to social distance. We refused to  get vaccinated.  We refused to take COVID seriously as the killer that it is.  We refused to believe the science that told us of countless mutations, some of which would be even more dangerous than the original virus.  On top of all this, we refused to care about our neighbors who might be and were ultimately affected by our choices.  Americans have no one to blame for our current situation but ourselves.  We have ceased to be a viable society, or maybe Covid has just exposed what was already true about us."

But this article is claiming that breakthrough infections in vaccinated people ""are still very rare."" So which is it?  Either the May 1st claim by the CDC is a total lie or the claim in this article by Dr. del Rio is a total lie.  No need to respond.  I've completely given up on the ridiculous messaging."

So if they can´t travel even if vaccinated because of a risk of spreading the Delta variant, are vaccines then not the solution at all? And why can Americans travel freely around the world with no risk of bringing the Delta variant back? Is it just me or where is the logic trying to get people to trust the vaccines and still not giving vaccinated people more rights?

2021-08-03 19:12:51,"“What’s happening is this is real-time public health messaging in a pandemic around data that is just emerging. That is just the reality, and that doesn’t necessarily provide comfort or always the kind of answers that people understand.”

So, so close.

The CDC, White House, Governors, Mayors and local health officials are falling over each other to be first to divine what steps are best in the face of a threat that's (literally) evolving and data that's constantly changing. Time and again, we've seen today's best practices (e.g. mask if you're high-risk, no need to mask if you're vaccinated) become tomorrow's worst case scenarios. 

Of course, none of the people tasked with messaging are even willing to consider the possibility that they might be sending the wrong message. Instead, they simply take the position that the data has changed, rendering previous messaging moot. 

Throw in some broad claims that ""there's a lot of disinformation out there"" without really specifying what that disinformation might be or just why it's wrong, and the whole picture is about as clear as mud. 

It's not that people don't understand what they're being told. Unfortunately, their experience by now has taught them that whatever they're hearing today is likely to change (or be countered by an equally-authoritative talking head) in a day or two."
2021-08-03 19:16:52,"I dispute the fact that Americans are unable to sift through the changing landscape of CDC recommendations.  Clearly, those folks who continue to refuse vaccination simply use any loopholes to dispute vaccine effectiveness, mask mandates, and distancing and prefer to rely on DJT's original hypothesis that the virus would simply ""go away"".  Heck, they've never trusted centralized government anyway.  They will not be convinced of any recommendations until their demigod DJT does the patriotic thing and urges them to get vaccinations.  Any why doesn't DJT do so?  Because he prefers to allow his followers disinformation which results in the further distrust of government.  It is a frightening loop which I fear only DJT can short circuit.  If even something as simple as vaccine effectiveness can be undermined, then think of the diabolical opportunities of that sort of mind control."

We've spent more than a year listening to the right wing throw a hissy fit about how wearing a mask ""violates their freedom,"" while the rest of us took sensible precautions, even when they were inconvenient or burdensome. Now, we have a safe and effective vaccine that would allow us to go back to relatively normal. But the same people refuse the vaccine too, because ""freedom."" 

Thanks to this insane construction of ""freedom""--which has zero basis in the constitution and is really just pure selfishness and knee-jerk obstinance--we're ALL paying the price. I take comfort in that I'm vaccinated and therefore relatively safe. My heart goes out to anyone who is immune-compromised, high risk, or unable to get vaccinated for medical reasons. They are the real victims.

And the CDC, in many cases, has been overcautious and too leery of alternative theories that go against scientific consensus, which in increasingly political, nowadays -- this is most apparent in how scientists gave their mark of approval and the mainstream media acted as apologists for super-spreader Black Lives Matter protests while lambasting Trump's comparatively small political rallies. Furthermore, the mainstream media parrots the CDC's directives as if they're gospel, when science and scientific ""consensus"" is constantly changing shape to conform to new discoveries. In summary, there needs to be more transparency and less partisanship, which, needless to say, leading publications such as the New York Times have had a heavy hand in.

But what's scary is that the cat is truly out of the bag here when it comes to masking and they have literally no idea how far out of the bag it is. Giving carte blanche to those who are unvaccinated on an honor system was and will continue to prove absolutely disastrous. Even among many of the vaccinated, there is no going back from the point Walensky essentially said, 'If you're vaccinated, you don't need to mask up. We're returning to normalcy.' It was and continues to be an absolutely astonishingly foolish and short-sighted decision and it is incredibly discouraging to seemingly have more common sense as to the outcome than the director of the CDC. Point blank - I have lost faith in them and hundreds of thousands of others have, too. Good luck on getting that back, Rochelle. Newsflash: you won't!"

I would love to see this sentence as a headline instead of having it buried halfway down in the story. Instead we seem to be living in some high school biology class fantasy where the correct answers are always in the back of the teacher's book and people get angry when the ""right"" answer changes.  This virus has delivered multiple nasty surprises needing new guidance and instead we get politicians who blame the other side rather than the virus. Meanwhile gratitude for the progress that has been made appears to have left the building along with empathy for the hundreds of thousands of families who have lost someone to this disease. Americans may be exhausted but, to quote NIH Director Dr Frank Collins, the virus does not care that we are sick of masks. And would that we could see the virus as our common enemy, not each other."

Biden is not sufficiently emphatic about the need to vaccinate. He just repeats in an almost toneless manner ""please folk, vaccinate, it is good for all."" That will do nothing. He has to provide more info about risks, more analogies like tobacco or seatbelts, or polio or measles vaccines, things that have been normalized. When he addresses the public (maybe that is his style) he sounds like if he's saying, ""please folk, drink milk and eat fruits, it is healthy for you."" HE does not convey urgency. Not a good communicator. And on  Pres. Obama, not a good time to party and celebrate his 60 years. Maybe next year. Will Biden be there without a maks?"
2021-08-03 19:47:36,Wearing a mask indoors is a simple and easy sacrifice to make when considering the alternatives which are: 1. You getting sick or 2. getting someone else sick.

We can't let insolent screaming two year old man babies lead us to slaughter any longer.

Together that is a huge portion of the population. We are no longer in a ""pandemic"" scenario although being careful is still a very good idea so should be the ""advice"" given.

Yes, sceptical because the messages have not been based on facts and statistics that are shared with the public so they can decide the real risks they take. 

-- Basing a whole Delta variant policy on the study of a few people in Massachusetts is not really what most would call ""great science"". Comparing the first wave with this one when we are at 80 thousand positives for 300 deaths is not conducive to convincing either.  

-- Requiring 3 years olds to wear masks on long haul flights when there is no evidence that young children fall ill or spread the virus like adults do is fanciful at best. 

-- Schools have been open in most of the world since last summer with no evidence of massive outbreaks anywhere, yet the teachers' union in the US have fought every effort to get kids back where they need to be for their mental and physical health. 

The more heavy handed overreactions have made it more difficult for citizens to believe some of the ""messages"" in the US and Europe, not easier."

2021-08-03 19:53:24,"COVID has pressed the CDC into a much more public role than it ever had in the past.  This public role has resulted in real-time public analysis of an evolving virus.  Since most of the participants in this public analysis process are not scientists, they seek certainty and predictable outcomes.  Alas, there is no certainty to be found in science's understanding of the Corona Virus, and this is what we would expect.  The problem is, how does the federal government keep the public informed and avoid confusing them.  I think a first step is to not rely on the CDC to be the public messenger. I am not suggesting the CDC is doing a bad job; I am suggesting that there needs to be some organization that interprets the CDC analysis for public consumption."

C) Proof of vaccination passports must be the highest priority, stat.
D) It does no good for Walmart to insist execs be vaccinated but not staff. 
E) Tyson, to name one, has given staff until late November to be vaccinated. Why such lead time?
F) federal labor department needs to exclude people from future unemployment benefits if they are fired for being unvaccinated. 
G) Whitehouse needs to get every federal agency in lockstep to control the endless mixed messages.
H) MSNBC and CNN  are not helping their liberal viewers like me, with endless harangues about COVID by unofficial spokespersons. Stick to official government people, and have them sparingly, you know, like when there’s news. 
I) liberal Americans have done a great job, but we are reaching the end of our ropes. It’s time for punishment, shaming, and shunning of those who are sabotaging what we the smart have tried to do.

Maybe these whipsaws will get us to pay more attention and cut through the noice, but count me as one of the deeply fatigued.

And when it changes again, I will change too. That’s life!

Masking is a minor irritation, and well worth protecting myself and others. I got vaccinated as soon as I was able, and will get a booster if (when?) advised. It’s a small set of measures to protect myself, the people I love, and my community- even those foolish enough to ignore common sense and science. Even fools deserve love and care.

To be offered the opportunity to unmask in May in a very low infection/high vaccination rate state was wonderful, but at the same time premature, realizing how difficult it is to get people back to mask wearing if the epidemic resurged again, as it seems to have done now and into the winter months.

Our new normal is changing yet again, and although my family never changed, it is difficult not to enjoy the happiness of normality outdoors and in the comfort of our local restaurants and stores. But to leave our locale, even into the big city, not just out of state, has us masking up and looking at other state's residents not doing the same.

I believe that Govenor Scott's willingness to explain his policy decisions in bi-weekly, sometimes 90 minute long press briefings aired via radio, TV and social media,his cabinet's rationale of adapting CDC and other advice to meet the specific needs of this state, and a policy of making it as easy as possible for people to get tested and vaccinated, even if it means taking the tests and vaccine to homes and workplaces, have made it possible for most people here to trust the messages and comply."

And speaking of the load, have studies actually confirmed this higher load?  Do they know how short its life is in vaccinated people?  Reports are that it is very short-lived.

And speaking of short-lived, when does CDC expect this surge to end?  Dr. Scott Gottlieb said shortly.  Is a mask mandate really the solution to a short-lived problem?"

For the rest, stop making excuses. Accept that it is still evolving. Just do it."

2021-08-09 23:19:58,"Dr. Krugman writes, ""Yet here we are: Trying to limit a deadly pandemic, even via vaccines that convey huge benefits at little risk, has become a deeply partisan issue. How did that happen?""

It is clear that writers such as Dr. Krugman still do not understand the real motivation of Trumpist (and the majority of) anti-vaxxers. When Trump was elected in 2016, the common mantra was that he was using his voters, that they were hapless dupes who were conned. 

In fact, the reverse was true. His voters were using him as a blunt force instrument against the rest of us. Their support for him was the first shot across the bow in the soft civil war that has started in this country. 

Fast forward to the pandemic. Trumpist anti-vaxxers are using the pandemic just as they used Trump - to harm the rest of us. They have weaponized a once in a century pandemic for just one reason - they want to do whatever they can to harm us, just as they wanted when they voted for the most spectacularly unfit man to ever hold the presidency. 

Make no mistake. Trumpists are using their anti-vax stance as the next weapon in their arsenal. They want to defeat Biden. They want to ensure that everything the Democrats try to do fails. 

And what better way than deliberately keeping this nation in the throes of a horrific pandemic? Trumpists see their own deaths as acceptable losses in the war against the rest of us. It is really that simple."
2021-08-09 23:35:27,"The right wing's Covid denial is nothing less than coldly inhumane, Dr. Krugman.  And they know that too.  However, by continuing to sow doubt and disinformation about the pandemic and life-saving vaccines, the GOP has definitely made a concerted political calculation. That is, ""owning the libs"" is fully worth the worst human fallout from Covid obfuscation.  

To do otherwise would be to deviate from the GOP playbook assembled under their leader DJT. Our past president made denial and failure to take responsibility the hallmark of his presidency.  Just the other day, when asked about the vaccines, he first said that folks should get them. He then quickly walked that back by asserting people should still have ""freedom of choice"" in the matter.

And there you have it.  Stick to your position no matter how contradictory it seems.  Why?  Because the GOP base doesn't want any compromises on the matter.  If Pres. Biden and the Dems can be made to look bad, the GOP has done its job.  And never mind the needless suffering it has engendered. 

So now Florida's governor, Mr. DeSantis, has picked up the same playbook.  As hospitals fill with Covid patients, he refuses to issue mask mandates, and threatens state municipalities that do.  In his mind, he too is ""owning the libs"".

This defiance isn't going to change.  It will be viewed as strength by the base, and will ensure (in the GOP's mind) election wins.  ""And [thus] the right's descent continues, with no bottom in sight""."
2021-08-09 23:40:13,"This irrationality is not restricted to the US. Until recently, Australia had been able to completely contain a number of outbreaks of covid in different states. 

A few weeks ago, an outbreak of the delta variant began in Sydney, the largest city, and capital of the state of New South Wales. The centre-right state government had previously chastised other states (led by centre-left governments) for going into quick, complete lockdowns to overcome covid outbreaks. They pretended that they had a better, more business-friendly way of dealing with the virus than those dreadful supposedly anti-business leftist state governments - which had done such a good job in completely suppressing all previous outbreaks. 

So the NSW government dithered as the outbreak rapidly grew, fearing the inevitable criticism. Eventually a lockdown was imposed - leading epidemiologists say at least a week too late. But the imposed “lockdown” was far too weak and was ignored by many, so the outbreak has now exploded. 

Currently, the whole state of NSW is under threat and the delta variant is seeding into the other states as well.

This is a serious misreading of what's going on.  The GOP is a white supremacist party that believes in democracy, but only for white folks.  The ""Don't Tread On Me"" and ""Come And Take It ""(my ar-15) flags that flew during the January 6 insurrection tell us all we need to know.  No one is going to order Trump's base around.  They follow Trump because he's a racist--no other policy position really matters.  If Trump's poll numbers don't plunge after OPPOSING the new infrastructure plan--which you would think Trump's base would love--then the truth of this assertion should be self evident.

So the reason GOP governors like DeSantis and Abbott oppose covid restrictions is because they must send a signal to the base that white people will finally be able to do what they want without gov't interference if Republicans prevail.  And there's probably a subliminal message being conveyed that whites are genetically stronger than the inferior races and will thus survive the pandemic while the weaklings among us die."

In the short term, they win. They get the shot of serotonin from owning us this week, and that keeps them going. Apparently they don't know next week is coming. 

As adaptive thinking humans who plan ahead, it is clear to us that short term thinking is detrimental: to life, to the quality of life, and to our survival as a species. The only protective rational response is to disengage from evolutionary dead ends and let them be. Our informal and formal processes should have nothing to do with this subset. Let them alone, let them prove or disprove the effectiveness of their thinking. But don't spend one thin dime on them. Treat them the way the are treating us now, completely ignore their existence and carry on like rational adults.

By the way, people who live and die by the market should live and die by the market. Insurance rates depend on personal behavior. Insurance companies should absolutely trip over themselves and rush to increase rates on anyone who remains unvaccinated without a medical exemption."

If the earth's climate is going to change over time do we really think we can stop it from doing so?  All we can do is adjust, and that's exactly what we're doing.  Think of the vast changes electric vehicles and solar and wind power of all kinds for all kinds of applications will effect.  What is causing this, government policy or technological (cost-cutting) innovation?   Unfettered capitalism, doing its usual thing will produce the changes needed, political hysteria only gets in the way.

In a national emergency like coronavirus, the national government must have the authority to check tinhorn politicians like DeSantis and Abbott who are foolishly risking thousands of lives. Either the president must have the power to remove them from office, or the federal government, the CDC, must have the authority to override anti-social, irrational decisions they make about, for example, mask and vaccine mandates. That would have the virtue of allowing national coordination of the anti-virus campaign. And though the drawback is that it might fail to take into account local conditions, we would have to accept that, to save lives."

Obama bragged about all the oil and gas that was extracted during his presidency, and now Biden is appointing Exxon personnel to key posts and bargaining away some of his campaign climate promises to the Republicans even though the Democrats hold majorities in both chambers.

It's basically reactionary.

The climate and Covid deniers--the anti-science, religiously fundamental, ""my freedom trumps (pun intended) everything else"" are a last gasp from a world that they accurately see is ending rapidly--a world in which they had the upper hand all the time, and now increasingly don't.

And they fear this.  They know how they've treated those outside their own narrow tribe, and they're afraid they'll be treated that way if they lose even a little bit of their power advantage.  So they will do anything to hold onto it--including losing considerable numbers of their own tribe.

When one needs to hold to a worldview in order to maintain one's power identity, not even death will dissuade one from it--because without that identity, life would not be worth living anyway."
2021-08-10 01:31:30,"We’ve been seeing numerous impacts catching many scientists by surprise with how soon they are occurring.  In 2014 two independent teams of scientists reported that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is likely irreversibly retreating. 3.3 meters of sea level rise equivalent of ice there is being destabilized by a warming ocean and energy is going into the net melting of ice all over the planet. 

The paleoclimate record indicates that increasing global temperature by just 1.5-2 °C above preindustrial temperature commits the system to an eventual 6-9 meters of sea level rise, a large fraction of which could arrive within the next 100 years.

Corals may not survive this century of warming and acidifying oceans, and droughts and floods linked to global warming—and conflict linked to those droughts—have already caused four countries to face famine.

Because of the decades to millennial long lag between a climate forcing and our feeling the full effect, due to the thermal inertia of the ocean and response time of the ice sheets, the effects we are feeling now are largely just the beginning of the result of emissions from the 20th century. And emissions have been increasing steadily for decades.

We are also seeing numerous amplifying feedbacks: loss of albedo (heat reflectivity) from ice melt, permafrost melt, methane release and massive wildfires; the Earth is starting to wrest any possible further human control of the climate away.

We're about out of time on this, if not already."

2021-08-10 01:34:56,"You're correct. Al Gore wrote a book called The Assault on Reason in 2006 that explains the modern conservative mindset. Gore updated the book in 2017 to explain the post-truth Trumpist era, which I will have to check out. All the forces that coalesced to defeat Gore in the 2000 election are still around and have only gotten worse since then. Instead of advocating for contained, foreign errors like the war in Iraq, they're allowing illogical errors to consume our country. It was once acceptable to say that the GOP still had some sense left in it because no one is so irrational as to destroy their own chances for power. But if you look at DeSantis and Abbott, they're encouraging their own followers to die by not getting vaccinated. After a while of this, they're going to run out of followers. So at some point, one has to recognize it is not rational and then make the connection that this type of irrationality cannot defy death for long. Eventually all of those cognitive errors come back to you and the chickens come home to roost. But it's not like reason requires everyone get a Harvard degree or study rocket science. Rationality is simply knowing cause and effect. And we do live in a complicated world, not helped very much by our information ecosystem, which Gore points out. But it's not that complicated to be a good leader and encourage your voters to do the things necessary to continue to live. The same applies to climate change and all the other issues the right opposes."
2021-08-10 01:36:33,"Conservatism is not necessarily about denialism-or even about simple greed-it's about short term convenience above all else, and the need to keep the short term conveniences in steady supply.

Climate change? Of course the conservative intelligentsia acknowledge it-but having to say that in public means that there would have to be steps taken to address it. Those steps mean that profits will be lost, and that is simply a bridge too far to cross. 

Covid? If we took it seriously, then we'd have to acknowledge that all of the little people have lives and livelihoods. We'd need to acknowledge that the person serving their food is human too, and therefore can be infected and infect others-including the rich. And of course, we'd have to acknowledge that people in the service industry, who make our lives much, MUCH easier are also entitled to dignity and respect, and maybe they might not want to risk their lives just to serve. 

Think of it the same way they treat our gun violence crisis. Having to register a gun, or earn a license, or *anything* would be far too inconvenient. Just as with making sure people wear masks when indoors, or providing any assistance for the poor-it's far less inconvenient to simply not register a gun, not give up some money, and certainly not wear a mask."

Nuclear power, which would sharply reduce CO2, is taboo among the greens. Innovation in developing low-cost natural gas, which substitutes for coal, may have done more than any government policy to reduce U.S. emissions. Yet President Biden wants to crush the gas industry with regulation.

Keep in mind that the IPCC report is a political document. It is intended to scare the public and motivate politicians to reduce CO2 emissions no matter the cost, which by the way the report summary never mentions. No less than Al Gore admitted this on PBS in October 2018 when the IPCC issued an interim report: “The language the IPCC used in presenting it was torqued up a little bit, appropriately.

I live in Florida; my grandkids started school today, with masks as optional -- they wore them, as they did last year. Some kids didn't, nor did their parents when picking them up or dropping them off. The school, bless their brains, tested each child's temperature upon entering the premises.

We could, I guess, close the schools, but that's fraught with problems of all sorts, academic and social, as every close reader of the NYTimes knows.

Going out on a limb here: Our governor is not mandating masks, but letting parents decide how to raise their children. Neither the schools nor the government own them. 

He published a Parent's Bill of Rights to make the point, and I think it's a good one in general. Public servants and public services should share power with the public. But is it the right thing to do in this particular case? Overall, I would say no; yet that's my viewpoint as an elderly germophobe who can't afford to get a serious illness. But is it all about me?

Most Floridians have already been visited by the Covid germ; you either fought if off or you didn't. I got the two shots, wear masks, socially distance, and live like a hermit. It's a lousy life, barely worth the effort sometimes, in all candor; but grandkids make it bearable.

On that crisis as well, the Republican Party's stand is against the recommendations and interest of both consumer advocates and the industry representatives, stuck in the mantra of ""No new taxes."""

2021-08-10 01:25:54,"COVID denial has caused the death of hundreds of thousands of Americans but is a pinprick compared to the impacts climate change denial will cause.

A population of a few million human hunter-gatherers was apparently beyond the carrying capacity of the planet as most places where we showed up the megafauna disappeared.

Around 10-12,000 years ago, when large climate oscillations settled down, we developed agriculture which allowed us to double our population many times into the billions.

But agriculture faces big challenges if we don’t change our ways soon (1), as do our fisheries, and if they both decline significantly, forcing us back to being largely hunter-gatherers, history tells us that out of every 1,000 people you see maybe one survives.

Except this time it wouldn’t be meat on the hoof with mastodons, large flightless birds and picking lobsters off of New England beaches. Going back to trying to hunt and gather during the 6th mass extinction isn’t the best timing so one in a thousand may be optimistic.

Actually, the free market can have an enormous impact on fighting climate change if accounting standards are changed to require companies to internalize the external costs of their emissions of greenhouse gases. I’ll give you one actual example.

A chemical company had to clean up a large quantity of benzene in the groundwater under its plant. When the plant’s engineers were told the cost to do that, they readily said they could have eliminated all benzene waste for far less than the cost of cleanup. Thus, had the company been forced to account for the cost of cleaning up benzene at the time it was polluting, it’s engineers would have eliminated the waste altogether to save money and increase profits.

If we change our accounting standards to make companies internalize the costs of emitting green house gases, they will find efficient ways to eliminate or substantially reduce them."

Getting vaccinated and wearing masks has been very successful in slowing transmission and in vastly reducing hospitalization and death. 

It's a world wide health emergency for crying out loud. Most of us will never really understand why so many don't comprehend the rational and caring thing to do.

Same with supporting development of new energy sources and greatly reducing GHG emissions. Climate and weather are changing before our eyes, as projected for decades. Again what is wrong with deniers.

DeSantis miscalculated in this attempt to ""Be Like Trump"". 

Sure, recreational cruelty plays well in today's GOP but target selection matters. It's one thing, for example, to put brown children in cages at the border. The base loves a show of ""toughness"" when it hurts ""those"" people. It's quite another to fill up ICU beds with the children of your political base. 

Delta hasn't peaked, school is starting, tens of millions of Americans seem determined to be petri dishes for the next variant and the ones after that.  This is quite likely to get a lot worse in Florida if DeSantis won't back down before it gets better.

But DeSantis can't be seen to back down and keep his base. He caught a break when a Federal Judge issued an injunction against stopping a cruise line from requiring proof of vaccination. I am sure DeSantis is praying that he loses the lawsuits filed to stop him from outlawing mask mandates in schools. 

The best hope for DeSantis (and Floridians) is that judges keep him from executing rules that he knows will result in otherwise preventable deaths and hospitalizations of his constituents including children. 

The best hope for America is that it is already too late for DeSantis politically. That governor is the last job that he ever holds that allows him the power to sacrifice lives for no reason other than his own ambition."

Is there only derangement therein, or is there something else too?

The nativist, white christian authoritarians who comprise the essential populist base of both climate and covid denialists believe that they are in a war since they face an existential threat to their culture, religious  influence, and  social prestige/privilege by  a coalition  of liberals, globalists,  and non whites (aka ""the Others""). ""Owning the liberals"" has about it something similar to a war metaphor of taking territory and  taking out enemies on their territory. 

 So, I wonder  if they're not also thinking of  their opposition to vaccines +  spread abatement policies in military terms. This would be, to put it crudely, that the virus   attacks more  of  the Others  than of  themselves. 

Those who live in rural or less densely populated zones feel reassured by living with an  illusion that they are less a fat target than those in the enemy territory of  urban zones. So, the virus is more likely to hit and weaken their sworn enemies than their own. 

This also creates more social chaos that destabilizes their enemies.

The British created a vast railway network in their colonies, to ship raw materials to Britain.Then the finished products from British factories were exported back to the colonies, including cloth from the Manchester mills. The colonies were not allowed to manufacture  the finished products to compete with the British and they had almost no heavy industries when the British were eventually kicked out of the colonies. The global supply chains are very complex today and cannot be easily modeled by economics perhaps. Trump's trade tariffs were a complete disaster, and have been contributing to inflation.

DeSantis suffered a heavy defeat today when cruise lines were allowed to impose mask mandates. He is threatening school employees with salary cuts.Cannot do that.It is unconstitutional and schools have the right to do whatever they consider necessary to keep students and staff, and kids, safe and healthy-including impose mask mandates.

Virus and vaccine denial are continuations thereof.  It's also difficult to argue with its political success.

The Right contains factions that care only about control...not about the state of the society they control.  If it takes wrecking things, well, they're not getting evicted for inability to pay rent, a 20% rise in the price of food is a mere annoyance, if gas goes to $10 a gallon they'll go electric.

And of course, as Mr. Krugman's point of making Covid 19 a political issue from the get-go. The GOP rolled the dice again on an important, and deadly, issue and came up snake-eyes. This, for no other reason than to take the opposite approach to science and Democrats. All they needed was a little sunshine or bleach-jabs and the all of that Covid negativity would go away. Another losing position. It sure seems to me that any objective look at politics over the past 40+ years would show that the right is virtually always wrong on matters of great importance.

So here is a little climate history,  they say know your history or be doomed to repeat it.

The carbon cycle for the last 2 million years was doing 180-280ppm atmospheric CO2 over 10,000 years and we’ve done more change than that in 100 years. 

The last time CO2 went from 180-280ppm global temperature increased by around 5 degrees C and sea level rose 130 meters. (graph of the last 400,000 years of global temperature, CO2 and sea level <a href=""http://www.ces.fau.edu/nasa/images/impacts/slr-co2-temp-400000yrs.jpg"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ces.fau.edu/nasa/images/impacts/slr-co2-temp-400000yrs.jpg</a> )

One amplifying feedback alone out of dozens, loss of albedo or heat reflectivity from Arctic summer sea ice melt, over the last several decades has been equivalent to 25 percent of the climate forcing of anthropogenic CO2. And that will continue to increase as that ice disappears by mid century.

The Titanic sank because by the time the lookout called the warning the ship had too much momentum to turn. The Earth has a lot more momentum, e.g. we've already likely locked at least 6 meters of sea level rise from the marine sectors of Greenland and West Antarctica’s ice sheets, and decade to decade warming in the near term is also virtually locked in.

That momentum is building and the higher we let global temperatures rise the greater the risk of them going really high as amplifying feedbacks strengthen."

2021-08-10 03:05:00,"Quoting Paul as he paraphrases one of the obstacles to spending money to save the world from global warming: ""They’ll say ... any attempt to mitigate climate change would devastate the economy.""

I heard that argument 4 years ago. Seeing as I had a BA in American Studies I am supposed to remember American History. I wound up focusing on the American Civil War, as it is regarded by some as the first modern mass war. It is called modern  partly because it used ideas from economics. 

Salmon  P.  Chase was Secretary of the Treasury under Lincoln. He devised a series of financial instruments to fund the North's part of the Civil War. One of those instruments was the issue of a currency called the Greenback Dollar. It was used to pay Northern soldiers. The Greenback dollar was a fiat currency.  

The Greenback Dollar enabled soldiers to buy food and entertainment. Wikipedia notes, during the Civil War, the North did not lack for money.

So for Dr. Krugman, our distinguished Economist, I present the name of a new instrument of exchange: the NEFFC. One unit of NEFFC is earned when one kiliogram of fossil fuel CO2 is not emitted. If gasoline is valued at about $3.50 per gallon and the CO2 generation rate is 19.62 lb of CO2 per gallon, then 1000 NEFFC is worth $392. 

An example use for NEFFC is to substitute electric cars,  work site solar charging, and fill the cars with riders.  Fourty dollars a week not spent on gasoline is retained wealth for the participants."

For all the Covid floundering though, I still think we're underselling climate change when focusing on Covid. The pandemic, despite global impact, is a narrow consideration. Climate change is broad in a way we struggle to wrap our heads around. We can't even grasp what we can't understand about it. We don't know what we don't know.

I also consider Covid and climate change interrelated. We don't know exactly where Covid originated. However, new and emerging diseases are on the list of things climate change will accelerate. Bactierial growth in warmer climates, changing habitation with changing adaptations, atypical specie interaction with mass migrations. You can view Covid as representative. There are changes going on we don't even yet consider.

With a chemistry education, I have had no trouble believing that the climate crisis is real.  But not until this year have a felt the degree of the threat in my gut.  Why?  Because this is a year like no other.

And over the past 40 years we've seen the Republicans preach a doctrine of ""greed is good"", and a ""Law of the Jungle"" agenda that pits the strong against the weak - or more precisely, the 1% vs. the 99%. They have been able to do that by weaponizing cultural issues: race, guns, religion, abortion, immigration, all tied together with the ""super glue"" of fear. 

Meanwhile, the Democrats, having been driven out of power after Reagan, tried to copy the Republican playbook, chasing after the same donor class, while trying to convince the working class they were still on their side, despite NAFTA, etc. When the working class finally realized NO ONE was fighting for them, they too adopted a ""me first"" attitude. And now here we are: we need to work together, but can't trust anyone.

In the end, the ""jungle"" wins."

Trump's election has messed with the balance - more than ever. Power hungry/money hungry creeps have taken over the GOP like never before.

Since knowledge won't goad us to action, will experience?

The US has had a few wakeup calls: Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans, Hurricane Sandy and NYC, Hurricane Harvey and Houston and Hurricane Maria and Puerto Rico and Hurricane Florence and the Carolinas.

And Dorian, the cat 5 storm which stalled over the Bahamas for 24 hours (part of me wishes it had stalled over Miami instead, actually a big part of me because maybe that would have woken up a few people, while of course killing a bunch as well. To bake a cake you have to crack a few eggs right?)

2021-08-10 04:04:42,"Your opinion piece is remarkably perceptive in your introduction of labelling the GOP strategy for regaining political power in 2022 and 2024 by continuing to engage in messaging designed to expand the ""authoritarian political cult"" that was created and formed around the former president.  

The cult seems to be about a third of the registered voters so I have been noticing the emphasis given to building cult-like words like""mandate"", ""freedom"", and ""illegals"" to divert attention away from the real challenges like the pandemic or global warming.  

The cult words and disinformation are diversions away from voter suppression in the States and what I sense is slow-rolling the Democrats to deal with the climate change and issues related to the pandemic, and the social corrections in healthcare, and fair taxation. 

Dems must show actual improvements being realized in all sectors.  Clearly, we must get the truth and evidence on the Trump tax cut.  It seems to only have increased the concentration of wealth. With the Dems in action, it appears we are getting some movement on the income inequality issue and closing in on a fairer tax system.

Dems have a great opportunity on the infrastructure bill and the reconciliation bill to do some good work.

Would a Gore victory in that election have put the world in a much better place regarding global warming than we are now and not just marginally better? 
If so, then the Supreme Court justices made an important contribution to environmental degradation, destroyed ecosystems, and increased the possibility of mass extinctions, which would inevitably accelerate the collapse of the civilization in which they have comfortably resided."

Nobody who has been working remotely wants to go back to the workplace.

Nobody with stimulus money and expanded unemployment benefits wants to go back to chump change jobs.

We need to stop trying to patch up things with programs like food stamps and child care credits.

In a country that is this prosperous, every adult has a right to decent job with good pay an benefits and decent working conditions.

Any adult who works 40 hours a week should have good health coverage and a high enough wage to support a family, buy a car and buy a house.

We don’t need socialism.

We need a regulated economy in which those who have benefitted most  are made to be responsible for the well being of all.

If the competent wealthy people cannot figure out a way to bring everyone else along,  they must be taxed heavily enough for the government to provide the jobs."

DeSantis claims that lockouts, mask mandates and social distancing hurt businesses and the economy. It appears that the opposite may be true. Areas that took effective measures to combat the pandemic, along with high vaccination rates, have been able to bounce back faster than low vaccination rate areas. Recent data from The New York Times shows that the infection rate in Florida is more than three times higher than California."
2021-08-10 04:26:04,"I think you're on the right track that covid denial can't be explained in the same way as climate denial, but it's not because conservatives don't want to give Biden a win. Covid denial started as soon as covid started, way before Biden. It has never waned, even through 600,000 American deaths. 

You're on the right track too that it's about the GOP as an authoritarian cult - but not just a political cult. It's a central part of personal identity for the true believers. Because of this, the greatest sacrifice - human sacrifice - is not something that DeSantis and others are just stuck with because it's impossible for them to change course. The sacrifice itself is the ultimate loyalty test. Sociologists study how sacrifice, including human sacrifice in ancient religions and cults, cements group cohesion and belief systems. Nowadays human sacrifice is considered abhorrent, but the true believers understand perfectly well what is at stake. It just isn't elaborated explicitly in those terms. Instead it's framed in terms of shared mythology around freedoms and government tyranny. 

Arguments about the ongoing covid death toll don't convert the believers because while to us each avoidable death is a tragedy, from the inside, among the rank and file and the leaders, each death is an affirmation - a triumph - a visceral expression of the proper relationship between man and sacred ideals and authority."

But we had resistance to vaccines long before we had Trump, covid, and Biden.

And many of the ""original"" anti-vaxxers are liberals; an outgrowth of the environmental/New Age movements.  If it comes from a corporation, it must be poison and everyone should choose their own system of healing.

Granted, these left-wing performative science-deniers don't have as much sway in the Democratic Party as their equivalents on the right do over the GOP which is beholden to both fossil fuels and freak fundamentalists, but still.  The problem is older and broader than what Krugman includes."
2021-08-10 04:28:45,"Hospitals are filling up across the South. Because people are making ""personal decisions"", but then wanting to take up shared resources when that decision has been proven wrong.

Now, with hospital beds becoming in short supply, the Texas governor is asking hospitals to suspend elective procedures. Again, the poor decisions of some are having an impact on others. Think about what the governor's mandate is doing to everyone impacted by covid. And then go read about what is happening in arkansas where the republican governor has just announced that they have seven total icu beds available in the state. Seven in the state.

And then think about someone who was injured in an accident or has cancer and they need an icu bed but are unable to get one because someone with covid made a ""personal choice"" which cost those people their lives.

There is a fundamental flaw when conservatives start preaching about government, liberty and communism: You do not have the freedom to harm other people, no matter how you try to splice it. It's not about liberty; it's about harming people and getting away with it."
2021-08-10 04:31:56,"I beg to differ. According to Florida Health, case rates (confirmed infected) have been relatively flat until June. That changed at the beginning of July, at a time with the highest vaccination numbers, when case rates started to rise steeply among all age groups. Because of the new Delta variant? As can be seen from the graphs, vaccination and case rates do not correlate. 
The cumulative case fatality rate (confirmed infected died) for age under 16-29 is 0.0%, for 30-39 0.1%, for 40-49 0.3%, for 50-59 0.8%, for 60-64 1.8%, for 65+ 8.8%.

Illinois and California, one party states, have so-so vaccination rates. Along with many other Democratic states, they also have quite poor cumulative Covid stats of deaths and unemployment rates. 

In terms of states with low vaccination rates, what is the percentage of unvaccinated who are registered Democrats? Hint: it's a very significant percentage. In NYC, about 27% of adults are unvaccinated, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 8:1. Who is to blame? Republicans? Seriously?

There is mistrust of government across party lines; blaming Republicans makes no sense because hesitance runs across party lines in a big way, as well as across age (and younger people are more likely to be Democrats).

In terms of climate change, the opposing argument is not against climate change, rather it is against transforming the entire US economy at once through government control versus incremental change through the private sector. The scare mongering is classic left wing tactics for scaring voters in accepting such a non intuitive, drastic expansion of government. The sky is falling. Every single weather event is incontrovertible evidence of climate change in mainstream media. This loss of credibility goes against focusing on the very, very few actions that will actually make a difference (and accepted by enough countries to count).

2021-08-10 04:37:41,"I think Dr. Krugman gives Republicans credit for too much thinking.  Covid denial and climate change denial both stem from a basic philosophy:  Government is the problem.  (Where did we hear that first?)  They're simply anti-government on many things. 

Denying climate science or epidemiology is just a rationalization to prevent government from dictating a policy for the common good.  They've recently taken this to the extreme by refusing to fund the IRS to collect lawfully owed taxes to the tune of $600B per year.  So they've even abandoned the idea that taxpayers should accept their personal responsibility to pay a fair share.

This adds up to a blind loyalty to individual freedoms over the common good and thus any role for government.  (Notable exception: women's reproductive freedom).  When one political party has abandoned all notion of a common good, democracy is doomed."

Its embrace of authoritarianism has meant an embrace of white supremacy, which has been fueled by white cultural resentment, anti-intellectualism, demagoguery, and deception. Its descent into authoritarianism comes at a time when we have seen a renaissance of authoritarianism throughout the world. It comes at a time when an ascendant China has become America’s main superpower rival and will soon overtake America as the largest economy in the world. It comes at a time when a declining Russia is still run by the most powerful dictator in the world, a man who is desperately searching for a way to restore his nation’s place atop the superpower ladder along with America and now China. It comes at a time when America must address its physical and social infrastructure after forty years of neglect triggered by its unwise and unsuccessful effort to produce mass prosperity by upwardly redistributing wealth.The damage that the Republican Party is doing to America at home and abroad is simply incalculable."

2021-08-10 01:06:02,"This is a tempting narrative and in broad strokes, probably more right than wrong.  But what’s going on with the broader right-leaning part of our population may be somewhat more nuanced, at least for some. Take an older relative of mine, for instance.  She’s a diehard Trump supporter, believes the election was stolen (because what else explains Trump losing?) and everything Tucker says is true.  She was also probably one of the first to be vaccinated.  (She thanks Trump personally for the free vaccine, by the way, and thinks Biden is none too bright.)  She says masks don’t work, but now thinks everyone unvaccinated (especially under 12 grandkids) should wear a mask around her (she doesn’t wear one, although she dutifully puts one on for doctors visits).  She says it’s your choice to be vaccinated, but then wonders aloud (often and resentfully) why one of her grown children chooses not to be and yet continues to visit her (maskless).  In short, it’s unending cognitive dissonance.  At least for those with some sense of self-interest over “sticking it to the libs.”"

For an easy example, that being gay is a degenerate choice and not a normal variable of the human condition determined at birth.  And the Lost Cause, the Gold Standard, Supply Side Economics, Global Warming, Pedophile Pizza Parlors, the Big Lie, and so on.  

Even today, on NPR, the news is that Ted Cruz, Ron DeSantis and others are stating with absolute certainty, as fact, that immigrants are being deliberately let into the country who are carriers of the delta variant to spread the virus and create the surge we are seeing in the southern states.  Immigrants let in deliberately by Joe Biden.

You know what I think is the common thread?  There is some Big GOP Boiler Room somewhere, financed by conservative big money, who latch on to some populist thread, or just create stuff from whole cloth, that serves their purposes, and they disseminate it to Republican Polls, who then broadcast it with the most singular discipline imaginable.

How a Trump mini-me like DeSantis can turn his back on his constituents is the definition of evil.  There is no other descriptive word for a man who would deny protective mandates to save the lives of INNOCENTS - our children - who are getting very sick and might carry permanent disabilities for the rest of their lives.  What kind of grotesque person allows, even supports and encourages, such cruelty.

Obama’s enormous charisma terribly backfired, though he got elected with relative ease but, while it gave a little too high a hope for black and other politicians of color, it gave a bad taste, an unease about non-white candidates.  Besides, FL is a red state.

Unlike Asa Hutchinson, DeSantis wouldn’t review and revise his views. And yet, the most surprising event was he captured more votes than even Donald Trump did as the 2024 presidential candidate, in a straw poll recently!

With this sort of Republican candidates out there, we ought to worry a great deal about the 2022 & 2024 elections. Republicans at the helm have become more and more irrational and silly. I doubt they are that silly. But I fail to understand why they act like this."

2021-08-10 02:39:52,Thank you Paul Krugman for this! Your analysis is spot on.
2021-08-10 02:40:24,"Covid denial is bad, but nowhere near as bad as climate denial. Covid will kill a few million at worst.  Continued climate denial - and inaction - has the potential to kill us all! Yes, billions - all of us and almost everything else. Read the latest from the IPCC and weep."
2021-08-10 04:17:19,"What's fascinating about Republicans' political calculations that Covid denialism will increase their election chances is that in spite of being utterly incompetent and corrupt, likely the only reason Trump didn't win a second term is because of Covid denialism."
2021-08-10 04:23:30,"""...right-wing...refusal to acknowledge facts, accusations that scientists are part of a vast liberal conspiracy... were foreshadowed in the climate debate...the anti-rational streak in American politics isn’t as bad as we thought; it’s much, much worse.""

They deny the very distinctions between logical/illogical, true/false, myth/reality, fact/fiction.  

Right belief, right speech is just Republican belief and speech. Everything else is just partisan blasphemy by infidels.

The Republican party is a religion.  It just replaces a god story with a Trump story.  

At least Trump is not marketed as a god--OH!--wait for it.  
First a god will speak only to him; if Ivanka asks why?, she will become a leper.  Then Trump will be one of the divine persons.  The others will eventually retire.  And the klieg lights will only shine on Him.

Actually this is old pre Enlightenment marketing.  It was the greatest marketing success of all time.

Inquisitions will replace all Constitutional due process."
2021-08-10 03:34:49,"Professor Krugman you are way smarter than me and your columns are normally a font of wisdom and concise thought. But this one left me puzzled. 
What's the difference between ""because it's cold today.."" and ""because I'm well today""?
There isn't big money in the American medical system? Doesn't the for-profit design deny both access and experience with medical treatment to a significant fraction of Americans preventing them from getting vaccinated? 
Doesn't medical care for all as a fundamental right in a society that can afford to provide it conflict with free-market ideology?
On the other hand you are spot on about how weird it is that owning the Libs has led to a bizarre suicidal blood sport phenomenon."

1/ A virus doesn't care about politics. It's only reason for 'being' is getting multiplied. It gets multiplied by infecting a maximum amount of 'hosts', regardless of what happens to that 'host'.
2/ Climate change doesn't care about politics. It's only reason for 'being' is the ever increasing amount of greenhous gasses (mainly CO2 and methane). Climate change gets worse with every ton emitted.
How come some politians (who are supposed to be smart persons) cannot understand this?
The cost of doing nothing outweighs the cost of action in both cases. 
Again, how come some politians (who are supposed to be smart persons) cannot understand this?
I do not understand, but then again, I am but a simple person."
2021-08-10 04:49:16,"Your choice of the word ""descent"" in the headline says it all, Mr. Krugman. 

Theodore Roosevelt once said ""This country will not be a good place for any of us to live in until we make it a good place for all of us to live in.""

Compare that to the quote last summer from the lieutenant governor of Texas, Dan Patrick. ""There are more important things than living.""

How both men reference living demonstrates the descent."
2021-08-10 04:55:31,"Education. Far fewer people would be fooled by misinformation and by political and media manipulation if they had been trained to think critically, relying on evidence based reasoning, in school. The most striking manifestation of this is the widespread rejection of science. Pay teachers more, to compete with industry; build appreciation of the scientific method into all curricula; teach kids defense mechanisms against their manipulation by social networks and the media. It's fine to question the efficacy of vaccines if you do so by studying the science. You will emerge appreciating their marvelous power to prevent disease, and the process itself will innoculate you against misinformation. The only long term solution is better education."
2021-08-10 05:05:26,"So we have to solve the world's most complicated problem right now or it's all over? Thank God this writer has no political power. Editorials like this are the main reason why voters have a hard time taking progressives seriously. They're always hitting the panic button. We need sensible long-range planning. Once you drill down you'll find climate change is much more complicated than GOP resistance. In the 60 years following WWII, the earth's population jumped from 2 billion to 7 billion. In short, the climate is warming faster because so many more people need energy. The left rarely addresses overpopulation since that would rob it of its cause, it's chance to flap its very ""woke"" ethical wings over our fossil fuel use. The notion that we can tame climate change without resolving overpopulation is totally insane. We're targeting 9 billion-plus by 2050. We simply can't support this many people adequately. There's more to this than regulating the planet's thermostat. The value of proven fossil energy reserves the last I read was 30 trillion dollars. Can we erase that sort of wealth from the global economy? We can't & won't. One way or another it's all coming out of the ground. All of it. There's zero evidence of the popular or the political will for the unprecedented changes that would be required to achieve any of the Paris Accord targets. Responsible family planning is essential going forward. This has to be the priority if we're ever going to address climate change."
2021-08-10 05:06:26,"Vaccines help, but they are oversold as a panacea to the pandemic. We still need to wear masks everywhere and social distance to minimize spread. Unfortunately this isn't happening. For e.g. people are still flying to/from India (where the Delta virus is widespread). Foreign students from india are able to fly straight into the US. None of them are asked to quarantine.

The Biden administration can easily and without controversy impose much tighter travel restrictions to limit the spread of the Delta virus. So, if they are not serious about taking these simple preventive steps, how can we mandate that everyone get the vaccine? Vaccines help individuals who get it. Masks and social distancing help everyone and they are much easier to impose.

It appears most people don't want to inconvenience themselves with masks and social distancing. Sorry, no easy solutions to the pandemic."
2021-08-10 05:08:44,"I just checked the Times' number for cases on August 9, and it's now over 125,000.  It went from 12,000 to 125,000 in a few weeks.  Hang on and muster all the strength you can.  It looks like we're going for a ride."
2021-08-10 05:10:58,"Any hope that Republicans won't regain a stranglehold on rational governmental function depends entirely on an unceasing full-court press by the responsible media to refute every false statement, and to illustrate time and again the negative effects of Republican obfuscation.  This effort needs to be as repetitive as the endless Fox News barrage, and needs to be accompanied by massive voter education and turnout in the 2022 Congressional elections."
2021-08-10 05:17:26,"The only comment I disagree with here is that Ron DeSantis' political career would be over. The attention span of an American is about 48 hours and will quickly forget he switched tactics. With Mr. Krugman making this statement, it will only make DeSantis' team dig in deeper."
2021-08-10 05:17:30,"Continued dependency on fossil fuels will result in environmental catastrophe and extinction of most of Earth’s life forms.

However, the problem needs an economic solution that conforms to known human behavior. Think E.O. Wilson's sociobiology, and Maslow's need hierarchy. 

People won’t cut back on fossil fuels if it means a lower standard of living.

It is clear that we must reduce our use of fossil fuels. But if using less energy means a lower standard of living, it won’t happen.  Think back to how your daily life experiences have changed since you were born. 

We will not go back to the 18th Century before we started massively consuming fossil fuels. Moreover, people in developing countries like China and India want to raise their standard of living to be like present living standards in developed countries. If it means increasing fossil fuel consumption, that’s what people will do.

The only way to stop the massive consumption of fossil fuels for electricity generation, transport, industrial, residential and commercial uses, is to develop and implement new, and practical non-fossil fuel energy sources that are more economical, both in investment and operation, than fossil fuels. Otherwise, people and nations will continue to burn fossil fuels.

So the Biden Administration is off to a good start in setting goals for electric transport and batteries but we must also turn our attention to new ideas for electric power generation.

We must mobilize/invest in R&D."
2021-08-10 05:18:37,"yearn for the days when TV news was at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m., there were only 3 networks to choose from, they mostly told you what happened rather than what they thought, and they did so with journalistic integrity. 

As we turn the blind eye, little by little, to actions and behavior that was once considered unethical, improper, and immoral, and accept it as the new standard, we slowly lose our grip on what we are as a nation. A leader in Florida forbidding kids to wear masks in school, even when a vaccine is not available! A congress unable to square with an attack on their own chambers and hold its inciter accountable!

I wonder what Walter Cronkite at 6 pm would say to all of this."
2021-08-10 05:27:23,What I don't understand is the Republicans are telling their base that the virus/ masks etc are not of any use.

2021-08-10 05:45:50,"Surely the fundamental flaw of Conservatism as a philosophy is that it isn't adaptable. It's a ""stick one's head in the sand"" philosophy. ""It's good enough for Jonah"" is fine when it's a religion but fails when social change is forced upon us. Social Democracy had its heyday in the post-war period when enormous social change was forced upon the West by recovery from two devastating wars and advances in medicine that realigned women's place in society. The people felt and saw the need for social change. Since 1980, Western Democracies have continued to grow largely problem free. Without obvious challenges to that structure, why change anything? 

Based on that assessment, it will require a huge sacrifices: sea level rise that makes large parts of the Eastern coast uninhabitable (without billions spent in sea defences), wild fires that threaten (or decimate) major Western cities, crop failures and food shortages, before the people are forced recognize the need for change and vote to change the status quo. I guess the question is, will that be too late?"
2021-08-10 01:38:14,"Dear Mr. Krugman,

Your ""Republican Autocracy"" explanation on July 19 has become, in my mind, a definitive explanation of the irrational.

2021-08-10 04:54:40,It is difficult to stress enough what the importance of NOT doing what educated Democrats want you to do is to these people. The perfect example is the number of MAGA's who instruct that the news of their deaths due to Covid be reported as being due to something else. They would rather take a lie to the grave than admit a Democrat was right. It's hard to absorb that kind of hatred for a fellow American. But we need to understand it and deal with it.
2021-08-10 04:56:29,"I would add that the Republican Party’s descent into authoritarianism means a few unpleasant things we need to face before it is too late. We can delude ourselves, but the reality is that the American national security infrastructure which includes the domains of defense, intelligence, and law enforcement, largely consists of conservatives. The ACLU is reporting that the FBI has reprised its officially defunct domestic counterintelligence program and is targeting African-American political activists. During the classic Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, the FBI used this program to suppress the First Amendment-protected political activism of liberal political activists. In 1975 and 1976, the Church Senate Select Intelligence Committee determined that this program unconstitutionally, illegally, and over-broadly targeted members of The American Left. Today, with Republicans openly behaving like fascists President Biden, Attorney General Garland and the Democrat-led congressional intelligence committees must look at America’s domestic counterterrorism effort to ensure that conservatives are not playing partisan games."
2021-08-10 05:14:47,The governor of Arkansas admitted it was a mistake to ban mask mandates. He reversed the course now. He hasn’t lost much of a support. Why can’t Florida and Texas governors do the same? Floridians are dying because of Covid-19. Florida governor DeSantis claims that he is protecting the freedom of Floridians. I don’t know what kind of freedom a dead Floridian will have.

I watched the men's 4 by 400 relay at the olympics. The race was dead even till rai benjamin,son of west indian fast bowler winston benjamin, received the baton. Then he took off and left the competition  a long way behind-in the dust. There is something to be said for immigration bringing in talent, especially when the team USA men performed below US olympic team standards overall. Suni Lee, Hmong American is another outstanding example. In the 1970s, the lady gymnasts who won were all russian and east european. Women won 60 percent of the olympic medals for America,and China was edged out by a solitary gold. The rising China competition is another story. Trump bashed immigrants in 2016 calling them 'rapists,murderers and thugs' to appeal to the worst instincts in his right wing party-successfully, and Suni and Rai are two examples of outstanding contributors repudiating Trump,and there are millions of immigrants making a big contribution everyday to America's success on the global stage. 
Climate denial and covid denial in the Trump party leadership,and from DeSantis and Abbott lately, is devastating leadership failure in a divided nation. A strong, firm,determined and visionary Biden is needed more than ever. Only Biden stands in the way of America becoming a climate disaster zone. Cutting salaries for mandating masks, as DeSantis is doing, is pathetic."

Next to the said door is one labelled “Climate Research”.  The scientists outside that door are helpless with laughter."
2021-08-10 02:10:14,"I agree with your argument, which I would like to push one step further:  like most authoritarian movements, modern Republicans have abandoned Reason for Will.  But Will--the collective desire to create the destiny of a White Christian Nation--has predictably run aground when confronted by a far greater force: Nature.  And they'll never admit their folly."
2021-08-10 02:19:27,"Mr. Krugman mentions Florida's creepy tight-lipped Covid-denying governor Ron deSantis and Texas's charmer Gov. Greg Abbot, two men not all there with reference to the health of their constituencies. It's monstrous. 

That saying, ""The wicked are safe among the blind,"" may aptly be used around both of these men, who, through their actions, seem quite unfit for office. And yet, why aren't they being hounded out of town? Meanwhile, California's Gov. Newsom (a man who has clearly been doing all in his power: expediting mass vaccinations, you name it) is being ruthlessly judged somehow inadequate by state Republicans out for blood. This charade of Republicans groaning on about pushing back against Dems and ""freedom"" (when people are dying) will only cause more deaths. Won't some sensible Republican step forward to end this nightmare of self righteous balderdash?"
2021-08-10 03:06:47,"Desantis is a demagogue willing to hold the children of his state hostage to his own vindictive intransigence. How sad that parents are now faced with sending their children into such a toxic and stressful start of the school year. It is not too late to demand change from this cruel Trump wannabe. Parents, teachers and school administrators have the power to work in tandem to demand a safe classroom experience. If it takes defiant action and lawsuits by local school districts to protect children. so be it."
2021-08-10 03:30:08,"You don't have the freedom to drink and drive, you don't have the freedom to yell 'fire' in a crowded theater.  Once your ""freedoms"" threaten others, they are not freedom from anything other than responsibility, adulthood, and accountability.  The other argument against vaccinations is ""my body, my choice"" (robbed from the pro-choice movement).  This is precious coming from the ""pro-lifers"", that is until it comes to Covid, and vaccinations.  Pro-death is more like it.  If the Delta variant weren't so contagious, I wouldn't give a whit whether a majority of Republicans didn't want vaccinations.  This current Covid wave is courtesy of the unvaccinated, ""religious"", ""pro-life"", Pro-""freedom"" party of hypocrisy.  Isn't it ironic those who are passing the Jim Crow 2.0 voter restriction laws are restricting their access to the polls by dying of Covid.  Mother Nature bats last."
2021-08-10 04:20:05,"The Republican party has taken an anti-freedom stand on protecting from more widespread death from Covid-19.

They believe, in the persons of DeSantis and Abbott, that people who work in stores should not have the freedom to prohibit disease carriers from coming in without a mask or a shot. They want to stop the workers and owners from protecting themselves because that's what government does best, shutdown the freedom to decide what diseases you are exposed to at work.

They believe that local school districts should not have the freedom to decide if masks are necessary in the area where they are located. The political party that believes in ""small government"" and local decision making wants big, state governments to take away the power of decisions at the local level. What are they, communists in disguise?

The Republicans believe you shouldn't have the power to decide if you get a vaccine shot. They don't trust you, so they help to spread false information and rumors that will ""help"" you make up your mind. Individual decisions by free citizens are not allowed or are highly suspect.

Ultimately, dead people have no freedoms. They can't even use a gun inside a coffin. Imagine. But the freedom to be alive, to help prevent the spread of infections is not the most important item on the Republican agenda. Protecting your right to die and to give the virus to others, yeah, that's the ticket. Vote Republican. They have an amazing, totally contradictory program."

Now, for the first time in half a century, those lies are having very real, and very negative consequences. And frankly, I couldn't be happier. I'm happier because, as someone who has suffered incredibly as a result of their unaccountable lies, for decades, there is at last some kind of reckoning. A semblance of justice. A whiff of just desserts.

And I can say, with no reservations, that I am going to enjoy every minute of it with great relish. The greater the suffering the Republicans and their supporters endure, the more I will celebrate.

Now, before you condemn me as being some sort of callous, unfeeling, uncaring monster, realize this. That anything I do now pales in comparison to everything they have done to everyone else.

They wrote this book of misery over the course of fifty years. Words after word, Sentence after sentence. Chapter after chapter. People like Nixon and Reagan. People like Bush and Rumsfeld and Chaney. People like Norquist and Gingrich. People like Limbaugh and Carlson and Dobbs, and Hannity and Ingraham.

It is hard to see how things will end well, since we now have a country sharply divided into sane, thinking folks who want to do the right thing, and a cult of zombies who simply parrot whatever their right wing masters utter.

2021-08-10 02:47:11,"Yes.   It seems that the modern GOP descends ever lower into a kind of apocalyptic cynicism.  They declare freedom from consistency, rationality, morality and common human decency.  They declare their freedom to live in a cartoon world.  They are motivated almost entirely by ideological imperatives and clearly could not care less about what actually happens to actual people.  The modern GOP is a theatre of vicious absurdity.  Mandates?  The whole point of a society governed by laws is to establish mandates: both what you must and what you must not do.  You must get automobile insurance.  You must stop at the red light and drive on the right hand side.  You must pay your taxes.  To argue that legal mandates somehow ""infringe""  on their freedom to act in a totally destructive and anti-social manner is beyond absurd."

While legislatively the Republicans try to create as many roadblocks as possible, the whole issue with vaccinations is something wildly different. Actually, I think a lot of the obsession with Florida in particular is over Democrats' concerns that DeSantis will run for president in 2024. If you look at what's going on in Florida though, a high case count masks that the hospitals thankfully are in fine condition, and that there really isn't a wildly spiraling death rate because the elderly and vulnerable were prioritized for vaccines. Actually, in that regard Florida did a much better job than ""Captain Can't Keep His Hands Off Employees"" up in NY, whom we were praising for his ""decisiveness"" in battling COVID (wonder if that book he wrote about handling the first wave is still going to be published). 

But I digress- in COVID, low vaccination really has more to do with a host of cultural issues including a distrust of government,  driven  in no small part due to the disdain with which the coasts hold red America. But that's quite different from the GOP consciously trying to muck up vaccination because Biden's in office. But Mr. Krugman certainly has been one for conspiracy theories, trying to make the GOP a boogieman responsible for all social ills"

As for Climate alarmism, is should be noted that Democrats were in the White House for 8.5 of the last 12.5 years and carbon dioxide emissions during the Trump years were actually below expectations - and that was pre-COVID.   Blaming Republicans seems odd when Democrats have control.   

But Biden gets a pass of course.   Massive California wildfires, for which Trump was excoriated for some strange reason, barely register a blip on the media's report card for Biden.   Biden will be waiting out the wildfires in his basement in Delaware."
2021-08-10 05:54:31,"Climate and Covid denial might intertwined through the Republican Party, but economic denial is common for both parties. Both were brought on by the interdependent global economy, or what I bleakly call consumerism. Attributing environmental denial to Republican political strategy, not the consumer economy, conveniently distracts from reality. 

In your last column, Mr. Krugman, you referenced the comparative advantage regions and countries have as trading partners, then went on to trading between countries with similar advantages and on the same playing field (vaccine production). You may get your numbers correct, but purposely avoid the global reasons for both the pandemic and climate change, and what humans have to do to avoid a looming environmental catastrophe. 

To come to terms with global warming, and by default, Covid, Americans must face consumerism like an addiction: confront the monster in the morning mirror, admit profligacy, then make an individual and collective effort toward redemption, if only incrementally. The dismal conundrum is that the majority make their livings, establish futures, and thus have grown inured to the downside of the fossil fuels. Influential writers like you turn away from the true culprit. It's too frightening.

Visionaries see the world locally. We should start listening to them."

I think it is that selfishness which is at the heart of the matter, and always has been.  Unfortunately, as the world gets more crowded and our affairs become more interconnected, that attitude becomes destructive.  

And, note that certain populations that have traditionally been highly privileged have reacted particularly violently, and selfishly, to any suggestion that they act for the common good, with respect to climate or public health.   Of course, this is not a complete explanation -- conservatives are not the only population that is resisting vaccination."

How many billions of tons have been emitted throughout our ""modern"" era of ancient blood feuds and expansionism, since WWI? Who knew the war to end all wars was the beginning of the longer war to end the Anthropocene Epoch? (Which will, ironically, end all human wars.)

Twenty years ago it was sufficient to front 'experts' listing all the ways climate wasn't changing.  That's now impossible, so a more aggressive form of delay tactic is needed: such as a soft civil war.

The fossil fuel that must be stranded if climate action is taken is valued, at current prices, at $235 trillion.   I doubt even the United States is large and powerful enough to remain undefeated against that much money."

So the odds are that the average Republican hasn't heard that there's a global heating crisis, or if he has, he's only heard about it as a Democrat So-shul-ist plot.

The BBC has written about Trump’s statements about climate change. They reviewed countless Trump quotes on the subject and found that he proposed emissions reduction, opposed reduction, called it a hoax, a real, but exaggerated problem and he expressed multiple other views on the matter. And many other Republicans are similarly all over the place. 

The days of outright denial have given way to controlled obfuscation. A new answer every day. 

As the BBC pointed out, Republican climate change policy is all over the place. Krugman’s denial claim is pretty much a thing of the past. And those like Krugman who hang on every word of the Republicans play into their hand.

The fact that there are still so many elected Republicans who, to please their fossil fuel corporate donors, are still denying climate change with a straight face is an utter disgrace and a testament as Paul Krugman says, to the fact that “the right’s descent continues, with no bottom in sight.”"

I'm not familiar with the relevant laws in either state, but if any private individual were to happen upon a bad car accident, saw somebody trapped inside and either stood by watching that person die or dropped a lit cigarette into a pool of gas, then I'm certain that person would face criminal charges.

We have to remember that all the talking points for right wing politicians are taken from Murdoch's hymn sheet. The arguments for both mass vaccination and addressing climate change should have been settled years ago. But Murdoch's nay-sayers spread misinformation simply to foment chaos. In Australia two former prime ministers, Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull, are taking on Murdoch. Responsible people in both America and Britain should be joining them."

If the Republicans and Trump had gone around knocking on doors and offering MAGA hats to everyone that would get a shot, we just might have had 90% of the population vaccinated by school opening. What a disaster this would have been for the GOP. Biden would have reached savior status. 

Of course too much of a good thing- torpedoing Biden's vaccination plan- could backfire. Most of the adult deaths resulting from lack of vaccinations will reliably be Republicans. Is it possible that once Biden has been tarnished this would be a motivator for Republicans to begin enthusiastically recommending the vaccine? I would hope not. In the distant past (5 years ago) I would never have considered such a callous attitude from any politician. 

Back to accountability. Teflon Don is approaching 80 years old. As far as I can determine from my internet research, Trump not only has not been held accountable over the years as a businessman and president, his failures and crafty escapes have added to his popularity. So why would Abbott and DeSantis worry about consequences? There's always denying, distracting, deflecting, sleight of hand, and my personal favorite- good old fashioned lying. 

The root of all these problems lies in capitalism without compassion. When a handful of men have as much wealth as half the population do you really think the story is going to end well? I give our country the same odds as the 1969 Mets."
2021-08-10 08:32:10,"In the early 1990's, when my children were young, we joined a country/beach club. The people who ran the club were all retired and in their 70's. They spent club money on the things people of their age group liked, like fancy dining facilities, and refused to spend on amenities for young families like mine. As a result, eventually most of the young families left the club and went elsewhere, eventually putting the club in financial distress. When I would try to talk to the club leaders about what young families needed to keep us as members, their response was often some version of this:

""We run the place. You can do what you want when we're dead and gone.""

The club nearly went bankrupt, as it could not attract younger members. Eventually, the old leaders died off and new blood took over. Changes were made. The club is thriving today.

Fortunately, a few have recently taken a step back from the cliff.

Perhaps it is worse, at the moment. The reckoning for climate denial is coming.  The etiology of the G.O.P. anti-rationality remains open to debate.  There is some evidence that it goes back to George W. Bush and the turn toward Iraq with its putative WMD. During this period, following 911, the G.O.P. started embracing the notion that changing course based on new information was a sign of weakness.  In the extreme, never apologize.  The derivatives include ""alternative facts"" and the fact-free nonsense of the present.

Now we see members of the G.O.P. clinging to the White patriarchy, above all else.  I think this is truly where the pathology lies.  The result? Resist anything from the other side of the aisle even if it (literally) kills. Climate science and medical science tend to be things that folks on the left believe have merit. This means COVID facts are inseparable from the left so must they must be false, or part of some elaborate fantastical conspiracy.  I hope that the electorate sends the signal that we are actually at BOTTOM and the G.O.P. is voted out of power."

We not in a total Dark Age, but instead a Grey Age of functional illiteracy, innumeracy, and misinformation.

An incisive comment yesterday said that people feel no Covid danger until it happens to them, and they cannot comprehend simple statistical analysis and probability.   That's very true.

Social media has acculturated people to be active producers, and not mere consumers of information.  Hence, even though everyday people cannot describe a virus as an obligate parasite, nor have any conception of T cells and B cells in the immune response, they feel on a par with someone like Dr. Fauci.

Hoi polloi are in a state of perpetual activism, and will not brook any correction that they are laboring under a false set of alternative facts.   

Of course, because of Trump we are playing catch-up football.  But this administration has not done enough to inculcate the idea that a virus can only live and reproduce with a host, that is, us.   

A vaccine is like a good goalie in soccer.   It keeps the virus from scoring goals.  Imagine soccer with two goalies.   A vaccine plus masks equate to a very low probability of the virus' goal of infection.  Hardly any virus gets through.

Vaccine plus masks stop a virus from reproducing and spreading through society.  It's not an infringement on freedom.   Vaccine plus masks equate to day when we are free from Covid.

Professors of liberal arts and pseudo sciences - ""social sciences"" - took note and soon states were funding, without their real awareness, studies deconstructing gender in Marvel comics and the like. Then Social constructionism came along - it asserts that there is no reality without social agreement. No gravity,, no virus,, no global warming- just male dominated agendas masquerading as objective.. Hard working scientists looking at important phenomena had to share ""research loads"" and grants with lightweights ""discovering"" things like gender and race.

And as it looks like infrastructure legislation might finally come to fruition those same MAGAs should consider why not a single infrastructure bill was ever so much as debated on the floors of congress during the four years that Trump held total control of congress but could only talk about locking people up and toilets.
I suggest that the only thing that was lost or stolen from the MAGAS was four years of progress on climate, covid, and infrastructure relief and  all I think that the current administration is asking in return is for a those who simply want to continue down the path of denial to simply "" Get out of the way""."

Pass a Federal vaccine requirement for travel, visits to public places, schools, employment.   No vaccine means no job, no traveling and no visits to retail stores or restaurants.

Pass a gradually rising carbon tax that raises retail price of gasoline and diesel, natural gas heating, and electricity.  Consumers and business no matter their political views will begin buying hybrid/electric vehicles, insulating their homes, and installing solar panels on roofs.

I assumed that after the Army Corp of Engineers spent billions rebuilding flood protection around New Orleans following the incredible Hurricane Katrina, that we would have learned.

If liberals did not exist, the rightwing would need to create another enemy in order to rationalize its existence and control its followers."
2021-08-10 12:08:36,"There is another common element in the right's climate and covid denial. Both reflect the unwillingness to acknowledge negative externalities. American capitalism, except when required to do so by regulation, has consistently refused to take responsibility for the costs of doing business that hurt others, but not the perpetrators. If I build a factory along a river upstream from a city and dump my industrial waste in the river, I don't have to pay for the cost of cleaning up the mess unless someone makes me. This free pass has become a fundamental element of what now passes for conservatism in America.
The impact on climate policy is obvious. The negative externalities in the production of fossil fuels are all of the devasting harms of climate change. With the pandemic, it results in Republicans opposition to mask and vaccine mandates. If I refuse to wear a mask or get vaccinated and I spread the virus others, well, that's their problem, not mine. I've caused a harm for which I refuse to take responsibility.
They've rebranded denial of negative externalities ""personal freedom"" or ""liberty."" It's really just selfishness and nihilism."

The party and those who support the Trump coup are the enemies of all American values."
2021-08-10 12:11:32,"I'm a recent immigrant to this country and few decades younger than Mr. Krugman. Yet I feel as if most people on this board and Krugman included have no idea what country they live in.
The GOP in my opinion is made mostly of businessmen/women. And as business people, they respond to the need of their customers aka their base.
The GOP most strong base is the Evangelicals. These people put the bible or their interpretation of the bible above anything else, which explains GOP position on climate change and even the vaccine.
Evangelicals believe the bible literally. In the bible there are verses/predictions about the End time. The fires, floods etc... So for them these events just confirm the predictions mentioned in their bible and there is no reason to fight events predicted by God.
The same goes for the vaccine when they believe that it contains some microchips meant to control them as the bible.

My point is that knowing your adversary is the best way to win a battle. And it seems to me as if Mr. Krugman and most Democrats don't understand where Republicans irrationality comes from.
They have to believe like their base/customers to win them over."

Unfortunately, too many people in the country have decided to accept the lies of the deniers and reject vaccination and call climate change a hoax.  Why?  Because it requires no effort on their part to face the pandemic and climate change head-on and do something about them.

2021-08-10 12:30:10,"In my conversations with Trumpists who earnestly believe the election was stolen and who are at least leery of the safety and efficacy of vaccines, it becomes clear that a lot of their ideas come from right-wing internet echo chambers that likely provide a sense of belonging. In order to counter that phenomenon, it's probably not a good idea to ridicule and/or rhetorically railroad conservative leaders into admitting they've been incompetent. And news articles that simply say vaccines are safe and effective because the experts have so determined likely also won't sway many in the Trump cult. 

What might work is information about the history of vaccines, how they work, how they aren't a permanent modification of the body (other than inducing long-term immunity), and the track record of the safety and efficacy of vaccines in general (I'm presuming original articles about the polio vaccine, for example, won't be seen as having been planted by nefarious actors). The goal should be to have everyone have as much valid information as possible, and then let them decide which course of action makes sense in terms of their own safety, that of their loved ones, and the impact on the economy. Getting into a shouting match with Desantis et al won't help."

Democrats have talked a good game but they too are beholden to corporate donors who will gain in the short term if denial is predominant. Transformative change is what we need but that takes an extreme kind of courage that I don’t see is there.

In the early stages of the pandemic, it was possible to hold the cynical belief that Trump was downplaying the gravity of the situation due to its concentration in ""blue"" areas such as New York City and Seattle. But now the epicenter of contagion is in the deep South and Florida, the Republican stronghold, and yet the governors of Texas and Florida are heavily into denialism.

Having all as a captive audience, he carried on with the usual loud speech about his “rights”, at that time his privilege, on federal property, not to do so, given by the then president. 

Everybody else was his captive, his potential victims of viral spread and the captive audience of his spiel.  We had no way to avoid contact with or to avoid listening to him.  We had been stripped of our means of defense.  We were placed at the mercy of this evildoer.  Our means of defense had been taken by presidential proclamation.

This same sort of thing applies to our endangered climate, eventually our endangered selves.  We are denied effective action to save ourselves by elements of our government, in the name of “freedom” and by the actions of big money.

C.  'Hundred year' fires and floods happen all the time, they really only became an exploitable political issue with the arrival of internet which puts them in front of people at home and at work all day every day; the world has only been coming apart at the seems and the climate going to pot since internet took hold.   D.  I notice Mr. Krugman has stopped talking about inflation since he got it so wrong when he told us it would be nothing much to worry about, then that it would only be mild, then that even if it was severe it would be transitory.  Could he be equally wrong about climate, vaccines and Republicans, too?"
2021-08-10 12:44:37,"For quite some time the primary objective of conservatives (Republicans) is to defiantly resist anything associated with liberal thinking regardless of the merits. This includes any and all attempts by governmental agencies to address critical issues like climate change and COVID, but it has a long history related to any policies to address national and environmental health issues. Under the guise of protecting personal freedoms it rejects any mandates of personal responsibilities, suggesting instead that responsibility is a matter of personal choice. It is a pathologically self destructive ideology that places blind loyalty to your tribe, and hatred for the other tribe, as a test of membership. The right’s political leaders have cynically promoted this mindset even as many, if not most, of them understand the human and societal costs. Given the undemocratic structure of our national government it is hard to be optimistic."

In California, the governor, a Democrat who mostly but not always has followed the science regarding Covid and has generally done a good job is not just facing a recall but is looking like he might lose in the recall.  Such a loss can only come if many Democrats also succumb to irrational thinking.  Republicans in California began their recall efforts almost immediately after his election because they didn't like the outcome.  That's not the purpose of the recall and Democrats are ironically allowing what is literally the overturning of a legitimate election.  And the murderous governors of Florida and Texas?  They are licking their lips on their increasingly positive political futures.  But this craziness in not limited to the US.  Just look at the responses to COVID in Brazil, India, Russia, and on and on.  China is the exception of the large countries when it comes to COVID but what about addressing climate change?

This is not just personally inconvenient.  The continuing refusal of a substantial minority of Americans to receive vaccinations, wear masks or physically distance puts the lives and livelihoods of the people I most cherish at greater risk.

All this was and still is so unnecessary.  We have the science, but many Americans still prefer miracles of a supernatural sort and stubbornly cling to their exceptionalism.

Yes, Americans are infuriating in many ways, but this has always been the case.

Just because you can drink until you're drunk and you have a car doesn't mean you get in and drive the car while you're drunk.  You think of others on the road.

We make this mistake over and over again.  How many times have we heard (or said) ""It's a free country.  I can do whatever I please""?  That means you don't have to be vaccinated if you don't want to be.  It means that you don't have to wear a mask. It means that you can endanger other people's health and well being.  Or does it?  

As for climate change;  there has been an entire industry devoted to watering down regulations, laws, acts, agency powers etc., so as to avoid dealing with reality.  We're talking about people who see a snowflake and say global warming isn't real if there's one snowflake remaining.  And some of those people know they are lying.  

We have a choice in this country.  We can continue to elect politicians who will act in the best interests of their large corporate donors or we can elect politicians who will say no and act in our best interests and that of the planet.  Remember, there is NO planet B out there.

Many of the people around the world look at what we have and desire that lifestyle.  They are bearing the brunt of Covid, while some of us distain getting vaccinated, and that vaccine that we do goes to waste.

I'm wondering if the current surge isn't further evidence of a two-stage GOP strategy for managing the Covid crisis: a surface rationale and an underlying backup. Both were launched before the vaccines became available.
The surface plan was to fiddle unsystematically with mitigation measures in municipalities. Under the rubric of  states' rights, every area had to fend for itself, with the Trump regime supplying varying access to PPE, funding, etc. This was the period of distraction and floundering, as with the hydroxychloroquine sideshow.
The backup plan, glimpsed in Trump's assurances that the plague would go away naturally, was made explicit by Scott Atlas--to simply let the virus rip through the country. That prospect was abetted by the inconsistent responses of states and municipalities. Had a vaccine not become available, this would have probably been the dominant GOP strategy: open up everything and let the chips fall where they may.
Now that a vaccine is available, the GOP governing class takes advantage of the Delta surge to re-implement the let-it-rip strategy. They push for vaccine resistance as an expression of prudence, caution, or personal freedom.  Given that vaccine resistance isn't confined to Trumpists, many potential Democratic voters will be killed as well. Biden will have been judged a failure in facing his biggest crisis."

At the end of the day, these monsters have to live with the consequences of their actions.

Presently there are few ICU beds. Hundreds of children are in hospitals with Covid-19. And still Ivey follows the Republican dictates issued to her from somewhere deep in the recesses of the GOP. She is a puppet on a string.

That campaign of demagoguery eagerly employed by the plutocracy and the erstwhile authoritarians has, however, now escaped their control and is running wildly rampant in a susceptible, vulnerable host, the American people. It's difficult to bring back under control the rabid dogs of fear and greed once they've been unleashed and have tasted blood. They have a feral life of their own, as does now the disease of fear across the land.

At a time when we need a national confidence to address the ills of our imperfect union and to meet the greatest existential crisis of humanity, climate disaster - and its attendant geopolitical and economic effects surely to explode - instead we find our powder wet, our foodstores rotten, our ammunition suspect, our morale sabotaged and the gates unprotected.

Yes, denialism, the refusal to see the truth even when it stares one straight  in the face, has brought the obtuse rich to the privileged place they inhabit today. Completely cut off from rational crisis policy discussion to protect that privilege, many of them are perfectly willing to sacrifice the future (and the duped base they have bamboozled into supporting the likes of DeSantis and Abbot). They have decided that even inoculations are political fodder, the aged were going to die anyway they tell themselves, as long as my cash stream continues, nothing else matters.

This lobe - the mind - stores all the influences and experiences of life and is conditioned by them. Conditioning of the mind is starkly demonstrated in pet animals. Pet animals do not behave like their wild cousins. 

The conditioned mind resists change. The conditioned republican mind and the conditioned democratic mind considers the other to be on the wrong side. This is the cause of the partisan conflict and dysfunction of Congress, especially of the senate, and of the existence of a political weapon called the filibuster.

""But it’s almost impossible for them to change course. If Ron DeSantis were to admit the deadliness of his Covid mistakes, his political ambitions would be over.""

I'd only add that similarly, if the average Republican were to admit they were hoodwinked by Trump and Fox News, after making them the indelible imprint of their personnae with hats, flags, nasty outspokeness, anger, and Fox blaring 24/7, they would no longer be able to face their friends and family without shame and embarassment, so it deepens......"

Conservatives believe climate change is real. They just believe it is cyclical and has been happening for hundreds of thousands of years (the earth was 2 degrees hotter not that long ago - look it up). 

And Conservatives believe that Covid is very real. They just don’t believe that lockdowns and mask mandates stop the spread. 

The same number of those who voted for Biden have refused the vaccine as those who voted for Trump. You and the media just ignore the ones who voted for Biden."

Although their actions are  monumentally stupid and callous, these two men are smart enough to know exactly what they are doing: trading hundreds, thousands, and potentially tens of thousands of people's lives for personal political gain.

We do not currently have laws that adequately recognize and address these kinds of crimes -- because in our prior history we have never had such people wiling to throw thousands of other people's lives away just to improve their political prospects (our endemic political warmongering aside). 

But what we are seeing now in Texas and Florida are the worst kinds of crimes against humanity, being committed even today by two men who have sworn oaths to project and serve the people of their states.

Every party is entitled to its own tranche of mentally ill people. However, the GOP needs more than the jamboree attendees in Sturgis to elect its members in such numbers that it can impose its will and its logic on a county, a state, a nation.

It needs lots of people who, notwithstanding their indifference or even disdain for the 5-alarm paranoia, still pull the R lever. They say that they do so because the Democrats want to make the US into a socialist state. But what's really going on?

I suggest that, as Scott Peck pointed out, much evil is rooted in laziness and inability to give up a comfy status quo. If climate change is real, how much will my life have to change? Will my taxes go up? Will the people who have been warning about climate change be given more credence the next time they predict doom?

The actions taken by the fringe support the lack of action taken by the stealth Republicans. So, it's no wonder that when crazy people deny inconvenient reality the sane but lazy point to such venting as one side in a debate, when it's really equivalent to a crafty insomniac child claiming that monsters are under his bed. Thus the (good) Republicans get to support a government of short-term convenience, voting for the Chicken Little Party (""everything's fine!"") long after that party's sloth and perfidy have become obvious."

With wealth comes power and influence. And they bought their way into media, politics, and even colleges and their faculties. A solid electorate controls the Republican brand. They have final say on who runs and who represents them in elections. Often, through gerrymandering and media control, they win elections. No one can deny that these right wing supported extremists are good at winning elections. But once in office they plan the next campaign which usually means controlling taxes for their donors. They hardly ever pass any other kind of legislation. And they must live on lies like the ones mentioned here. 

Covid may indeed be different. Lies don't work when they can expose believers to a serious infection that has a good chance of death or lingering effects. Covid may expose the liars as no amount of punditry and talk could ever do. What is needed is to connect the covid lies to the other lies told by the long time liars."

If you don't wish to spend the rest of your life wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, enduring rounds of booster shots and new vaccines against variants, and fretting over sporadic outbreaks, take action now. 

Do nor patronize businesses that retain or hire unvaccinated personnel! Demand that the school district your taxes support requires vaccination for teachers and staff, and practices reasonable and effective masking and social distancing!

They would also tell me that after work, they would go home, go online and search for vaccinations for their families and themselves.  And, if a source was located, then they had to next worry about the cost and whether or not it was simply a saline solution.

Gov DeSantis says Florida is a free state -- folks can decide for themselves if they want to contract Covid or infect others (but businesses aren't free to do business only with vaccinated customers because that would be a violation of freedom).  Abbott in Texas says freedom is carrying a concealed weapon with absolutely no restriction.  Sen Josh Hawley believes a mob attack on The Capitol is an exercise in freedom.  GOP state legislators say they defend freedom by making it impossible for some to vote.  A majority of Supreme Court Justices define freedom as telling woman they have no reproductive choices.  

For decades driving a Chevrolet (or more likely a 300 horsepower pickup) to see the USA was freedom at its gas guzzling best.

America is the land of the free.  Responsibility, consequences, that's socialist talk. The want to take away our guns, monster trucks, smokes, even our burgers and steaks.

What's not free?  Education, healthcare, equality, childcare, the right to vote, decent housing, livable wages.

Covid, Climate Change are just socialist conspiracies against American freedom.  

Republicans love to say vigilance is the price of freedom. That's a lie.  The real price of freedom is responsibility, personal and collective.

What I can't understand is why his political ambitions are not over already.  His state is gripped by raging disease, he and everybody else knows how to curb it, and yet he, in effect, champions illness and death while gas-lighting his campaign against human life as a defense of freedom.  Even more puzzling: he and the rest of the right-wing are systematically killing off their own political base with their anti-masking and anti-vaxxing and putting everybody else at risk into the bargain.  It's murderous behavior on his part and on the part of all those who break into big smiles, applaud, and cheer when he spews his death-dealing rhetoric."

He is a Yale grad and a Harvard trained lawyer. He knows (or ought to) some basic truths about vaccination and mask wearing's role in preventing epidemics. His calculation to abjure both at the expense of his constituent's health (and for the benefit of his own political ambitions) is not a mistake.

The epidemics of random mass shootings and unwarranted police violence speak for themselves. One could also point to the millions of Americans who persist in believing Trump's Big Lie despite its corrosive effect on our democracy.

A little humility would go a long way.  Doctors, despite their assertions, are not always right (no masks, wear masks, do not eat eggs, eggs are OK).  Instead, be honest and admit that the current science indicates...

People are scared and not always the most rationale when scared.  Explain the need for masks and persuade people to wear them.  Mandates won't work.  They create confrontations between  low paid workers and customers.  They create anger in the schools.  Etc.

2021-08-10 14:41:24,In reading the comments in the NYT selected comments I feel that the attitude of the comments is indicative of the reason why we have not succeeded  in working to solve this problem over the years.  In 1965 it was suggested that families have no more than 2.5 children which sounds ridiculous but you know what it is referring to.  I know because we were starting our family at that time.  We have solar panels on our roof and increased the insulation on our home.  I drive a Prius which people make fun of and my husband drives a 4 cylinder Jeep and has alway done so over the years and services our cars so that they do not pollute.  We recycle.  I am sure that there are many people who have been working on this for years.  When I read the comments in this section there is such venom and ugly attitudes directed toward people who reject taking steps which only makes them put their backs up.  It doesn't serve the cause.  The stick your finger in their eyes attitude of the people who voted for Trump and the rage of the attacks on our government reflects the anger they feel towards blue states and the ugliness on this page reflects the anger blue states feel toward them.  Why don't we talk positively about how we can soften this ugliness and begin to seek the common good.  From what I see in these comments is the fact that our side is no better than the people rioting in the Capital.  We just are using a different approach which is scorn.

What I don't understand is that they don't have any policies to counter the Dems.  They just oppose everything without providing their own infrastructure plan or health care plan etc.  They are just going to have to accept they are going to lose the mid terms and the next presidential election even though they are bringing in voter suppression laws.  it is sad but overdue.  they had a chance to reform from 2012 onwards but they went backwards.  it is a slow and painful death but democracy and the planet will be healthier for it in the long run.

It is critical that we break the fever soon, as it is just a matter of time before a new mutation comes along that can make it past our current vaccinations.  That means starting over with developing a new version of the vaccine for protection and then getting everyone vaccinated again.  Economically, I don't know our country can afford such a path.  
Can someone take the Abbott and DeSantis of the country into a room and explain this to them?  Paint the picture of what this would mean.  
If they don't change their course, then commit them to an insane asylum as they are a clear and present danger to our country.
The Country has an obligation not to let this happen.  We are in a war that we cannot lose. In such times, perceived individual freedoms must carry a low weight, as we need each other to survive and win the war. 
In fact, I question if anyone not medically prevented from taking the vaccine has any right to refuse.  This is not a personal decision, as a decision not to negatively effects the rest of us.  Unless you're going to completely quarantine yourself, you can't choose to not vaccinate and continue to enjoy free movement. Every non-vaccinated person is a risk to everyone they come into contact with.  You are the potential host to the new mutation.  In this light, it is not a personal decision."

Think of it. Corporations are in essence, an autocracy.They are led by a CEO who sets the tone under the eyes of an elite board of trustees.
The millions of low wage earners across the globe that enable these entities are cogs in a wheel.They have no voice or decision making abilities.

No one of any political persuasion was throwing up any roadblocks to those who wanted the vaccine.  Now, with this Delta variant, it is fair to question what we have been putting in our arms due to the number of breakthrough infections and renewed mask mandates, but that's not just conservatives, that could be anyone who has been vaccinated.

2021-08-10 15:53:14,"First, I'd like to say that Krugman has a writing style that is instantly recognizable -- his economy of words and eloquent expression of facts covers all the bases. A true wordsmith.

He is, of course, absolutely correct with his observation of the right's affliction.

What is so sad and aggravating is that GOP politicians have got to (privately!) know better but refuse to admit all in service of winning their next election. It's telling that (mainly) the house republicans and senators that are -not- seeking re-election are bold enough to speak the truth.

And the lemmings they preach to? I weep that our country is so divided on issues where's there's simply no question where the truth resides.

It's one thing to discuss abortion where reasonable people can hold differing views (it's not a binary discussion) but it's quite another altogether when hard, irrefutable facts (regarding climate change, COVID, etc.) are rejected by a significant minority of our citizenry.

And for what purpose? Sub-rosa white-supremacy? Religious reasons? ""Freedom""? Can the right not walk and chew gum? -- Believe in science and still otherwise hold their their identity? (Not withstanding that identity may necessarily preclude belief in science...)

Or is their entire identity tied to ""owning the libs"" thereby automatically rejecting anything a ""lib"" believes in? Does the sun rise in the west?"

The unvaccinated and unfortunately the immunocompromised will be the most badly impacted.

2021-08-10 16:01:31,"Dr. Krugman. Thank you for your insights here.
""Climate Denial, Covid Denial and the Right's Descent"". Seeing this headline, we see something in common. The threats from the growing climate change and the raging pandemic are real. Scientists and others at the UN are sounding the alarm on global warming. We see a mixed acknowledgement to the pandemic. We see no sign of the vaccine becoming available for children. Schools are set to reopen in a few weeks. Climate Change was declared a hoax by our elected leaders. At the same time, certain elected leaders are also been careless and negligent in addressing the Covid pandemic. This country has already lost over 600,000 valuable lives. Hospitals are already running short of bed space. Yet, it is disappointing to see how governors of Florida, Texas, others and even some Senators responding to this growing concern. Their position on this issue that relates to the health of the people, is appalling. It is difficult to understand what their mission and objectives are."
2021-08-10 16:02:03,"Perhaps because of the extreme nature of the threats we are facing in this country and given how interconnected humanity has become, the world, when trying to come up with parallels, I frequently stumble upon fairy tales, fables and myths. 

For instance, I see the rise of trump as a non fictional version of the Emperor's New Clothes, a tale that includes the majority of townspeople unwilling to point out his nakedness. Those of us not susceptible to con artistry, conspiracy jabbarwocky and the attractions of a cult are represented by the one little girl voicing the truth. If only we had her sway to wake up the hypnotized.

When it comes to most glaring examples of denial despite red, blinking signs and sirens in relation to climate change and the pandemic, I see as reference The Grasshopper and the Ant with the short sighted, gluttonous deniers as Grasshopper. Sadly, though, no matter how hard working the Ants in my imaginary updated fable, they will not be spared the repercussions of the feckless, solipsistic and fatally irresponsible behavior of the Grasshoppers. 

It is by now obvious that if not directly confronted and defeated, the human race is in great peril. Sometimes, as in this case, the Boy Crying Wolf is telling the truth. The deniers side with the wolves."

The long-term consequences of those two paths are clear, but which is going to make him more popular today?

do away with corporate, financial, environmental, and gun regulation 

vote against affordable universal health insurance and reasonable prescription drug pricing controls

spend vast amounts of money on defense and the military to arm the nation with weapons of mass destruction

2021-08-10 16:12:13,"All true. But I think vaccine opposition follows directly from Trump's denial of the pandemic once his handlers decided they weren't willing to take the steps necessary to control transmission of the virus. They realized that their inept response presented a threat to his re-election and so downplayed it... it's like the flu, it will be gone by spring. Once they realized vaccines wouldn't be widely available by the election, they downplayed their significance. It was a short step to opposing government action to increase vaccination, with the added value of undercutting Biden. It is, of course, insane to politicize a virus that infects everyone, no matter how we vote!"

Sadly, sooner or later  with schools opening up soon, their perverse abuse of law   to  block vaccine mandates of any healthcare or educational staff,  the voluntary wearing of  masks or any other mitigation efforts against the rising Delta variation infections amongst young children,  will force them to confront reality.  How many children will have to die to prove that  their malignant  adherence to GOP (and Trumpian) dogma has nothing to do with freedom, but death and despair?   How many Superintendents of Schools, Administrators and teachers will have to deal with the threat of losing their salary or quitting their jobs, if they put protection of the children first ahead of  the Republican agenda?"
2021-08-10 16:32:03,"Lately I've been thinking that humans have no ultimate control over their societies, so that blaming elected officials, political parties and people under the sway of various ideologies is futile.

Climate science is a science about complex systems. So is economics. So are the logistics of global industries. Now we need to start looking at humanity as a set of complex systems rather than as groups of culpable and/or responsible individuals. Not sure how to do this. All I have to offer as examples are the checks and balances of the U.S. Constitution, and GAAP (double-entry accounting paired with external audits.)

Claims that mass transit or  Amtrak help cllimqte change are also overblown except in the most congested areas. 

Covid denial reveals that neither the somewhat sensible caution about climate change nor paassionate and self-destructive defense of assault rifles were not enough of a loyalty test. Rational anaylsis simplified often to a slogan ora sound bite were not the primary motivation for most deniers . An allergy to scammers does not keep someone from social distancing, wearing a mask or getting a free shot that many millions have alreadt received.

2021-08-10 16:55:28,"While what Dr. Krugman says is valid as far as it goes, it understates the problem.  My points here will include, though they aren't limited to, some things that Dr. Krugman himself has said in the past:  the institutional Republican Party has become heavily committed to establishing a corrupt authoritarian regime.  The regime doesn't have to be led by Donald Trump (Ron DeSantis really would like to lead it himself).  It wants to direct power, including money and other resources, to a small number of people at the expense of everyone else.  It's no longer a case of wanting to promote the interests of wealthy donors over the rest of the population;  the wealthy donors have been put on notice by certain remarks that they can be made expendable, like Russian oligarchs.  The politicians have realized that they can be the oligarchs themselves.  How do they get voters to support something obviously against the voters interests?  By promoting irrationality as a prime value, and by distracting attention from as many real world issues as possible in favor of obsessing over critical race theory, etc. and valuing tribalism, although most of the tribe will suffer in the long run."

He did not go along with her suggestion that wearing masks was a greater threat to health than getting Covid, (which evidently someone opined at the WSJ) but he was forced to agree that there have been no studies on mask effectiveness in classrooms, but rather only in a lab. (Although another column today proves that false, too.) She got him to agree that there should be no universal mask mandates. 

This line of questions was contrived by Fox News “journalists” to doubt and deride mask mandates even though they are the best way to prevent spread of the virus in schools.

When Dr Redfield started to say that the most important and effective way to stop the spread of the virus and its mutations was to get vaccinated they cut him off.

So now Fox News viewers are armed with false/misleading factoids to support their opposition to masks. 

(PS I heard nothing on Fox News about the climate report, but no doubt if it was they would interview a science denier to discredit it.)

When the CDC makes a course correction in the gathering storm of pandemic calamity it is accused of ignorance and ideology. This in turn opens the floodgates of misinformation. Even people with medical education, such as Rand Paul or R. Kennedy spew misinformation on the Web, that hotbed of moral decay under management by a herd of waffling promulgators of mush.
To look at the bright side: the beneficiaries of Rand Paul serving in the Senate rather than his ophthalmologist practice is his former patient population. Imagine their medical provider refusing to be vaccinated, wear a mask, take precautions, no need for that, ""herd immunity"" does the job, Paul had Covid and will give you some of his.

In the real world they are not relevant.

Covid is the first time republican voters have had to pay the piper first.  Up to now, their cozy, smug response to every injustice and evil that empowered them was: 'What? No.  Not now. You first.""  

Their parasitic status, fueled by the labor of democrats, let them live dangerously while feeding fat at the federal teat (subsidies, no taxes)   Republican voters, at the behest of their churches, FOX, and Trump and Cruz, enjoyed their meth, their penury, and their consequence-free gun waving, bullying, and the insurrection.  

Blue states were paying the piper.

This is the first time, having made up their minds based on churches, FOX, AM radio, Klan mom, and Trump, they are catching Covid because of chips in vaccines, space lasers, and child eating democrats.  I.e., they are facing the consequences first - before others.  

The thing for private and public businesses is to sack all those without vaccines, triple their health insurance premium, and have them pay out of pocket for infecting others.  Let churches, FOX, AM radio, Klan mom, Trump and republican leaders - who continue to tell them not to vaccinate - address their needs.

The ACLU is reporting that the FBI has reprised its officially defunct domestic counterintelligence program and is targeting African-American political activists. Open the link below. During the classic Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, the FBI used this program to suppress the First Amendment-protected political activism of liberal political activists. In 1975 and 1976, the Church Senate Select Intelligence Committee determined that this program unconstitutionally, illegally, and over-broadly targeted members of The American Left. Today, with Republicans openly behaving like fascists President Biden, Attorney General Garland and the Democrat-led congressional intelligence committees must look at America’s domestic counterterrorism effort to ensure that conservatives are not retaliating against liberals for their political views and advocacy. Frankly, that was J. Edgar Hoover’s prime motivation for creating the program in 1956: to defeat American liberalism.

We understand that you may be used to chicken that has been cooked to 165 degrees. We do have to respect that some of our cooks may have seen a meme or a YouTube video saying that 100 degrees is fine and we do not want to encroach on their beliefs.
Some servers may wish to touch your food as they serve it. There is no reason that a healthy person with clean hands can’t touch your food. We will take their word for it that they are healthy and clean.
Water temperature and detergent are highly personal choices, and we allow our dishwashing team to decide how they’d prefer to wash the silverware you will put in your mouth.

Meanwhile, Gianforte and the state Republicans haven't said a word in criticism of the tide of anti-vaxxer hysteria washing over our state.

Regarding climate change, Gianforte has removed environmental regulations governing polluting industries such as mining, and arranged sweet heart deals with many of these companies who are contributing to global warming.

Even today, on NPR, the news is that Ted Cruz, Ron DeSantis and others are stating with absolute certainty, as fact, that immigrants are being deliberately let into the country who are carriers of the delta variant to spread the virus and create the surge we are seeing in the southern states.

It’s stunning how unpatriotic and grossly, openly unAmerican the Right has become, all in the name of… Freedom?

DeSantis has become the leading face of authoritarianism in America: a smarter Trump (Trump 2.0), doing in fact what Republicans have longed to do for years.

Yet, ironies abound. The Republican vision of free economy, free business, and freewheeling local government, has become a Floridian lockdown of all three - each held hostage to the political whims of a ruthlessly driven governor. It’s all about the “freedom” from masks, avoiding the tyranny of vaccines, masks, and other assorted pandemic mandates. It’s done by imposing DeSantis’ own private tyranny. Florida has become a state of one man rule: where local law, municipal ordinance, and the discretion of school districts, and university governing boards, have all been summarily overruled.

Freedom from tyranny… by imposing tyranny. It’s freedom for me, autocracy for thee.

Public employees not only have no say, they aren’t even allowed to object. DeSantis is not only threatening to defund school districts who defy his anti-mask mandates, he’s threatening to withhold paychecks too.

Welcome to North Korea!

And this is supposed to give him broad presidential appeal for 2024? How? Only by winning the authoritarian groupie Republican primary - followed by wholesale stealing/overriding the votes of countless millions in the swing states.

Be very afraid. Democracy is dying in 2024!"

The right wing tendency has been a part of our society from the beginning, but, since Reagan it has become more overt. 

Rush Limbaugh was significant in that he gave a voice to the right wing -- remember the Rush-Rooms and dittoheads?  

But, he did something else, perhaps even more powerful.  He made a point about ""having fun doing it"" -- his words.

This combination has proven irresistible to the hard core right. 

Trump exploited it at his rallies, which were all snark in a party atmosphere. 

Now, instead of issues, we have right wing political identity. It is impervious to facts and logic.  We have right wingers in the process of dying from Covid, still insisting that it's a hoax. We have them insisting on exposing themselves and even their children to a potentially deadly illness. We have knee-jerk opposition to anything the left or center-left supports, including science. 

Why? Because they're still having fun ""owning the libs"".

Climate change will affect everyone equally, although certainly some states and countries worse than others.  But Covid-19's rules are simple and even harsher with the Delta variant -- if you don't get a vaccine and if you don't wear masks when appropriate and engage in certain precautions, it's going to get you and then your parents, relatives, and maybe kids.  And it's going to kill some of you and make others very sick and suffer long-term symptoms.  The rules are simple and pretty immediate -- much easier to spin climate change when the most severe consequences are at least a few years in the future.  I am surprised to find myself, and many of my peers, lacking any sympathy whatsoever for unvaccinated victims of Covid in this country (with exception of children under 12).  And maybe, just maybe, as more and more Trump supporters are killed by Covid or lose family members and loved ones to Covid, just maybe they'll think twice next time they vote for a DeSantis or Abbott or Trump or any other Republican politician who has completely mislead them for the past year and a half and has cost them dearly."

The Koch brothers, and other billionaires have used the political right to disrupt and prevent the government from problem solving because it is in their financial interest to do so. The problem is this has led to social disaster where simple things like wearing a mask or getting a vaccination is a bridge too far for the nonsensical lemmings following the pied pipers of greed, selfishness, immorality, and unethical behaviors. When ""love thy neighbor"", and ""turn the  other cheek"" gets lost in the wind of hate and bigotry, we see the governing Republican principles. Before Trump, those tactics were hidden under the covers of silence and they refused to accept the idea that they were morally bankrupt. Funny how it's so evidently clear who are the responsible and rational people. Democrats were concerned about the health of the American people and about what was best for our country and humanity at large.

2021-08-10 19:14:00,"A thread tying conservatives’ response to climate change with Covid is their medieval religious belief the universe is controlled by a Divine Puppet Master.  Bypassed by the Enlightenment, they reject concepts like human autonomy and free will. 

In their antiquated view, human beings cannot possibly cause climate change, because we aren’t that powerful.  It must be the Divine Plan, and we can’t interfere with that.  The righteous will surely be saved, and only sinners swept away, burned out, or starved. 

Likewise, Covid is a test from which true believers will be saved, and only sinners stuck down.  Taking the vaccine reflects lack of faith in Divine protection, a moral failure. 

Conservative leaders believe it their religious duty to clear the path and hold the line so the Divine Plan can take its course and purge the Earth of the pagans, sinners, and unfaithful.  Their heads filled with medieval apocalyptic imagery, they likely look at a landscape wracked by fire, flood, drought, famine, pestilence and death gleefully anticipating The Rapture. 

Those of us embracing Enlightenment Era humanist rationality, autonomy, and free will - with or without complimentary religious belief - must rally on in spite of them.  Like the medieval Flat Earthers to whom they are kin, they will either adapt or die off, consumed by a plague they refuse or deny power to stop.  

Medieval thinking must pass away.  Perhaps Covid is Nature’s way of moving that along."

This means this technological revolution is coming whatever one thinks about climate change. The real reason Reagan took the solar pannels of off the roof of the white house is because he was in the pocket of big oil. Big oil is not interested inclimate change is real but only in delaying this technological revolution so they can continue their operations because this revolution is a threat to their business model. It will make all their investments worthless.

This discussion about climate change is an illusion on both the right and left. So the left is telling the truth about climate change but it is inconsequential. There are these two sides claiming their dogma is more important than the dogma of the other side.

So let us ignore this false pretence. This revolution is coming although it seems not fast enough to counter climate change. Whaterever, they who invest now will be the frontrunners who will benefit economically from that investment and mitigating climate change is a nice extra.

Really, this economic argument needs to be made by the left. The reason why some focus on climate change is because this polarization over a nonconsequential matter benefits them.

The further they drift into intellectually untenable lies, the more dependent they become on demonization, to the point where now they have no serious arguments left and their entire viability relies on liberals being evil and wrong.

Denying the vote to working-class people of color who are predisposed to vote Democrat is one way. Neutralizing the First Amendment-protected political activism of liberal political activists, such as Black American civil rights leaders, labor leaders, women’s rights activists, immigration activists, and LGBTQ activists, through the domestic counterintelligence infrastructure is another way. Neutralizing the will of America’s mass majority via the legislative filibuster is another way.

The idea people coming together to solve big problems is not one they feel comfortable with.  It is hard to imagine people like this every agreeing to any plan to fix climate change.

A rise in covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths was the completely predictable result of anti-mask and anti-vaccine efforts.  Perhaps they didn't envision the extraordinary surge related to the greater infectivity of the delta variant, but only a fool would think that the GOP wasn't trying to keep Biden from decisively defeating the pandemic.

During the Obama years, it seemed shocking and almost libelous to suggest that Republicans were intentionally trying to hamper recovery of the U.S. economy from the Great Recession, though by any objective measure, such a conclusion was inescapable.   From our current perspective, GOP malfeasance circa-2011 seems almost quaint.

2021-08-10 20:50:03,"Why does DeSantis not simply allow each school system to determine their own protocol? He claims to not want to restrict freedoms, why is he restricting theirs?

2021-08-10 21:00:08,"A new trend is emerging according to which ideological conservative governments are brought down by the realities of the environment pushing back. Their poor planning, magical thining and general ineptitude at governance becomes apparent. For GW Bush it was Hurricane Katrina, for Trump it was Covid. 

Meanwhile in other countries the same dynamic is at work. Canadians may remember the unsafe water (Walkerton) crisis in Ontario that felled the Harris government, and Australians now are familiar with the failings of their federal and NSW governments when it comes to making hard choices to contain Covid. 

None of this is coincidental."
2021-08-10 20:52:34,"My son lives in central Florida. He has the corvid 19 virus, not the Delta variant. Had a shot for the virus. My wife and I think it was the Johnson & Johnson shot as he only got one shot. Now he is at home. He can't work. (quarantined) feels lousy. No money coming in, two kids and a wife to feed. His wife can't work because she is quarantined also. No health benefits. My wife and I have sent money to help them. My son isn't unique.

2021-08-10 20:42:42,"Krugman obviously did not read the 4,000+ page U.N. report.  The report suggests 3 different possible scenarios.  One is fairly benign, one has dire climate changes and the third is in the middle.  The middle scenario predicts global temperatures will increase 1 degree centigrade by the end of the century, 80 years from now.  That would not have dire consequences.  So only the most dire scenario would adversely affect us.   And placing the blame for non-vaxxed people on Republicans is ludicrous.  Take a look at a map of the cities least vaccinated.  They happen to be heavily Democratic."

2021-08-10 21:01:11,"""If Ron DeSantis were to admit the deadliness of his Covid mistakes, his political ambitions would be over.""

The trouble with this statement by Dr. Krugman is that it zeroes in on one particular ambitious politician as a role model for virus insanity and denial, where in fact the Republican party is full of DeSantis carbon-copies.

The difference is that most of them are not governors of one of the most populous states. But taken as a group they all fit into one profile: covid reality and vaccination deniers.

The most pathetic are the right-wing politicians who, after being covid and vaccinations deniers, have succumbed to the disease, and have had a change of mind on their deathbed. 

Too late."
2021-08-10 21:25:30,"Call it the Ronald Reagan phenomena.  If I remember correctly, and please correct me if I don't,  he mentioned when he was President that you don't have to roll over and roll back common sense politics,  he meant  the New Deal,  all at once,  80%  on each bill was good enough.   After 40 years of Republicans reversing policies designed to achieve the common good,  including public health,  to advance the Conservative  uncommon populist good,  very little if any common good  remains.

What does remain is a toxic mess of ignorance, hatred and debt,  sprinkled with the star dust of rich boys toying with flying each other into space.


The conservatives were simply patient, grabbing a little of the future here, some there,  sneaking back for a scrap hidden that they might have missed,  80% at an opportunity  until there well may be no future,  even for them."
2021-08-10 21:36:11,"Frankly, I am sick and tired of the entitled selfish people who say ""my body, my choice.""  Unless they live in the woods as hermits, whatever they do ultimately affects everyone around them.  Billions of Covid shots later, there is little reason for most people to be afraid of them.  The relatively few who have autoimmune and other issues should talk to their doctors. One of my friends did--and she got the shots without a problem, even after a serious reaction to a different shot some years ago.  I have an autoimmune disorder but my only side effect was a sore arm, just like with my yearly flu shot.  Let the Right scream and flail all they want. Smart and decent people do the right thing--not the ""Right"" thing."
2021-08-10 21:46:50,"To understand how the right is able to mobilize people to protest masks and vaccinations, you have to look at NPR's investigative series No Compromise. They lay out in detail how a handful of activists, many in cooperation with the Dorr brothers, operates a network of Facebook pages that mobilize conservatives to protest pretty much anything they want them to. Gun rights, covid lockdowns, school closings, mask mandates, Critical Race Theory, you name it. 
When you see people purporting to be ""concerned parents"" protesting school closings or mask mandates, you can be pretty sure they're conservative activists, often trained using the book Confrontational Politics by H. L. Richardson as a blueprint. I strongly recommend listening to this series on NPR's website."
2021-08-10 22:00:12,"“If Ron DeSantis were to admit the deadliness of his Covid mistakes, his political ambitions would be over.”

Are DeSantis and Abbot so without understanding or compassion that they're actually willing to risk the lives of innocents?  Masks are not political; they work to limit exposures in circumstances where vaccination isn't possible.  We are in a new era of irrational perversity where denialism has no reason behind its resistance.  It's no longer hyperbole to declare the GOP a death cult.  No other description aligns so utterly with their insanity."
2021-08-10 20:45:39,"It's not denial, it's that people don't care.  Does anyone think for a minute that obese people, those who smoke, use illicit drugs and drink as a lifestyle don't understand that these activities are harmful to them and others?  Of course they do but they simply don't care and no one is going to tell them any different.  Who are we saving the environment for anyway, a bunch of people 50 or 100 years from now that we'll never know or see?  Who's to say some idiot doesn't get an itchy finger and set off a barrage of atomic bombs blowing us all to smithereens before then?  Then we have the government telling us that everyone must get vaccinated and wear masks all the while 1.1 million immigrants have crossed our southern border this year without being Covid tested or vaccinated and continue to do so.  If the government is so worried about the spread of Covid, whey don't they start there?  Crickets.  

You're not going to shame or mandate people do something which they don't feel is important or concerns them.  It certainly doesn't mean you give up trying to get them to do the right thing but you certainly don't widen the gap by politicizing or regionalizing them either."
2021-08-10 21:39:43,"I voted for Trump.  The vast majority of people and everyone I know agrees that climate change is real and man made.  Instead of making taking action the top priority, the Democrats have made hunting down every last person who disagrees and argues with them their priority.  It's the cult like fanaticism from the movement that is slowing progress, not a handful of idiots who don't believe in it.  Anybody that can fog a mirror and goes outside knows the climate is changing.

I lived in a foreign country that was over 99% Catholic.  All major Catholic holidays were observed and everything closed.  By focusing on the conversion of non-believers, they spread through whole populations, creating billions of believers in the world.

This seems to be how the global warming cult movement is growing.  Until they reach a conversion rate of 99% or more of the population, they will probably continue in argue and covert mode.

Until then, people that want action will vote for Republicans.  Trump blocked the carbon exports from Iran.  Trump allowed Iran to continue its peaceful pursuit of zero carbon emissions energy.  Trump halted the production of Nord Stream 2.  Trump put carbon taxes on carbon intensive imports like steel, aluminum and manufactured goods from China.

Biden's decision to allow Russia to resume building Nord Stream 2 alone will increase the EU's natural gas imports by more than 10%.  We're doomed."

2021-08-10 21:07:15,"As far as I can tell, this is how 21st century Republicanism works:
1.  Scan the landscape for anything that can be used to ""own the libs,"" assail Democrats, ignite the continuing culture wars, or instill fear about ""those people"" (anyone associated, even tangentially, with Democratic officials or their constituencies).
2.  Importantly, whatever you find doesn't have to be true or valid.  False framing is an important element (e.g., illegal immigrants are rapists and criminals, not hard workers and entrepreneurs).  Cherry picking is encouraged; hypocrisy, double standards and wild conspiracy theories abound.  
3.  Disseminate what you've come up with as far and wide as possible, through Fox News, talk radio, right-wing websites, etc.
4.  Fall in line behind the leader.  This is the ultimate in cancel culture since you must support whatever the leader says, even if he is a pathological liar and even if he is corrupt.  Consequently, believing lies that might be  helpful in the cold war against Democrats becomes more important than facts, the truth or good policy.  The truth is less important than beating Democrats.

Now Republicans have reached a truly Orwellian place, where they fly their American flags while simultaneously aiding our enemy, the virus, by opposing lockdowns and social distancing, producing anti-vaccination messaging and refusing to wear masks."

Covid and climate change can only be dealt with by collective action. Since these two situations are the most pressing and threatening in our time they, together, represent an existential threat to the doctrine of anti-collectivity. They must deny them or obfuscate their reality to defend that core project."

Hence, we cannot make the huge changes necessary to fight the impending climate catastrophe, when it is political suicide for politicians to get rid of the oil industry and make changes to our lives that involve short-term inconveniences."

2021-08-10 21:02:42,"Oh, the wicked irony of the GOP sirens. Patriots! Freedom! Family values! For decades these con artists have hijacked American values as lingo in which to cloak their false and self-righteous reverence to the true foundation of America. In their lexicon, Patriots are free to occupy federal land, shoot legally protesting Americans, form a mob and attack the federal capitol building.  Patriotic means supporting dying, climate killing industries on the altar of “my job” instead of “our planet”. Freedom means having the choice to wear a mask or get vaccinated, but not freedom to make school and work safe by requiring them.  Freedom means being able to purchase and carry firearms, not the freedom to go running or to school and not get shot to death. Freedom means being free to tell women when they can and cannot have children. Freedom means being free to make it difficult for some Americans to vote.  Family values means making sure those Americans who are less fortunate and less educated, or forced to bear children they cannot afford,  stay that way because if those families do better the real Patriot families will do worse.   Patriotic is cover for racist and bigoted,  because America was better before.  
What Republicans haven’t ignore is that patriotism requires a collective contribution.  A responsibility to the country and one’s fellow citizens. A responsibility, as we are free to pursue happiness, that we all contribute to our society."

""This week, ensemble forecasts of new reported COVID-19 cases over the next 4 weeks included forecasts from 25 modeling groups, each of which contributed a forecast for at least one jurisdiction.

This week’s national ensemble predicts that 350,000 to 1,800,000 new cases will likely be reported in the week ending August 28, 2021.

Over the last several weeks, more reported cases have fallen outside of the forecasted prediction intervals than expected. This suggests that current forecast prediction intervals may not capture the full range of uncertainty. Because of this, case forecasts for the coming weeks should be interpreted with caution.""

2021-08-08 11:11:52,"Hey fellow seniors (I'm 73), there's a great way not to get Covid. Protect yourself with a real anti-viral mask.  All advanced countries produce anti-viral masks (also called respirators), designed to protect health care workers in Covid ICUs. 

The N95, made in the US, is the only mask approved by the FDA.  The downside is the higher cost and discomfort.  Many people find them hard to breathe through.  N95s are available on Staples and Office Depot websites.

Two other widely available masks are the KN95 and KF94.
The KN95 is made in China.  This mask is less thick than the N95 and much easier to breathe through.  They are also a fraction of the cost.
The KF94 is made in South Korea and tested by their government.  It shares the advantages of the Chinese mask: easier to breathe through and less expensive.

NBC News has done a piece on where to get authentic KN95s.

I want to stress that all three masks have been battled-tested in Covid-care settings.  All three masks are sturdy and reusable in the light virus context of the supermarket.  If you regard your office as a heavy virus context, you can disinfect by placing the mask in a sealed paper bag for three days and then discarding after five uses.

What we need to see are financial repercussions against he unvaccinated.  Lawsuits for wrongful death. We need insurers and the government to stop paying for COVID hospitalizations as it is elective not to be vaccinated so that hospitals bankrupt the unvaccinated. 

The Republicans have only one true lord and it isn’t Trump. It is the all mighty dollar.

Put their money in jeopardy and see how fast they get vaccinated. Take away their inheritance for killing their grandma with stealthy Covid.  See how fast they get vaccinated then."
2021-08-08 17:28:12,"The media treads too lightly on Governors such as Asa Hutchinson. The covid19 cases increased, and he is sorry for his mask anti-mandate. What should be pointed out is that the suffering in Arkansas is up BECAUSE of his anti-mask laws, and his and other republicans' downplaying of the vaccine. Please call a spade a spade, and do not become part of the misinformation/spin machine of those who helped perpetuate and accentuate this plague."
2021-08-08 17:33:47,Even more evidence the insanely irresponsible CDC policy change on masks in May was a disaster. They really believed the honor system would work? New leadership is needed
2021-08-08 17:26:57,"the Bilys’s children would not have suspected the new coronavirus. They might have blamed the flu, or simply advancing age. “What we heard on TV was ‘high fever, can’t breathe’ — and they had neither,” Mr. Lamanno recalled.""

I hope we learn something from the last year, plus. I really hope lay-people stop diagnosing themselves and/or their family and blaming illnesses on what amount to wives-tale knowledge. ""Oh it must be old-age...no worries."" ""Ah, the kid is always sick, went outside with a wet head."" 

People gotta stop relying on their folklore medical diagnoses. 

The facts have been made clear over the last 18 months...most Americans dont know squat about viral threats, much less all the simpler mitigating procedures that are grounded in science. Masks are not perfect, but they do work to curb transmissions. Perfectly? NO! Even allegedly sterile environments like say surgical theaters are not 100% sterile, but all the protocols - including PPE - greatly lower the risks of infections - from the staff to the patients and vice versa. 

Do car brakes eradicate vehicular accidents? NO! They greatly reduce them, and lessen the damages. Does an umbrella make it impossible to get wet in the rain? No! It keeps you mostly dry, and that's good enough to use them. 

If we learn anything from the pandemic, it must be that our civilian population don't know squat about epidemiological threats. And down home diagnosis must end! 

We must learn from this, or we're doomed."
2021-08-08 17:35:06,This is a poorly executed column.  It needs to make clear upfront that everything in it applies ONLY to unvaccinated individual. It’s information has nothing to do with breakthrough infections. It’s tying currently rising hospitalizations to what occurred before vaccination was available is a bad concept and  of limited value for the vaccinated
2021-08-08 17:36:04,"About the elderly being more susceptible to Covid, statistically this may be true but let's look below the surface. The longer we live in this toxic culture, the more we become victims of a range of things undermining our immune systems and making us more vulnerable to disease: obesity, heart conditions, lung conditions, alcohol and tobacco addiction, overuse of pharmaceutical drugs. And pesticides and herbicides including glyphosate, all of which are found in the air and water, not just in sprayed crops. Then there's the ongoing effect of pollution in cities and around factories and mines. We are living in an autoimmune epidemic which started in the '80s, long before Covid. So it's no surprise that compared to children with their strong immune systems, older adults are sick and frail. The vaccines, if successful, will ameliorate symptoms. They will not solve an underlying, culture-wide problem."
2021-08-08 17:38:33,"Early on in the pandemic, there was an article in the Times by a doctor about blood oxygen levels in Covid patients. As I recall, he was a pulmonologist volunteering in a New York City emergency room, I presume because his practice was shut down because of Covid. He wrote there were many hospitalized patients with no fever, but they had low levels of oxygen in their blood. I ordered a oximeter on line (that little thing they put on your finger when you visit your doctor) and used it every morning, along with a thermometer, until a few weeks after my second vaccination. Finally put it in a drawer a couple of months ago. I pulled it out again this morning."
2021-08-08 17:43:52,"Thank you for this article.  Are you aware of any follow-up studies aimed at detecting similar symptoms for breakthrough infections in vaccinated elderly?  Also, what is the guidance for testing after some time has passed since onset of these specific symptoms (fatigue, forgetfulness), ie should testing be done for antibodies vs virus? Literally asking for a friend, who has been experiencing some of above; pcp has not suggested Covid as a potential cause."
2021-08-08 17:46:09,"Thanks for continuing information.  Practical and honest. 

I know an old couple who were very vigilant about staying in their house prior to vaccination.  They refused to see family and grandchildren. Now all family members are vaccinated, including the teen grandchildren. The old couple agreed to a family reunion. But suddenly they’re freaking out about the Delta variant, they ditched the reunion, and they’ve retreated into the house again. They don’t trust the vaccines, they misinterpret the purpose and efficacy of the vaccines. They believe The Variant has caused them to not see their family. 

Life is risk management.  This old couple has a good chance of becoming disabled or dying from lots of other common ailments before they ever consent to visit with their grandchildren again."
2021-08-08 17:59:14,"Yesterday the US had over 100'000 new cases , Canada had 518 , the US had over 500 deaths , Canada 9 deaths . Canada has given about 20% more vaccinations with the early efforts targeting seniors , this despite a much slower startup to vaccinations . So the US has 200 times more new cases despite having less than ten times the population . No wonder that seniors in the US are having problems . We live in Windsor Ontario opposite Detroit and the entire county has 2 people in hospital which is a spike up from zero a few days ago , a death is rare these days and we get a daily update from the local health unit . We do not congregate in large numbers and people still social distance and wear masks indoors , and we do not think that we live in party central . So simply be your own quality control , you all know what is happening by now and you should not have to wait to be told what to do . Anyone who is not vaccinated should do so now , its so simple you sit in a chair and bingo its done , you do not even have to raise your arm and when it's over they thank you . So if you can't be bothered doing it for yourself , do it for the seniors you know and i bet that afterwards you will feel good about yourself , we sure did ."
2021-08-08 18:00:40,I am curious if anyone vaccinated has died from the virus
2021-08-08 18:00:55,"age 75, double vaccination in spring - at recent annual physical exam by nurse rather than PC physician, all staff were, by doctor's reported advice, entirely ambiguous about ability to detect Covid19 via any test, to detect traces or symptoms remaining if previously contracted.

exam left clear impression that medical staff were incapable of - or disinterested in - diagnosing or treating anything less than most obvious and dramatic symptoms of the plague.

just one old guy's anecdotal report - but via such we must make decisions in lieu of more concrete data - med staff seems clueless, confused, maybe overworked, and not particularly interested in or skilled at sorting through any individual senior's list of accumulated physical grievances to determine the effects of a specific virus.

others' results may vary depending on access to providers."
2021-08-08 18:04:24,"In May, 2020, I had a bout of sudden weight loss with nausea and diarrhea.  My doctor checked me for flu, which I did not have, but refused to give me a Covid test because I ""was not at risk.""  I was 73 years old.  While I masked when out, I mostly stayed home.  I suspect I did have Covid 19, but I will never know.  While we know more about this disease now than we did then, it's disturbing to know that I was refused a test that might have made a difference."
2021-08-08 17:47:44,"As a geriatrician, this is not news to me but still important for many health care providers and the public to know. Typical signs like a fever, an elevated white cell count (immune cells), and even focal symptoms (like cough=pneumonia, burning feeling on urinating=urine infection, etc.) may not be present. I'd also caution the same in younger people who are immunocompromised because of chronic conditions and medications they may take."
2021-08-08 18:10:20,"Dr. Robert Redfield was interviewed on Doctor Radio on Friday (a channel on SiriusXM radio which I highly recommend). He noted that it wasn’t until March of 2020 that the CDC realized that asymptomatic infection was how this new coronavirus was spreading so efficiently. 

Now we have the Delta variant, which is spreading even more rapidly than the original version of the virus. Yes we now have vaccines, but you can still catch and transmit the virus, EVEN if you are vaccinated. You may get symptoms or not, and there’s no way to predict how your body is going to handle it. 

Get vaccinated, and act like it’s 2020. Mask up, wash your hands, and practice social distancing."
2021-08-08 18:13:42,"So far, I have read and heard no public advice to people to avoid taking antibiotics if they feel sick until a doctor tells them they have a bacterial infection, not covid. Antibiotics open pathways for complicating infections because they make holes in a person's protective biota that defends from infection by filling ecological niches that can otherwise be occupied by pathogens. This article recounts a case where a person took prescribed antibiotics for a urinary infection and wound up with a more severe covid infection."
2021-08-08 18:35:01,Rosemary seems to exude beauty via her robust health.  And I'd guess that is what it will take to not be damaged by covid.  Though much younger people do actually end up with chronic problems so hard to tell.
2021-08-08 18:37:53,"Life is risk management.  

The mRNA vaccines are a wonderful achievement of medical science.  They still provide great protection against serious symptoms of Covid 19. 

Family and friends are important.  If old people are vaccinated, they should take the opportunity to be with their vaccinated families.  Covid 19 is not the only risk in living.  Old people are disabled or die from lots of common ailments every day. 

Being with family and friends is important. If you are vaccinated, go be with them."
2021-08-08 18:41:18,"Reading this through, I was struck by the information that the older gentleman, Mr. Bily, underwent two hip surgeries after having contracted COVID-19. What healthcare provider thought that was a good idea in this fraught environment? Perhaps it was difficult to get around, but the man was 90 years old and surgery in such an individual is extremely taxing, even if you are very healthy, which he wasn’t! It seems to me that too many health providers have no common sense and are neglecting quality of life in favor of, dare I say, making money off elderly people in difficult circumstances. 

I hope this wasn’t the case, but it wouldn’t be the first instance of medical idiocy and venality."

With each new variant we are seeing a virus gain power like a video game hero.  The original virus has gone from level one in Wuhan to spread world-wide, overcome masks because to many people did not wear them, challenging vaccines by becoming super infective.  The last variant recorded by humanity will be the omega variant, the one mutant hero coming from the mass of infections in unvaccinated people that will completely overpower the vaccinated."
2021-08-08 19:11:26,"Thanks for highlighting this difference in how disease may present in this population, hopefully it is an updated reference point for congregate settings.  Checking for a fever is not always an effective way for screening or prevention of contagion."
2021-08-08 19:12:51,"This is really outdated information.  What seniors need to know is the symptoms to watch for now since many of us are vaccinated. With delta variant surging and the potential for serious breakthrough COVID infections, are they the same or should we seek testing and help at a different point?"
2021-08-08 19:22:03,"This is useful information even though the people were not vaccinated. It's a head up for older people for whom the vaccines don't work, or don't work well, because of health issues."

My experience with Covid shots was waiting 3 months & having to hire a cab to drive me 1 1/2 hors away to get them. I deal with the daily terror of many older friends who are in a state of chagrin, shock or very ill. One amidst the bey of the stricken or semi stricken is Playwright dr. Larry Myers, a Catholic colleague who tenure taught at St. Johns University 30 years after 10 years in Ohio teaching. His Playwrights Sanctuary challenges newer dramatist to write about critical issues. Myers own new play is ""Ambidexterity"" about vaccination debate, Covid & the hope for a new theater arising post neo Dark Ages. His theater is masked, gloved, six feet apart in found theater spaces. His mentors were Tennessee Williams & Eric Bentley. Edward Albee authorized his Sanctuary."

One with pneumonia may not cough. They may not have fever. The most common symptom of a serious infection in an old person is lethargy or a deterioration in thinking. Older people with urinary infections, pneumonia, or infections in the abdomen like appendicitis or diverticulitis can look the same."

2021-08-08 19:30:31,I could only hope that this terrible nagging pain in my neck was only a stealth symptom from Covid19 but I doubt if I’d be that lucky.  Once the pandemic passes we’ll just be left to resign ourselves to the fact that it sucks to get old regardless.
2021-08-08 19:44:52,"It's so frustrating constantly reading articles in every subject that refers to Hispanics as a race. It is not! It's even worse in articles about illnesses. Hispanic is a linguistic group that only share Spanish as a common language. And Mexican Spanish, or Colombian, or whatever, is not that different from the Spanish from Spain. Are Americans one race or ethnicity? No! Neither are those coming from south of the border. Many Hispanics are black or of African descent, white or of European descent. What most consider ""Hispanic,"" however, the stereotype, are Native Americans from south of the border who where colonized by Spain. Many are multiracial. So, to say that blacks have a certain tendency but not Hispanics is totally incorrect since many Hispanics are black, too! Or white!"
2021-08-08 19:45:46,It would have been a good idea to state if these symptoms are prevalent in vaccinated or unvaccinated seniors. ???

2021-08-08 19:51:33,"""In June, he began receiving home hospice care."" 

Was Mr. Bily's declining health directly or indirectly related to the Covid infection?

One of the most important messages in this article is ""Diagnosing Covid quickly in older patients can make a world of difference.""  An article on this subject would be informative."
2021-08-08 13:10:45,"My MIL got COVID in late December of 2020.  She was in the hospital the day the nursing home she lived at started vaccinating its residents in early January.  One of her caregivers had a big family Christmas celebration and brought it back to the residents she cared for.   At first it seemed like my MIL just had a mild case, no appetite, fatigue, and increased confusion.  After a few days in the hospital on supplemental oxygen only, she was discharged to skilled nursing and we hoped she was on the road to recovery.  But it turned out the COVID caused significant lung damage.  She had bout after bout of pneumonia  for the next 5 months.  She was completely bed ridden (she was lucid and able to walk with a walker before Covid.). It was like she had sudden dementia after the covid and had the most frightening hallucinations.  They tried everything, dementia meds, antipsychotics, sedatives, nothing brought her any peace.  She died after 5 horrible months that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.  The doctors and nurses at her skilled care home, which was excellent, said her experience was not unusual after Covid and that there were several patients with similar trajectories that they had treated.  Some passed away and some improved a bit but not to anywhere near the level they were functioning at before covid.  The Doctor said he heard over and over from his covid surviving patients families that something was very wrong with their parent, they just weren’t the same."
2021-08-08 19:34:36,"In case this info about atypical symptoms is of use to anyone: 

I caught COVID ten months ago, as an older person (59). My case was mild, and I had none of the most-common symptoms, but the intense fatigue, headache (as I've never had before -- like a steel band around the back of my head), and brain fog told me it was COVID.

In addition, I had
--- a low-grade fever, but erratically (it would come and go and return);
--- head-cold-like symptoms (stuffy / runny nose);
--- complete loss of appetite for the 1st few days;
--- erratic / non-linear recovery -- I'd feel better and then feel crummy, again and again, despite undertaking zero activities when I began to feel better.

Was back to almost-normal after 19 days, and fully back to normal after 35 days.  Here's hoping that an increasing number of us around the world won't contract, or re-contract, COVID."
2021-08-08 19:04:09,"One of the many exasperating things about Covid is the seemingly endless variety of symptoms, as noted by many commenters. Particularly confusing is the presence of fever. A great many infected have no change to body temperature and yet every time I go to see my doctor or enter a healthcare environment, someone dutifully assesses my temperature as if that is the telltale sign. It is worrying that our own healthcare systems are perpetuating a screening process based on understanding from 18 months ago."
2021-08-08 19:52:42,"Are any medical facilities “masking” the true number of new positive COVID-19 cases concerning the elderly, especially since their age group has the highest percentage of being vaccinated?

This isn’t a political narrative I am trying to question, but one of concern…"
2021-08-08 19:43:53,"In 2020 between September and October I had to go to 5 different doctors’ offices for appointments and then a midsize medical facility for eye surgery.

During my appointments none of the doctors offices had sufficient airflow, if any at all, which the CDC with guidance from ASHRAE, indicates that an increase to the HVAC system’s airflow to bring in more outside air is necessary to reduce any presence of the airborne infectious COVID-19 aerosols.

Several appointments I had there after I canceled because not only that vaccinations were not available at this time, but more so because I was not comfortable with the environment these medical offices were keeping and not following the HVAC protocol to help reduce transmission of COVID-19, which several months after in January was another spike in positive cases.

So, even now I am still reluctant to enter a medical facility even though I’ve been fully vaccinated for 4 months, because several weeks ago I had to go to an emergency room to be with a family member having a medical emergency, and most people who came in were not wearing masks, until they were given one.

So mask up where ever you go because not all places you think would follow safety protocols, are not."

2021-08-08 19:57:10,"Back last March, about three weeks after the second Moderna shot I attended an outside work event.  I worked alongside a younger person who I later found out was an antivaccier.  I wasn't masked, figuring I was OK.  Neither was the kid.

5 days later developed a fever.  The next day it was 103*F.  According to my wife I was pretty whacked out.  I don't remember quite a few conversations she said we had. This fever fluctuated between 103* and normal for 6 days. It was all over the place.  I never coughed.  Just fever, aches and my diabetes was completely out of control even though I wasn't eating. Developed a rash over about 25% of my body.  Lost 13 lbs over about 10 days.  I weigh 175.

Primary care physician refused to have me tested for COVID.  They ran blood tests, checked for Lyme and a couple of other things.  Said ""It can't be COVID, you have no symptoms."".  

I always wondered.

After the sixth day the fever stopped.  It took weeks to regain some sense of normalcy.  After about a month I finally got my sugar straightened out.  Never did gain all the weight back.

After reading this I wonder even more.  The doctor called it ""A fever of unknown origin.""."
2021-08-08 20:03:18,Woken have been dealing (and dying) with the lack of distinction between their symptoms of say a coronary episodes and what a man mustn’t experience. How many were sent home with a prescription for anti anxiety drugs and told to relax only to die shortly thereafter? Glad the healthcare community is noticing that seniors are presenting with differing symptoms.
2021-08-08 20:06:04,"This is all the more reason to get the FDA to approve booster shots ASAP for the most vulnerable. I am 77 years old and was fully vaccinated on January 30, 2021. I also have an immune disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and take the  immunosuppressant medication methotrexate and periodically a steroid called prednisone. I need a Covid-19 Pfizer booster shot now. I really do not see why the FDA does not approve booster shots now for old people with immune disease."
2021-08-08 20:01:08,"Different STRAINS of the Novel Coronavirus SARS CoV2 can manifest in different ways in anyone. Those, like the moron DeSantis, who deny that children are at risk, don't have clue and deliberately mislead their citizens, luring them into a grossly false sense of security. 

The ""elderly"" and infirm, medically-compromised and immune-suppressed may manifest as differently as 7 y/o's vs middle-agers. THE BOTTOM LINE, one that vaccine deniers and Cult of Trump politicians and liars ignore, is that ANYONE can get Covid and without FULL vaccination they may die. Vaccines are an answer, but an INCOMPLETE one unless everyone uses them BEFORE yet another, more virulent, variant surfaces; one that is resistant to present vaccines. THE LONGER WE WAIT, the more ignorant and stupidly we behave (yes YOU, Republicans), the longer this will last and the greater the chance of having to start all over again, where we were at the pits of last year.

Right now one if forced to assume that ANYONE is possibly infected. They may be asymptomatic or minimally so - the larger the viral load to which YOU are exposed (greater indoors, without masks) the greater YOUR chance, vaccinated to not, of contracting the disease. Denying that it exists won't protect you and THERE IS NO CURE.

At this point, if you don't get vaccinated you don't deserve care if you get sick. Just like smoking and getting lung cancer, there is no excuse here and we, as Doctors, owe you nothing for stupidity."
2021-08-08 20:09:41,"I really don't think of myself as a senior, but other people do. What with breakthroughs, new variants, an aging vaccination (and the probability of booster shots being in short supply), I'm again masking up, distancing out, eating outside (eventually only take-outs, more eventually eating my own cooking). COVID-19 and its scion are smarter than we are, and they've got non-vaxed people and superspreader events aiding and abetting them. That's who we are. USA? USA? Sigh."
2021-08-08 20:18:53,"To an elderly person confused already about   determining what to do leads to just another level confusion.  And it does not help that doctors and health care workers are also confused about vaccinations, treatments and who and when to test.  This syndrome seems not be confined to the elderly, but their care givers and family.

So what to do. Get your vaccination, where a mask when out and about, but living in a bubble the rest of your remaining life is not very appealing.  And reading in the Times that almost every thing you suffer from may be covid  is maddening.  An old comugen and hypocondriac like me just does not need this to cloud the rest of my life."
2021-08-08 20:11:30,Out of date
2021-08-08 20:23:38,"This article is very frustrating. While the very first sentence starts with . . . ""One day in March of 2020,"" I have to admit that as I read the entire report I forgot about the date that was included and looked for a mention about whether the seniors cited had taken the vaccine or not – so much so that even after a second read I was still perplexed. It wasn't until I got into the Comments section that I figured it out. 

OK, I'll admit that technically it was my mistake – and that of a bunch of others too judging from many of the comments here – but in reading the comments section we see that the author copied/pasted the same answer to so many readers who brought up the same question. Usually our favorite news source is a lot clearer. 

Perhaps acknowledging a mistake or lapse of judgment by Ms Span for leaving out a clearly worded statement that this is not a current story with regard to the increasing cases of CV-19. In fact it's more like a good example of why those who have not been vaccinated should do so ASAP.

With all the news available on this timely subject, I also have to wonder why The Times would publish an article like this as current. While it is an interesting article, perhaps it belongs after a more current one where the date of when the action occurred is indicated before it's beginning."
2021-08-08 20:24:48,"The more I read articles like this, the less I believe Covid jumped from animals to humans.  This is an incredibly complex, almost sophisticated virus with many symptoms and different reactions from different patients.

And it mutates at a rate that doesn't support natural selection.

I don't know if it matters at this point, but I'm coming g to believe this virus was enhanced or manufactured and through a tragic mistake, escaped.  We know the rest.

I have no doubt large nations - China, Russia, the USA all experiment with viruses, bacteria and other communicable diseases.  I don't understand the purpose.  Releasing a virus that kills everyone is hardly a weapon of war.

And some of this research is no doubt put to good end.  It would be nice if we at least had an answer.  None of us has seen anything like this before."

2021-08-08 20:32:22,"My father, age 74, died on April 1, 2021. He had many health issues. He was an 8-year survivor of stage 3B lung cancer, and had COPD, among other issues.

He had willed his body to be donated to UNC hospital for medical research. They would not accept his body, because it was possible that he died of COVID. (That is indeed possible, though not the official reason on his death certificate.) He was fully vaccinated at the time.

The death certificate stated the default reason of cardiac arrest. That may well be true. But it is also possible that he did indeed have COVID, and that was the final straw for his rapidily declining health over the last week of his life, and for his death."
2021-08-08 20:34:07,"Two members of my family who were fully vaccinated caught COVID-19 last week.  

That brings my family number COVID-19 pandemic total to 42 people from age 4 to 93 years old. All of the 65+ year olds have multiple underlying health problems plus they are Black African and brown Indigenous. 

While none have died some have experienced ongoing chronic conditions- heart, lung, kidney and brain fog.  And the symptoms were most severe in the elderly females."

UK opened totally on July 19; while a large portion are fully vaccinated, that leaves plenty who were not, plus all the young. Why no huge surge?
My county in NM has a very large % fully vaccinated, but we are seeing a surge.  FL, TX, LA, etc. I can  understand.
Why are highly vaccinated areas in the US seeing a big surge, 
some others with much lower percents vaccinated, not?

2021-08-08 20:43:01,"If you are familiar with the study of the world's longest living people called ""The Blue Zones Project"" that described social and dietary habits, a similar study of Covid-19 survivors, especially the strongest ones, should be done. It would also contribute to our understanding of health in strong people who not only live long, but live well. What are survivors diets and social habits? How often are they ill? What is their environment like? Are they indoors more or outdoors? We need to research what makes a durable and potent immune system just as we study immunodeficient people. That would be consistent with helping the weaker people. That is the goal of health care."
2021-08-08 20:43:28,"Isn't there a big difference between people who are between 65-75 and much older, such as 86 or 90? Are all seniors 65+ really in the same category?

Do young to middle age people feel like themselves when they get Covid? I wouldn't think so. When I was 48 and had the flu, I was not at all myself and felt like I was going to die while I had fevers."
2021-08-08 20:44:25,"Two weeks ago I had a weeklong virus, the second time this year. Age 69, I had never felt so ill: first unstoppable vomiting, then repeated sweats and chills, high pulse >100, HBP >200/95, no fever, extreme fatigue and body pain, dizzy. Tested covid19 negative each time and fully vaccinated the second episode. Quick ER visits helped w IV and tests eliminated other issues both times. This article points at covid but I'm still puzzled."
2021-08-08 20:45:26,"In mid February 2020, I cut my Thailand trip short because Wuhan was happening and hordes of Chinese tourists were all in Thailand for their long Chinese New Year vacations. I was 75 then and 10 days after arriving home in NYC, I was kneeling on the floor looking in a medicine bag for a thermometer to take my temperature when I lost my balance and fell over. I was face down flat on the floor and could get up for several hours. As it was getting dark I called 911 and the buildings front desk to unlock my door. I was taken Northwell ER where my temperature as 103. Since I had been in Thailand they called the National Institute of Health to see if they should test me for covid. It was denied because at the time only persons who had been to China were tested. I was hospitalized with multiple symptoms and was released after my temperature was normal for 2 days. The hospital said I had the flu. To this day I do not know if I had covid so early on when covid was not on the world's radar."
2021-08-08 20:26:18,"The descriptions in this article of the early symptoms are eerily familiar and uncannily accurate. My wife's 93 year old uncle in Texas (not vaccinated because of stupidity) was admitted to the hospital, doctors diagnosed and treated him for a UT infection (just like the description in this article), exhibited weakness, confusion and appetite loss ( again, just like the article describes), and died from Covid within a week. RIP uncle Bill, despite your slew of obstinate misconceptions."
2021-08-08 20:26:07,"Thank you for this article. My mother (now 86) was very ill at the beginning of February of  2020. Extreme fatigue and what seemed to be bronchitis. She was mostly in bed for 3-4 days which was totally unlike her. I have always wondered if she had COVID - she had been at the gym regularly and also had been at the dentist (in NY Capital region)
She recovered but in late July had a weeks long stay in the hospital for what appeared to be heart failure & was later described as a “fluke.”
She is in good health now but I still wonder if she had COVID. 
I think the article is great in letting people know to consider that COVID may be at work even if symptoms aren’t what one might expect and to take action for testing. Not sure why so much negativity. We’ll be studying and learning about the virus for years to come. Learn what you can & do your best to keep yourself and loved ones safe (& everyone else too)"
2021-08-08 20:26:53,I guess everyone’s brain has turned to mush due to covid pandemic stress. Looks like the NYTs is going to have to spell everything out each fact explicitly in the first paragraph of each story or face a letter’s column like this one.

2021-08-08 21:09:16,"In March 2020, my cousin in NJ, who is a nurse, came down with Covid. She’s in her 40s, has no comorbidities, is slim, healthy etc. She’d been infected by another nurse on her shift who’d been taking Tylenol to mask her fever symptoms. Several other nurses on her night shift had also then become infected with Covid. 

Why I write this: she never experienced any respiratory symptoms! But intense fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting and having to try to crawl on all fours to get to her bathroom. She made provisions so her brother could take care of her kid, so sure was she that she was dying, as her husband had these same symptoms. 

They both made it through. Their teenage son never got it. Covid produces various grave problems, not exclusively respiratory."
2021-08-08 21:12:17,"I guess I'm still young at 69 since it didn't escape me that this study data was collected in March and April 2020 so I didn't have to wonder about vaccination.  Since our hospital is currently overrun, I think I'd just stay home regardless of symptoms unless my oxygen saturation level drops below 95%."
2021-08-08 21:18:57,My big takeaway after reading many comments on the article is that we are in such a time warp as an effect of the pandemic that we cannot distinguish what year either we or Ms Bly were or are actually in.
2021-08-08 21:20:00,"I would be inclined to assume there's a study of older folks that have been vaccinated and experiencing similar symptoms?  If so, when could we expect to see those results?"
2021-08-08 21:20:37,"This persistence of Covid and its various transformations is a 'johnny come lately' scenario and it is bewildering. Science simply does not seem to be able to catch up with it - that is medical science. 

But social science caught up with it some time ago - that is if you comprehend the drift of the chaotic economic system the human race is now plagued with - capitalism. 

It is the capitalist system that seeks to 'expand everywhere, develop everywhere, and knock down all Chinese walls of social insularity' to paraphrase Marx - including remote regions like Papua New Guinea, the 
Congo, Madagascar, the Amazon, in search of resources, cheap labor, plunging into areas with animal pathogens harmful to people. 

Combine this global disaster with, the climate disaster, (technology gone amok with fossil fuels and urban sprawl) and we have a growing social portrait of ""Dorian Grey"".

2021-08-08 21:31:02,"This was my elderly parents’ experience last December: My dad (age 90) fell and hit his head on the wall. He didn’t have a fever or a cough. He was just very, very weak. My mom called 911 and an ambulance took him to the hospital and she never saw him again. They were very surprised he had Covid because his symptoms weren’t what they expected. They have him the best treatments they had at that time, but his lungs were ravaged. We said our goodbyes to him over the phone. We couldn’t get him home to die because the hospice care workers said they wouldn’t work with Covid patients and his oxygen needs were way more than they could provide. While my dad was dying, my mom had terrible gastro-intestinal issues (but no fever) and refused to get tested for Covid. I think she was afraid if she went to the hospital, she’d never make it out alive. She did get vaccinated in March, but now refuses to wear a mask."
2021-08-08 21:42:14,I'm unclear..did the Bily's have their vaccinations or did they choose to ignore the public health professionals advice and then catch C19?

However, it is just a ""nice idea"" as I am just as fatigued with this aspect of the pandemic as others are of wearing masks, social distancing, avoiding indoor social gatherings. 

Also I hope people still in the work force with long COVID --who need Social Security or insurance disability income supports and other support services-- have more clear-cut symptoms and more open-minded physicians who will  properly diagnose them to sign the support services papers."

2021-08-08 14:42:20,"Thank you for this coverage.  I believe fatigue is the primary symptom of Covid in the vaccinated.  Also rear sinus headache.  My teeth also became sensitive, then that migrated.  These symptoms are fading, but it surprises me when I sleep in as I have been waking by 5AM for decades.

We should expect to see more of it, but by the time we get enough data, we will be on to what new variants seem to be doing.  The flu also raging right now is clouding this data.

2021-08-08 16:27:54,Strange article. Like fatigue for a virus is unique? People young or old get different strains and COVID like all cold viruses react differently. I had fatigue cough and no temperature as did many of my other friends of varying ages. You only study old people then assume they're somehow unique?  And knowing you have COVID doesn't help. The media and doctors think this is the only thing that kills us these days so it's better to ask oneself “How would I feel about this if I didn't know I had COVID?”  then you realize you just a regular mild cold like always. I'm sorry but I know a lot of people who had COVID and only two who died and they didn't die of covid but that was listed as the cause of their death because it's the only virus that means anything to healthcare and media.
2021-08-08 22:51:46,BUT had they been vaccinated. YOU NEVER SAY!!!!!
2021-08-08 23:22:25,Get vaccinated!  There is no longer any reason to become seriously ill with COVID-19.
2021-08-08 23:25:54,"Given how expensive medical care can be and all that Medicare doesn't cover, and how stressed our doctors are, I think people can be forgiven for not catching the symptoms of most illnesses at this point.  The last time I saw a doctor for an illness I had to wait 2 days for an appointment.  Given that scenario, if I'd been ill with COVID-19, I could have died before I was ever seen."
2021-08-08 23:41:37,"This is what scares me most: getting vivid of any type is Russian roulette , you don't know if you will have a mild case with full recovery or end up in the ICU on a ventilator or be a long hauler.  As someone who had a severe case of chicken  pox   as a child (in my ears and between my toes) and spent 6 months in bed with mono ( everyone gets mono but most think it is a minor cold), I am afraid of being a vivid long hauler if I get this virus.

Please get vaccinated!! Don't end up being the one who gets vivid and creates another variant. This is really serious."
2021-08-08 23:48:42,"My wife and I were vaccinated 2 times with Moderna. We have both contracted Covid since, likely the Delta variant, so we isolate. Our community has been overrun with more people who have contracted the virus despite vaccinations.  I am sure our mild cases are a result of the vaccine. If you haven't done it yet, please do. Let's not diddle around until it mutates into something deadly for everybody."
2021-08-09 00:08:56,"No vaccine ever fully prevents transmission of any virus. But it decreases serious illness and death to statistical zero. The issue is, that with Covid we test for asymptomatic disease. We don't do this for other diseases. I'm sure that people get asymptomatic measles. But no one tests for it. Why? Because it isn't clinically significant. And neither is asymptomatic Covid. Before the vaccine there was a correlation between increasing positive tests, even in asymptomatic people, and increasing hospitalization and death. Since the vaccine, that relationship has been severed because half the population is vaccinated. So testing asymptomatic people is idiotic at this point. But, it isn't if we want perpetual lockdowns."
2021-08-09 00:12:58,"One thing I did not notice within this article that I am concerned about is vaccination status. My grandmother had both Pfizer shots long ago and still has the same symptoms as the older americans in the article. One of which died, the other lived. Which had been vaccinated? Another issue I have is not with the article itself but with the listing of symptoms themselves. It seems new symptoms are constantly popping up, so why is it that health organizations are shying away from CT scans, and the like, that could give valuable data to data scientists who then could point to more possible disparate symptoms? Another issue I have is that, as another commenter pointed out, we might just be finding out about these symptoms. Which could be too late for some people. I might not have the money to pay NYTimes monthly but i sure need this information, especially when there is so much and a lot can be inaccurate. It hardly feels like this is being taken seriously, capitalism continues.. Only those lucky enough or well-off enough will see these articles. Only those with access to health organizations willing and able to be tested will be tested. The women who had been diagnosed with a UTI and given an antibiotic, who actually needed a covid test 5 days later is an example. My grandma had fallen a while back and has been refused a brain scan. This was after she was scanned for brain bruising a month after an incident. Now I nor her docs know how covid might affect this without a scan."
2021-08-09 00:30:44,"COVID is so over … some seem to think. Traveling in Pennsylvania. Very few masks.

Was wondering why I got the evil eye stare at the smallish town Walmart. Ah, out-of-state plates — and a mask on in the parking lot already.

Looking at just the mask compliance — among obese folks, older, people smoking and vaping, etc — we are going to be in a world of hurt. Again.

May just be COVID waves from now on."
2021-08-09 00:44:33,"Since the nature of the SARS-CoVid-2 origin and the mode of its breakout is sketchy and scientifically not established even after a period of 21months as of today, the behaviour pattern of its mutants from alpha to lambda also became enigmatic and make the different types of vaccine invented rather a barrier of  probability than a barrier of infection.This makes us to continue  don our mask even after fully vaccinated."
2021-08-09 00:52:00,Thank you for reminding us the elderly are most vulnerable still. With all the scare reporting on kids over the last two weeks (which is way way overblown if you look at the NYT data!!) we may easily forget that. The number one priority by far is STILL to get the unvaccinated elderly and health vulnerable to get their shots.
2021-08-09 01:01:01,"There are hundreds of conditions that can lead to lethargy, loss of appetite, diarrhea and fatigue.  They include lactose intolerance, celiac disease, drug allergies, ulcerative colitis, Chrohn's disease, pancreatic cancer, E.Coli, walking pnuemonia and many more.  Having those conditions and testing positive for Covid-19 does not necessarily imply the conditions are a result of Covid-19.  Jumping to the conclusion that just because a person is tested positive for the virus that the virus is the source of the problem is not only short-sighted, it can be medically dangerous."
2021-08-09 01:24:59,"My first question upon reading this article is whether the Bilys had been vaccinated. Upon rereading I didn't see the answer, which surprised me since that seems an important variable to consider. Looking through the comments, I found that neither the Bilys nor--presumably--Mr Lamanno, nor--perhaps--anyone else in the article or the study it cites had been vaccinated. The author explained that these cases all occurred in 2020, over a year ago, before vaccines were available. That point should have been made clear at the outset, in my opinion."
2021-08-09 01:30:56,"This is great news for the public but any well trained modern FP, Internist and especially gerontologist learns the first rule of the elderly is that every older person presents differently at all times than those younger, except when they don't. I'm retired and I recall that admonition and many papers published during my career pointing that out. Which is to say that loss of appetite is frequently the only sign of everything in us and if a doc is not more sensitive to unusual behavior and does not have a much wider differential diagnosis in the elderly then one is going to be frequently be wrong, one is then an inadequate doc and the patient often has a worse outcome than (s)he should. The most important news is just the list, not that it occurs."
2021-08-09 01:50:01,"I found the article interesting but surprised people took chances in March because I was aware of it in January and wearing a mask then.

I worry about the care workers who refuse to get vaxxed and because of shortage of workers they stay on because the agencies have no choice.  Therefore, the variant gets into the nursing homes due to the anti vaxxers."
2021-08-09 01:50:37,"I haven't read all these comments yet.  But many/most of the symptoms could be due to any number of common viruses (some of which, right now, are making unusual comebacks.) Or the flu, which also seems to be increasing in some areas right now (strange time for flu to be increasing.)

In trying to gauge the seriousness of what's happening to you, I find that tracking weight, blood pressure and resting heart rate works quite well. The body is responding to lots of viruses we probably never even know about, but when you see HR going up 10 beats per minute or BP going up 10-15 points, especially if weight drops more than a couple lbs overnight and stays depressed, something's up.

These are useful things to monitor because BP and HR can increase quite a bit without your really being aware, unless you monitor them.  They're a window into how your body is talking to itself as it deals with different stresses. 

I monitor these mainly to gauge fatigue levels after exercise days, but they also demonstrate how your immune system is reacting to other stresses like illness. I'm not sure I'd get all that excited about anything unless I saw my system doing all three of these things. 

If you exercise (even a 5-minute walk) you can also look at how HR and BP recover back to normal.  And you can use a pulse oximeter to measure oxygen levels to ID a real problem with oxygen levels (i.e. COVID.)  Exercise performance itself is a great tool for health monitoring."
2021-08-09 01:57:59,"Let’s get the old people vaccinated a third time.  There’s plenty of vaxx going to waste, as people are simply ignorant or needle shy. 

The old people died in nursing homes largely because their caretakers were sloppy, had no PPE, or were just superspreaders. 

Let’s not repeat the fiasco of 2020. With 2020 hindsight we can avoid a repeat performance in 2021. 

Send all J&J Vaccines overseas, as well as the Astro Zenice which are disappointing."
2021-08-09 02:00:05,"@ Diane in New Jersey

First of all, my condolences for the passing of your father. You and your family were hit very hard, in caring for two loved ones. 

If I understand correctly, your Dad passed shortly after returning home from the hospital. I can relate:  my uncle died years ago, shortly after contracting a “super-germ” in the hospital. Ironically, the proactive stance of the hospital and its employees came too late—after he became infected with C-Diff.  

If hospitals would take an earlier, vigilant stance in educating all visitors—from the start— in how to take simple precautions, there would be significantly less deaths and hospital-borne illnesses."

Members in my family over 65 had other symptoms; it would be interesting to note them as well. They were toothaches, toe pain, hiccups, l severe sore throat, extreme clumsiness, ringing in ears, extreme dizziness when bending down, etc. Also, most of them have “long Covid” now."

Also an onset of severe knee pain that was sudden and lasted for months. (Before this article, I had never heard of joint pain being a symptom of this virus). No fever but some breathlessness. 

I didn’t test because at that time tests were hard to find. 

In July, I tested for both COVID and antibodies. Both negative. But now after reading this, I wonder if those early antibody tests could have been false negative."

2021-08-09 09:37:15,"Nothing like fanning the Covid-Mania flames suggesting any ache or pain might be Covid thus justifying a rush for testing or making demands for medical.

In spite of  clearly stated dates, characteristics and symptoms of the patients, some comments still question the  reliability or relevance of the report.  How much more difficult thus to dispel persistent vaccine objections, as no solution can be one-size -fit -all forever."
2021-08-09 13:02:26,"We will see this ripple through the population for years. There were well documented neurological sequelae from the 1918 flu pandemic, including a spike in psychosis discussed by Karl Menninger in his book “Psychoses Associate with Influenza”. 
I had a case of something in February, unknown source, with very “non COVID” symptoms including muscle/joint pain, gastro system basically ceased functioning for a week, headache for a week, insomnia; no fever coughing or pulmonary symptoms. Suddenly I had sciatic pain, which I’ve never had. I hadn’t thought it was COVID at the time due to absence of the “classic” pulmo symptoms. I’ve since tested seropositive but I’ve had the vaccine too. 
Six months later, neuro pain aka sciatic pain and ongoing joint pain persist. My son is a med student so I was monitored. 
Separately, comorbidities are not openly discussed in our national discourse on COVID but are very contributory to deaths. Obesity contributes to all the above and in the US is largely ignored in COVID discussions. Dementia is noted in UK as being the largest killer during the COVID crisis. 
A good source is Pub. Health England, url below. I am aware of misquotation of their data so here is the direct link. The largest comorbidity risk lies with cardio/hypertensive, 44 and 20% respectively then Dementia at 26% and Diabetes.

While we simply can't blame the deniers for all of the ills befalling us, we can blame them for this particular Covid-19 surge, their lack of motivation to become vaccinated and their sheer stupidity.  

Rather than dwell on the madness of not wanting to save yourself from the virus and possible death, I want to find a way to reach these people and chart a path through this despicable and intensely sad episode in our history.

To become complacent, is to face an uncertain future of multitudinous surges, disastrous personal interactions and a loss of hope.  

We face the very real possibility of having two separate Americas-one for vaccinated people, and one for anti-vaxxers, and this is totally unacceptable."

They may want their right to make me sick. I don't.

As for the idealogy of this all, maybe a large part of it is resentment of the uncouth against the educated.

He states that immunization improves chances against one of the four mutations: Alpha,  Beta, Gamma, and Delta.  He uses the term ""nullify"".

The question that the infectious disease community should answer is if the Covid-19 test picks up the four mutant variations.  Is it possible that seniors in each age group could have both Covid-19 and one of the four mutant variations with different symptoms?"

You can't mount a fever without an intact immune system, you won't make as much phlegm initially in response to an upper respiratory tract infection, you could have pneumonia without purulent sputum. A mild urinary tract infection can throw them badly off-kilter. They just don't have the reserve capacity of their organ systems like younger folks, their equilibrium is so delicate. 
Any doctor who doesn't know this shouldn't have a license to practice medicine. But we should also do a better job informing family members of geriatric patients. 
As far as Mr. Bily, condolences to the family. Two hip surgeries at the age of 90 always indicates a poor prognosis, but we weren't told about why he's in hospice care. Also the son-in-law was mentioned by name, but not the daughter. I found that rather strange."

We've added a phrase to further clarify that they were not, since no vaccine was approved or available in the spring of 2020. 

Even now that most older adults are vaccinated, however, the few who experience breakthrough infections may have atypical symptoms, like functional decline or altered mental states, rather than the classic fever/cough/trouble breathing.

Let's face it:  Even without the wildfires a significant percentage of us are to greater or lesser extent breathing in with each breathe many days an invisible cloud of very small particulates of plastics, metals, hazardous chemicals, etc.  The US is favoring industry over the health of its own citizens.

It's hard to imagine that wildfire smoke that contains particulates from the incineration of houses, cars, etc. isn't itself highly hazardous to breathe.  And not only is it in the air, but it must also be contaminating the water supply."

It has become so horrifying to even see the hazy days here in Rhode Island, the air quality warning from all the way across the country. My 10 year old asked me quietly if the fires in California where why she hasn't seen a clear sky, and I couldn't lie.  She doesn't want to go outside. Says the light is weird. It is. I can't lie. I don't know how honest to be, what a child can handle. My childhood terrors of nuclear war (I'm a Cold War kid Gen Xer.

It seems California used to be blamed, but now that fires are all over the West, along with drought, even in parts of the Midwest, people appear to be waking up to the problems of drought, fire and smoke.  Before the season begins, we make sure to stock up on air purifiers for our house, and change the filters of the one used last year.   Air-conditioners don't always filter out smoke, so, for your health, consult with someone who can install a Hepa filter that will filter out particles dangerous for your health.

2021-08-13 21:37:08,"Gavin Newsom and our CA state legislature need to mandate (and fund) smaller class sizes* in public schools and/or mandate well-fitted N95 masks at schools as we continue to deal with the trifecta of Covid-19’s dangerous Delta; huge, active wildfires and prolonged fire seasons; and too-low full vaccination rates, especially among younger people and children.

Currently, public high school classrooms mean around 37 persons gathered, for 1-3 hours at a time, in fairly compact classrooms that may have only a modest open window for ventilation when there is no wildfire smoke, but no safely-opened windows once AQI hits the orange range.

Elementary school children and many middle schoolers don’t even have the option to be vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2, and yet are being packed into classrooms with up to 32-35 students plus 1-3 adults.  And the smaller the lungs and the less developed the brain and other organs, the sooner and worse the impact of wildfire smoke.

Schools received and may yet receive CoVID-19 relief funding, often in the millions of dollars.  Some of that money needs to go to renting more or larger classroom space and, if need be, a handful of more teachers so that everyone is safer.  Our children’s, teachers’ and families’ lives — and our state’s economic  future — are worth at least that!  


* Smaller class sizes provide myriad other benefits to children as well, not to mention making teaching more enjoyable and, so, good teachers easier to recruit and retain."
2021-08-13 22:25:33,"It doesn’t make sense that smoke would increase infection, but not severity of disease. Instead, it seems more likely that people 1) switch time outside to time inside, increasing exposure and 2) escape to less smoky areas, bringing the virus with them and 3) stay at hotels, friend’s houses, or red cross shelters, eating out. The researchers should account for cell phone mobility data to reach their conclusions."
2021-08-13 22:27:19,"Where is the skepticism and digging? Common sense should question the idea that PM2.5 from wildfires would increase infection rates. And if it were true, then why wouldn’t smoking (which is loaded with PM2.5) have the same effect? Journalism should consist of more than parroting or summarizing the work of others. There is literally one source for this article."
2021-08-14 01:38:49,"As a transplant who has lived in PDX since 1999, I was incredulous late last summer when smoke particulate enveloped our area. We had never experienced anything like it. It was like walking through a campfire, 24/7. That said, as I have no respiratory issues and I imagined my lung health could withstand the fairly brief exposure, I did not take exceptional precaution aside from limiting my time outside. I don't recall if data were available that reported the parts of PM per cubic meter, as this article provides. Had there been, I would have likely made more significant note of the conditions and purchased a respirator. I find the numbers far more compelling than an advisory that the outdoor air is ""hazardous"". Thanks to the reporter for sharing this valuable info for those of us likely to experience such conditions again."
2021-08-14 02:32:25,"I lived in western Oregon during the awful wildfire smoke events that started in the summer of 2017 and returned with a vengeance in the summer of 2018. I relocated to the East Coast and thereby fortunately avoided the wildfire smoke events in 2019 and 2020.

I cannot recall any kind of climate event in my life that was as nasty as the ""hazardous"" air quality events that sometimes lasted weeks at a time. The sky was yellow, the sun blotted out, the entire world tinged by yellow and the fecund smell of burning everywhere. 

The only place to go was inside to get away from it. Where in a normal summer people would be out doing things, camping, swimming, outdoor things in outdoor places where it is more difficult for Covid to spread.

When the smoke is bad, people universally go inside, where the virus is more easily transmitted. I posit that the increase in covid cases is more likely to come from wildfire smoke causing people to go indoors than it is the from the particulate pollution. There is no control for this cited by the authors. This is a pretty flimsy article from a scientific standpoint.

I'll note also that the firefighters themselves are brought together in large numbers from many places to work alongside each other. They are outside fighting the fires but at night they sleep in tents together, eat in mess halls together and generally congregate in large groups inside when not outside fighting the fires.There is also nothing in this article about that being a factor."
2021-08-14 06:04:27,"Studies generally reveal correlations, not causation. Nobody knows how many COVID deaths were caused by wildfire smoke. And all this study tells us is that more folks died when there was smoke outside than when there was no smoke outside. It ignores the fact that most COVID deaths happen to people who are inside. And the supposed smoke deaths were a tiny fraction of total deaths. I don’t care about Harvard. There ain’t no causation here and even the correlation is dubious."

All in all Trump is responsible for the deaths of 630,000 Americans including my wife of 34 years with that number expected to soon hit 700,000 equaling the catastrophic loss of life in our Civil War. Yet he sits down in Florida getting fat from the good life while his cult followers like the pillow man say he will be reinstated as president whatever that means, his crazed base voters refuse to take the vaccination out of some warped liberty belief fed to them by non scientist charlatans and his cult following governors in Florida and Texas claim they are the new Trumps while doing everything in their power to kill everyone in their respective states with Covid.

The planet is dying before our very eyes, resources are being depleted, oceans are filthy, ice caps are melting at a very fast rate and the amazon is being cut down - this alone will eventually hasten our demise. And no one cares. 

America is a very self-serving country, one where we only think about what is good for the individual and not the whole. We have reached and gone over the tipping point with climate and I am afraid there really is no turning back the clock. 

I'm a very young 60 years old and I hope I have another 25-35 years left in me. Who knows. I doubt if anything will ever change. President Biden notwithstanding, I don't see our government doing anything to proactively stop it or at least slow it down. 

No one wants to invest in the basic essentials i.e. electric vehicles, clean energy, etc., because they don't want to spend the money. As with everything else in America, we see a problem, ignore it until a catastrophe happens then throw money at it, more money than what we needed to find the problem if we did so initially.

2021-08-12 21:13:01,"Miriam ""Florence NIghtengale"" Jordan is more a social worker than a journalist, and she has her facts flat wrong about testing, positivity rates and quarantining policy along the border. Writes Jordan: ""Catholic Charities since last year had been testing migrant families for the virus immediately upon their release by Border Patrol and isolating those who test positive at its downtown shelter. In February, amid an uptick in arrivals, it began sending those families to motels."" Other sources, including well-regarded Texas state border monitors say that the positivity rate is far higher among migrants than locals, that Catholic Charities is often not testing migrants and that many towns and cities along the border are simply putting untested migrants on busses for bigger cities like Dallas & Houston, with little ability to conduct contact tracing or vaccination persuasion campaigns. What is happening now is that the federal government and NGO's don't like the measurements they are getting from the ""yardsticks"" they are using so they just throw out the sticks."

What percentage of the private charity’s funds comes from the government?  Many religious and secular charities depend largely on the government for funding.  Plus, any donations the charities receive from private individuals are deducted from the latter’s taxes.  So it might have been more honest to say that some of the migrants are being quarantined in hotel rooms at taxpayer expense.

And, this is probably the least expensive of what each one of these migrants could end up costing over their lifetimes, if allowed to remain here.  Most of them have little education so they will not be able to fill jobs which pay much more than payroll taxes, but they will need taxpayers to provide them with housing, transportation, medical care, and possibly social services.  

The children of less-educated parents generally need more school resources, leaving less for all other children.

These people will be a financial burden.

Most of do not meet the criteria for asylum as set by the U.N. Convention on Refugees.  They are economic migrants.  We need to spend our money on our own needy citizens, not economic migrants from around the world."
2021-08-12 21:34:29,"After WWII, many countries met to decide who constitutes a refugee and what each country’s obligation towards refugees should be.  They determined that a refugee was someone who was fleeing persecution based on his or her race, religion, nationality, politics, or membership in a particular social group.  The United States Congress voted to offer asylum to anyone who met the definition.

When Obama became president, he decided to expand the definition of refugee to include anyone who was fleeing domestic or gang violence.  He did not ask Congress to agree to this expansion.  It is doubtful that it would have as the expanded definition has the potential of covering hundreds of millions of people from around the world.

Trump was stopped from returning to the original definition of “refugee” by a district judge.  And now, Biden is welcoming everyone who claims to be fleeing an abusive partner or gang.  

Everyone who is offered asylum is eligible for all kinds of government benefits, including medical care.  (Some states also provide benefits to those who have applied for asylum but have not yet been approved for it.)  Biden has invited the world in, and many are accepting his offer.

Scapegoating ""immigrants"" is such a tried and true and cynical ploy that politicians like Governor Abbott and De Santis do as a reflex.

If anyone is interested, you can volunteer or send money to Team Brownsville, Al Otro Lado, Seguimos Adelante or Asylum Seeker Sponsorship Project. Currently I volunteer for Asylum Seeker Sponsorship Project by finding sponsors across the United States to host asylum seekers as they navigate the asylum process to one day be able to work and enjoy the ""freedoms"" we say we represent.

Earlier this year, Biden tried to duck responsibility
by facilely chalking up already high numbers even in winter
to some kind of mythical pent-up demand built up
as a result of strong control measures --sensible measures --
put in place by Trump.
Instead of trying to control the border,
Biden has spend six months dismantling any semblance of control at all,
and has put out the welcome mate in myriad ways.
The world has nearly 8 billion people,
half of them living in dire poverty or other dire situations.
Hundreds of millions want to come here,
and will come here,
if Biden continues his de facto open borders actions.
We have no obligations whatsoever to take them.
For decades, every year,
we already have been granting one million green cards
plus hundreds of thousands supposedly temporary visas
that somehow end up getting renewed endlessly
and become de facto permanent.
That is more than plenty.
We do not need more,
certainly not in the numbers coming this year.
What the USA needs is strong border control.
Other advanced countries have much stronger control.
No reason whatsoever that the USA cannot likewise have strong control.
Biden owns this crisis,
lock, stock and barrel.
Now, it will take very strong measures to slow the flow.
Biden will likely not take more than a few paltry measures.
Biden and the Dems will suffer for this big time in 2022."
2021-08-12 23:42:54,"In 2018, Trump and Republicans, like many of the commenters here, tried to make immigration and the Southern border the biggest issue for the midterms. There was daily Fox News coverage of the “migrant caravan” headed to the border to “invade” the United States (remember that?). What happened? The Democrats crushed Republicans in the mid-terms, picking up over 40 seats in the House.

So bring it on commenters. Most of this country is sympathetic to immigration and immigrants as almost all of us came from immigrants (I certainly did). And those immigrants (Italians, Hungarians, Irish etc.) were all derided as dirty and lower life forms in the manner in which you refer to them now. And look at the USA, the land of freedom and opportunity. This is how our economy is boosted and strengthened as economies without immigrants age and wither (Japan, Germany, etc.) as their population ages."

Right wing media has time and again won the false argument that it is the Democrats who are to blame for our border problems. It is not and has not been the Dems who have stymied comprehensive immigration reform, it is the Republicans.
 If you read through S744, you will find that nearly everything the Republican electorate wants, is in that bill. That includes nearly $30 billion in border security funds and guarantees that the border would be secured before any other parts of the bill would be implemented.

So, U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo is Fox News with the press conference discussing what the Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas (who is over his head / incompetent) should be taking the lead on.  US VP Kamala Harris does not have the ability or interest in working across the aisle especially to try to heal the divide.  This is absolute arrogance - US VP Kamala Harris is not up to the task/ role.

This is an utter, reckless, arrogant failure of the Biden administration and the Republicans will be propelled in the 2022 and 2024.  It is time for US President Biden to replace his chief of staff and  Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas."

It also doesn't help that most of their ""news"" comes from folks like Tucker Carlson.  For all the folks like this, the only way to go are mandates.  Nothing else will work.  In my area most places now do vaccines  on a walk in basis.  They're free.  Sorry but I feel that if you are 12 and over, are not in some way medically unable to be vaccinated, and you choose not to do so anyway, then all medical costs incurred should you contract the virus should be your responsibility.  At this point it's  nothing short of a national disgrace that our vaccination rate is as low as it is."

But I wonder if it's too late for all the people who have decided the Delta variant is too contagious to hold out getting vaccinated any longer.

It takes about a month to go through the 2 shot regimen, and another 2 weeks after the second shot before the antibodies are built up sufficient in your system to give one full protection.  By that time, if the British experience is any guide, the Delta variant will have ravaged the population and moved on.

People who are scared into getting vaccinated now will essentially go through the Delta surge with little additional protection."

And this is whether from the MAGA you can't make me side or from the crunchy granola holistic intuition healing side.

As has been explained by everyone from Manager Gabe Kapler to countless analysts, their success has been largely due to everyone, from players and coaches to trainers and other staff, “buying in, all in,”to their system. If a single member doesn’t hustle, recognize, respect and play his or her role, contribute 100%, everything would fall apart—which is what we are witnessing and enduring, going on two years, in our country as a whole. Thomas Jefferson characterized the founding of our nation by writing that “we hold these truths to be self-evident”. Our problem is that we no longer hold any truths, self-evident or otherwise. As Dan Rather recently said, imagine if, during World War II, all it took to defeat Hitler and the Nazis was wearing a mask and getting getting a shot. Sadly, our less-than-greatest generation wouldn’t have a clue where to begin."

We've been far too polite with those people.  If they shot someone, their lives would be ruined.  They'd bleed all their savings away on a futile legal defense, would lose their jobs, families, and would be spending significant time in prison.

Yet we see people collectively murdering 620K Americans, and can't muster the courage to confront them about it.  I think we can confront it:

- COVID should no longer be an insurance-covered illness for those unvaccinated without a valid, high-bar-to-clear medical condition.

- Required vaccination in schools and for all public sector employees. You don't get to take public money while killing the public.  You just don't.

- COVID passports for access to any public space or good

- Target government assistance and investment away from rural communities that took sides with the virus last year. 

- Remove tort protection for all businesses and individuals that don't require vaccination and appropriate masking/distance. Even though proving who infected you could be difficult, proving civil liability requires a far lower standard of proof. It could result in some fairly sporting litigation cases against businesses that deserve the trouble."

We’re exhausted and scared and worn out and we want to focus on the people who want to be part of the solution.”

Fury is an understandable response.  Channeling that fury appropriately is important.   I draw people closer who demonstrate empathy for others and draw boundaries to protect myself and our society from people who don’t.

Religious fanatics and some well-educated folks have found an outlet for their fear and frustration over the loss of the other guy, and their anger and fear at an ever-changing Salt Lake City and world.

Why not get the shot there--at the WM pharmacy?
  As far as ""time off due to bad reactions?"" How many get sick from the vaccine? what %? I'm sure most employers would understand a day off due to a bad reaction (maybe 3% of those vaccinated?) from the shot--as it makes their workplace safer.  Also--many working-class employers are now demanding their staff to be vaccinated (Tyson foods, etc.).

We still have all the work we had before PLUS C19 patients.  We are nearly 17 months in and October is the soonest things will improve.  Anyone who thinks we all just need to chill needs to volunteer to change bedpans in the C19 ward or call patients back with COVID questions in the outpatient clinic on top of the massive amounts of work we already have to do.

Exactly. As well, I am far less mad at the individuals who refuse the vaccines than I am at the media landscape that floods them with lies and propaganda.

They don't want to pay for a decent education and wonder why they can't get good jobs. It never occurs to them that the loss of one days pay is better than the loss of months pay or death.  I can't change their minds, so why should I pay for their stubbornness?  They want to  be taken care of when something goes wrong, but won't do anything to make sure it doesn't go wrong."

The pandemic is crashing against the wider ecological crisis, which seems to be surging. It is imperative to resolve it before even greater and more urgent problems swamp oiur capacity to respond. Now is when we need the ""this is one world"" perspective."

So yeah, I’m medium annoyed by the Republican pols who’ve blocked Medicaid, attacked CHIP, tore at health clinics for poor and isolated folks, slapped idiot work requirements on benefits.

Especially the ones like DeSantis, who then cheerfully piled lies and disinformation and refusals on top, which blew case rates through the roof in Florida and Louisiania and Missouri and big chunks of Texas—and who did it for political gain. 

And I’m afraid I even have some ire left over for folks who just shake their heads, repeat this or that idiot tag line, and say no to vaccines and masks. Because they’re grown people who ought to know better, and refuse to."

Access is not a problem for anyone who goes to a grocery store or a pharmacy or an ER or, at least in my town, the local bar, which, God bless them, offered a shot with a beer. You don't need the internet. You don't need health insurance. You don't need a phone. You just walk into the Walmart and ask for the shot.

As for what to do with our anger, I suggest sane Americans channel it into running for the school board. Ignore the manufactured  controversies over sex education and Critical Race Theory and start insisting that elementary students learn about the history of science. Dump No Child Left Behind and the time consuming, unproductive testing it requires. Figure out a way to integrate math and science into all parts of the curriculum, including English literature. You can find plenty of examples in the latter in which communicable disease, from TB to cholera, plays a major role in a story.

It’s the anger, sense of unreality,  and frustration that many of us feel realizing that we never really knew some of our friends or family members and that they were capable of this level of irrationality and selfishness.

And, I will continue to direct my rage at their followers who willingly serve as petri dishes for a rapidly mutating virus for the joy of “owning the libs.” Also, I will continue to direct my rage at so called conservatives who are only concerned about CoVid at the border.

2021-08-07 16:48:44,"Some decline the vaccine because they're young and they believe the risk from covid isn't much more than the risk from the vaccine. (In a situation where there is a low prevalence of the virus, this is not incorrect--the risk from covid and from the virus would both be low--but when prevalence increases, the risk to the virus outstrips the risk from the vaccine.) But what they don't understand, and what the public doesn't understand, is that vaccines work better when most of the population is vaccinated.

Then a five hundred million dollar yacht pulls up alongside and starts chucking stuff at you: massive medical bills, crushing student loans, banks fees, poisoned food and water, opioids, militarized police, for-profit prisons, loads of divisive partisan propaganda . . .

You object, beg them to stop, and ask if they might have a cup of water to spare. Whereupon they throw a marble sink at you, call you a Socialist Leech, and ask how you expect them to pay for it all.

Access to the vaccine is readily available. Some have had friends and family members fall ill with the virus and end up hospitalized.  Some have had the virus themselves.  The reasons for not getting vaccinated are: they putting their trust in God or they don't trust the government or the vaccine is experimental or they have natural immunity or [insert any other excuse here].  I have run out of patience for these people.  They aren't economically disadvantaged; they are willfully ignorant and putting our collective wellbeing at risk.  The only way these people will get vaccinated if they lose access to things that they need or want -- airline travel, jobs, etc. Yes, I am angry and tired of excuses!"
2021-08-07 16:34:14,"As of September 30th any of my family member who have not shown me definitive real proof that they are vaccinated will be summarily written out of my will and trust.  Plain and simple.  Furthermore they will not be welcome into any of my homes or businesses.  

There is no point in keeping people who are a danger to society in line to inherit millions of dollars.  It doesn't make statistical sense to bother with them now or in the future because they will have a 95% chance of dying from the Delta variant or one of the next ten new variants coming along.

Florida now has a school aged Covid hospitalization emergency at pediatric hospitals.  Go ask the fake ex president Trimp to pay for their visit to the hospital.  ""Oh, it's just like the flu...""

Republican deniers have spouted illogic as if they have M.D. degrees saying that young people won't get it and now not only have they caused the death of their own elder family members they are losing people, republican voters had they lived, in their thirties through their late forties.

2021-08-07 16:34:23,"Ugh- trying to parse out who is being willfully ignorant and who lacks access is a struggle.  Anybody, and I mean anybody, can walk into a pharmacy right now and get vaccinated for free, whatever your socio-economic status, race, rural or urban, etc.    This is why I struggle to put my good liberal, empathetic hat on over this.  The people throwing up the excuse of access are not really any more sound in their thinking than people who swear  covid is the flu  (lack of sick leave being perhaps the only legit excuse, but how many work 7 days a week?)  And the left wing paranoid anti-pharma folks are just as culpable and just as ignorant as the folks on the right ranting about microchips.

But those real reasons, from worry about cost of lost wages, to worry about side effects, to worry that the vaccine is too new, and may be worse than the virus, still carry the fundamental calculus that a person's individual worry or opinion outweighs the total benefit to the community. 

So while I can understand, and even sympathize, I can't agree with the decision. 

And while I can't desire our healthcare workers to turn away the unvaccinated - that is just evil - I do feel that asking the community to pay for your hospitalization, either through rate increases or tax increases to cover the hospitals costs, because you were unwilling to pay for your own protection by taking the risk of vaccinating, is ultimately just selfish and stupid.

Let's reinstate mandatory 14-day quarantines for those unvaccinated entering states with high rates of vaccination. Let's urge President Biden to invoke the Interstate Commerce Act requiring all those engaged in interstate travel bu air, bus, or train to be vaccinated. It's time to channel the pent up negative energy into positive change. we had the same resistance to set belts and motorcycle helmets and mandatory, enforceable laws prevailed."
2021-08-07 16:57:46,"""Stereotypes on social media""   The social media is the message.

Could you imagine those vulnerable to polio refusing the Salk vaccine on Constitutional grounds?   ""It's about freedom,"" e.g.

Reagan, Norquist, Paul, Thiel, etc. wanted a libertarian society.   Social media has come to America like a deus ex machina giving them such.

Not only do we have misinformation, social media has turned individuals into active producers rather than consumers of information.  This reflex has rendered a good percentage of the populace into a permanent state of activism, pitting them in a fight against the ""system.""  It's a pastime of personal grievance in the age of post-industrialism.

The virus doesn't care about politics.  The virus has evolved to seek hosts, the only way it can live as an obligate parasite.   The virus doesn't care if it kills.  An asymptomatic host is almost as good as a victim, because a vector of transmission allows virus to live another day.

And science shows the unvaccinated make much more efficient hosts for virus reproduction.

Ignorance, benightedness, and recalcitrance to experts are the order of the day.   I ask these people what a virus is?  What's an antibody?  Of course, nobody knows.

Nonetheless, they flail about, declaiming, ""No one is going to tell me what to do.""   Not only are they willing to sacrifice themselves, and put neighbors at risk, they cannot see the long-term damage to the economy.

The truth cannot permeate the miasma of social media."

I believe my rage, however, would not be so great if some of my own family members were not among the foolish, selfish unvaxxed—family who happens to be caring for my frail, 86-year-old, immunocompromised mother. Their refusal to mask up put her in the hospital twice for Covid last December and January, but they continue to prefer ignorance and political statements to guarding her health. I am praying the FDA approves a booster shot for people like my mom ASAP. In the meantime, I'll try—try—to minimize my fury, and not direct it indiscriminately at every unvaccinated adult in the country."

2021-08-07 17:04:42,"People who refuse to get the vaccine have one thing in common. Regardless of class, race or political affiliation they all believe in their “right” to exercise personal freedom over societal survival.  In my state, Minnesota, we have the lowest vaccination rate of any professional football team.  Our Vikings quarterback, Kirk Cousins, refused to be vaccinated, allowing for the possibility of the team forfeiting games.  That just affects games, but is an example the affect on the continued existence of an orderly society when a sizable percentage of its members refuse, for a variety of selfish reasons, to act in the best interest of the whole.  Americans refuse to grow up and accept the responsibility that goes with their sense of unlimited freedom."

Then, a day after our kids positive test result, and his initial negative result, my husband began to feel unwell with what's become a doozy of a breakthrough case. He's isolated in the back of the house now-- an absurd quarantine within our family's quarantine.
Somehow, I'm still feeling fine and testing negative, which is a mercy because someone has to take care of things around here. Thank you, vaccination, for keeping me safe and probably keeping my husband from an even worse experience than the one he's having.
Once he's out of the woods--oh please, please-- (thankfully, our kid seems fine now) and my fear and sadness has been supplanted by the anger that's sure to come, I'll do my best to follow the grace and wisdom this author provides.

Unfortunately, I’m not at that point yet. So much loss of all kinds, so much suffering and sacrifice, and no regard for our healthcare and front line essential workers who were pushed to the brink and will be pushed again thanks to the unvaccinated.

Refusing a FREE and effective vaccine if you are able to take it, when many people in the world would do anything to have it is the height of gall and entitlement. Spreading lies and misinformation that can kill people and keep the virus active and mutating is criminal. And on top of that, refusing to do what is needed to protect yourself and others from COVID displays utter contempt for the people who have already died from this pandemic (<4M worldwide, <600K U.S.) and renders their deaths in vain. 

Anger feels appropriate and justified right now. I hope one day to feel differently."

It's hard to watch the disease spread yet again.  But we should be helping people get shots - give them rides to shots, help arrange child care for unvaccinated women, reassure people that the vaccine doesn't cost anything and isn't (very) dangerous.  This would be a lot more helpful and useful than blaming them for COVID's longevity."

Follow with a nomination for a Nobel in Medicine, shared, of course, with the vaccine developers.  Commend him for getting his vaccination, even after defeating the disease a few months earlier.  Make him the role model for the hesitant.  If this is not enough, try a nomination for a Nobel in Literature.  Bobby Dylan broke fresh ground with his Nobel, deservedly so, for his poetic lyrics. Trump's body of tweets on the Big Lie is a model of prize-winning fiction.

But to be successful, say nothing of his contribution to the 600,000 deaths to covid for his initial denials and inept defense.   His attacks on Fauci -- bury them.  Let the vaccine be called ""Trump tonic."" Give free travel and tickets to Trump rallies to early responders.  The unvaccinated need not go, if they are still around."

2021-08-07 17:11:56,"I am neither an envious or jealous person; by the same token, I am not affected one way or the other by the folly of others -- unless their folly directly interferes with or otherwise impacts my own existence.

Thus, I have looked on with near complete detachment as this COVID contagion has engulfed our nation.  I've had to wear a mask, socially distance and get vaccinated.   No problem.

As the Greek philosopher Epictetus teaches, we are in control ONLY of our own thoughts, feelings and behaviors.  To get enraged by the behavior of others is to believe that one has control over said behavior.  And that is irrational.

Besides, things will eventually resolve one way or the other.  If as a result of this health crisis hundreds of thousands of more Americans die because they have stubbornly refused vaccination, it seems to me that we will all be better off because of it.  Think of it as a thinning of the gene pool.

Until then, tend to your own affairs and look after the people in your life who you love."
2021-08-07 17:18:04,"Having interests in both countries, I'm following what's happening in both the U.S. and Canada. Both countries are trying to deal with a sizeable number of people who haven't been immunized, but there's a big difference in approach.

In the U.S., Democratic political leaders are leading the way in a blame game, and those of us who are vaccinated are getting increasingly aggressive about those who aren't.

This is not happening in Canada. At the government level, unvaccinated people are being encouraged but not blamed, and the vaccinated public is not venting the kind of aggression that one sees in NY Times comments. Coming measures will put pressure on people to be vaccinated, but they are not being packaged a stick.

I think that Trudeau's decision to open the border to Americans on Monday on a trial basis, and to the world on September 7, is part of the domestic strategy.  It's an upbeat rejection of a siege mentality. It says ""Stick with the program a bit longer, there's light at the end of the tunnel"".

Canada's target is 80% full vaccination. Interestingly, the public are told what the target is regularly. The country is 11% ahead of us on full vaccination, and 14% on one shot, but it still has a ways to go to go to get to 80%. It's just using a less polarizing way of getting there."
2021-08-07 17:19:43,"I don't buy the, ""I can't get time off work to get the shot"". It's a cop out. We've had two months. What worker in two months can't get an hour off at noon (or even take a lunch break) sometime in two months to get a shot? Name a business (name, phone number) that does this, so I can call and check. 

I don't buy the, ""what if I get sick and lose a day?"" cop out. I mean, pre-covid, I've gone into work sick so I could conserve my sick days for goofing off. My job (R&D) chemist) mostly involved walking around and working on equipment, not sitting at a desk staring at a screen. It wasn't heavy construction, but it wasn't secretarial. 

How about, ""I don't have a car""? I respond, how does this person get groceries? They're almost certainly able to get to a food distribution point if they can answer this question - not many in the USA practice subsistence farming. 

What about the  Dem vs. 'pub split in vaccinations? Are that many more 'pubs dirt poor?

We can go down the list, but except in rare circumstances, what we're left with is, ""I don't want the shot and I'm making an excuse"". Don't trust it because of YouTube? The horrors of Tuskeegee 90 years ago? Just want to be free? 

And at the end of the brain stuff we run into fact: the universe doesn't care what your reasoning or reasons are. It cares only if your body encounters the virus, and if it's equipped to fight it off successfully. 

Don't enable this behavior."
2021-08-07 17:21:23,"At this point I am resigned to the fact that what will happen will happen and simply wait for things to run its course.  I am grateful that many people are hard at work to persuade the willfully unvaccinated to change their minds, but I am afraid that it will make very little difference.

Do I wish the willfully unvaccinated ill?  No.  I do not want them turned away at the hospital, but that is going to happen regardless.  Do I wish them to suffer?  No.  But that is going to happen regardless.

I am just sad that many other people will have to suffer alongside them.  The overwhelmed healthcare workers.  The children under 12.  And, when the next variant comes along that renders the existing vaccines worthless, each and every single one of us."

   If you click here and search there, especially in regard to total deaths per 100,000 (""all time""), you'll find the the differences are seldom very significant.
   You'll find the same if you compare within the US. Red states are not seriously worse-off than Blue ones; often just the opposite.
   All of these various states, and various countries had different levels of masking, business closings and lockdowns. Again, those differences just don't track with the death tolls. (For instance, if you compare South Dakota with New Mexico you'll find that despite the well known polar differences in their behaviors, the numbers are fairly comparable.)
   In other words, everyone is furious about almost nothing. Or, more to the point, I think, they're still boiling about D. Trump. (And he must be loving it!)
   Instead of an essay about the proper way to enjoy the anger Ms. Smarsh should have advised the readers to just get over it!"

Masking up and locking down just prolongs the inevitable. Let's do this, or not, and move on."
2021-08-07 17:25:40,"I found it good to also read Bryce Covert's recent piece, ""No, the Unvaccinated Aren’t All Just Being Difficult"" this morning. Apparently, many of the people who have not yet been vaccinated are not all living in some conspiracy theory. For the ones that are though, I am losing patience. Just as people falling into the Trump world possibly endangered democracy, ideological vaccine resisters could allow a mutation to arise that vaccines could not stop."
2021-08-07 17:26:26,"Marvelous ending.  I'm 66 and was fortunate to get my first Moderna shot on January 31st during a raging snowstorm in Wisconsin.  When  I actually got the shout, I almost cried because at last I was getting out from the crowd of dread called Covid-19.

And you're right, anger creates a circling ring of more anger, many times followed by physical harm.  This is no answer.  This anger is a waste of time.

Time I can now spend living out my life, largely unafraid of this virus and marveling at the science that could create such extraordinary vaccines.  And for those who feel this vaccine was less than a year old when it was rolled out - incorrect.  The science behind Pfizer and Moderna's research is 20 years old, Since the SARS outbreak.  

These vaccines, in how they are prepped for delivery into a human, are virus agnostic.  Thet can take any virus, evaluate its DNA, and literally program a harmless virus that will be injected and create antibodies against Covid-19, and eventually the variants that come down the road.  

But yeah, do away with anger at the non-vaxxers.  And when have we ever been able to change someone's mind.  We're in what could likely be a lifetime Covid cycle now.  The best medicine is the vaccination."

We are failing. The main reason we are failing is because there is an organized group in this country--the Republican party--which wants us to fail. They want Americans to die so that Joe Biden will be discredited. They will not change course just because Americans are dying in increasing numbers. Look at today's lead story about Florida.

This isn't about rage. It is about protecting ourselves from the human enablers of viruses who seek to spread their devastation in our midst. Consciously. Purposefully.

We need mandatory vaccination for all who are medically able to be vaccinated and we need it yesterday, with jail terms for noncompliance."

We have done this to ourselves with years of leaving workers with minimal bargaining power in the current labor market out in the cold."

But this is a false conclusion.  Not having health insurance should make folks realize that the health insurance industry is the problem.  Not the Health Care  system itself.  Insurance is not health care.  The health care system and its doctors and nurses do provide cures.   It's the insurers that cripple folks with debt.  We must begin segregating conversations that falsely link health insurance companies with health care.  The former do not care!"
2021-08-07 17:42:01,"I am disappointed and angry at those who adamantly refuse to be vaccinated. When you get the vaccine to protect yourself and others, it's hard to fathom why someone would refuse to protect the community at large as well. Right now the world is witnessing  divisions of political nature just because some do not want to see that we have a public health crisis which can be prevented by getting a shot in your arm. Human nature, the good, the bad and the ugly, is in full display right now and those of us who want to condemn the unvaccinated for not doing the right thing have every right to do so. We have done our part. Why not they?  
However, one cannot do much against the ignorant and those who believe in conspiracy theories and misinformation of all kinds. When your aunt, neighbor or friend refuse to be vaccinated, look to the sources of their refusal. Where do they get their news?  Fox news, Facebook, far-right websites, local channel owned by Sinclair, radio talk shows? Where have  the Common Good and the Common Sense gone?"

Of course not. Rage is anger unconstrained by reason and anger is the reflex emotion triggered by knowing what to do but being powerless to act. The author’s advice, in a word, is rage is a guilty pleasure we cannot afford if we are  to succeed in getting as many Americans as possible vaccinated.
We are powerless to change the dark side of American culture or the dark side of our politics that  our virtues cannot contain. So what are we to do?
Recognize that we still live in a democracy where leaders are elected, and most  politicians follow their constituents fundamental beliefs, however irrational. 
Among elected American  politicians,few are statesmen who have the wisdom and talent to guide the perplexed to the light. In politics, change in attitudes are slow and most American abandon their self=interest rather than compromise their fundamental values.
Optimism suggest that in time and with sympathy for those whose values are self-damaging we will get through this crisis. Of course, the American experience has been more damaging than it needed to be. But Churchill’s aphorism about America  remains accurate. Roughly summarized he noted, In the end Americans do the right thing,but only after exhausting all the alternatives."

I've had friends who got covid and survived, and a couple who were sadly not so lucky. There was no vaccine available to them at the time.

My niece is a CPN on the front lines, currently facing the same overcrowding of her hospital as in the early days of the pandemic, due to the delta variant. 

Please for the love of humanity, get vaccinated."
2021-08-07 17:49:05,"I appreciated the eloquence of this beautifully written piece. Thank you. Due to medical issues, I cannot get vaccinated. I still continue to wear my mask, only go out when needed and avoid crowds at all costs. Have not been to a restaurant in almost 2 years. This is my reality and I accept it. The anger at those who are not vaccinated is misdirected. I agree with the author about the issues that are now manifesting globally in a pandemic with no end in site. Absent is climate change.  Rather than looking for a quick fix or magic bullet, we all need to look within and make changes to ensure we have a future. Do you need a big home? Do you need to take numerous car trips during the day? Do you need to order something to be delivered - several times a week?  What about flying?  I am afraid the ""normalcy"" we long for may kill us all - sooner rather than later."

2021-08-07 17:53:48,"Thank you. This piece is so true and very much needed these days. Although I live in ""liberal"" left coast part of the country, I also grew up poor and without health insurance. The injustice of deep poverty in the ""richest country in the world"" is the source of most of our problems. I also came to the conclusion long ago that poverty is a choice that a society makes. We could solve the majority of our problems tomorrow if we could just wrestle the control from the cold, cold hands of those who do not care about anything but themselves."
2021-08-07 17:55:40,Talking about the hesitancy among the unvaccinated due to being uninsured is a false flag.  The vaccine is FREE.  The choice not be vaccinated has consequences for those choosing that path and those they come in contact with.  It's time at the very least  to label these choices for what they are.  Uninformed or just plain ignorant pretty much  sums it up.  Hurting someones feelings who is endangering everyone's health should be the least of our concerns.
2021-08-07 17:56:51,"The people I know, mostly family or extended family, who are not vaccinated, have made their choice. It is not based on economics it is based on mis-information and the belief that because of their youth and general good health and healthy habits they don't need the vaccination. There are also a few who use their religious beliefs as grounds for not getting the vaccination; as in God will protect me and if I get sick it's his will. So basically there is no sense in talking with any of them about this subject. I took a long break from the civic arena starting in February. Now, with the increase in cases and the anti vaxxers nonsense, I jumped back in and have now quickly realized the only thing which will change their mind is if they or someone close to them gets the virus. I. don't wish this on them but it seems to be the only variable which will convince them that this virus is real and deadly. I've recently posted comments on a few other articles which detail some of my experience with these folks. I'm done."

2021-08-07 18:01:23,"I am furious at those who refuse the vaccine. I too was afraid, but I spent hours on my iPad trying to get appointments as soon as the vaccine was available. January 27th was a day we felt blessed that brilliant scientists created this way out of the pandemic. We got vaccinated for ourselves, our family, and for our country.  The author’s perspective on my anger is well presented but sadly, it appears that fear of death rather than patient persuasion by example is a more potent motivator."
2021-08-07 18:03:06,"The author points to hesitancy, fear, misinformation and inconvenience as salient reasons why people who are eligible and have access to the vaccine have not gotten vaccinated. But the two most relevant, overarching factors underlying all those excuses are: 
      1) the failure to take COVID-19 seriously, and 
      2) the failure to acknowledge individual responsibility within a society. 
Where there is a will, there is a way. The two reasons above, not the excuses listed in the article, are why people are not finding the will to overcome the excuses for not being vaccinated."
2021-08-07 18:05:05,"The Governors Highway Safety Association continues to fight a similar battle for public health with motorcycle helmet laws. 

""In 1967, the federal government required states to enact universal motorcycle helmet laws to qualify for certain highway safety funds. By 1975, all but three had complied. In 1976, Congress revoked federal authority to assess penalties for noncompliance, and states began to weaken helmet laws to apply only to young or novice riders. Currently, about half the states require helmets for all motorcyclists. Most other states require helmets for certain riders, and a few have no helmet law. GHSA urges all states to adopt a universal motorcycle helmet law and vigorously enforce existing laws.""

2021-08-07 18:20:59,"Those of us who are vaccinated have two choices before us:

- Let the unvaccinated remain unvaccinated and wait for them to die off. Positives: The IQ of the general population will probably rise 10-20%. Negatives: They take a lot of innocents down with them.

- Do whatever it takes to get them vaccinated (short of bribery or forcibly injecting them): Have the federal government pay for ""vaccination tours"" which are heavily promoted and go into hard-to-reach areas (e.g., rural communities and lower income inner cities). Make anyone who does business with the federal government mandate vaccination for employees who have contact with federal workers. Limit interstate transportation (i.e., air travel) to vaccinated people.

We don't need to declare ""war"" on the unvaccinated, but we do have to make them realize their behavior is very anti-social and society is NOT obligated to cater to their nonsensical whims."

And I worked in the La County health ‘system’ so I well understand the problems that very low income earners, with no help with child care and difficulties with transportation, have with making it to any clinic appointment. Likewise the distrust that some groups (eg, African Americans) have toward government and health care (the Tuskegee experiment).

It is impossible to address all of the other justifications you give for failure to be vaccinated but believing the conspiracies when 165 million have been vaccinated, with success, and virtually no adverse effects, is short of the mark of defensibility. As for many of the others, the critical point, made by others, is that this is not just about the vaccinated person; it is a civic duty. If that requires extra, but non-heroic, effort so be it. 

Anger may be a useless reaction but we have reached the point where the non-vaccinated need to wake up and realize that they are endangering countless other individuals, and the country’s general well-being. Collectively we — I have to say they — are behaving as fools, as completely selfish, or both."

2021-08-07 18:26:35,"Lack of trust exists among the uninsured but the tradeoff of not finding a way to get to a location and receive a free shot is potentially tens of thousands in medical expenses if things do not go well for themselves, family, friends and any one else they may pass on COVID to.  Avoiding these expenses, whether you are paying for them yourself or not, should be a motivating factor.

I'm not having symptoms, but I have a heart murmur. A few others are, including one, with cardiac issues. He is lethargic and we're worried about him. We're all getting tested. I was tested this morning. One big worry: Yesterday, before we were informed, my sister visited with her daughter and 9-year-old granddaughter, who cannot yet get a vaccine. 

The nicest thing I can say about the anti-vaccine crowd is that they're using blindingly bad judgment. Consequences of infection and serious illness from COVID-19 far outweigh the risks with the vaccination. Consequences of refusing the vaccine include infecting many others, including children and those with underlying conditions. 

Right now, I and my family anxiously await results of tests, and we dread learning that an innocent child, a loved one, is infected. 

I don't hate anti-vaxxers, but I am angry and resentful of them. I reject claims that I should accommodate them and respect their opinion. If my family's outcome is the worst, we'll be accommodating serious illness and possible death of loved ones, possibly a child."

Ms. Smarsh, I read your comments as building up to the above paragraph, which provides a much needed larger perspective and, yet is seldom said out loud.

I would go further. This larger perspective should be recognized in conjunction with the grievances of minority groups. Focusing only on what is hurting one minority will not fix the structural problems that keep all but the privileged few down. Yes, it's a money dominated health care industry, but it's also the entitlements given to the ultra wealthy to pay minimal to no taxes, it's the moneyed lobbyists who are allowed to dictate to regulatory agencies and to explain complex bills to our Senators and Representatives. 

Multiple identity groups shouting about their losses make me despair that we will continue to be splintered, never recognizing our common enemy, which I see as the oligarchy that runs our country for their exclusive benefit. Could we not have a politician who can get this point across and so unite us in a common good?"

In handling the pandemic, such misdirection of attention keeps us from what we should be doing: trying to reach the vast group of people who might choose vaccination if barriers to access and knowledge were removed.”

The white, well-educated, suburban, Christian, affluent Trumpites are the vaccine holdouts where I live.  (BTW, I’m a Christian too.) Not a bumpkin among them, although some are affluent members of the agriculture industry.  The basis of their resistance is ideological, and value-based, or, in my view, due to a lack of values.  So yes, I’m losing patience on several levels.  And friends. I’m losing friends.  A price I’m willing to pay, since I have never maintained close friendships with selfish, self-absorbed people.

And, as a believer in the scientific method, I would of course prefer a time-tested vaccine that has been proven safe over many years. However, the covid pandemic is a dangerous emergency that did not afford us the luxury of waiting for improvements in our health-care system or for long-term vaccine trials. This emergency becomes potentially more dangerous as long as there are a lot of people who can become infected--i.e. act as hosts--for a virus that cannot mutate without the help of a host's body. Further, even if one does not die or become immediately disabled by covid, there is still a very real risk of nasty consequences showing up later on after a covid infection.  Having taken all of that into account, as soon as I was eligible, I got the vaccine last March. Now, with the more contagious delta variant sweeping the globe and with more variants likely ahead of us, the scales are weighted even more in the direction of vaccination. Often, taking an action (like getting vaccinated) feels like a weightier, more significant decision than just sliding along without taking an action. But in fact, the consequences of inaction can be equally or more significant. I understand that some people may have valid concerns about the vaccine, but those concerns should be realistically compared to the well-documented dangers of covid infection."

When I realize parent fatigue has way overshadowed work fatigue.  More saddened by all this rage since I would rather be fully present and alive with my daughters. COVID has taken an enormous toll on mental health reserves, depleted months ago. To be clear, I can write this post. We can try to self-regulate, live, and love."
2021-08-07 19:06:48,"I am a family physician in that bastion of left-ism, New York City.  I offer both the Moderna and the Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) vaccine in my office.  Everyone who has an appointment is asked if they are vaccinated and, if not, if they want a jab.  The ""vaccine hesitant"" came down off the fence weeks ago.  Now, we have the 15-20% vaccine-refusing.  I enter into a non-judgmental, non-shaming discussion with each one.  Four categories of ""reasons"" (read: excuses): 1) vaccine too new/not FDA approved/possible long-term effects, 2) I have a strong immune system and don't need it, 3) I had COVID, so I don't need it, 4) any of a number of bizarre, delusional reasons found in those dark corners of the internet.  They remain steadfast: ""thank you doctor, but I've made up my mind"".  Many know friends or family who have suffered through COVID, but remain deluded that, through some combination of luck and strength, they won't get it.  They know better than all of science.  They know something we all don't know.  Until they don't.

I'll continue to try to dispel myths and misinformation, in hopes that a few will see the light or, eventually, relent.  But, the real solution is what I call the FOMO solution: strict workplace mandates, strict exclusion from public gatherings, including travel, sports activities, entertainment venues and restaurants.  Not vaccinated, stay home until you get it.  Anger? Perhaps.  Reasonable solution?  I believe so."
2021-08-07 19:10:15,"It is hard to read a newspaper without coming across another story of inequities in the USA.   But once again, I read an article that bemoans the poor decisions people make with their health, their children’s health and their financial stability and futures.  How much of the inequity we see is self inflicted vs systemic?"
2021-08-07 19:11:17,"This is a great piece, reminding us that self-righteous rage, like too much chocolate, isn't healthy. So I'll continue to try to keep my anger at bay. I am, however, out of patience with the unvaccinated. I won't force a needle into anybody's arm, but I fully support a program of forced quarantine. The unvaccinated have an absolute right to do what they will with their body; they have no right, however, to jeopardize mine and they should bear the cost of that isolation. Since they chose to be a risk to others, they should be the ones who must isolate."
2021-08-07 19:15:00,"I realize that I do not have the power to change others' views on getting vaccinated, so I really want a mechanism to keep the unvaccinated away from me.  This is because I want the freedom I experienced this June back.

We need a voluntary, secure registry for people who desire to be able to show proof of vaccination.  Then we can freely choose whether we want to patronize businesses that require vaccination and associate with others who believe in public health."
2021-08-07 19:19:31,"Let me ask those who are venting ther rage against the unvaccinated a simple question. Living in a two party political system as we do, how would you feel if the party to which you belonged was denied any voice in the media while being belittled, censored, dismissed out of hand? Without being allowed to present their case, they have been accused of being everything from selfish to unpatriotic. Would you still feel you lived in a country in which freedom of expression is supposedly a given? Well, that's exactly where many ICU doctors, other MDs, research scientists and virologists who have valid questions about the efficacy and safety of the vaccines, the lockdowns and masks have found themselves since the beginning of the pandemic. They have been ignored, demonized, unable to take part in a dialogue with those presenting the accepted medical narrative from the beginning. This no longer feels like an open society. It feels like this has become a country where the free exchange of ideas on which true science is based has gone missing."
2021-08-07 19:26:02,"Go to where you shop or use other services, and make a case to the manager or owner for the resumption of a mask requirement for staff and visitors. Until we have herd immunity or at least until Delta has done it's damage. Delta has eluded the vaccines in breakthrough cases, so vaccine or no, any of us can be the unwitting super-spreader with enough virus in our noses to infect 8-9 other people. As infectious as chicken pox, right? Certainly it's vastly more likely that the unvaccinated will be infected and that they will spread it, but alas, Delta is here and Delta is changing the rules. Further, I don't want to have to guess if the unmasked person next to me in line is vaccinated or not. That's not my responsibility. Further, I'm not immune-compromised but I am routinely around people who are. Say it with me folks: If a person is elderly, they have a weaker immune system. It's part of aging. And it's not as if immune compromised people wear a T-shirt that says, ""hey, I have lupus, or hey, I'm a cancer survivor."" And then there are ALL of the children under 12 who have no say and who are as yet unvaccinated. It is chilling to think about who either don't understand or don't care how a virus mutates, and those who don't know or don't care that the children can become the victim of a mutated Delta or the next variant. So yes, angry. But not incapacitated. At the least, we can get the masks back on."
2021-08-07 19:27:55,"My rage comes from absolute exhaustion from doing everything I can to avoid getting this disease, wearing a mask, avoiding others, not seeing my elderly father for a year. The fear I had that he would get sick and I would not feel safe going to see him. My rage comes from the wanton disregard towards others that so many governors, politicians, celebrities have shown by calling this virus a hoax and harmless, which caused so many people to disregard the warnings and pay the ultimate price. My rage comes from people continuing this line of propaganda for the vaccine as they did with the virus. My rage comes from being so close to the end only to be thrust back to the beginning. My rage comes from those that flaunted the regulations and mandates in the name of freedom that denied me the ability to live my life free from fear. Bring on the restrictions for the unvaccinated. Take the vaccinations to those who are willing but unable. I am tired of all the excuses."

However, there are exceptions.  Anger is as useful an emotion as any others when used properly.  

Those who are not vaccinated are, in my opinion, basically pointing guns at our unvaccinated grandchildren.  They are risking their lives with their irresponsibility and self-centeredness.

When you are risking the lives and health of our grandchildren then that crosses a line.  And upon crossing that line, those who do this will experience our anger and blame."

Our system cost 3 times more than the best, and delivers the worst outcomes for millions of our citizens.  Why have we remained so complacent regarding these facts?

Most Americans are grateful that a vaccine is available and realize that they can make an individual decision to protect themselves if they're worried about COVID.  

Please, get back to reporting the news.  We are getting fed five articles like this on a daily basis.  Why? 

Simultaneously, there is virtually no coverable of what is happening with the investigation into the origins of COVID.  

Personally, I'm more interested in finding those responsible for this outbreak and making sure it doesn't happen again.  If I'm worried about COVID I'll get the vaccine once it's approved by the FDA.  Others can do the same."

When I received my vaccine I was fully aware of the potential side effects and risks because I made myself so. I was still concerned as I rolled up my sleeve but I also thought about what might happen if I didn’t and what we had ALL been through up to that point.
Ignorance is a choice. Who to follow advice from, or not, is a choice. Not truly weighing the benefits for all vs personal needs is also a choice.
While I get and respect the point of this piece I also get that nobody is obligated to have compassion for those who refuse it for their neighbor. 
The greater good used to be more than just a consideration, it was a virtue, even  with the reddest among us before being obliterated by the loud “me and mine before you and yours “ crowd. 
The collective reasoning of common good is nature’s way of ensuring our survival. When we collectively began to believe in our superiority to nature , we have ensured our demise."

My niece is college educated, with a master’s degree, even.  Why have they not been vaccinated?  I’m not sure, but my niece’s conservative husband might have something to do with it.  He has already alienated part of our family with his political comments, and I’m afraid this might be the last straw for me."
2021-08-07 19:49:24,"One strong argument that may get some traction is this:

Think of how much money you will save by not getting sick from COVID-19.

And, I wonder how long insurance companies will look the other way? Do you think premiums will go up for unvaccinated people who get long COVID-19?"
2021-08-07 19:50:38,"The vaccine is FREE! You just have to go and get it, at pretty much any pharmacy at this point. So people without health insurance, instead of being afraid of contracting this virus that could put them in the hospital headed for financial ruin, are afraid of getting the free vaccine? 

I'm sorry, but I just don't understand that. That explanation makes no sense to me, and when something doesn't make sense, it probably doesn't explain what's happening.

Don't get me wrong, I totally agree that it's a disgrace and a sin that everyone in this country doesn't have health care. 

If you mandated this vaccine, the overwhelming majority of people who haven't gotten around to getting it would do so. To not mandate it as broadly as possible is simply derelict. The rest of us are rolling the dice hoping  this thing doesn't evolve to evade the vaccine because a minority of the population just won't get it. 

You talk about trampling on people's freedom! They are trampling all over ours, but apparently our freedom doesn't matter. We seem to only care about the freedom conservatives care about, which apparently doesn't include the freedom to live. 

Apparently, I'm not doing a very good job of channeling my anger."
2021-08-07 19:52:44,"Interesting, thoughtful and, I think, on point.  As a lawyer, mediator and arbitrator, it is my profession to walk into disputes that are already alive and often hot.

At the beginning of my involvement with every dispute I always ask myself, ""What is really going on here?  What is driving this dispute.""    Often the answer has little or nothing to do with the legal issues presented.

It could be a partnership that is broken at a personal level or a vendor who faces financial vulnerability if a contracted sale  is rejected.

On very rare occasion, I have succeeded in pulling broken partnerships back together and put them on the road to healing and productivity. 

Once, after 12 hours of negotiation, I was able to pull a partnerhip back together by getting the parties (the business guy and the creative talent) to realize that they desperately needed each other in order to be successful.  Then we were able to craft a new relationship addressed the underlying personal issues and grievances that had given rise to the dispute.

At the end, I actually got hugged by the parties.  Believe me that doesn't happen to mediators very often."
2021-08-07 19:53:34,"To feel rage about the actions of others is a natural human emotion, but not necessarily a good one for social animals like humans.  I remember in the 1960's and 70's that many leftist radicals were encouraging each other to keep their rage burning. Mostly it seemed that they were asking themselves and others to avoid weighing evidence and to avoid modifying their dogmas to fit new evidence.  Now, it is the Republican base who are rejecting all evidence contrary to their dogmas and getting angry at people who reject those dogmas.

When I was young, a brother of mine, my mother. and I all got polio.  Like with covid-19 my brother and I got over it with no lasting effects.  Also like with covid-19, my mother suffered lifelong disabilities and died young, her body simply worn out by the battle. Consequently, I will never want to deal with people whom I know deliberately exposed others to covid-19 and were proud of that.  Ever.  I will try to treat their children with respect and avoid prejudice. I will try to understand people who were genuinely ignorant or under cultural coercion.

As someone who values freedom and democracy, I will never again trust the GOP enough to vote for or support anyone who stays in that party.  This isn't rage, just a cold calculation that the GOP is way too susceptible to autocracy.  I sincerely hope that refugees from the GOP will be able to establish a new center-right party."

I have two autoimmune disorders, one of them, RA is extremely painful, to the point that a flare forces me to stay in bed, or sit around in a chair, unable to open a water bottle -for days, even weeks. 

It has spent years researching and experimenting with different lifestyles and diets, to find a way to live an almost normal, pain-free life -without being heavily medicated every day and without any of these 5K injections we see advertised on TV. I am on a very strict diet.

Even the use of different oil or an OTC medication can shatter my world. I love bacon and chocolate but have to live without both. I became a vegan, not by choice but by despair. A long list of things I CANNOT have or should not do.

I wore a mask everywhere, still got COVID in December, to my surprise, just a mild case. There are no studies, how the vaccine will affect me, but everybody tells me not to worry.

Sorry, this is my life, my body (rings a bell?) and I am terrified of the disease I am already dealing with, and of COVID.

This aggressive disdain for the medical case has enjoyed the aggressive public support of the former president of the United States and continues to benefit from the cheerleading of some of the most vocal Spreadnecks in public life, including the governors of our most afflicted regions.

2021-08-07 20:06:46,Thanks so much for this very thoughtful and necessary opinion piece!  I think that the vaccination rate would increase if every single employer across the country gave their workers a couple days of paid leave to get the vaccine and to deal with the side effects.  These employers should then get some sort of tax break for doing so.  I realize that such a solution would not likely work in our increasingly polarized and acrimonious political landscape though.
2021-08-07 20:14:33,"Thank you for this thoughtful piece. Today was a turning point for me for some reason. I’ve decided to both no longer be angry at the unvaccinated, they’ve taught me the depth and breadth of selfishness I didn’t know was out there; and to largely not wear a mask (I’m vaccinated) but now when I see a kid who is clearly not eligible to be vaccinated and we are indoors I will mask up.

Uh, no. I've long come to the conclusion that nothing I say or do is going to change anyone's mind about vaccines, and trying to counsel anti-vaxxers is just asking for trouble in a time when a sworn member of Congress is making veiled threats against public health workers who are trying to get the word out about how to be vaccinated. So I just forge ahead quietly, following the public health recommendations myself. What else is there to do?"

Why should the vaccinated have our freedoms restricted by a bunch of pouting juveniles?

I just feel a little disappointed that, for example, it's hard for me to socialize with my unvaccinated friends. I suppose as long as I'm vaccinated, it doesn't really matter. I got a little upset that my one friend didn't try to get his disabled brother, who has obesity and diabetes, a vaccine. This, even after I have shared with him many times that these are the highest risk factors for severe COVID-19 and death. I'm not mad at him though. I'm just frustrated because it seems he wasn't listening to me. But when I think of it from his perspective, he probably feels unheard as well. He works a night shift and lost a family member to a drug overdose this past year. It might seem hypocritical to him to take part in the national vaccination project when the nation hasn't really done much for him or his family. So it's probably low on his priority list. I think the same situation probably applies to most low-income people who don't want to get vaccinated. When you're living at the edge of despair, life and death aren't as important anymore, so you begin to take more risks. You begin to say to yourself, ""Well, if I get the virus and die, I was going to die anyway and this might take me out of my misery. If I don't get it, I don't get it."" I really think they view the professional class begging them to get vaccinated as people who have let them down before. And that's why they resist."

This may be my own ignorance, but this simply does not make sense to me. It's been at least two or three months since all American have been eligible to receive the vaccine. I'm sure most employers are eager for their employees to be vaccinated. Are we hearing stories of people being fired for taking a sick day? 

If taking a day or two off work is a disastrous proposition for some people, why not get vaccinated on a Friday and have the weekend to recover, if need be?

And what does it mean to fear the ""for-profit health care industry,"" particularly when vaccines are free and it's this same system that will be caring for them if--at this point, when--they contract COVID?

I know my rage is useless, but so many of the ""explanations"" of vaccine hesitancy among those beyond hard-right anti-vaxxers still make no sense to me. The supposed ""barriers"" feel self-imposed.

Another Times article talked about successfully bringing mobile vaccine clinics to street fairs. I hugely applaud that effort, but if you have time to relax at a street fair, you have time to go to CVS and get your shot. 

All that said, I'm extremely grateful to the health officials devising these clever albeit painstaking methods of getting the hesitant vaccinated. I just wish they didn't have to."
2021-08-07 20:57:30,"The Times needs to stop sewing division and promoting animosity against a group who are not responsible for this surge. Look, England had a huge surge and was mostly vaccinated.

But instead, we have a fragmented system of public health departments run by states and with little authority.

It's just late and sad and ominous. We are going to see new variants emerge because, since we and the rest of the world isn't vaccinated fully. So this uncertainty and death and finally fragmentation will go on for some years to come.

Many of the same citizens who choose not to receive a vaccine that is 95% effective at preventing death, are the same ones who refused to wear a mask at the height of the pandemic. 
Ms. Smarsh can rail all she wants about the injustices of our for profit health care system. But it has been the actions of our family, friends and neighbors that have resulted in many of the 620,000 deaths and prolonged the pandemic. If we had all practiced social distancing, worn masks when that was not possible and received the vaccine, far less would be dead and gone forever. Blame the unvaccinated."

It is frankly exhausting. It is a small group of very vocal people who are exhausting all of us. There are people who were still hesitant and it’s easy to be helpful and kind to them. Over the months those numbers have reduced as those people have taken the shots, but the remaining are getting more and more unhinged. They get taken down for a few days but (except for one foul-mouthed blow hard) they come back. 

I hear the author, I agree with the author, but it’s frankly hard for me to do the emotional work some times."
2021-08-07 17:41:39,"This started with Trump. He sent his followers to the unvaccinated slaughter (taking the freedoms and safety of the vaccinated with them) while quietly getting the shots for himself and his family in January. 
Just like saying ""I'll be there with you"" at the insurrection, then going back and watching it on tv from the safety of his room, the only skin he has in the game is his own. 
If you have your reasons for not getting the shot(s), okay, this is the USA. If one of those reasons is 'Trump told me not to', you are being played. And this is a dangerous game."
2021-08-07 16:51:53,"This is a function of the Radical Right Movements, in iterations appearing LONG before Trump came on the scene.
For decades they have perturbed the nation, culminating in a president who sought to deceive the country about COVID, did far too little to facilitate a response, and who ultimately instigated a violent coup attempt to overthrow the government.
THAT'S WHAT ALL THIS IS.
Its not just about COVID.
Its the cumulative affect of having this noxious and venal political philosophy being allowed PLAY in our res publica.
And now they threaten the health of the entire nation by allowing this noxious virus to mutate in a more unrestrained fashion than if a reasoned vaccination plan were being participated in by the whole country.
This group DESERVES the nation's anger.  They are threatening not only themselves, but us ALL."

I wish I could disabuse myself of the notion that we're getting what we deserve, stop feeling ashamed of my country, and feel like a proud American.   

Instead, I feel fear and despair over America's character and its future.  You'd think being old and childless would provide some consolation for that, but it just doesn't."
2021-08-07 17:12:02,"Nice article.

But the thing is, no one who has told me they were not going to get vaccinated has ever said it was due to lack of food, time off from work, etc.  It came down to two issues.  With the exception of one person, everyone said their faith in Jesus was all they needed (all people of color).  The other is a nurse at an Infectious Disease Clinic I went to who stated back in December that she was going to wait 2 years to see how the vaccine played out in the general public, i.e., Phase IV. 
 Originally, I was going to wait 2 years as well but changed my month ago.  

Let's discuss food issues.  I'm on food stamps and since the pandemic has started, the SNAP program has doubled my food benefits.  Food banks deliver.  A Samoan family keeps giving me their extra food.  My city has yet another program on top of that called Fresh Bucks and sends me coupons worth $40 a month in fruits and vegetables...and they doubled that amount last month and this month.  If you are going hungry in the U.S., I don't know what to tell you.  We don't live in Yemen and if you have kids, you are now getting some more money than last year so again, food/diapers is not an issue.  

Time off from work?  How much time would a person need to take off from work if they got even a ""mild"" case of COVID?  My religious neighbor who didn't even wear a mask got plenty of time off after going to church just before Thanksgiving.  She is now in a lovely urn."
2021-08-07 17:36:16,"I too have spent far too many years uninsured, when I was underemployed. Had to bargain for cheaper care after an accident helping a neighbor. I have a masters degree, have worked since I was 14, and feel punished for not “succeeding” in the right way to guarantee my basic health. That’s why I look very forward to renouncing my US citizenship (lucky me I have citizenship in a slightly more sane country). I no longer want to be part of a country where this is so true: “Is it so shocking that a caste-based society that exalts individualism and prioritizes profit above wellness — one of the only industrialized nations without universal health care — would fail to rise to the challenges of a collective health crisis?” America, you have lost me. Good luck with your “American values” that have led to this."

I think the actual rage is still the MAGA-hats; so to even attempt to equate justifiable anger of the vaccinated and masked at those harming the public good (our collective health and/or health care system) with those who flout common-sense public health efforts, is odious in the extreme.  While not all red states have low vax rates, most do. While not all blue states have high vax rates, most do. What is different is the numerous politicians milking personal ""freedom"" to not mask and not vaccinate, (No one can make you do anything you don't want to do!), all the way to the bank and the ballot box. Sadly, they will likely not have to account for all the deaths they cause, because you know, personal freedom. Diabolical. They will likely gain politically, yet never will have to pay the price. We are all nothing but tiny pieces of a huge risk-management game."

2021-08-07 20:28:55,"No, I will not let go of my justifiable anger against unvaccinated adults who are eligible for the vaccine and have access to it.   They are endangering the lives of the rest of us, damaging the economy, and consuming the resources of the healthcare system.   Further fueling my anger is the hypocrisy of many of the unvaccinated.  These god-fearing conservatives are neither—I suspect that were Jesus alive today, he would advise his followers to mask up and get vaccinated to protect their fellow man.   They want control over their own bodies, yet are against a woman’s right to choose.  They want the economy wide open, but won’t do the most important thing right now to accomplish that. We will all pay higher health insurance premiums and higher taxes because of their ignorance and selfishness.  They relish their individual “freedom” while making society as a whole pay the price for it."

You're either part of the problem, or part of the solution. 

I'm glad I'm no longer practicing medicine. I was compassionate to all, even to those who did things to themselves with cigarettes, alcohol or weapons. But now? I'm all out of compassion for the unvaxxed. 

We need disincentives for staying unvaxxed. Things like a  Covid copay for anyone admitted to the hospital without proof of vaccine. At the very least, make the unvaxxed pay for their own testing in workplaces that mandate vaccines. (They have the legal right to fire the unvaxxed and should.) Rate up health insurance for the unvaxxed. Require vaccines to get and keep life insurance. 

The majority of Americans think vaccines for Covid are a good idea. Since when do we let the minority rule?"

This is why the argument that the millions of doses administered are proof the vaccine is safe are not based in science.  Those using this argument are often the first to point in anger at the vaccine skeptical and say ""science denier!"".

Believing that millions of doses in the arms of the general public proves safety is poor science at best.  It doesn't meet FDA's own criteria for making medical claims.  Why?  Because it is anecdotal evidence.

Side effects are not being tracked in the general public as they would be in long term studies.  I know of only a very few who were vaccinated by private doctors who have received followups.   Ms. Smarsh attempted to report her reactions and was brushed aside by the supposed professional administering the shot.  CDC REQUIRES all healthcare practitioners to report adverse events to VAERS.  How many other providers are failing to report adverse reactions?

This is not to say that I believe the vaccines aren't safe but only to point out that those who rage away using pseudo science as 'proof' are just as much a problem as those who support the microchip conspiracies. 

Bad data is worse than no data at all."

I am still furious with the anti-vaxxers (not to be confused with the vaccine reluctant) for their shameless disregard for the well-being of others--including that of their own children.

Although your article has helped me to better understand the multiplicity of reasons for people's choosing not to become vaccinated, I find myself unable forgive what I deem to be the fringe-right's unforgivable acts of malice based in false ideologies.

I plan to convert my anger into energy  by engaging in  get-out-the vote campaigns aimed at Democratic-leaning voters in states dominated by  Covid-friendly Republican legislators and governors who have recklessly aided and abetted the spread of this devastating virus for their own political gain.

I will not allow my anger to consume me any more than it already has, hoping to find relief when these craven elected red-state officials have been booted from office in next year's mid-term elections."

We thought we were through with him as of January 20, but he's still lurking about and trying to be as disruptive and haunting, as unhelpful and as scary as possible, and, incidentally, continues to sell this and that, to his cult of followers.  I live in Wyoming, and that fact alone says a lot.  I can see a strong connection between that guy's awfulness and the anti-social, uncooperativeness, belligerent, disrespectful, uncaring, and reckless and ignorant attitudes of so many of the people in my little city of Rock Springs.

Do we rage against a convenience store customer for buying scratch off lottery tickets, when they have a gambling addiction?

Me? Nope. People take in as much information as they want and do with it as they will. I'm not fat shaming someone in public. And, I don't think we should treat them like a suspected witch in 17th Century Massachusetts.  Don't we teach our children to be non-judgmental of others?

If the unvax'd refuse the shot, it is no more our business, than someone filling there cart with beer and Fruit Loops.

2021-08-07 20:59:05,"I am so familiar with Sarah’s point of view, having lived in Kansas my entire life. I agree with her that the white, middle to upper class privileged folk egregiously mischaracterize blue collar working class and the poor as a mass of ignorant Trumpers. Still there is a significant number of us who have dedicated our lives to understanding the unmet needs of the poor and vulnerable even if we were privileged from birth and benefitted from unearned breaks that helped us become “successful,” in spite of our shortcomings.

I work in legal aid, and worked with Sarah for a time on writing grants to provide equal access to justice for poor persons in Kansas. She and I both know the many shades of gray in the experience and resulting psyches of persons needing a hand up. For persons of color, a free vaccination may be suspect—another medical experiment to torture them in order to provide scientific data used to improve treatment for the privileged. For others who say no to vaccinations, the only control in their lives that they can exercise is the right to permit what medical treatment they receive—even while they may lose jobs, housing and the basic needs for quality of life in the meantime. 

Americans may only evolve (if they want to) to higher consciousness if they recognize the full spectrum of humanity in this country—the range of colors, politics, life decisions and aspirations—cannot be lumped into cartoonish groups of us versus them “unvaccinated, ignorant poor folks.”"

The underlying problem here goes back to Reagan convincing Republicans that government is always the problem, never the solution. Clearly a pandemic requires a national response.  Instead, thanks to Trump and the GOP we have had endless promotion of lies and deranged conspiracy fantasies, with a president who tried to undermine the scientific information from those who actually solved previous pandemics. The GOP has made itself the party of lies, not only about the virus, but equally dangerous, about the undeniable fact that Trump lost the election.  People have died because of that big lie, with no sign that the GOP cares at all.  Must we be sacrificed to the cult of Trump?"

Therefore, I have to contest the statement that:

This cycle repeated when my brother got his shot, and when my many elderly aunts and uncles got theirs. During those tense, hopeful final months of spring I just assumed everyone out there was equally anxious for their turn to get vaccinated. How wrong I was.

I do appreciate the recognition that conspiracy theories feed off of dysfunctional systems, and the call for big, structural changes to the health care system to fix these systems.

But you know who like the idea of universal, affordable health care? Hint: it's not the anti-vaxxers. Try passing Medicare for All, and they'll double down on their ""death panels"" conspiracy theories. And they definitely will not get the vaccine."

It's addictive and there are many sources on TV, online and print media to fuel that addiction.

In these ""populist"" circles, loyalty in the form of blind obedience is strictly enforced under threat of cancellation. 

The Times reported on a video from a hospitalist in Missouri who said:

“I work closely with our pharmacists who are leading our vaccine efforts through our organization, and one of them told me the other day that they had several people come in to get vaccinated who have tried to sort of disguise their appearance and even went so far as to say, ‘Please, please, please, don’t let anyone know that I got this vaccine.’”

So the retribution is coming from within the ranks of the politically inoculated, too. We can give these folks facts, help them assess risks, and help them get to vaccination sites. But can facts counter the pressure to conform within the tribe? 

Some anti-vaxxers have even (ironically?) adopted abortion rights rhetoric (""My Body, My Choice""). But abortions aren't contagious. 

Think of political vaccine refusers as drunk drivers. They claim that they're exercising personal freedom and firmly deny that they're impaired. Yet they're a danger to themselves and anyone near them.

Your essay gave me hope. I have friends who are well educated, conservative, and live in blue California but are afraid of the vaccine or think it unnecessary. I don’t criticize them but make an effort to empathize with their hesitancy. I tell them my experience with the minor side effects and how it feels great to be able to travel again as part of a group. I’m not sure if that will encourage them to get the vaccine but being angry with their choice would drive them away. I reserve my anger for Tucker Carlson et al who have told their viewers not to trust the COVID vaccine even when it was developed on Trump’s watch.

This is not just to get the pandemic under control but also to address global warming.  The pandemic will kill millions, but climate change will kill billions by making the planet too hot to reliably support the crops we eat.  

If some deaths will get the rest of us to accept the realities revealed by science, or if deaths are mainly among those who do not accept science and occur because they do not do what science advises, then that is the price of our return to relative sanity.  As with wars, victory has a price and we must be willing and even eager to risk paying that price.

We are at war with an alien invader which is, thanks to the workings of its own evolution, able to develop strategies and tactics as if it were intelligent.  Those who do not believe in evolution can see evidence of intelligent design (God's or the Devil's) in the new, more effective variants that are appearing.  In times of war, actions that help the enemy (whether intentionally or not)  are prohibited and beliefs that help the enemy are censored and brainwashed away.

I blame Republican and conservative leaders for throwing the pandemic into the cultural war hopper for their own personal gain. They are so addicted to stoking resentment and polarization that there is nothing they are unwilling to throw into the flames just so long as they don't get burned. And so far they haven't. Division and polarization are is better for them than the common good. Lies are more useful than truth.

While I am sure that there are people who refuse the vaccine for the reasons the author cites, but a far greater determinate is the degree of felt risk.  The elderly are about 90% vaccinated and yet certainly cover the full rage of categories the author tries to create. Why? Because the elderly feel the threat and are mostly likely to have personal knowledge of someone who was hurt by covid-19.  For 99+ percent of the population, covid was like a distant war, something on TV where some people were being hurt or dying.  It’s difficult to motivate people against such a far and distant fear.

That, to me, is the heart of the matter. To blue state liberals, living in a “safetism” culture, the tolerance of risk is low.  In working class communities and less “liberal” communities, the risk is small and tolerable given the risks they tolerate every day (guns, crime, drugs, poverty)."

With all of the resources being provided to get vaccinated, at-home vaccinations, $100 gift certificates, donuts and fries, it is  ludicrous the level of privilege Americans have and turn away from, while the rest of the world suffers."
2021-08-07 17:35:54,"I really enjoyed reading this article.  It was refreshing to hear the thoughts of another person who is not wasting their energy being furious at people who chose differently than they do.

Everyone acts like only the unvaccinated spread the Delta variant.  It's already been proven that vaccinated people can and do spread the illness.  Even if 100% of the eligible people in America were vaccinated, the Delta variant would still be circulating here, folks.  Our borders are open, kids unvaccinated, and people are travelling,  You would still be at risk of dying if you are vaccinated and immuno-suppressed.  Just like it is in other countries that have better vaccination rates. 

If you want to be furious, just focus upon those record breaking profits that health insurance companies are making right now in America.  Our for-profit health care system is disgusting.  That's what makes me furious.

2021-08-07 21:58:35,"Demonizing those who choose not to be vaccinated is wrong but inner fury at their obstinance is inevitable. 

The vaccinated are not seeking to change the way of life of those who choose not to be vaccinated or those opposed to social distancing and wearing masks. The reasons are rather intensely personal. They want the overall risk reduced for themselves and their loved ones. 

Those opposed to sensible anti-pandemic solutions stand in the way of a return to normalcy. Their inability to comprehend the disastrous consequences should be blamed on the misinformation spread by right-wing media outlets and the reckless policies of far right politicians."
2021-08-07 20:44:22,"VAccinations for COVID are free, as you must know.  So why all the harping on economic status as the variable that keeps people from getting the COVID 19 vaccine?"
2021-08-07 21:59:23,"As I write this, thousands gather for the Sturgis Rally, again welcomed by Gov. Noem. Last year's rally led to 414 cases of COVID-19, according to one source -- and that was only in September 2020.

We've had vaccines against the novel coronavirus for some time now. Millions of doses have been given, and serious side effects are rare. These vaccines are not approved for children under 12, and some groups refuse for valid medical reasons.

But those who claim vaccines, or masks, or social distancing, are intrusions on their liberty, in my opinion have no valid basis for refusing. If they still refuse, I feel they should accept the consequences -- which would include being barred from public events like concerts, and going to the end of the line for treatment if they fall sick with COVID-19."
2021-08-07 22:02:11,"The Biden administration did a great job of mobilizing the infrastructure required to get millions of us vaccinated.

However they should have also focused on the one group cited here, the minority communities where the vaccination rate has been very low. If there are only a few adamant anti-vaxxers in that group but more concerned about costs, immigration status, hospitals or safety of the drug. 

Are they just hard to reach or could the Federal and State Government have done something more?"
2021-08-07 18:40:27,"What to do? Vote every republican out of office. It's our key to making sure this doesn't happen again. Oh, and haul the Murdochs in front of Congress to answer the question ""why""?"
2021-08-07 17:03:59,"""The good liberal citizen and the far-right anti-vaxxer."" More false equivalence that is disingenuous, unhelpful, and totally inaccurate. Those two positions are NOT equally valid. Sorry Sarah, but you're too late. The operative question is no longer how we will ""come together,"" but why anyone should bother trying to reach the one-third of the electorate that is unreachable?"
2021-08-07 18:50:26,"Let's not forget the immunocompromised, who remain vulnerable even when vaccinated, for whom the politically unvaccinated may be a souless executioner."
2021-08-07 22:07:01,"What is wonderful about Ms. Smarsh’s opinion piece is that she looks at the circumstances of the unvaccinated.  In a time of terrible inequity, to look only at personality traits is only seeing how people adapt to inequity, not the cause of the problem. Calling people “dumb” or “self-destructive” is a self-congratulatory approach. I am angry, too, but mostly at the lousy previous guy (and toadies) in the WH who did not care about testing, tracing, and PPE and then compounded it by bad-mouthing the vaccine (when he wasn’t taking credit for it), causing perhaps hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths and ruining  the public debate. I especially appreciate the author’s description of the world she grew up in, the loss of family farms to corporate farming, etc.—that in itself, can account for radical distrust of government. I do disagree with her interpretation of data that equalizes liberal and conservative inoculation receiving—while I appreciate the reasons she points out that poor urban people are less vaccinated—the politicians in power in conservative states (and conservative media) are polluting the country’s response as a whole to the virus. Very thoughtful piece."
2021-08-07 21:12:25,"Once again, the tired excuse of the “for-profit health system”. France which has universal healthcare has seen riots and mass demonstrations against the vaccine mandate. Ditto Germany. Vaccines are free in the US and delivered in every supermarket, pharmacy and now even gas stations. There is no justification for being unvaccinated today. None. Class, race, gender and all the rest of it have nothing to do with the deep-seated stupidity of the unvaccinated who are not limited to any political persuasion either. The only unvaccinated person I know personally is a Bernie voter. Issue vaccine passports and require them for any meaningful activity, including shopping. And if the government is too weak to do what is done in France and Italy, then let the dreaded insurance companies refuse to pay the costs of a COVID hospitalization. Maybe this will bring them back to reality."
2021-08-07 22:10:13,"My parents served in the Second World War, spent their careers educating and helping the poor, and delivered Meals on Wheels well into their 80s. When I was young, they constantly drilled into me the need to help those ""less fortunate"" and to do good. We may not be able to change minds, but we can choose to always be decent in our daily lives. One thing I noticed in the Trump years was how receptive people were to my attempts to be decent. In the end, decency, even if it's not reciprocated, is all each one of us has to contribute. Do the right thing (vaccinate, mask, distance) and lead by example."
2021-08-07 22:10:34,"I drove two hours to a rural community to get my shots last March.  I cried with joy.

""What will you do with the life it saved?"" asks Ms. Smarsh, the author of this wonderful column.

I have savored every delicious moment of a life filled once again with family and friends.

And now, I will roll up my sleeves as we approach the mid-terms and do everything I can to ensure that a science-based, compassionate and forward-thinking agenda prevails-again."
2021-08-07 22:11:40,"Before Covid there were those opposed to vaccines, have we forgotten the measles outbreaks? Unfortunately the pattern was set, ie allowing religious justification or autism fears to bypass prescribed elementary vaccines before enrollment.   The American public, it’s leaders  gave  an inch in terms of a common sense approach to vaccination in the past and we are surprised by the fix we are in? And please don’t get me started on our science and math curriculums, we are not and have not lead the world charts. Everything comes home to roost."
2021-08-07 22:14:17,"Indeed, it's high time America joined the rest of the civilized world and opted for single payer healthcare to help lift all boats. There are many permutations of universal healthcare in use around the world, so we don't need to reinvent the wheel.

We have relatives in New Zealand, a very conservative country, and they love their Health Service. Their model is one that might be a good fit for the U.S. I'm not optimistic it will happen anytime soon, but we should keep pushing in that direction."
2021-08-07 20:51:12,"Oh wow. It’s another article from a left-leaning publication scolding the vaccinated for their justified frustration with a group of people whose stubborn ignorance threatens to destroy us all. What an unexpected angle. This enabler mindset, where everything and everyone is blamed except the person guilty of destructive behavior, reeks of just as much dysfunction as the anger the vaccinated are constantly told they shouldn’t feel. According to the writers of these articles, you cannot shame or scold the unvaccinated for willfully endangering people’s lives, but you SHOULD scold and shame the people who are upset by them. We’re like a dysfunctional family constantly making excuses for an abusive family member, admonishing each other for not being understanding enough, for upsetting them, for not giving them enough help. This is ridiculous. At some point you have to start holding people accountable. Time to start mandating vaccines and making life much more difficult for people who choose to act selfishly during this crisis."
2021-08-07 21:25:20,"I am angry at the unvaccinated, the trump supporters who vilified and made death threats against our local public health department, who stormed our state Capitol with weapons to protest measures being considered to protect our health; I’m angry at the Republican law makers who willfully endanger their constituents’ lives to make points with trump voters and who continue to traffic in lies; I’m disgusted with the conspiracy believers and spreaders; snd I’m livid with the insurgents who stormed our national Capitol and tried to disrupt the count.

In my opinion all these people and these issues are connected and worthy of derision."
2021-08-07 19:44:14,"Fine. If the anti-vaxers want to endanger the lives of others, I can accept that. But they should not be allowed on planes, trains, buses, in offices, schools, public buildings, restaurants, bars, churches, businesses, sporting events, political rallies or super spreader motorcycle festivals."
2021-08-07 19:11:43,We have every right to be livid.  First at those spreading disinformation and the stubbornly ignorant who buy inot it at their and our peril. Second at the weak-willed leaders in our corrupted system who allow media disinformation and who refuse to mandate vaccination and quarentine those who refuse. This is about public health. It isn't a political game.
2021-08-07 20:36:37,Actually instead of fury I feel despondent.  What could be more clear cut than choosing a proven vaccine over potentially agonizing death or months of long covid?  Covid’s reality is staring at us in the face and to believe a goofy conspiracy explanation instead is just unexplainable.  How will we ever collectively face more existential threats - climate change- when choices this basic are an issue?
2021-08-07 19:21:46,"CoVID-19 has shown a range of the illness between being mildly sick, to having long haul CoVID with a variety of ailments, to death.  So far, over 600,000 Americans have died from CoVID-19.  Yet, there are, for a variety of reasons, a large number of people who can't, or won't acknowledge the seriousness of the situation.

Pandemics are pretty straightforward, if you get infected, you get sick, you may spread the disease and you may die.  

If the people cannot grasp a serious, very visible, issue like a pandemic where people are getting sick and dying daily, then I see absolutely no hope in people  comprehending Global Warming and taking the actions necessary to insure our survival on this planet."
2021-08-07 18:53:21,"This entire op-ed is useless because it all hinges on the entirely invented theory that ""many unvaccinated people are scared just like us, and that with the right help and information, they would sit down next to nurses and pull up their sleeves.""  They have had 7 months of help and information, and utterly refuse to save themselves, their families, and the societies in which they live (including the unvaccinated who are--for one reason or another--ineligible).  The carrot has failed, and only a stick remains."
2021-08-07 22:19:23,"I was inclined to agree with the sentiments in this article, until I read about the Sturgis gathering and read the interviews reporters did with the attendees."
2021-08-07 20:18:05,"Ms. Smarsh makes many fine points in her easy, speaking to the need for compassion to address individual covid vaccine reluctance.  Unfortunately her arguments are not enough to overcome the inertia of the reluctant.  In particular she fails, like so many others who echo her points, to address the fact that there is a concerted, deliberate strategy being promoted by the Trump party leaders ( I refuse to call them Republicans any more - they aren't but rather a neo-fascist, rascist cult) and their leaders - Trump, DeSantis, Abbott, Johnson, et. al. bear the lion's share of covid vaccine opposition) It's time that we hold these killers, yes killers, accountable as they have contributed to the continuation of this very preventable plague. These so called leaders are leading their followers in a death cult not seen since the ""plague parades"" of medieval times. They should be the focus of our anger, a justified anger just like the anger that defeated Nazism and fascism. You bet I'm angry.  I'm angry that this death cult is exacerbating suffering all for the sake of political power and a political order that will destroy our democracy and the hope that America used to represent. The facts speak for themselves and can't be explained away.  The Trump party is at fault - their leaders and followers.  They deserve the wrath."
2021-08-07 22:20:34,"I would like to urge pragmatism.  Yes, mandates for vaccination as a prerequisite for access to restaurants, concerts and the other pleasures of our old lives would help. But for those who would rather lose their jobs than take the vaccine, we need another approach.  An approach that protects them as a means of protecting the rest of us from them is what we need.  Testing, very frequent testing can catch their infection and hopefully prevent them from infecting others and dying themselves.  We are now proficient at testing and although the question has arisen as who should pay for it, I would insist that it should be free because it is cheaper than the alternative of more mutations and deadlier forms of the virus evolving.  I do not believe there are many left who think the disease is a hoax, there are too many deaths that attest to the reality of Covid. What we need to do is to convince the unvaccinated to protect themselves by knowing if the disease has caught them and then making it easy for them to get the help they need to save their own lives and by extension , ours."
2021-08-07 21:58:16,"I have a brother who insists that he votes Republican because of a single issue: Abortion. Yet he is an anti-masker who once told me that if it saved him a single penny, he wouldn't care if all electricity was generated from the burning of coal. He does make political choices based upon a single issue: Resentment. I'm sure he'd b happier in the America of a hundred years ago. Better make that a hundred and one years ago before women won the right to vote."
2021-08-07 22:07:34,"A sensible article containing this sentence:  ""The Center for Economic and Policy Research found that states with higher rates of insured people generally have higher vaccination rates"". 
MO, a gerrymandered state with a terrible Covid spike now, ignored a plebiscite which passed Medicaid expansion. It took a court to clarify that this vote was NOT optional to the legislature. They still do not have Medicaid expansion. 
Yes, mean and stupid is also a part of the equation."
2021-08-07 22:10:40,"I guess you have to be callous.  The folks that simply refuse to get vaccinated ( mostly Republicans according to the statistics) might get the virus, get hospitalized, go on a ventilator, and possibly die. That’s their choice, so be it, personally I don’t care, but on the way to the Promise  Land, they very well could take a lot of vaccinated people with them, if on the way to the Promise Land, the virus inside them mutates to a new strain, impervious to existing vaccines. That is why mandating vaccines could save a lot of us from dying with them."
2021-08-07 22:21:36,"I want to stop people in traffic to tell them the vaccine was not ""quickly developed."" Kati Kariko, likely to win the Nobel prize this year, spent FORTY years working on mRNA. She was underfunded, not recognized, not promoted, not paid, yet she kept on. She had done all the work for FORTY years to make sure the mRNA vaccine was safe for humans. When covid came along, she was ready--once Chinese scientists released the covid genetic code. The reason other vaccines have not been so quickly developed is that their genetic codes are much more complex than covid."
2021-08-07 22:22:30,Can someone explain how insurance and healthcare costs keep people unvaccinated? The vaccine is free. Hospitalization for Covid is very expensive.Who thinks otherwise?
2021-08-07 22:23:14,"My girl friend who has Parkinson’s and is in her late 70’s needed the vaccine. 

I called a housing project close by to me in Manhattan and asked if they had any openings for the weekend. 

They were completely open I was told - no one had signed up! 

I explained the situation about my friend and asked if she could get vaccinated. I was told no. 

Instead I drove her to￼ Binghamton."
2021-08-07 22:25:53,"The author has written an eloquent and empathetic article but I totally disagree with her conclusions.  Those who are over 12 and choose not to be vaccinated need to be held accountable.  How many millions of dollars have they cost our healthcare system, costs that will certainly be passed on to the rest of us through elevated premiums.  Those who have family members who die from Covid after refusing the vaccine and who have now ""seen the light"" don't particularly engender my sympathy.  However, those who had family members succumb prior to the vaccine have my utmost sympathy. I did not get the vaccine for myself, but for my elderly parents, and the other older Americans who have been socially isolated for over a year.  That is not healthy, and I'm sure increases cognitive decline. Sadly, there seems to be no shortage of stupidity in the world, and we seem to have cornered the market.  Contempt, shaming, you name it, all seem appropriate to hurl at the unvaccinated.  It's far time we stopped focusing on the ""me"", and were more considerate of the ""we"".  Things would be a lot better all around if we started to focus on the public good for a change."
2021-08-07 22:28:35,"I’ve met my fair share of anti-vaxxers and Covid deniers. They all have one thing in common. They believe they have a particular insight and are smarter than everyone else, thinking they see a reality only they are special enough to see. Their sense of identity is to BE an exception and exempt from everyone else. Debunking whatever theory or viewpoint they have leads to doubling down, it doesn’t address the need to be special and have insight that others (sheep) lack. So being wrong kicks them in the core of self-esteem, and they will defend that at all costs. And yes, it often co-exists with defensiveness over a lack of education, or not paying attention. I’ve met anti-vaxxer nurses and even here they think they have special insight as nurses into ""untested"" tech. They don’t let go of that self-esteem because this personality type knows they are broken, they lie on the borderline, narcissistic and anti-social spectrum, even just mildly. They’ve been beat down as kids and beat down as adults. The virus doesn’t care, but they will sit in the ICU denying they have Covid because they can’t be wrong or that fragile thread of special self-esteem breaks. I say we have to let them alone, because they are even more dangerous cornered with their reality."
2021-08-07 22:32:13,"Is it possible that we are incorrectly assessing the risks associated with COVID-19?  An example of a mistake in  risk assessment seems to occur for persons who are afraid to fly in an airplane, but who have no fears about taking a trip in a car. We know that the former is less risky than the latter, so this seems to be a mistake. 
In order to make a rational assessment of COVID  risks we can look for statistics that might inform us.  In Australia for example, we can use numbers available at health.gov.au for the following 4 types of statistics: 
A. since the start of the pandemic,the rate of persons testing positive for COVID has been only 14 cases per 10,000 tests, and deaths have been only 4 per 100,000 tests.
B. Looking at all cause mortality annual rates between 2009 and 2019, it has ranged between a low of 6.3 per thousand persons and a high of 6.8 per thousand. In the first year of the pandemic, 2020, the rate was at the low end at just 6.3 per thousand. 
C. Looking at causes of death in 2020, coronary heart disease caused 10.6% of deaths, prostate cancer 2.2%, accidental falls 1.9%, and COVID caused 0.5% of deaths. Thus, one is at 4 times higher risk of dying from a fall than from COVID. 
D. Between 6/2020 and 6/2021, of those who tested positive for COVID, at most 3% were in the ICU at any time."
2021-08-07 22:38:30,"This column is a good reality check. Over half of unvaccinated adults aren't refusing the vaccine because of ideology--they've simply put it off, some because they haven't had the opportunity, some because of misinformation.

Many Americans don't realize that the vaccines are free, or that you don't need insurance or a prescription from a doctor (which they may not have). We need to broadcast this information on every airwave, in every language. Many undocumented immigrants fear that the vaccines will be used to track and deport them. We need to allay these concerns, especially on Spanish language media.

The federal government needs to institute a program reimbursing employers who give their workers paid time off to get the shot and recover. Too often people can't afford to take even a day off work, so this can be a real obstacle.

And we need mobile vaccine clinics to go into rural areas and neighborhoods without good access to vaccine clinics.

Our vaccination numbers will continue to climb. Eventually, Covid will find the unvaccinated, and we'll achieve herd immunity. Those who refuses the vaccines are just choosing a different route."
2021-08-07 22:38:40,For all the good insights Ms. Smarsh offers. I can’t help wondering how much higher the vaccination rate would be if the CDC had worked to create a perception that Democrats were hoarding the vaccine.
2021-08-07 22:40:53,"Here we go. For four years it was ""Why isn't the left trying harder to understand the Trump voters"", now it's ""Why isn't the vaccinated trying harder to understand the unvaccinated"". 

I live in a Red area in a supposed Blue state that is almost always run by a Red Legislature, and my husband and I are the only Democrats in our respective extended families. We work with mostly Republicans. People can say what they want but at least 80% of the unvaccinated are the Trumpers. Full stop. If people can find a way to get their cigarettes, liquor, fast food, and any other things of life that aren't required to live, they can find a shot."
2021-08-07 22:41:15,"My smoldering, unrelenting rage comes from the unwillingness of those around me to do what needs to be done to protect those who cannot protect themselves, i.e. children under 12 like my son.  He's in more danger now than ever,  because of ""choice and freedom."" 

The same people who oppose masks are usually the same ones who oppose vaccination.  And what,  then,  is left to get us out of this mess? Are any solutions offered? Nope, just more ""choice and freedom"" rhetoric. It is maddening. 

At some point, I may be able to move beyond this.  For now,  as long as there is willful negligence by those who will not get vaccinated and therefore refuse to help me protect my child,  the rage stays."
2021-08-07 22:43:31,"I have attempted to compartmentalize my rage at the refuseniks.

This is how easy it is to get vaccinated now. 

Is this so hard to do? 

And yes, I've been fully vaccinated since January. If a booster is needed this fall, I'll be the first in line. 

Get. Vaccinated!"
2021-08-07 22:46:26,"A fine dissection of anger--its causes and how to profitably direct it at this moment--and totally beside the point.  The non-vaccinated need to be denied access everywhere.  If that means carrying a vaccine passport, so be it.  If they can't go anywhere the non-vaccinated will a) get vaccinated and/or b) remain quarantined.  Have the immune compromised receive their vaccinations as inpatients.  Whatever.  We need to eradicate this virus."
2021-08-07 22:50:54,"What I don't get is that the same people who are afraid of vaccines and refuse to wear masks will support wars to ""defend"" their country from ""enemies"" who live thousands of miles away. Go figure. I think it's time that we framed masks and vaccines as one's patriotic duty the same way we expect our soldiers to blindly march off to war."
2021-08-07 23:02:53,"Would the following policy motivate some of the unvaccinated?Tell them that there is a shot available to them now, but--last chance!--if they don't get the vaccine by the end of the month, it will be sent to a less-developed country.

2021-08-07 23:13:07,"Yes...angry, frustrated, bored, scared...I fear that life as we lived it is no longer possible. 

‘Angry’ because Covid might have been prevented from reaching our shores. Unfortunately, the will of our citizenry and the  leadership necessary to make intelligent, critical decisions was, and remains, absent or suppressed.  

‘Frustrated’ because despite our current vaccination and masking protocols, the virus shows no sign of backing off.  Rather, it’s mutating and spreading.

‘Bored’ because we can no longer engage in many of the spontaneous activities that brought us joy:  dinners with friends, travel, casual conversations with neighbors and colleagues, public events and holiday celebrations.

‘Scared’ because the virus remains a deadly threat to our health and well-being.  We do everything we can to protect ourselves, but there are no guarantees.

‘Sad’ because time is on the wing and we’ll never get it back. 
(Not to mention that I may never see my elderly mother again, who lives 2000 miles away).  

We carry on, as we must.  But without joy and confidence in the future..."

2021-08-07 23:36:19,"I appreciate this helpful article.  It keeps my head straight in these awful times.  The coronavirus has become conflated with combative politics and underlying social disparities.  The result is slow uptake in vaccinations that hurts us all - and we all know it, let it happen, and are all liable.  Most frustrating for me is our collective failure to implement policies and programs that we know prevent infection.  Our individual rancor expresses frustration over our collective incapacity.  We know better!  Lets face down the rancor to build up our collective capacity at least to help our community stay healthy.  Biden is on the right track; bi-partisanship will restore both our health and our economy."
2021-08-07 23:38:00,"This is an excellent article, with good advice that should be taken seriously.

Maybe the free market will work in our favor for a change."
2021-08-07 23:45:06,"I cannot say I am angry at the unvaccinated. If we were all rational human beings, we probably wouldn't need prisons and wouldn't engage in warfare.

Governments should not mandate vaccines or masks. 

Both are reasonable, true statements. 

Unfortunately, those on the left want the government to force vaccines and masks, while those on the right don’t take the virus seriously and speak out against masks and vaccines. 

A reasonable middle ground would seem to be that businesses should take the virus seriously, require employees to be vaccinated, and require customers/vendors to wear masks when on the premises and/or interacting with employees."

2021-08-08 00:06:01,"My first grandchild was born eight weeks ago (parents fully vaxxed), a continent away. I waited until the new family -- having nested and overcome nursling woes, and careful of their own contacts -- felt ready to welcome me, who would stay several days.

Yet in considering the effects of the delta variant (not to mention the new variant mutations brewing in the bodies of the unvaxxed, who are, at this point, walking Petri dishes), and how many strangers I would have to be in contact with in getting from one coast to another, I called my daughter, the new mum. 

We talked. And I decided to postpone my visit and be content with texts and Zoom.

It's not like I could simply hop in a car with food, drive a day, and reach the Pacific coast, having contact with very few people on the way.

My grandchild might be walking -- even talking! -- by the time I get to hold that new, wonderful little human. That's okay.

Because the thought of importing infection into that house brought tears to my eyes. 

And all because so many people in the US remain unvaccinated."
2021-08-08 00:06:26,"I am honestly beginning to believe that people who choose not to be vaccinated should not receive any government stimulus payments and should have to pay the costs of their own testing and treatment.  I am excluding from this any person who is unable to be vaccinated for legitimate medical reasons, but not any religious claims.  Don't the Ten Commandments say ""Thou shalt not kill?""  What gives these people the right to spew their germs amongst the rest of us?  

Someone I know peripherally and stopped communicating with because of their unremittingly anti-vaccine viewpoints, about which they were vocal and dismissive of all other viewpoints, died last week of COVID.  As they approached their deathbed, they begged for a vaccine.  It was too late.  This is not the first story like this I have heard.  Although I would love nothing more than to have to work from home for the rest of my career, I also wish that people would just get the vaccine!"
2021-08-08 00:16:59,"I appreciate your words of kindness and wisdom. 
However…
Trump politicized Covid early on and didn’t give us the facts. 
By the time he was through with the American psyche, the people who supported him viewed those of us who wanted masks and vaccines as the enemy. 
We couldn’t win and still can’t. 
I made an effort to read about the vaccines before they became available. 
After my research, I wanted Moderna and I was fortunate to get two doses of it. 
And I finally realized a few weeks ago that people are not interested in learning about Covid or vaccines. 
They are still dragging Trump around like a dirty diaper. 
So, until they make “a change” I think the Trump unvaccinated are in for illness and death. 
Others who are unvaccinated must decide which to fear most: Covid or the vaccine. 
But soon our federal government will mandate vaccinations because our hospitals are overwhelmed now. It will become a necessity. 
Last time this happened we didn’t have an answer…vaccinations. 
This time we do."
2021-08-08 00:17:14,"I am eternally grateful to have been an American, by luck of birth and nothing more, and got the vaccine so early.  One percent of people in Africa have been vaccinated.  I'll have a booster, I'm sure, before many in Africa or S. America.  Just by luck of birth, nothing more.

So I have accepted that all on this planet will live with Covid.  For us lucky ones, we will get our booster and try not to worry about the variants that surely will pop up here and there from now until forever.  Even if people in America were all vaccinated - and that is never going to be achieved - the rest of the world will lag and so we will never be free of it completely.

I'm grateful to the scientists who have been working on this new method of vaccine for a long time and so we lucky Americans only had to spend a year avoiding the disease.

I hope we get the rest of the world vaccinated, so they all can feel the relief I feel."
2021-08-08 00:20:48,"Hey, I'm honest about the unvaccinated.  

Let 'em die.  Nothing will persuade the 25% who still refuse despite all the correct information about the virus that is easily available everywhere.  Don't waste time even trying.  It is pointless.  

But how about the unvaccinated who are not yet infected or dead?  What should the government do with them?  

Don't bother with mandates.  The unvaccinated will just ignore them.  

So, ostracize them from the rest of society.  They pose a direct threat to the life and safety of everyone.  They can spread the Delta Variant to the unvaccinated--especially unvaccinated children under 12, who can then pass the virus along to the elderly unvaccinated and the allergic unvaccinated.  They can spread the Delta Variant to the vaccinated--causing rare breakthrough cases.  They can breed new variants of the vaccine.  

Exclude the unvaccinated from all airplane flights, subways, trains and buses.  Exclude the unvaccinated from all public gatherings--such as concerts, theaters, sport events, playgrounds.   Exclude the unvaccinated from working in any public health service or governments.  Exclude them from teaching in any public school.  

And finally, give a $1000 tax credit to everyone who has been fully vaccinated.

And that's just for starters.

It is the responsibility of the federal government and every state government to protect vaccinated citizens from these dangerous unvaccinated resister."
2021-08-08 00:27:00,"This piece began as thoughtful and introspective, but you lost me when you veered into the lazy red v. blue trope, It's not that simple at all. Even in a bright blue state/city with high vacc rates, we struggle with family, friends, co-workers who refuse the vaccine. 

They can't explain why. We're supposed to ""listen"" and accommodate them--which essentially means agreeing to a prolonged pandemic that risks more lives. No more. We tried. The time for accommodation is over. If they want to quarantine indefinitely let them. The risks--health, job, etc--should be borne by those who refuse to be part of the solution."

Not necessarily. Failure to vaccinate against the Delta variant spawn a new variant against which the fully-vaccinated are helpless.

I never met a variant that was as dumb as a human being.

So, vaccinate, and quick."
2021-08-08 00:12:20,"The issue with a fair number of these anti-vaxxers is that NO reason is EVER going to be good enough for them, even if you talk until you’re blue in the face.  So really, why bother? They are so-called “adults” , and they have made their choices - let them live (or die) as a result of those choices.  I just wish there was some way to keep them segregated, so they are only a danger to each other.  Politically correct? I doubt it, but we’re talking life and death here."
2021-08-08 00:39:36,"Not feeling a rage. Feeling a peace that I cannot explain.

Those that choose not to receive the vaccine will need and learn to deal with whatever the future has in store for them.

If their insurance will not cover them, they have made that choice. If they are not allowed to participate fully in everything that society has and will offer, such as shows or eating out, they have made that choice.

There is no benefit to me and those I love in getting angry or full of rage with those that do not vaccine. 

The unvaccinated will simply be groups of people that we will need to avoid and walk away from for our own sakes. And at all costs. They have made their choice and we should respect that, as much as I do not agree with them."

The dead zombies will have to be burnt to prevent further spread of the zombie virus, resulting in an apocalypse accompanied by a global warming catastrophe, which will complicate matters severely.

In addition to also fighting the mandates at their facilities.

For the life of me, I can't fathom their refusal. They saw and see first hand the devastation of not being vaccinated.

I was in healthcare and it was mandatory to have all our vaccines... flu, polio, smallpox, etc.

2021-08-08 00:55:07,"The vast majority of of my extended family members, scattered throughout the country from Massachusetts to Florida to Michigan and many places in between, refuse to get vaccinated. We are a largely white and working class family done good. Today, we are middle to upper middle class. Many folks have a college education. We all have health insurance, and we all have access to vaccinations, which of course are free and available 7 days a week. 

The reasons most of my family members refuse to get vaccinated fall into: Distrust of the government; distrust of pharmaceutical companies; a belief that the virus has been overblown in the media; a variety of conspiracy theories; and a fundamental belief that homeopathic “remedies” ie supplements and acupuncture and bone broth will keep them safe. Most family members hold a number of these delusions. 

I’ve tried to listen to their concerns and share my experiences and encourage them to get the shot, as have others, since the vaccine was made available. Not one person has budged, and many have cut me out of their lives entirely. 

I have since backed off and tried to prepare myself emotionally for a lot of death, as many are older and/or have health issues and live in hotspots like it’s 2019. Freedom! I have a lot of anger, a lot, but I also have a lot of grief. A lot of people I love will likely die."

2021-08-08 01:01:26,"Great sharing of an often unheard perspective! I too am angered by those who went unmasked and now unvaccinated but I also dislike the oversimplification by some of those who have been observing safe procedures.

The demonization and name calling may help people unwind but it is counterproductive to addressing the problem. Liberalism by its nature implies tolerance. Many people who consider themselves as such are behaving in a very illiberal manner.

Even worse than accomplishing nothing with their degrading banter is they are proving every Ring Wing pundit and politician correct in their propagation of the proposal that the ""Libs"" hate""real Americans"" as they believe themselves to be.

Of course these people for the most part are wrong and poorly informed although as mentioned here many have extenuating circumstances. Stop making the problem worse by creating even deeper divisions than already exist.

Back off the name calling! They still are our countrymen if not our friends. We will all have to pick up the pieces at some point in the future. I would rather it be sooner rather than later."
2021-08-08 00:38:16,"No.

Every single person who is unvaccinated (other than those who can't get vaccinated based upon age or infirmity) is choosing to place the lives of others at risk.

If I argued, ""don't be mad at people who drive drunk - they're scared of not having their car to drive to work in the morning,"" would the NYTimes run an opinion piece demanding understanding?

If I argued, ""don't just people who shoot guns in the air on New Year's Eve - they don't realize the bullets will fall to the ground and perhaps kill somebody,"" would the NYTimes run an opinion piece telling us that anger is misplaced?

If I argued, ""HIV positive people have a right to have unprotected sex with people who don't know they're infected - they don't realize how contagious it is,"" would the NYTimes run an opinion piece telling me we all need to be more understanding?

If I argued, in any other way shape or form, that people who voluntarily put the lives of hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands (because that's how viruses spread, exponentially) of others' lives at risk, would the NYTimes give column inches to the defense of the indefensible?

Of course not.

Bar them from public places. Bar them from work. Raise their insurance rates to reflect the cost of treating them. Jail them for not wearing masks. Brand their foreheads with a warning to the rest of us. Do whatever it takes to force them to get vaccinated or remove them from society. 

But do not forgive or understand them. They don't deserve it."
2021-08-08 01:13:37,"The anger that the vaccinated majority feel toward the vaccine-refusers for preventing us  from being able to return to normal life is legitimate and should be expressed in powerful negative ad campaigns that should be going on right now against the Republican political leaders who've defended the vaccine refusers. The Republican brand should be indelibly tied in voters' minds to the refusal of the Republican base to get vaccinated and the lost opportunity to return to normal life that all of us have suffered as a result of that refusal.

The anger of the vaccinated should be channeled into well-focused outrage at the Trump-controlled Republican Party that fueled vaccine rejection and let the Delta variant spread. The Republicans sabotaged our recovery from COVID.

For that, there is justified anger and it should be channeled into political mobilization to hold Republicans accountable for their sabotage in the unfolding campaigns that will determine who controls Congress after 2022."

2021-08-07 23:17:38,"I know, I will be stoned and quartered for saying this, but if you really do understand virology and immunology, you would - some would say 'perversely' - thank the unvaccinated for doing us  a favor.

The mRNA vaccines, as good as they are, cannot protect us from infection.  They can only blunt it.  Lasting immunity can only arise from living through a mitigated infection.

As long as our antibody titers are high, we, the vaccinated, have little to worry about.  When we get infected, we will live through a mild version of the disease and then develop the robust cellular immunity the vaccines by design cannot confer.  That will then protect us for years to come, as this virus will become endemic.

Unfortunately, we also know with near certainty that the neutralizing antibody titers will progressively decrease and reach zero after about 1-2 years (we know this from early studies on the SARS spike protein).  

At that point, we will be sitting ducks again, only minimally protected by the spike restricted T-cell immunity conferred by the vaccine.  Only an early booster can save us then.

I personally am taking any opportunity now to deliberately expose myself to the virus, as long as my antibody titers are still high, so that I can acquire the robust and comprehensive T-cell immunity that I need to fend of new variants of the virus in the future.

Again, don't stone me for this comment, think it through.

Your life may depend on it."
2021-08-08 01:20:52,"The shots are free. You don’t need health insurance to get them. So that argument for not getting vaccinated is void.

What needs to be said is this: if you refuse the vaccine and then get sick and hospitalized (highly likely with Delta) you will THEN need some very good health insurance or face many thousands of dollars in medical bills.

Common sense, folks. That free shot seems like a very good deal! That should be the message."

Suspicion and recalcitrance are deeply imbedded in the American psyche. Malevolent politicians gain and retain power by stoking these vulnerabilities of their constituents. 

Today, the Republican governor of Florida seeks to prevent communities stricken by the Delta variant of the Covid virus from practicing simple protective measures like masking and social distancing. Young people and children are particularly at risk.

Trump helped to sharpen this attack that can be described here as ""I'm not the cruel one for being unvaccinated; you're the cruel one for saying I'm the unvaccinated problem""

Simply stated, there is NO reason for ANY person to not get vaccinated other than a doctor saying so.

All the usual equity nonsense does not apply here.  The vaccine is free, widely available, incentivized.  They'll even being it to your door.

Do you take time off from work to shop for food?  Then you don't need time off from work to get a vaccine.  You can get it at a Safeway or Kroger without appointment.

The biggest mistake was when fully vaxxed people put their masks back on.  Like last year, that returned control to the deniers.

Fully vaxxed people have a .1% positivity rate.   A .004% hospital rate and a .001% death rate.  A FV person is one eighth as likely to even get sick as an UV person.  A group of FV people are as safe as can be expected.

What about transmission?  Yeah, what about it?  That's THEIR problem.  Let THEM wear the mask.  Per CDC guidelines.

And then I know they and I will enjoy going back and forth between in class learning and on line learning, every time there is an outbreak. Last year practically crushed all of us in education. As well as hurting kids. The solution was and is vaccines. Yet, because of Twitter and Facebook and Instagram misinformation, lots and lots of people are STILL not vaccinated. And Delta variant cases of covid keep rising. Oh, and have I mentioned Sturgis and the MN state fair and giant concerts are coming up where lots of the unvaccinated will be unmasked. Of course. Their freedom, etc. My freedom to teach normally, to stop fearing that I will infect a family member with cancer or my elderly parents or my new grandson, that freedom, is gone because these people won't get vaccinated, won't wear a mask, won't stop mingling, and then they are mystified when one of their own gets sick or dies.

- Yet, they shrugged off the American attitude and refuseniks. That is just how Americans are.

Rational people with no money or insurance should be first in line because what do they think they’re going to do if they get in the hospital with COVID. 

Besides, people don’t cite lack of insurance or funds hardly ever in  “explaining” their resistance. It’s all drivel from the internet. 

Clearly we have a bunch of people who can’t think their way out of a paper bag. To what extent they’re responsible for that, I am not sure.

“Never mind that, per the C.D.C., the daily case rates in urban and nonmetropolitan areas closely track one another.”

Unless you’re talking about per capita positive tests, this statistic is more horrifying than the mistruth you’re attempting to dispel. You’re telling me daily cases in major metropolitan areas track closely with non-metropolitan areas which are a fraction of the size? Nearly all of Wyoming could test positive and they’d still amount to a fragment of NYC.

I kept track for 5 recent consecutive shifts that the vaccine was available.  If it wasn't for the risk to others, and that it goes against everything I believe in, I would throw up my hands and say let the Darwin effect take over.  So I keep trying because even 1/10 is better than 0/10"

One thing not mentioned in it, however, that continues to greatly puzzle me is why uninsured people would not take advantage of the covid vaccination offered at no cost. (I gather many are not aware of this fact but  don’t understand how it has not been widely and repeatedly broadcasted via all the means available). Anyone who is not insured, remains unvaccinated and catches covid is courting financial ruin from hospitalization costs, should they manage to survive this terrible disease."
2021-08-08 01:57:33,"Sarah Smarsh is a fine writer, a person of empathy and nuance.  But her research indicates the primary differentiating factor:  education.  When did the United States lose its respect for learning and for expertise?  How has a significant portion of the population determined that experts are trying to scam the populace, or that people of expertise are really no better positioned to provide valuable information than anyone else? The source of this ""anti-elitism"" has been the inculcation of relativism within the educational process, a bleeding of appropriate revisionist practices in the social sciences to the hard sciences, where the inclusion of multiple perspectives and sources of information is not pedagogically appropriate.  Science is not social science.  Vaccine success is not a matter of opinion, but neither should they be viewed as 100% effective.  There are no guarantees, but there are positions and concomitant actions that are based on a preponderance of data and analysis.  Too many people no longer understand these concepts.  So the virus, agnostic and obeying a strictly survivalist logic that we continue to study, pushes on, taking advantage of an organism, human beings, who have willfully diminished their key asset, intelligence.  Widespread premature and unnecessary human deaths are the inevitable result."

It ought to be a crime to publicly disseminate information that is known to be false and which taken as “truth” will likely cause harm. Enough! (yup, I’m still angry)"

No feeling for burnout healthcare workers.  My neighbors have two little boys who struggled with virtual school, but they're terrified to send them back to in-person classes.  I'm furious about their fear, and there's nothing I can do to help.  All these creeps going to Sturgis, egged on by a governor.  And the people who keep supporting governors like DeSantis and Abbott, who are doing everything possible to help it spread.  I don't buy a sports car and drive 100 because it's not safe for anyone.

We didn't take the threat seriously enough, and it cost us dearly.

We had the advantage of being first in line to have access to highly effective vaccines in early 2021. And we squandered that by not getting enough people vaccinated early enough to control the spread. We haven't learned much from over 600K Americans dead.

Louisiana and Florida are on fire right now. It is hard to see that other parts of the country are really doing things better enough than we have. Pessimistically, I would tell the rest of the country, ""What you are now, we used to be. What we are now, you will be."""

Your analysis of ""metropolitan vs non-metropolitan"" misses these huge, somewhat predictable political drivers.   Sure, the people making these bad decisons about vaccination are misinformed, and it's perhaps not their fault.  But many of these are the same people who believe, incorrectly, that the election was stolen.  Many of these people are the same people who believe, incorrectly, that climate change is a hoax.  The source of the disinformation (not misinformation) that is fed to them is Fox ""news"" and the other right wing media.  This is all orchestrated to feed their outrage, and to hold together a coalition that will vote for low taxes for the uber-wealthy, at the expensive of any sensible policies that might actually make this a great country, someday, again.   My outrage is channelled into political action to dismantle this dangerous ""right wing media"" ecosystem, and what it stands for.  That is how we should all be processing our outrage.

2021-08-08 00:46:27,"Here is a thought on what to do with the rage at the unvaccinated, how about we learn from the Republican playbook that uses white rage at increasing minority populations to win elections by vilifying Democrats as somehow responsible.  The thinly veiled racism has served them well for the last 30 years.

Democrats need to make the belligerent unvaccinated, who are largely conservative and Republicans, the focus of all the Covid rage for the next election.  Tie every Republican candidate to the death we see and despair we all feel.  Its a lot closer to the truth of who is responsible for our inability to get Covid under control than the right's specious arguments that communist Democrats are the source of all evil related to minorities.

Unfortunately, many if not most Democratic officials continue to bring their knife to the gun fight, and refuse to lower themselves to Republican levels, even to keep their office.  We may not be as brazen at channeling public anger, but I still think it will be a major factor in the next election if red states continue to have carnage while blue states recover."

2021-08-08 01:08:15,"I haven’t read your memoir of “working hard and being broke in the richest country on earth” but I did spend time during the early 70’s in Kansas. One year the farmers had harvested their wheat and sold to the granaries for barely enough profit to stay in business. Suddenly, a major wheat deal was made by the Nixon administration with Russia. Of course, the large granaries made enormous profits.  Big business crushes the “hard working” who eventually do go broke and sell their land in the richest country on earth. But that applies to health care as well.

You mention many reasons why people have not been vaccinated. Health care is a primary reason. There is the “some 22 percent” who haven’t gotten vaccinated ""because of concerns about cost, safety or systems that previously did them wrong.” Next, you note that “liberal women and men who have delayed for fear of the for-profit health care industry.” Again, “when the highly contagious Delta variant was taking hold, uninsured Americans had the lowest vaccination rate of 22 subgroups examined by Kaiser.” “…The health care system is better known to the uninsured as a crippling source of debt than a helpful provider of cures.” 

The only industrialized nation with a for profit health care system. The refusal to be vaccinated is about people’s stubbornness and conspiracy theories but more about our failure as a nation to provide a health care system people trust and won’t lead to being broke."

2021-08-08 02:54:29,"""Most importantly, we can direct our rage not at lost individuals but at systems of power""

While there are rare exceptions, the large majority of people who are refusing to get a vaccine are doing so only because they have worked extraordinarily hard to stay ignorant, to cut themselves off from all credible sources of information, and to blind themselves to what is going on right in front of their eyes. 

No ""system of power"" is responsible for that - that is simply individuals making astonishingly poor choices.  And because those particular poor choices are directly affecting our ability to get out of this pandemic, we need to apply as much pressure as we possibly can to force them into compliance.

It will indeed consume us if unchecked, and in destroying others- we destroy ourselves. Distinguishing it, is the first step towards transforming it.

I am exhausted by the willful ignorance and selfishness of my fellow Americans. To your point, ignorance is the petri dish of fear.  There are many, many places people who are willing to look for useful information can find it. I'm not angry at people who cannot help themselves - children, elderly and those with legitimate health concerns; My anger is toward those who choose to be willfully ignorant; who choose to follow debunked FB misinformation, rather than the CDC website or even Google.

I agree... the problem isn't so much rural vs. urban, white or black.  Americans are more separated by socioeconomic class than any other barrier - and education is the transom for upward movement.

After affordable healthcare for all, the critical issue in this country is to fix a broken education system.

With greater access for all to higher education, we will be a better country.  Today, our fellow Americans who
lack critical thinking, information discernment and knowledge are needlessly dying - and killing their fellow citizens.

And kids under 12 don't need that protection to this extend. There are far more dangerous viruses for them out there that we don't care anything about, such as RSV. 
So please let everybody be. It's their choice and problem. We all want to live in a free society. 
And now that it's even apparent that transmission doesn't stop with the vaccinated people, the argument for the common cause falls flat as well.
Same with the cost of treatment. If someone wishes to eat that 3rd or 10th donut then that's none of my business, even though heart disease kills way more people each year than COVID. 
It's like the vaccinated people are at their most anxious and angry now that they are protected and could relax.

... but, hate to burst your bubble, it won't work.

I have a relative, highly educated, works in healthcare for nearly 40 years, at a Level 1(?) (the highest) Trauma center/hospital in our area, who absolutely will NOT get the vaccine and will very likely be seeking other employment now that the institution has put out a vaxx mandate by late Fall.  

It is, at minimum, a 2-or 3-part reason, and I will grant you, the first part of your paragraph does apply: she is scared. Of the vaccine. Of many vaccines. Sees too many people with seriously debilitating health consequences -- GBS, MS, strokes, blood clots, neuro damages -- from vaccines show up in her facility each and every day. 

Now, I could point out, she doesn't see the multiple tens, or hundred million+ who DON'T have significant and serious health issues afterward.

But that doesn't resonate. She sees what she sees, and in her life, for herself, and in her sphere, she feels better off without it. 

We differ and we disagree -- I am vexed and couldn't wait to get it -- but no amount of 'the right help and information' will budge her.

And in healthcare, she is not alone."

It is unpleasant but then several aspects of the human condition are. They coexist."
2021-08-08 03:05:08,"Yesterday I gave blood at a Red Cross drive. I chose to keep my mask on, commenting that I didn’t want to take chances with the Delta variant. The nurse complained that she found masks uncomfortable to breathe through, and I did notice that she didn’t have hers adjusted correctly around her nose. We continued to chat as she started the blood draw process, and a few minutes later she mumbled something I didn’t quite hear, then said, “after all, I don’t have any of the risk factors. But I could be wrong.” From her attitude and subsequent comments, I suspected that she had just admitted she was unvaccinated. What was I supposed to do at that point? I was hooked up to an IV. It hadn’t occurred to me that I needed to ask for a nurse who had been vaccinated in our area!

I didn’t start an argument. I finished the donation process and left without waiting the usual 15 minutes, trusting my husband to monitor my health. I’m not eager to donate again unless I can confirm in advance that the Red Cross is requiring all staff to be vaccinated.

A nurse should know that any future killer variant —possibly one able to cause a fatal infection in a vaccinated person—will most likely emerge from an unvaccinated infection. Some people in the world don’t have the opportunity to be vaccinated yet, and that’s all the more reason for everyone who can get vaccinated to do so ASAP.

2021-08-08 03:36:40,"Sure, get vaccinated. But more importantly, wear a mask! That isn’t too much to ask. Wear a mask even if you are vaccinated since you can still catch the delta variant, and wearing the mask helps prevent you from getting the virus then transmitting it to someone else. Doing so saves lives. It helps the economy by allowing businesses to operate uninterrupted."
2021-08-08 03:38:20,"When our local paper runs articles about vaccination, I notice the same argument being made repeatedly in the comments section. ""Why should I take an experimental vaccine for a disease that at my age I have a fraction of a percent chance of dying from?"" (The vaccine is not, in fact, experimental. But presumably the commenters are concerned about potential long term effects that may not yet be known. ) 

To be honest, I haven't seen strong public health messaging that responds directly to that skepticism. Media reports are full of anecdotal stories of severe and fatal COVID cases, but the commenters see these cases as outliers that are disproportionately featured as a scare tactic. Public health officials often speak in absolute numbers, e.g., ""100,000 cases a day,"" but this doesn't impress the skeptical, since they believe that most cases in healthy people under 40 will fare no worse than if they had the flu. ""For the public good"" doesn't impress them, since they believe that more vulnerable people should protect themselves rather than expect others to take a vaccine with unknown long-term effects.  Potential for ongoing mutation into to more dangerous variants seems too speculative a concern to overcome their objections. 

Messaging needs to successfully address what many vaccine skeptics believe to be a rational individual risk/benefit assessment. All the rage in the world isn't going to do any good."

The country  will admit people who have been fully vaccinated and who have passed a standard (not rapid) RPC test no more than 72 hours before entering the country.

I think that one of the objectives is to send a positive message to Canadians about light at the end of the tunnel. Canada's is introducing measures to address what it believes will be a fourth wave this fall. I think that opening the border is intended, in part, to balance those measures. Canada's top health official thinks that more cases are coming, but that opening the border is manageable despite that.

So far, Canada has done a remarkable job of managing the pandemic compared other countries Europe and the rest of this hemisphere. It's going to be interesting to see whether it's calling this right."

It feels like ambition, it drives people onward. It focuses and narrows and targets, it deflects from becoming aware of self. 
It feels big, it feels important. 
Righteous anger.  It feels so good. 
It is addictive.  People don’t want it to subside, it takes over, it becomes chronic, people go searching for something to be angry about. 
I’ve seen this happening to old friends, to family, and all I can do is be careful of my own emotional health."
2021-08-08 04:45:16,"Aside from being a direct in-the-moment threat to society, the unvaccinated pose a threat which will most likely manifest itself months from now, in that each infected body is a potential manufacturing center for mutated forms of the virus.  It's only a matter of time before a series of mutations give rise to a highly contagious, vaccine-resistant strain.  Then we're back to square one, waiting for a new vaccine to be developed, mass-produced, and distributed around the country.  Except the difference will be that no one will be willing or financially capable of another lockdown, so the virus will spread exponentially and completely crash our healthcare system, and economy."
2021-08-08 04:52:08,"Here’s the thing - when you go through a traumatic experience - you find that things somehow get divided up in your brain into a “before” and an “after.” It’s sometimes hard to wrap your brain around that you actually lived through that traumatic experience. The photos from your “before” seem so innocent in a sense.  But really, imo, just our brains trying to make sense of everything. Having been through more than my fair share of traumatic experiences, even before COVID, I had some idea of how things would feel, and I can say emphatically that I am definitely not the same person I was before those traumas so I also expect changes because of COVID. I do get where you’re coming from. Sometimes it seems all too surreal. And I do think that right now we’re all suffering from a collective trauma."
2021-08-08 04:58:33,"Look.

I appreciate the effort. I don't appreciate the smoothing over of certain facts.

Such as:

There is a direct, clear correlation between the percentage of people in a county who voted for Trump and the rate of vaccine refusal in that county. Yes, there are white city folks who voted for him -- but as we all know, it wasn't city folk who elected him. Why paper this over?

Also, my goodness ... yes, lack of access to healthcare is enormously important in this discussion. But why are there still so many people uninsured all these years after the ACA became law? One factor is that many ""red"" states have still refused the Medicaid expansion that would have covered so many poor Americans, both rural and urban. TX and FL, we're looking at you. It's fine to point out that people don't trust healthcare because they've been left out of the system, but come on. There's a reason they've been left out, and it's their own state governments.

It's not bashing or patronizing people to point out facts. The frustration of watching this mess unfold when it is 100% completely manageable is driving a lot of us crazy. 

Which, as the writer points out, does not help. My own anger, for what it's worth, is aimed square at right wing media and the social platforms that spew misinformation 24/7. They know better."
2021-08-08 05:22:54,"""Remember how you felt last spring, at a city stadium or a suburban pharmacy or a rural community building, when you got a shot. How will you remember its blessing? What will you do with the life that it saved?""

Thank you for that. I do remember the relief I felt when I received my second shot. Hallelujah!

Now, gotta do something worthwhile."
2021-08-08 05:25:08,beautifully written and empathetic. i too am frustrated with the unvaccinated but I’d rather live a life of joyous gratitude than spew anger and bitterness towards those who choices about their bodies i cannot control
2021-08-08 05:26:21,"Objectively, I agree with the author of this opinion essay. But the thing is that in my own personal experience, the unvaccinated people whom I know or know of do not fit into any of the categories in the essay -- not economically or educationally disadvantaged, not without insurance. In fact, I know some highly educated individuals -- people who generally eschew conspiracy theories and who are decidedly not supporters of the former president -- who have, for reasons of their own, embraced one of more conspiracy theories, hoaxes, or myths about the vaccines, and indeed about the virus itself, their chances of contracting it, especially delta, their chances of getting it and being the source of more and possibly more dangerous variants, and their responsibility to their community and to the larger world. And beyond these formerly reasonable and rational people, there is in my community -- in a blue state, mind you -- a small but significant and very loud group of hardcore antivaxxers, who have been such for years, but have now may have found their way into the psyches of those beyond their echo chamber. So, while I know that socioeconomic disadvantage plays a role in the vaccine-hesitant, I am just not seeing it personally in my area, where our health dept. goes all out to bring the vaccines to people where they are and every single pharmacy and supermarket have ample supply of vaccines for walk-ins, no appointment necessary anymore."
2021-08-08 05:26:35,"I am an ex-pat living in Bangkok. I have been here since 2010 because of my years in Baghdad, Kabul, and Pakistan in the War on Terror. I made an appointment for an Astra Zeneca shot on 11 July and get to receive it tomorrow. This pandemic has reinforced the righteousness of my decision to never live there again."
2021-08-08 05:30:44,"I found myself really relating to this article, right up to the part where she said that we are stereotyping people who live in rural areas as being vaccine-reluctant and/or anti-vax. That isn't true. They are everywhere. All you need to do is look at the COVID case map to see that."
2021-08-08 05:32:31,"I needed to read this column, despite feeling the chastisement. I  have also been binging on my righteous indignation, a psychic doughnut devoid of nutrition. I don't know what to do with the anger, the resentment, but I feel its  corrosive effects, and deep down I know that I am deceived. At some point, (hopefully SOON) I hope to see through this parable, and remember that the things we discuss at Seder."
2021-08-08 05:37:15,"This pandemic has left me an orphan. Rage, utter sorrow, and a slow resignation are my bitter pills. I have many “blessings” and strive to honor and do justice to the wonderful people still in my life and the legacies of what’s been lost."
2021-08-08 05:48:54,"Wonderful article, full of empathy. What I am wondering is the competition between the elected leaders of Texas and Florida based on an inability to understand basic public health concepts or an a strangely abstract and disassociate form of cruelty?"
2021-08-08 05:51:57,"“Their education status keeps their income low, and income predicts insurance status. When the highly contagious Delta variant was taking hold, uninsured Americans had the lowest vaccination rate of 22 subgroups examined by Kaiser.”

The vaccines are free. Hospital stays are not. 

More outreach. Time to buy ads on a certain network."
2021-08-08 05:52:55,"Wonderful thoughtful piece, thank you for writing it. The NYTimes should hire you to provide ongoing perspective on rural America, of which few writers here seem to truly understand, and when they come close, they lack the intimacy (it’s clinical, academic…), the compassion, the humor, the insight, all of which cannot be learned in books, lecture halls, documentaries, but only from experience."
2021-08-08 05:57:07,"If covid had started 3 months ago, and the vaccines introduced yesterday or even last week this author might have a point, as would the skeptics.

But we've had covid for about 19 months now, and the vaccines were introduced in January.  The folks who could get the vaccines but have not -- the ones with time, money and health -- have no good reason in the world to still put it off. There's an article elsewhere in this paper about right wing militias who are even allying with anti-vaxers to form a well-armed death cult.

So this author's plea for the rest of us to be understanding, to be patient, to be careful, is just silly.  We've tried that since January, it hasn't worked.

Those people need to be beat over the head with it.  They need to be compelled, they need to be charged extra (a LOT extra) for medical insurance and/or care, and they need -- if it comes to that -- to be allowed to face the fatal consequences of their choices in favor of saving those who actually want to try to survive."
2021-08-08 05:59:31,"If someone has not gotten vaccinated so far, it is impossible to reason with the person. Only force works with unreasonable people. I support mandating COVID vaccines."
2021-08-08 06:00:52,"This is a magnificent observation: ""If we do not understand the problem, our feelings [of indignation] are untethered from reality. Untethered anger tends to be unproductive and selfish, delighting our own egos rather than directing us toward necessary action.""

There is plenty of real, credible information about our society's defects which merit our getting angry. But let's hold off, when we don't really know what's going on. A doctrine distilled from the Platonist/Aristotelian tradition says, All suggestions that anyone stands in radical opposition to anyone else are dangerous illusions; in essence, we are all on the same side."
2021-08-08 06:02:26,"Try being diagnosed with a terminal illness that is not covid and could potentially have been caught earlier by a screening if we hadn’t all been told to avoid all doctors for over a year. There are many ways to die that are not covid buy nobody cares. You simply cannot pause life. You might never unpause. I’m a lifelong Democrat and I got the vaccine but I am more angry at the intense calls for more endless pointless lockdowns with no endgame. That is not a way to live. Not to mention, everyone who seems to want to stay locked up in their homes expects other people to bring them groceries and Amazon packages. I just can’t with this anymore."
2021-08-08 06:12:39,"This is a most timely essay. As someone with a role in fighting this pandemic I have had some interesting conversations of late. Yes there are those who’ve gone down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories but more often I have encountered individuals who need information and time to speak with their doctor or pastor. They need to know that the vaccine is free, that we don’t require documentation, that we will come to their home if there is any barrier whatsoever in their getting to a vaccination clinic. Because I get one on one time with folks I also get the reminder that it isn’t an us vs. them. Sure, I get frustrated and angry but blaming doesn’t keep people alive. Come next week I’ll be back knocking on doors, meeting folks where they’re at and as our conversations range into all sorts of topics I will continue to circle back around as to why they should get vaccinated."
2021-08-08 06:49:26,"My best hope at this point is that the full FDA approval for the Pfizer vaccine next month (hopefully with more vaccine approvals to follow), combined with the Delta surge, will be enough of a face-saving excuse to allow many of the vaccine-resistant to change their minds without having to admit that they were wrong.

I don’t care about being “right.” I just want to be able to buy groceries without having to constantly monitor for people who won’t wear masks, get a vaccine, or give me space.

I would love to be able to stop wasting emotional energy on this."
2021-08-08 06:54:51,"I’ve given it all I have.  There is no compassion, empathy or sympathy for an avoidable crisis.  It never had to be this way.  

Masking and vaccinations was always the answer to every questions about the pandemic. 

Ron DeSantis is so cynical he is now important NY Hassidics and paying their private school with tax payer vouchers to secure more votes."
2021-08-08 07:27:04,"“ The so-called “uneducated” of all races and backgrounds are hampered not by a lack of good sense but by a lack of money and power. Their education status keeps their income low, and income predicts insurance status. ”  I don’t understand this statement. A vaccine is free while a trip to the hospital or god forbid the ICU will cost thousands. If you don’t want to end up sick, unable to work and with a pile of hospital bills then why won’t you take the vaccine? This argument makes no sense, let’s stop trying to make excuses for people who are unvaccinated. It’s all about “personal responsibility” as the republicans love to say."
2021-08-08 07:34:28,"Very nice article with overwhelming valid points, but what a condemnation of the US as a modern functional democracy."
2021-08-08 07:38:50,"""many unvaccinated people are scared just like us, and [that] with the right help and information, they would sit down next to nurses and pull up their sleeves""

Yes, many are. There are substantial efforts going on to reach them, often involving good people going door-to-door - with some success, but having to fight through the hordes with the same right to vote as themselves who are, in their own, less  understandable rage, trying to stop them. What motivates *those*people is the mental problem that needs analysis - not the reactions, some constructive and some not, that they cause in those of us who actually understand that freedom requires responsibility. We are learning that this awareness is well short of universal. Rage may not be the most productive response to this miserable discovery, but, as is said in the chess world, all moves are the same in a lost position."
2021-08-08 08:44:48,"Reading this has not helped. It has been minutes of putting up with virtual hand patting and there-there-ing, it’ll be all right. No, it won’t with advice like this. The curve of the pandemic has not - and will not - be bent by good intentions or soothing words or prayer or anything less than focused action. Action is what has developed the vaccine, put it into arms, delivered the best available science on medical treatments, and self-help guidelines for protection and prevention. Kind words, forbearance, and tolerance are soft weapons against the virus when other methods fail. They are as ineffective in changing my mind about the willingly unvaccinated as are my words to convince the holdouts to join us."
2021-08-08 08:45:03,"I just attended a function (plans were made before the current surge and my aged parents would have been devastated had I not attended) where there were many relatives. All but one relative was vaccinated. We shared the information freely as a matter of caring for one another. As far as I am concerned the unvaccinated relative put us all at risk and should not have attended. Their motivation for not being vaccinated was solely political from a viewpoint of the far right. Because they believe the pandemic is a hoax and masks are useless they potentially exposed me and others to a deadly disease. I am furious. I have no capacity to attempt to understand this person. How dare one person, based upon political beliefs, be so selfish to put the rest of us at risk?  How does this even come close to being considered an individual freedom?  Freedom for him to foist his toxic politics on everyone. No freedom for me to avoid both the physical and mental toxicity. I will head home, pray that I and the other attendees do not get breakthrough infections and will hunker down for the duration. Empathy for the unvaccinated? No way. They are so worried about being controlled but it is they that control the rest of us. Shame on them."
2021-08-08 09:05:56,"I got whooping cough a few years ago. My doctor told me that my vaccine had worn off (I was 54) and the disease was endemic in my town, and across CA. Parents refusing vaccines, and the disease spread.

I was furious. Whooping cough is painful. You cannot breath.

I got the Covid vaccine as soon as I could.

Like I want to lie in bed, gasping for breath."
2021-08-08 09:07:29,"I'm rather stunned that those of us who have been working hard at using evidence based motivational interviewing approaches with the vaccine hesitant and try to counter vaccine misinformation on social media have been stereotyped in the same way Ms. Smarsh accuses us of stereotyping those who are not vaccinated. 

Yes, she's correct that we're angry, but she's not correct that we stereotype the unvaccinated as rural white folks or archetypal bumpkin villains. We are well aware of the KFF data and use it to teach others how to best approach changing minds. Large groups of nurses, for example, work both on social media and in our communities to counter misinformation and increase vaccine uptake. Many of us are very angry at those who shame and blame rather than recognizing and addressing their concerns. At the same time, I don't see those who have been putting people in body bags for the past year and a half being considered as part of this demographic of angry people. Ms. Sharma should look at the full picture of the angry vaccinated rather than relying on anecdotal evidence from social media to come to unsupported conclusions about what to do with our COVID rage."
2021-08-08 09:15:59,"The most productive thing to do with 'Covid rage' is look at how human behavior increases the risk of pandemic in the future and adapt our habits accordingly to reduce this risk. Habitat loss due to deforestation, much of which is done to provide more land for cattle grazing to feed the beef industry, is a significant risk factor for the transmission of zoonotic diseases. The number of people I see angry about Covid measures or Covid itself yet refusing to reduce their meat consumption absolutely astounds me."
2021-08-08 09:22:43,"The NY Times ran an article on August 7th concerning Texas mask & vaccination mandate laws and how the Austin hospitals are currently overloaded with new COVID-19 cases.  The virus has rebounded with devastating effect thanks in no small part to political posturing.

It should be noted that when a health care system overloads this reduces the treatment quality for COVID patients as well as stroke, car accident, and other routine health issues.

It's one thing to debate COVID stats, but quite another when someone dies from a gunshot wound that could have been treatable had the ER / ICU not been swamped with vax skeptics.  We need to get serious about this, the virus affects far more than we realize.

Mask, distance, vaccinate and live!"
2021-08-08 09:41:22,"I am fully vaccinated but the rest of my extended family aren’t (even after pleading). They aren’t conspiracy theorist, they aren’t even conservative, but they have been wronged, bankrupted, and had costly (both monetarily and health-wise) procedures because of our health system. They don’t trust it…and honestly why should they? Why should they trust big pharma that has longed care more about profit than care…when they have repeatedly tried to oversell products that caused addiction and destroyed families? Why should they trust a healthcare system that refuses care to millions and has previously caused them pain? Many unvaccinated are crazy, but I’m willing to bet just as many have been hurt and wronged by a largely private and for-profit system that operates in the wealthiest country ever to exist. Change and better the system and the problem of distrust will go away.

Oh and btw my extended family knowing the risk tries to mitigate it by wearing masks and staying home. They aren’t partying it up or getting get togethers…and neither am I even though I am vaccinated. They understand the severity, they just don’t trust the health system. Especially with vaccines being pushed through without normal review"
2021-08-08 09:44:39,"Please consider, just for a moment, the rage and deep, deep sorrow of parents with a vaccine-injured child.  Try very hard to understand their disillusionment with, and resulting deep-seated distrust of, those who had a hand in harming their child.  Many thousands of these parents exist in our communities, quietly suffering while millions vent their rage at them.  

It is a sickness to wish ill-health on another human being.  Everyone is doing the best they can in a highly stressful environment.  Be kind."
2021-08-08 09:52:44,"The purpose of rage whether expressed or held inside has a much-needed, self-protective function.  It both insulates the self against exposure and actively keeps others away. If it emerges as a defense strategy  it will be used by an individual or group which holds onto rage as a characteristic style.  This strategy of defense is a ""feeling state"" distinct from feelings, an internalized state. . .no longer one affect or feeling among many . . actively held onto and prolonged whether it is expressed or just felt inside."
2021-08-08 09:59:22,"I’m not so much angry at the unvaccinated. Rather, I’m angry at the national policy makers who are abandoning their Red state citizens.

Here in Florida, the state government is actively encouraging the spread of the virus. Towns are not allowed to impose mask mandates. They are not even allowed to hold online meetings; it’s in-person or don’t meet at all.

Schools will have funding yanked if they mandate masks. There are no workplace quarantine rules.￼ Concert halls, gyms, and restaurants cannot ask about vaccination status.

As a result of these policies, hospitals are so full that every person who is injured in an accident or who suffers a heart attack is in danger of dying because ambulances and hospital staff are beyond fully busy with desperately ill Covid patients, many of them young adults, some of them children.

We need help! We need federal mandates to override those of Red state governors. We should not be left at the mercy of self-serving governors who care nothing about our suffering."
2021-08-08 10:16:24,Thank you for a beautiful statement. My rage is directed at those who feed fear and misinformation that results in people not getting the vaccine. My rage is directed at the Republican party. Not only is it the party that spreads misinformation. It is also the party that makes it impossible for some people to take time off from work to get vaccinated.
2021-08-08 10:17:15,I lost a very good friend to the virus in Spring 2020. A relatively young woman with a disabled husband who relied on her. It was of course just awful for her family and friends. But it was long before any vaccines had been produced. How much worse must it be for the family and friends of those that are dying now given that vaccines are available but are being refused? RIP Sheena.
2021-08-08 10:17:53,"This essay is a lyrical and dark portrait of what my country has become. Thank you so much. 
I am puzzled. Puzzled that it took 4 short years to break a 243 year old democracy. Even with the architects of our present state are all out of office, we are still broken. For those who refuse the vaccines and stubbornly think masks are a violation of their privileges, just wait. What won’t bend will break."
2021-08-08 10:29:55,"Ms. Smarsh, thank you for this insightful and beautifully written essay."
2021-08-08 10:30:10,"What makes me angry is attitude of many of the non-vaccinated, which is similar to their attitudes about any number of other issues today: ""I have a right to do whatever I want, no matter what, no matter who else it may hurt. And no one can tell me otherwise."" It doesn't even stop at the issue of being vaccinated; some of them refuse to even say whether they've been vaccinated or not, while at the same time failing to wear a mask or socially distancing. 

There is no moral, ethical, religious or Constitutional basis for this position. None whatsoever. Full stop. 

If you choose not to get vaccinated, I strongly disagree, but at least be transparent and accountable. Admit you are not vaccinated. And then show at least a shred of human decency, morality and concern for others by wearing a mask indoors and socially distancing. If for no one else, do it for the health care workers who are exhausted and who, at various times during your life, has given you and members of your family care for a variety of health-related matters. They have put you and your family ahead of themselves. 

There are 320 million people in this country. You're only one of them. Start acting like it."
2021-08-08 10:33:18,"There’s a critical truth that can be generalized her.

“ Most importantly, we can direct our rage not at lost individuals but at systems of power that made our grim national death count the only plausible outcome. Is it so shocking that a caste-based society that exalts individualism and prioritizes profit above wellness — one of the only industrialized nations without universal health care — would fail to rise to the challenges of a collective health crisis?”

As with the pandemic, so with climate change, the assault on democracy, and all of the other threats challenging us as a species. Unenlightened self-interest combined with the power of money is deliberately using divide and conquer tactics to keep us at each other’s throats."
2021-08-08 10:43:22,"Children without proof of the Measles, Mumps, Rubella vaccine are excluded from schools. No arguments. Likewise, it's no big deal to exclude vaccine refusers from public, shared space."
2021-08-08 10:51:32,"I appreciate Ms. Smarsh pointing out to use our rage towards systemic change. For those without health insurance or with jobs that will give sick leave, they cannot afford to take time off if they were to get sick from the side effects of the vaccine, which many have experienced in varying and with some, debilitating degrees. 

This is a GLOBAL pandemic, and until  more vaccines are distributed to those who don’t have access, this pandemic will continue to affect everyone. 

We are all interconnected and we cannot ignore how humans on this Earth must work together to address future pandemics and the climate crisis."
2021-08-08 10:59:17,"Yes, that’s pretty much my attitude now that I’ve been through the other stages of grief: I won’t die of this virus because I’ve been vaccinated. But that’s not enough. In our democracy we rise and fall with the tides. One thing we have not attended to is the social contract which manages the tides. We’ve left the far right to superimpose an idea of rights without responsibilities to the polis. That’s a grave mistake and the essence of why we need to get everyone vaccinated. Beating Covid will damage the far right and save lives."
2021-08-08 11:06:00,"I am vaccinated, I spent many hours helping friends get vaccinated. They are all vaccinated, no matter which party they belong to.
Where I live in Florida, most people wear masks VOLUNTARILLY in stores, inside places.
I'm visiting NY, right near a ""sanctuary city"" where the vaccination rate is no better than the red States and although I wear one, I seem to be alone most places I visit, stores especially. Where there are many undocumented (Illegal) people, where the numbers are going up just as fast or faster than Florida.
Does anyone really think that open borders are helping? 
I don't. 
So channel your anger, think of ways to help instead of being angry. How about a legal immigration system and stop allowing people to break any law you don't happen to like."
2021-08-08 11:07:43,"I am so tired of people trying to excuse vaccine hesitancy/resistance. Yes, there is a correlation with socioeconomic class, education and the like, but so what. It would be one thing if people that were less educated sought out information from those that were more educated, but that simply isn’t the case here. Instead they almost revel, many of them, in their ignorance and hate, and hold special contempt, many of them, for those of us from identical backgrounds that struggled to obtain an education. Mandate vaccination for every aspect of life...work, school, travel, the military. Distrust of the health care system and pharmaceutical companies? Wait until you see how much it costs to spend a month in an ICU, versus a free, to you, vaccination."

2021-08-08 11:12:01,"The current medical system has been undermining public trust in the medical community for years. This is what it got us. I think I will funnel my anger/frustration into pushing for reforms and writing my local representatives 

Here in NYC I overheard my local grocery clerks talking about the vaccine and their concern was hidden fees. One told the other “they always say it’s free but then send you a bill. I can’t afford that!”. I believe the NYTimes ran an article on those who got what they thought were free Covid tests and then ended up will a bill.

How many families have been destroyed by the opioid epidemic after their loved one was prescribed an opioid by a doctor? No wonder they are hesitant to trust those same people. I would be too.

I didn’t even consider getting this vaccination until I was able to read some medical recommendations and speak to some medical experts outside of this country. I’m lucky I knew where to find those resources."
2021-08-08 11:13:15,"Such an important analysis of the complexity of the public health issues today.  We should not assume that COVID divides evenly into blue and red categories- there are many deep nuances to every individual’s story.  I am glad to be vaccinated and be able to visit my granddaughter again.   Vaccination is a personal and civic responsibility, but casting stones or hateful comments toward the unvaccinated does not improve the odds in managing this scourge."
2021-08-08 11:14:05,"I'm angry, but scared too, and so disappointed and stressed.  My mother, an ordained Pentecostal minister sits in her nursing home room, right now with pneumonia, as her dementia worsens.  She is three states away from me.  She cannot hold a phone now, but she does recognize me still as she speaks to me from the nurses station. Visits are still allowed, but I can't with a good conscience travel to see her and bring death to her door.  Her former ""flock"" is nowhere to be seen and it's a good thing I guess because they are not vaccinated.  She is."
2021-08-08 11:14:33,"It's not just covid and the refusal to get the vaccine because something on Facebook told you it was dangerous.
It is the past four years of lies, disinformation, cult worship, and the destruction of US constitutional norms.  It's January 6 and its many apologists.  It's the transformation of the Republican Party into the authoritarian party.  It's the recognition that there are those within state legislatures who are willing to toss out or suppress votes to get the result that they want.  And of course the electoral college means that what happens in Texas could destroy us all.
Unfortunately for the unvaccinated, their tolerance for all of the above seem to go together.  
I think the author makes a good point--an excellent one, in fact--about the people who have been too poor to access the health care system, and who now fear to lose a day's work, and I'm grateful for this perspective."
2021-08-08 11:28:01,"I had a few good weeks in the spring - COVID seemed to take a break.  

Are we supposed to just be grateful for a few good, somewhat normal weeks out of a year and a half of isolation, staying out of sight, beholding the walls of our homes, telling ourselves it’s ok to just not miss stuff - like hugs, interaction with family members, friends, neighbors?  

I have watched my eighty some year old widow neighbor ladies turn into hundred year olds, psychologically, this past year.  They seem to have nothing to look forward to anymore.  Their contact with those they love has been snatched away - again.  

What is left for seniors to honor anymore?  Not much to look forward to.  It’s like we have been taunted, a touch of normalcy to tease with.  Oh, to be old and feeling so sorry for the young.  We are caught in a web.  And the non vaxxers think all this is okay.  Haven’t their lives changed?  Maybe not."
2021-08-08 11:29:44,"If there are people out there who genuinely have not been able to get a vaccine they would like to get, that is a problem communities can solve. And I’m not angry at any such people, if they are out there. I am angry at and frustrated by and exhausted because of and afraid because of everyone whose excuse for not getting a vaccine is simply an excuse (not a reason) that stems from their choice to follow Trump. Because my anger and frustration and exhaustion and fear of Trump go back many years now, and because all those feelings relate to much more than the vaccine, I simply do not have the ability the author is requesting of me, to put that anger and frustration and exhaustion and fear aside."
2021-08-08 11:30:12,"Yes, rage has its downside but I can't give it up just yet. After our family worked like mad for a year to keep the most vulnerable amongst us safe - several seniors including me, a premature baby, young nieces, one with leukemia - sacrificing precious time together, then losing my husband to another illness just before the vaccine was available.  And there are many families who have lost so much more.

The vaccine saved our lives from covid and from a world of isolation and separation. In June and July,  it was a miracle. Now, thanks to the criminal misinformation machine and a crumbling public health system, we are sliding backwards.  I'm not sure yet how I can go back there again. So  yes, I am angry. 

Let the uninsured and unvaccinated stop blaming Democrats and start blaming the source of all of this unnecessary suffering - the GOP.  People are not without health care and information because of their education level - they have have been purposely neglected by their elected officials. Perhaps enough anger directed at the right places will finally get things done."
2021-08-08 11:31:30,"Beautiful written with valid points made as to why the unvaccinated remain so. But the why does not change the facts. The result of their behavior; sickness, and at times, death for themselves and others is inexcusable, and unforgivable. Understanding a person's reasons is not a justification for inertia. The unvaccinated must be isolated from those of us who are vaccinated. Period. We have waited long enough for effective action. It is the responsibility of our government and business leaders to provide healthcare protection for all peoples residing in this country. It is indefensible for those leaders to continue to hide behind the veil of ""personal freedom of choice."""
2021-08-08 11:37:19,"A wise friend once said to me that humans have been allowing each other to self-destruct for thousands of years, and that is never going to change. 

It makes sense to focus our energy on helping the people who are not yet vaccinated due to logistical challenges, or who are ""vaccine hesitant,""  as opposed to wasting our energy on those not vaccinated for idealogical reasons. I'd rather focus my energies on improving the situation than wallowing in my anger, however justified.

Thank you Sarah, for a nuanced and thoughtful piece."
2021-08-08 11:41:42,"It is curious that those who refuse to believe anything the government says have found religion in the mantra ""It's not FDA approved!"" 
Ask what FDA approval means and they will say, ""It's safe.""
So when this government agency declares it's safe, they will believe it then?
Not likely.
As I understand it, the reason the FDA cannot approve it is not there is not yet adequate safety data. 
After 6 weeks no vaccine has ever been found to cause severe adverse effects. (Peter Offit)
Even Guillain Barre after the Swine flue vaccine occurred  within 6 weeks.
The reason for 2 years? It's a rule, dating back to thalidomide, which was a drug, not a vaccine. 
The FDA is not a public health agency; public health agencies have to act in a timely manner. Just ask Charity Dean, MD, who was thwarted by timely action by the CDC. (""The Premonition"")
The FDA is an agency concerned with process and rules.
The same rules thwarted use of anti AIDS drugs until the EUA exception was codified into law. 
The argument then was thousands would die awaiting compliance with a rule.
The same argument applies now."
2021-08-08 11:42:43,"Well let's help out the undecided once again.  First: from the start of the pandemic, the experts said we needed 70-90% of the population to have a vaccine or antibodies from contracting the disease to achieve herd immunity.  Obviously, we have not achieved that yet. The numbers bear that out.  Second: to those of you out there fearing that not enough study has been done about the vaccine, I offer this.  Not a single medicine you do or would put into your body was ever put on the market until waiting until after 190,000,000 subjects had taken it.  Every single day millions of people demand their doctors give them Eliquis or Opdivo, or Humira, or....after seeing them on TV.  Medications with far more side effects than the Covid vaccine. And far fewer test subjects. The numbers bear out that the overwhelming number of people getting really sick, hospitalized, and dying are unvaccinated.  And the longer this drags out, the more likely it is another variant will come along.  One that might bypass the vaccines or make only kids get really sick.  And then it will have a clear playing field in unmasked kids in schools.  Easy pickings for a virus.  So by all means wait and see.  Guess who will get blamed for a more dangerous variant.  Hint: it won't be those 'pesky' immigrants at the border."
2021-08-08 11:45:53,My local Walmart and Walgreens have had signs up for free vaccinations for months. Including weekends at Wal-Mart. There's no excuse.
2021-08-08 11:50:51,"While Delta will take more American lives because of the hesitancy of people to get vaccinated, we need to remember that this is a global problem.  Delta did not start in the US.  However, the Epsilon variant was discovered in Southern California, and that variant seems to be more resistant to the vaccines than Delta, although, not as deadly, or transmissible.

If the vaccination rates in the less industrialized countries do not rise with our vaccination rate, we will almost certainly run out of Greek letters to name them.  What language will we go with when that happens?  Perhaps Sanskrit?  They have 82 basic letters.  Hopefully, with a high enough vaccination rate in the US, we will not be the place that the new, more transmissible and deadlier, Kanthya variant will arise.

This issue starts to hit on internet literacy, and the ability of Americans to be intelligently selective in their sources.   If we cannot get Americans to double or triple check their sources and learn which sources are more reliable than others, we could easily perish in the next Covid-style pandemic."
2021-08-08 01:21:56,"The article rightly touches on the fears of those without health insurance. The side effects of the vaccine range from temporary to permanent disability and even death. Please research this before  you take your anger out on those who are already victims because they cannot afford health insurance. Becoming ill from the vaccine side effects might at a minimum cause missed days of work, but could lead to financial ruin in more complicated cases. Allow compensation from the Vaccines Injury Fund for those affected, and provide Medicare for all.

My anger is more at the anti-maskers, and the trump administration, who seemed to promote the spread. And at the premature advice from the CDC, that vaccinated people need not wear masks. We don't even fully understand this virus or what it will do next. Mask up."
2021-08-08 11:53:06,"Why was I comfortable with getting vaccinated when so many others are not?

Not because I believe everything the government tells me or think it always acts in my best interests. Not because I particularly trust the healthcare and pharma industries. Rather, because at some point in my public school education in New Jersey, I had a science class where I learned what a virus is and how vaccines work. New Jersey now has a very high rate of vaccination.

It’s no surprise that the states with the most unvaccinated people are those at the bottom of the national rankings for quality of public education. An egregious example - between 1999 and 2007, Ms Smarsh’s state, Kansas, removed evolution from its science curriculum and taught “creationism” instead. Such states produce citizens who are easy prey to superstition and misinformation. 

Ms Smarsh is right that anger is initially empowering but ultimately toxic unless it’s channeled into productive pursuits. One such pursuit could be a nationwide initiative to upgrade state science curricula to ensure that every student in the country acquires an adequate grounding in science and critical thinking. There’s no guarantee that the current pandemic is a “once in a century” occurrence, as some say, so now is the time to begin preparing our younger citizens for the next one."
2021-08-08 11:56:03,"I'm only one person, but there are zero, zero, people that I know who are unvaccinated because of fear. Or because of a missed day at work from the after effects of the shot. No, they are all smarter than everyone else and have the reasons why you shouldn't get vaccinated all ready to go if you can stomach listening to it. Nope. I'm staying angry for a bit longer, thank you."
2021-08-08 11:56:25,"What we should do with our rage is simple. Make it very very difficult not to be vaccinated. Every job, school, restaurant, public benefit and  mode of transportation ( except your own car) should require vaccination. It’s amazing how many excuses will fall away with those mandates in place. My friends company put a mandate in place. Their director of finance ( who seemed to have political objections to the vaccine) said he wouldn’t get it. Ok they said, let’s start working on your transition plan, we will want to have a replacement in place in 45 days when out return to office starts. We’d be happy to give you a nice letter of recommendation. Ugh, he groused, after realizing they were serious,  I’ll get the vaccine."
2021-08-08 11:58:53,"In my area of NC, there is not a lack of access. You must be able to drive yourself or have someone drive you for anything you do.  People find all the other services they need or want that they can afford.  This free service is available and accessible.  
The people I know who are most opposed are more than capable of getting the vaccine on their day off.  Most have taken vacations already so they have they time.  The last one I discussed this with told me she is wary of the vaccine but she isn't the least concerned about the virus.  She knew 80 and 90 year olds who had survived it.  Well I know people in that same age group and younger who died.  I asked her about spreading the virus and reminded her that she might be contagious days before symptoms appeared.  She ignored this argument.  This is a smart successful woman but she is about to lose one customer.
The problem here is largely politics. Not every Republican is opposed to the vaccine, but I don't know a single Democrat who has abstained.  
If there is another mask mandate I will comply but I will be angry about it.  We should blame the people who are making this worse.  My Republican husband who is very pro vaccine believes we should start charging the unvaccinated for the cost of their Covid treatment. I'm starting to do is move my business away from places where I know the employees and particularly the proprietor are unvaccinated particularly when these businesses aren't taking other precautions like masking."
2021-08-08 00:56:26,"There's an article elsewhere on the NY Times website today --

""Inside One Company’s Struggle to Get All Its Employees Vaccinated

At an optical business in New York City, it took months of coaxing, a cash bonus and a weekly testing mandate to persuade 90 percent of the staff to get a coronavirus vaccine.""

<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/06/nyregion/employee-vaccination-business-ny.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/06/nyregion/employee-vaccination-business-ny.html</a>

The article describes the difficulties faced by the owner of this business to convince all his employees to get the covid-19 vaccination -

It mentions many reasons why some people are hesitant -  but my favorite is --

""One employee said she was concerned because she thought a vaccine had caused the characters in the film “I Am Legend” to turn into zombies. People opposed to vaccines have circulated that claim about the movie’s plot widely on social media."" --

This reminded me of a quote from a book titles ""A World Lit Only by Fire"" - which is about the middle - or so-called ""dark"" ages -

An early chapter covers what the author refers to as ""The Medieval Mind"" - describing it in part -- 

""...the portrait which emerges is a mélange of incessant warfare, corruption, lawlessness, obsession with strange myths, and an almost impenetrable mindlessness."" -

The book is about - ""The Densest of the medieval centuries—the six hundred years between, roughly, A.D. 400 and A.D. 1000..."" --

And here we are - 1,000 years later - with great advancements in technology -

The human part - not so much..."
2021-08-08 01:22:30,"I am completely confused by this opinion piece.  It appears that the author wants to blame the lack of insurance, the uninsured, for the poor vaccination rate.  As if, by placing blame here, the vaccinated will feel sorry for the uninsured, as liberals and many Democrats do, and that will placate our anger about the nation’s situation.  

balderdash!  Many who are uninsured are vaccinated.  But states run the vaccination program, not the federal government and it is states that haven’t made vaccinations local enough, transparent enough, and states who haven’t done the messaging needed.  Hey, Don’t Fauci my Florida!  That’s a state messaging and it is clearly aimed at NOT getting people vaccinated.  Don’t give that horrible vaccine to my teen!  That’s a TN message clearly aimed at reducing the number of vaccinated children. Masks don’t work so you are forbidden, by penalty of law from requiring children to wear them while in school!  Welcome to TX, FL and AZ  messaging that not only insures children will get Covid, but also that their parents will believe masks dont’ work because their government tells them so.

You bet I am angry.  And it doesn’t have anything to do with the uninsured!"
2021-08-08 03:25:28,"I can’t stop thinking of the over 4 million people who have died from COVID, many of whom (in the U.S. at least) didn’t have to if the previous administration had handled this better. Many weren’t lucky enough to live to see a vaccine and now people insult their deaths by refusing it. It is beyond offensive. 

I’m sure those who have died would love to trade places with the unvaccinated, and if they could communicate to us, they would be screaming, “Get the shot!”"
2021-08-08 05:13:02,"It would be great to see all the ambulances with Covid patients inside, and all the hearses carrying those who died from Covid, take a lap around DeSantis’ Governor’s mansion.  How’s that for rage? Those who should know better, stoking division and ultimately costing lives, is the appalling shame of this pandemic. Diseases should not be politicized."
2021-08-08 06:38:30,"Look, I work with someone who cannot explain to me why he won't take the vaccine.  They are more than readily available in so many places here. I can direct him to one immediately. He has no reason that he can explain not to get the vaccine. Not only is he putting me at risk, because I work closely with him, but the whole team at work. On top of that, he has a newborn and a wife. His newborn just had her flu shots. He is a selfish individual, through and through. How many more are just as recalcitrant as he is. Don't elide over the real reasons he is so  selfish.  There are many and too insane and unbelieveable to fathom here. No excuses, from anyone anymore."
2021-08-08 07:47:36,"I’d feel better if this were only about vaccinations. The same people (mostly) support an insurrection against our Capitol and taking away voting rights from minorities. As I watch the women of color proudly represent the USA in track, I think how patriotic those women are. And yet they are treated poorly in daily life. Who are the Patriots?"
2021-08-08 05:47:20,"Some people are always hard to reach for vaccination campaigns. That isn't the problem here.

There are some people who are legitimately scar d of the vaccine. They aren't the cause of the problem. They are the victims.

The criminals are Tucker Carlson and his ilk. Most of them vaccinated, but happy to turn vaccination into a wedge issue. They are driving this. They are spreading lies. They are were we need to start to fix this issue."
2021-08-08 01:27:34,"Covid infections now exploding again. Death and suffering again on the rise.
Manifestly, the President takes some actions but never enough. Always behind

terribly weak Presidential leadership to actually win the war against the pandemic. Always some other reason for all the death and suffering, and the harm it does to our children, their education, and to the economic recovery. The poverty and the unemployment due to infective action to win the war against the pandemic."
2021-08-08 03:56:55,"Well well well......the things that bring out the closet authoritarians. Perhaps it would ease your minds to remember that there are several safe, very effective, and inexpensive treatments for any and all corona virus infections. And staying healthy, fit, and active, maintaining a good Vit. D level, and practicing basic sanitary protocols will go far in keeping the worst plague in the history of the world at bay. Neither I nor my wife will ever consent to an mRNA injection, of any kind, for any reason: we are both all too aware of the science. When the de-platformed inventor of the mRNA technology tells you that this isn't a good idea, perhaps you should pay attention. His name is Dr. Robert Malone, for those of you who aren't completely lost in the Mockingbird world. And for those of who who think me and mine worthy of scorn, derision, and worse, I wish you well. Take the shot, if you believe it will 'protect' you. People who refuse the shot are not your enemy, and they won't 'infect' you, right? That's why you got the shot, right?  And finally, a survival rate of 99.4%, even if you believe the CDC numbers, speaks well of humans' immune systems."
2021-08-08 06:40:05,It's fashionable now to note that many who are unvaccinated are thus for reasons other than right-wing ideology or disinformation. Fine. But what do we say about politicians who know better but who peddle lies and misdirection?

2021-08-08 03:04:11,"I´m not angry -- I´m amused, disgusted, and a bit incredulous that there are so many that are willingly ignorant in our supposedly advanced country.  For me, the bottom line is that sometimes people just have to be told what to do.  No one asks if the public agrees that it is a bad idea to drink and drive, and no one (that I´m aware of, at least) claims that ¨liberty¨ demands that everyone has the right to drink and drive, putting others at risk.  Instead, we throw people in jail who drink and drive.  I´m not saying we should throw people in jail who don´t get the vaccine, but they should be told to get the vaccine or lose the privilege to enter public places."

Because she persisted in working as a cook, by which she exposed others to the disease, she was twice forcibly quarantined by authorities, eventually for the final two decades of her life.

2021-08-08 04:17:51,Anger is not a good response to anything. Anger interferes with thinking and makes us vulnerable to being influenced by crackpots. Consider how Trump uses anger to control his base. The USA was able to survive four years of deprivation during the second world war because we were all on the same side with a common enemy. Now we have people who disagree about who the enemy is and also disagree about what reality is. After one year we have lost our will to do what is needed to defeat the enemy virus.  It is time to stop all of the emotional stuff and get back to problem solving to figure out what to do about Covid.
2021-08-08 11:12:45,"I admire the author's grace and forebearance even if I can't quite get there myself. I try to avoid 24 hr. rage, grief and resentment because I'm afraid that'll kill me as surely as Covid. After 4 years of the Orange Plague, I was looking forward to some peace and real freedom. I mean the freedom to gather with friends and family without fear; go out for a quart of milk without wondering if I'd catch a deadly disease; ignore the news for a day because the government isn't in the hands of a deranged psychopath. But, no. Here we are, facing yet another entirely avoidable crisis, a crisis that may become another national tragedy. So I'm angry. And with all due respect to the author, the high minded excuses about mistrust of the medical establishment, etc. are hogwash. And it's not about a fear of medical debt. The vaccines are free and widely available. If you have no valid medical reason to abstain, you simply have to excuse to endanger the largest segment of the population who really cannot get innoculated: children under 12. Unlike Covid 19, the Delta variant can infect them as easily as an adult. Schools are getting ready to re-open. Stop being such a selfish, pig-headed monster and get vaccinated."

2021-08-08 11:20:58,"I,too, am overwhelmed by the punishment of unbridled rage in this country. I am encouraged (slightly) by a growing awareness that the unvaccinated includes a (relatively) tiny sliver of people who cannot be vaccinated. 

The anger, the consumption by targeting, the spitefulness, the caustic judgmental ‘opinions’ have been psychologically alienating. Masking, isolating and living carefully have been less a challenge for a family member than enduring the fact-free hostility of others. Wishing death or economic ruin on a person betrayed by their body is sick. Oh, but say those throwing stones, I didn’t mean you! Really? Damage done. 

If only we could devise a ‘vaccination’ against the virus of a mind closed to awareness. Broad brushes paint poorly.

I am heartened to see that another sliver of the population understands this unfortunate predicament some live with, based on comments made by a handful of writers here. Let’s also pillory the poor children who are sick now, spreading infection too, regardless of who infected them.

I propose that outrage, mistrust, arrogance and fury, regardless the ‘justification,’ will kill something in our humanity in this country before the virus finishes us. Will any of it get the vaccine-resisters to Walgreen’s?  But, then, I have a very different seat at the (kids’) table where I am watching and listening to the national conversation. It is sickening in its own way."
2021-08-08 11:42:07,"I really don't have any rage. I thought that locally, and all along my recent drive along I72, US36, and I70 to Denver and the RMNP and back things have returned to essentially normal. Restaurants are open, the caves at Hannibal were open, RMNP was open, enough, etc. Locally I think things were handed fairly well, as while we could not meet people at the office we were never actually kept out, and could meet them at home. 

I will get mad if dictator Pritzker closes things down again, very mad. Up to now I think he has been pretty correct. Its time to call quits to all the fussing. Permanently."
2021-08-08 11:23:22,"On my local TV news this morning: video of hundreds of cars lined up for what looked like several miles at a COVID testing site in Florida, followed next by video of a vaccine site just a few miles down the road with almost no one there.

I am so tired of people telling me to empathize with the unvaccinated. I keep being told these people have no transport / no food / no time / no [fill in the blank with lame excuse].

Utter balderdash. As I write, huge numbers of these people are sitting in their cars in miles-long traffic jams waiting for a COVID test.

Yes, we ""have the facts,"" and they are ugly: the unvaccinated represent the portion of the human population that is just willfully selfish and willfully ignorant. A couple of months ago I might have been able to exercise the kind of empathy and outreach this writer advocates for. But now I just have contempt. 

Anger, too. I'm a teacher, about to start a new school year. Yet again, I will spend my workday in the strange, dystopian world of not being able to see the faces of the people I'm teaching, or they mine. 

Oh, and with regard to my wonderful cousin Bob, who died at the beginning of the pandemic, long before an available vaccine: He would have taken the vaccine in a heartbeat if he'd had the chance. I'm angry at the unfairness of the his death vs. the callousness of people who could now take a vaccine but won't. It should have been the other way around."

As a former Kansan, I grieve for my state.￼ The state was always conservative; but as “the free state,” there was also a strong value of education in even the smallest of towns and basic compassion for others. It seems that many of my family and so many others in the state have now gone over to embracing ignorance and bigotry. They might as well start flying the confederate flag, or move to Missouri. Your article does a terrific job of laying bear how people’s hearts can be turned hard. For them and my former home, I wish them some degree of enlightenment."

As for the conspiracy crowd?  Feel my rage.
2021-08-08 12:01:48,"The vaccine is free, readily available, and widely supported by medical professionals.  Public figures of all races and political affiliations have received it.  There is no valid excuse for any eligible American’s remaining unvaccinated."
2021-08-08 12:01:57,"Years ago, at the end of a spiritual retreat on spaciousness, I raised my hand full of tears and angst and suffering, seeking discernment in my lost state.  My comment/question was:  ""No matter how spacious I get, the world will still be broken.""  A great teacher had the dais, and her response, without pause or misplaced empathy, was ""I don't have an answer for that.  All I know is, my reactivity never helped.""   

And my reactive angst popped in a blink as the mental bubble it was, dropping me back into my human response--suffering, and the truth and heartfelt grief of it.  

I remind myself of my teacher's response often these days whenever I'm tempted to leave the suffering and grief that is--whatever its (insert favorite swear words here) cause--to feel the (relative) relief and (delusional) escape from that suffering and grief offered by my (mental bubble) reactions to it.   Keeping my teacher's response in mind reduces the number of times I react in ways that, as satisfying as they feel in the moment, I know I will judge myself for later, down from several hundred million to several hundred thousand.  A great spiritual return, in reduced suffering all around."
2021-08-08 12:04:21,"When one takes  politics out of the equation the author argues that a steady stream of  inaccurate information and poverty are the reasons why so many Americans refuse the vaccine . 
 That argument gets lost when one considers the simple fact the vaccine is ' free'  to the uninsured  so exactly where does poverty come into play. 
When the author got her vaccine did those sitting waiting with her pull up in Range Rovers , I suspect not. No they were poor people who just used some common sense and knew the importance of prioritizing  something that would save their life .
 Americans are angry at the unvaccinated 'by choice'  and we have every right to be . They  are spreading a virus that  has the potential to make other unvaccinated people very ill , especially young children too young to get a shot.
So yes I am angry in point of fact I am furious at their selfish behavior,  but  'surprised' no I am not surprised . Self centered is who these people are and the mantra they live by . We hear and see it  every time they allude to 'their' rights, ignoring the rights of all who live in their communities ."

Why do we have to keep trying to bridge this gap? Every step we try to take towards them, they take another step back. Science deniers, who can’t tell the difference between opinion and fact on their favorite media propaganda who think it’s amusing when we try, patiently, to explain how vaccines work, or how climate change works, or how government is supposed to work. I’m full of rage. I’m incandescent with fury. My brother, an otherwise normal, reasonably intelligent man, is now lying in a hospital on a ventilator, paralyzed, because he refused to get a vaccine. Angry doesn’t even come close to what I feel right now about what is happening in this country."
2021-08-08 12:06:05,"They say that anger, even rage, when appropriate is not best denied or overcome, but channeled toward effecting good.  All of us with appropriate Covid rage should be directing it at the politicians and policymakers who are walking on eggshells with the unvaccinated.  We should be demanding vaccine mandates and punitive measures or at least enforced disadvantages to those that continue to refuse the vaccine.  Stop acting like freedoms are being protected by allowing the unvaccinated to make that decision for themselves.  More freedoms are being harmed by not clamping down on them than letting them go on.  Our elected officials should forget about politics and consider public safety and good over all.  

I am 63 years old and even though vaccinated still live in fear thanks to politicians that can't correctly solve an ethical dilemma.  For me the solution is clear, but I lost my 92 year old father to Covid last year and my rage over that has taught me not to ever excuse or make peace with those who are not caring about anyone but themselves.  And that includes the politicians, who are more worried about themselves and their votes than they are about public safety.  And that goes for both Democrats who are acting wishy-washy and Republicans drinking the right wing Kool Aid.  Again, justified anger does not need to be ""resolved"" but channeled to effect good.  If all of us who have this rage can find a way to do that we might be able to effect change."
2021-08-08 12:08:49,"This is a great article! 'Exhausted, despairing minds find comfort in turning complex realities into simple, opposing categories.' If I say one thing like, look at NY's death rate over time, things really look like we're finally getting there, I get slammed from every direction. If I say, well, we have a high rate of vaccinations, then I get slammed from others. I'm not even allowed to acknowledge the truth, or comment on it. BRW, check out the NY state graph for deaths over the course of the pandemic, look at the entire thing, we're getting there!"
2021-08-08 12:10:46,"Is there a correlation between those citizens who reject vaccination and also oppose expanding Meficare, or oppose a national healhcare system altogether?  Would they be tied together by state or location?  Their elected representatives?  Political party?

Admittedly I don't have facts or a research study, just anecdotal information, a hypothesis, and, frankly, a suspicion.  Could someone with better knowledge and information please answer?"
2021-08-08 12:13:37,"The author presents no evidence that condescension is driving down vaccine rates and does not engage at all with evidence (reported in this newspaper) that areas that supported Trump are far less likely to get the vaccine. Once again, the country must burn because conservatives feel vaguely offended."
2021-08-08 12:19:24,This author hit the nail on the head. How to channel emotions into something positive and other than rage. Sometimes hard to do but necessary if we want to rise above a culture that sometimes seems less mature than my junior high school experience
2021-08-08 12:19:38,"The anti-Vaxxers are mostly segments of the population who, prior to the pandemic, consistently acted/voted against their own interests. Why are you all surprised that during the pandemic, they continue to act against their own interests? It's really not a surprise. They are behaving exactly as expected."
2021-08-08 12:21:47,"Everyone has to pay taxes, regardless of your income, education, available time off work, “liberty”, or trust in government. Figure it out or pay consequences. I would have less rage if the government would start holding people accountable for vaccinations like they do taxes."
2021-08-08 12:22:18,"I do agree that anger against those whose inaction has kept this pandemic front-and-center is unproductive, even if understandable. To channel the rage, we should turn our collective efforts from trying to persuade the unpersuadable to the task of vaccinating the rest of the world. 

There are plenty of people around the globe who would take the vaccine if they could get it, but who can't get it. Let's get it to them. The future variant that will be able to bypass the current vaccines is being brewed amongst the unvaccinated, no matter where they live. 

Unless the vaccination program is made successful worldwide, it won't matter what communities of refusers do in the U.S. Let's turn our minds and actions to this very difficult and very expensive task, and finally bring this problem under control."

2021-08-08 06:05:42,"What in the whole wide world is happening? This is all so absurd. If covid did what polio did and we could SEE the damage, then the vaccine would be mandated, no question. Those of us who don't need to visualize the damage need to demand that we mandate the vaccine. End of story. Stop talking. Stop writing. Stop trying to understand the unvaccinated. We don't have time. Mandate the vaccine."
2021-08-07 21:55:50,"An 89 year old man fully vaccinated and a 75 year old anti-vaxxer both got the Delta variant. Don’t know where the anti-vaxxer caught it but he gave to the 89 year old. Both ended up in the same hospital. The 89 year old developed Covid pneumonia.  After 4 days in the hospital his lungs cleared up and he was released with oxygen to help his breathing. He’s doing OK. The anti-vaxxer ended up on a ventilator and then his kidneys started failing so he was also on dialysis. He eventually left the hospital in a body bag. He was cremated yesterday. I do not care where you live, what your political affiliation is, what race or religion you are. Unless you have a specific medical reason for not being able to get vaccinated, you are signing your own death certificate if you choose not to get vaccinated."

Wont spend my vaca money in Florida (or the South) this year. It disgusts me that these selfish people don’t care that hospitals must care for the covid patients for WEEKS, if not MONTHS, clogging up space for other surgeries, and wearing out staff; not to mention they have no desire to protect even their own children.  Increase their insurance rates, shun them and fire them.  This would’ve been over long ago if they respected public health."

2021-08-08 12:15:49,"My anger runs deeply  in my soul. The part of this that actually enrages me is how impotent  and downright stupid we look to the rest of the world. There is no pride in watching people claim freedom while  neighbors, co-workers, friends get sick  and some do die.
The death  of community, empathy, courage, and respect is the shameful face we show to the world.
""Land of the Brave"" belongs to our medical  profession. The rest of us, even some among the vaccinated, look strident, furious, and frankly, crazy.
Being a patriot, a good citizen, got shoved into  a garbage can of conspiracy, rabid politics and a hatred of pure science by those whose knowledge is based on vapid social media fear mongering.
Even if or when we defeat this virus, we have to face the reality of our collective intellectual  defeat and surrender to manipulative fear."
2021-08-08 02:24:31,"Wait until ""Covid-Omega"" comes around, that will be the end of the line for all the remaining anti-vaxxers. I don't wish anyone's demise, but such a precipitous fall in that segment of the population, here's some potential fallout:  NASCAR will no longer be the most widely viewed spectator sport, anti-abortion rallies will cease to exist, mega-churches will become minor-churches and the aggregate IQ of the Fox News audience will quadruple- because the remaining/living viewers were smart enough to get vaccinated."

We've seen Republican politicians literally undermine the health of their constituents to play to the ignorant mob. And it continues today.
So while anger toward the unvaccinated may be misdirected in some cases, the anger at consistently having our lives interrupted and our health endangered by a bunch of selfish, self-serving jerks is not."
2021-08-08 10:08:55,"I have noticed that some of the no-vaccine crowd have peculiar ideas.  I was listening to a Youtube show and one of the hosts noted that those who take this vaccine “will be dead within 2 years.”

I was shocked to hear hear this.  Where on earth did this idea come from? I have been reading Covid news and watching Youtube episode made by medical professionals and the worst I’ve heard concern (very rare) complications.  I experienced no complications myself. 

Should that particular show be removed from YT?  Won’t they just congregate elsewhere?

Has anyone else heard far fetched tales this? If people really believe this then vaccine hesitancy is quite logical."
2021-08-08 10:46:20,"You make some good points, but it is important to place the blame on our leaders more so than on individuals.  Many of those who refuse to get vaccines get all their info from FOX, OAN and Newsmax which have been saying covid is  hoax and just a cold or they listen to their preachers preaching against the vaccine or they look to republican leaders, state and local, who have used covid and the vaccine as a cudgel to stay in power. So while I do harbor anger at those making stupid decisions that risk their own lives and the lives of others, my deepest anger is for the leaders who for their own self-indulgence are happy to convince their own constituents not to get vaccinated because they think high covid death rates are in their political favor. Have they not seen yet that the people dying are their voters?"
2021-08-08 11:09:00,"As I recall, last year when the coronavirus was revving up, the focus was on how the virus was disproportionately killing black people. It was considered a blue state problem because California, Washington, and New York were hit first. Southerners and red staters felt “immune” and behaved accordingly. 

So, no, I have no patience for the unvaccinated in the South and the Midwest. I’m more concerned about children under 12 who are the most vulnerable."
2021-08-08 11:43:46,We should have a national vaccine mandate. Those who decide not to be vaccinated should be quarantined. I’m tired of people choosing to endanger my family and other responsible citizens!
2021-08-08 12:06:53,"Last week, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, in Alabama, hinted that Covid vaccination workers should be shot at if they turned up at anti-vaxxers' houses.  Apparently she was cheered by the crowd.

How can one muster up any sympathy or kind thoughts for such people? I am sure, also, having known such people, that they don't care in the least how others might regard them.  They will laugh in your face if you indicate you are trying to ""understand"" them or see their side of the issue.  I do pity the medical personnel who have to work and live in such places."

Broke a large national union, leading to a collapse of unions in US. He crystallized anti government sentiment, while being President! His cynical cry of “I’m from the government and I’m here to help” as being his hatred of the very institutions he was in charge of began the Right’s attack on all the accomplishments of FDR to LBJ. It’s no wonder the GOP radical followers attacked the very seat of government on 1/6. Ask those same people to wear masks, get vaccines or believe science, you must be joking."
2021-08-07 17:37:02,"People who willfully refuse to vaccinate and mask-up are threatening others lives. It doesn't matter whether they believe it or not because what matters is they are a lethal danger to all others.

I'm a 93% disabled Army Vet, with a heart condition who's existence others depend on. They endanger my life and it doesn't matter a hoot what they think. They are still endangering me and everyone - everyone else.

I treat these anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers like I treat someone comes into a store wearing a large holstered gun in the city where I'm shopping: I leave. I don't say anything to them. I probably won't shop there anymore. 

They don't have a constitutional right to kill me or endanger my health or anyone else."
2021-08-07 19:59:26,"Your perspective paints a complex situation with no end in sight. Although the re-awakened viral Pandemia is creating havoc, vaccinations lag...to our collective shame. Lack of education and solidarity remain patently obvious...while disinformation (malevolous spreading of lies and conspiracies) is ""alive and well"" via digital fast and furious spread. I guess we harvest what we sow. And Nature, abused by our lack of identification and support (as we are partt of and depend on it), is left crying!"
2021-08-07 22:06:33,"There appears to be a tendency, among some republican politicians, including a few governors, to tyr to keep the death rate up and then blame Joe Biden during the 2022 election."
2021-08-08 03:48:19,"I'm still trying to figure out the point of this essay.  

The issue is, basically simple, even though there are any number of different explanations for this group or that group of people not getting vaccinated, not being willing to wear masks, not being willing to respect social distancing.  True, some people truly do not have access to the vaccines.  These, it must be emphasized, are a very, very tiny minority.

The rest, whether actively or passively, will not get vaccinated and make a point of not getting vaccinated.  Ditto, wearing masks.  Why?

This is not, despite the circumlocutions of the author, all that complex.  The bottom line is simple, really: getting vaccinated, wearing masks, etc., is part of both protecting oneself AND PROTECTING OTHERS.  Not to do so is to express basic character defects that legitimately anger those who practice good citizenship.  Those character flaws are that these people are selfish, reckless, stupid and, yes, evil.  They find it acceptable to play Russian Roulette with other's health and lives.

Nobody's freedom includes the right to endanger others.  The willfully unvaccinated celebrate their ability to hurt and kill others.  The politicians who pass laws against vaccine or mask mandates are even worse, because they try to force others into positions of danger.  Such villainy, such perfidy, such malignancy on the part of legislators is unacceptable.

The behaviors of the vaccine refuseniks are unacceptable and make me very angry."
2021-08-08 00:45:05,"Systems of power that harm others don't just materialize out of thin air. They exist because individuals keep them in place. It's not a choice between trying to implementing a systemic change and challenging individual behavior. One should do both. 

If you don't care about the well-being of others, you have no right to expect others to care about your well-being. Your ""freedumbs"" are no excuse to harm others."

2021-08-08 12:03:23,What about my freedom to not pay taxes? The government should keep its hands off my money. S/

2021-08-08 12:09:13,"I get it already. There are many reasons people remain unvaccinated and blah blah blah. Enough already with the guilt tripping of the responsible vaccinated. I am sick of the pandemic. I do hate the voluntarily unvaccinated. I'll own the word because it is what I feel.

My life would be better; my less-than-12-year-old nephew's life would be less threatened; my work which requires travel and in person meeting would be more stable, predictable, and more able to support me; if these people would just get the shots. It's not my responsibility to care why they won't do the right thing for their country.

Stop minimizing the damage they are doing. Every article like this one just enables their dangerous negligence, no matter how thoughtful or fact based."
2021-08-07 23:50:09,Why don't people vote out the politicians who do not support a universal health plan. We continue to vote Republican so we deserve what we get. I have no sympathy for us.  Covid is a joke compared to what is coming at us because of climate change. We are responsible for putting significant CO2 in the atmosphere but the poor living near the equator will suffer. We deserve what we get.
2021-08-08 10:32:46,"A source of anger for many about those who have chosen to not be vaccinated is that we know that they are but a severe case of COVID-19 away from changing their minds.  

To me that's a definition of what it is to be a community sociopath - no regard for others and no interest in assisting others unless they're 'kith or kin'."
2021-08-08 11:26:43,"The author makes good points. Nonetheless, those children in adult bodies are making decisions that endanger others. They falsly believe it is their right to spread the virus, potentially killing their friends, family and even young children.

It is all about how concerned you are about your fellow man. Where does the circle of your concern stop? There are degress of selfishness, and those who refuse the vaccine are selfish."
2021-08-08 11:55:44,"I'm more angry at government letting us down. For months and months governments, the feds and the states, have and continue to use public health as a political football. Trump wasted all the good of Operation Warp Speed by playing down the pandemic from the start and then even playing down the effects after he received special care when he got Covid. Then Trump's enablers and wannabes continued the damage. But even states that have done well have done so by bribing and cajoling folks to get vaccinated and yet many of those ""good"" states still have 30% or more unvaccinated. When did bribing people to save themselves and others become accepted policy? Governments have been playing with a deadly illness for months and the outcome leaves us, after all this pain, still at great risk. Mandates for public places would have ended this nightmare months ago. Keep playing nice with Covid and eventually it will kill you."
2021-08-08 12:14:52,"I remember former Mayor Ed Koch say, “you can’t save everyone from themselves,” or something to that effect.
Also, since the vaccines have been free to all, why is fear of medical indebtedness a reason NOT to get vaccinated?"
2021-08-08 12:21:14,"We no longer ask people to mask up when we're out and about.  The chances are too high that the unmasked person will go full crazy if approached, especially since we've had all this time to understand why masking is so important.  We've done our part.  We just hope the unmasked, unvaccinated remainders (yes, there can be many reasons) don't let the final devastating viral killing machine out of the bag."
2021-08-08 12:29:34,"I don't understand the author's argument about vaccinations and lack of insurance. At least in my North Carolina county, the vaccines are free to everyone."
2021-08-08 12:35:59,"The only anger more impotent than rage at individuals is rage at 'systems of power.'

I suggest directing donations, resources, and pressure on our representatives in government to fund support for those who otherwise cannot afford even a 'free' vaccination — because of parking fees, availability and cost of day care, the cost or impossibility of time off from work, lack of reliable transportation, and so on.

The greater the support, the less the persuasion needed. 

For too many in our current systems of power, individual responsibility means simple survival. Let's support them."
2021-08-08 12:36:36,"In AZ I am furious with our governor. School is starting and he will not allow the schools to follow CDC guidelines with mask mandates. My kids hated being online and that is where they will end up again in a week or two- the obvious consequence of all the unmasked children in classrooms. I feel terrible for my patients who are immunosuppressed or got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and now are sick with COVID. I am kind to my patients with COVID that were not vaccinated, although it is aggravating. I spend many hours a week trying to persuade my unvaccinated patients to get a vaccine. The pathway of France makes the most sense- showing proof of vaccination to enter public places like stores and restaurants. Just like society does not make drunk driving an individual choice getting vaccinated should not be either."
2021-08-08 12:37:18,"I’m not certain who the “we” is that this essay addresses. I don’t fit the community the author describes. And I’m old now, so I don’t have the excess energy to sustain a lot of anger at random individuals who don’t do what I think it would be wise for them to do. I do, however, manage to sustain a good amount of anger toward political ideologues who privilege personal ambition above community responsibility. I’m sorry that some of my neighbors don’t trust the vaccines that are helping so many. But I’m outraged that there are so many in positions of power and influence who propound lies and misinformation in civic life. Those are the ones who deserve to be met with and a reckoning at the next election. There’s virtually no one left in the GOP leadership that deserves the position of responsibility they hold."
2021-08-08 12:40:15,"Are employers and local governments worried that if they mandate vaccination and masks that they will lose those employees who refuse to comply? Why are they not worried about losing those of us who do comply but whose health and safety are at risk? One huge slice of ""the great resignation"" is going to be the critical Frontline workers, medical professionals and those of us in the professional class who will lead a massive brain drain as we depart for safer pastures. These organizations will also be losing people who are critical thinkers and actually care about others' welfare. But, okay, favor the anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers. I'm sure that turn out great for business, employer morale and company culture. The rage is real and it's justified. Stop shaming us for feeling it."
2021-08-08 12:44:47,"What about breakthrough cases? Are those contributing to this covid rage and anger? There are many people who were previously infected with Covid and currently the studies show that immunity from infection is on par or better then immunity from the vaccine. Those folks may not need the vaccine at all. But this is still being studied. And perhaps when the FDA officially approves the vaccine some of the hesitant people will get it. It has been appalling and sad to see on social media the call by some to “shun or disown” family and friends who are not vaccinated, and at times mock or celebrate the covid death of someone who was a vaccine skeptic. This whole thing has become so emotionally charged and the one thing I agree with in this article is that yes, the anger will hurt only you."
2021-08-08 12:45:03,"There will always be people who refuse vaccination. Even before humans eliminated small pox, which carries a 30% mortality, a case concerning vaccine refusal came before the US Supreme Court.  However,  there is a unique cruelty to the rugged American Individualism that pervades so much thinking in this country."
2021-08-08 12:48:06,"I'm sorry.  I am angry, very angry!  The U.S. began vaccinating the public last December and at this point, with the exception of a miniscule number of medical issues, there is absolutely NO valid reason for not getting vaccinated.  I read in these comments - and elsewhere - that maybe it will require their own children dying to convince the anti-vaxxers to get vaccinated. What about the fact that they are also risking the life of my 11 month old grandson (both parents fully vaccinated)?  Selfish doesn't even begin to describe my feelings toward these folks!"
2021-08-08 12:50:27,"In the beginning of the pandemic I had nightmares about no one wearing a mask: crowds of people bare faced and infected.  Sadly, my nightmares came true."
2021-08-08 12:50:30,"Totally appreciate all the data cited in this article. Will keep it in mind even though I routinely pass places offering free shots. 
However, I work for a private company that pays well and offers exceptional (these days) medical benefits to its employees who are college-educated engineers, builders, and construction professionals. All have been required to return to the office, regardless of vaccination status, and a conspicuous number are wearing masks at work because they’re unvaccinated. Why am I forced to mingle with unvaccinated people in the halls, elevators, conference rooms, even if they’re masked? Why should I have to try to understand the co-worker who says she’s  “waiting for additional data,” as if she’s equipped to analyze that data in the first place? Seriously? While she’s (presumably) poring over the data at night, she’s compromising the safety of me and mine and the community each day. That I do not understand as anything but the height of arrogance and selfishness. And I do not apologize for it."
2021-08-08 12:50:48,"The saddest thing, to me, is all the people who belive -- based on past experience -- that either the vaccine is not free or if it's free, it must be bad in some undisclosed way. Think about how we learn things like that for a minute."
2021-08-08 12:54:35,"Not sure what is more damaging, the fear or the rage. I have anger for other reasons, but no fear. The fear that other people has bothers me for some reason. I think it's because it harms our country and children. It paralyzed logical thinking. No, I don't only make opinions based on my own needs, please, not everyone does. And judgement on feeling grief from a death or grief from loss of time, neither of these are worth judgements, that's crazy. Both sides are filled with so many self oriented people. We are a people, can we think like one, with our range of personalities and needs?"
2021-08-08 12:55:35,"So many excellent points made in this op-Ed, and so well-written. A reminder that anger is information. We learn something, we get angry, and then use that information and anger to make change. I understand the fury. I wanted to shame people on the A train just last night for not wearing their masks. The anger coursed through me, hurting no one but myself. After this article, I think I would have respectfully said something. Thanks for the reminder:

“Is it so shocking that a caste-based society that exalts individualism and prioritizes profit above wellness — one of the only industrialized nations without universal health care — would fail to rise to the challenges of a collective health crisis?”

And thanks for permission to speak up, and more importantly, for the attitude adjustment. What will I do with my vaccinated life?"
2021-08-08 12:58:50,"At first listening to patients at the beginning of the Covid pandemic there were those who sat across from me many with MAGA hats, trump shirts, American flag tattoos who were angry because they knew that this was all going to disappear the day after the election. Now these same people rail against the immigrants infecting the country, tracking devices in vaccines and loss of personal freedom. It’s infuriating and exhausting. Then there are the patients and sadly friends that insist that it’s all over blown by the MSM. There really is no reasoning with those whose minds are polluted by misinformation. I’m saddened by the lack of concern for the greater good. I’m disgusted by the selfish politicians, religious leaders and news organizations who perpetuate the falsehoods. We live in a very dangerous time."
2021-08-08 13:01:43,"I show my Covid rage where it can do the most good/harm. I only make reservations (for outdoor dining) at places where all staff and customers are required to wear masks. Those eateries that allow unmasked workers lose my monetary support.
And if Darwin’s Theory of Natural Selection is also a business model, I relish the thought that my not so random and very calculated decisions add to the  selection pressure on them to adapt or become extinct."
2021-08-08 13:02:53,"I’m looking at this surge as Darwinism in action, crass as that appears. Unfortunately and sadly, covid will claim the lives of some of our best and brightest as it did before Delta appeared. And it’s the nature of a virus to mutate. I hope we never get to the end of the Greek alphabet."
2021-08-08 13:03:17,"What's causing most of the vaccine skepticism are broadcasting and social media outlets that profit from disinformation, completely unregulated. 

In an environment where you can make tidy sums of money for lying, is it any surprise that some people do?

This is selfish in the extreme. What happened to looking after others that might die if they get infected? What happened to being concerned for all of our fellow humans?

I politely asked him about to mask mandate on the door, and he replied, “yes, everyone has to wear a mask.”  The only thing preventing my jaw from hitting the floor was my mask.  At this point, I had had enough of the nonsense, so I called him out on it. After a minute of fumbling around he reluctantly put on a mask.

What has being uninsured in rural America got to do with vaccine hesitancy? I too live in rural America, and the shots here are free to anyone who will take them. 

I also get that people dislike the medical establishment because they associate it with enormous billings and debt. And yet many of these same people, some of whom are my neighbors, regularly turn up on election day and vote in legislators who oppose nearly any measure that would expand the affordability of health care for your neighbors and mine. So, they seem crippled by their distrust of the system, and then they vote to continue crippling themselves. These are not people who will be convinced to go get vaccinated by our presentation to them of yet more facts.

We are in the midst of an enormous social experiment to determine the depth of civilisation. We know that we live under a veneer of rules and customs, which mandate that we  voluntarily give up certain freedoms in order to have better lives. We are finding out how thin that veneer really is. 

The facts are showing that about a third of us (more in some areas, such as my own) must be forced to give up any of their freedoms for the common good. They would just rather go it alone or take their chances on faith and luck. They are immune to a benign presentation of additional facts. Isn't this the point at which we need to start our search for the question of, ""What on earth do we do about COVID?"""
2021-08-08 13:14:43,"What you don't seem to realize is:

That the people who are NOT vaccinated allow the virus to mutate to probably a more deadly virus and possibly one that will be resistant to the vaccine.  
And that will allow the virus to be around longer.  Much longer than necessary if people, whoever they are continue to refuse the vaccine.
Sorry, Sarah, I have no compassion for those people.  If they want to die, let them.  And let them pay for their treatment; no government help.  
However, they are putting the lives of health care workers in jeopardy.  Those hard-working, dedicated people who are suffering under long and difficult working conditions and are having to see people die every day.  They are putting the lives of their neighbors in jeopardy.
They are putting the economy in jeopardy.

He also held superspreader events where disease limiting protocols were lampooned. To give the head lemming credit, he did help in the development of the vaccine.

Ignorance is not just killing those who refuse to wear masks and get vaccinated on grounds that it violates ""freedom of choice"" (what about seatbelt-wearing?); Ignorance is also killing our health-care system, legal system, and more -- indeed, our whole Society.

For every issue ever argued between opposing humans, understanding and acceptance quickly fizzle for those who vigorously, unequivocally, and WRONGLY argue a viewpoint proven Contrary to Fact and/or Civility and who simultaneously refuse to improve themselves -- even when the proofs are provided.

In defiance of bigotry, Congressman John Lewis RIGHTLY walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

In the same way, Americans are RIGHTLY walking in defiance of those individuals -- and their disgusting ""leaders"", DeSantis, Abbott, Parson, etc. -- who pooh-pooh Covid restrictions,

Since the pandemic erupted, here in San José we've been treated to huge amounts of road rage.

Aggressive freeway driving increased for a while, but the return of traffic congestion is impeding the onslaught in 2020 of 100-mph speeders.

Since traffic-law enforcement disappeared with the pandemic's onset, congestion is the main a deterrent.

More noticeable is the number of people with violently loud exhaust and audio systems. They've turned the city in a cacophony of noise, day and night. Plus sideshows, screeching tires, and people driving 60 mph on city streets meant for 30 or 40.

Here too, traffic-law and noise enforcement is minimal or nonexistent.

This is the peri-pandemic increase in anger I see in physical form. Anger about people's vaccinations or masking shows up mainly on my Facebook newsfeed. That is easy to tune out, unlike the rise in Dodge Charger RT drivers blasting misogynist or N-word-laden hip-hop and triggering car burglar alarms with their exhaust systems. The pandemic has unleashed the vulgarians, and they misbehave with impunity."
2021-08-07 19:54:52,"Rage is pointless.  Winning a war is about doing what needs to be done.  ""We will fight them on the beaches  . . . we will never surrender.""  What needs to be done is vax and wear a high quality mask.  All advanced countries produce anti-viral masks (also called respirators), designed to protect health care workers in Covid ICUs. 

The N95, made in the US, is the only mask approved by the FDA.  The downside is the higher cost and discomfort.  Many people find them hard to breathe through.  N95s are available on Staples and Office Depot websites.

Two other widely available masks are the KN95 and KF94.
The KN95 is made in China.  This mask is less thick than the N95 and much easier to breathe through.  They are also a fraction of the cost.
The KF94 is made in South Korea and tested by their government.  It shares the advantages of the Chinese mask: easier to breathe through and less expensive.

NBC News has done a piece on where to get authentic KN95s.

I want to stress that all three masks have been battled-tested in Covid-care settings.  All three masks are sturdy and reusable in the light virus context of the supermarket.  If you regard your office as a heavy virus context, you can disinfect by placing the mask in a sealed paper bag for three days and then discarding after five uses.

That goes for: Republican Governors who actually prevent businesses, cities, or school boards, from mandating masks or vaccines. Also, media who willfully profit by spreading misinformation: Facebook, Fox, OAN, Newsmax, RT (a Russian internet channel clearly working in the interest of a hostile foreign power). 

Those who actually prohibit others from enforcing public health on their own territories are most definitely committing murder in the first degree, full stop. Those who spread misinformation are committing some lesser degree of it -- we know that, statistically speaking, a higher proportion of, say, the Fox audience is less likely to take a vaccine and more likely to die or kill others by spreading it. 

The President needs to quit temporizing and get this behavior limited by any means necessary. The 1905 Supreme Court precedent of Jacobson v. Massachusetts, which affirmed the constitutionality of that State's smallpox vaccine mandate, provides lots of ammunition should he dare to use it."

The school’s response to that now is basically “I got mine, Jack. If you send your kids to school, he/she may be the only one wearing a mask in the class. Tough luck.” It’s infuriating and if these folks think I’ll be giving any money to the PTA or buy the lie that the school is “a part of the community”, they will need to think again.

The barriers are mental.  Fear and confusion that is encouraged by the lowest political actors in the country keeps people from a life saving procedure.  The discomfort from the vax is, as the author's 2nd shot provider said, is better than a tube down your throat.  There's a lot to fear about our often indifferent medical industry, but the vax keeps it away from you.  Why is that so hard to understand?"

As far as I'm concerned, I do want them to renounce all hospital care if they become seriously ill. I'm done trying to ""understand"" them."

The economic caste system, the greed, the lack of insurance and education are most likely, just like she writes, big parts of the problem but not by far the whole story. It's clear that human beings are capable of acting terribly stupid and selfish and destructive and sometimes a critical mass of people acting like this  forms and then we have ""anti-vaxxers"". I've seen so much suffering up close caused by this pandemic that to think of people acting in a way that might prolong and worsen it again, I think to feel anything but enraged is just being in denial."

The public’s health trumps every single reason the author cites to explain vaccine hesitancy. It’s not a close call. We need to mandate vaccines, now. To have this miraculous tool available to us, KNOWING THAT WE CAN END THIS PANDEMIC, and not use it is simply idiotic. Enough already."

Ducey's is a merciless attack on education, on lives, and on communities.  We all read about Florida's and Texas's demented governors.

We're talking decades of rampant poverty, lack of education, drug and alcohol abuse, divorce, children out of wedlock, obesity, lower life expectancies, inequality, etc in these areas...and the usual scapegoating of immigrants, minorities, the media, and other poor people all along the way.

And if some of us have to quit our jobs to make it work, so be it. The CDC can be as wreckless and irresponsible as it wants.

That “freedom” they cling to, oh forgive me, those “freedoms” with an idiotic ‘s’,  have consequences. It seems inevitable that an even more deadly variant will soon emerge regardless of the few stragglers we might convince, so getting them inoculated will serve no purpose apart from (in the short term) freeing a few hospital beds for those who deserve them.

Only Blacks have a lower vaccination rate than non-Hispanic whites. 

What matters is vulnerability. Those more likely to die if they are infected are most likely to get vaccinated. For example, CDC data shows 92.4% of Americans age 65-74 are vaccinated while 58.6% of Americans age 25-39 are vaccinated.

I’ve had the Pfizer shots and didn’t even wear a mask, because the common directive from the authorities then was that masks were not necessary while outdoors. While there I noticed they were giving COVID-19 vaccinations in the stadium, and people were getting vaccinated. That kind of blew my mind, since there were over 20,000 people there and only a tiny percentage of them were wearing masks. Seriously, can you imagine going to a large public event right now while unmasked and unvaccinated? Hello, Sturgis! Anyway, yesterday there’s a headline in the NYT that Austin’s COVID-19 situation is out of control, and all I could think about is whether that game had something to do with it.

We should be over-the-top angry that elected leaders have not mandated vaccines and quarantined those who refuse; that largely funded by big insurance, block effective national health care. 

A new report from the Commonwealth Fund provides a sobering if unsurprising assessment of the health care system in America. Compared to similarly wealthy countries, the U.S. scored dead last in most measures of decent health care, which included having the highest infant and maternal mortality rate.

I can understand the initial suspicions of black people, but there is just too much evidence now that the vaccines are safe, even for that suspicion to make sense. Millions of people have died from COVID. NO ONE has died from the vaccine.

If everyone had been vaccinated in timely fashion, we wouldn't be having this new surge. It's irrational not to be vaccinated and a threat to public health. 

So, yes, it makes sense that the vaccinated are outraged at the irrational selfishness that is ruining it for everyone. And, giving the virus a vast petri dish in which to evolve to a variant that evades the vaccine. 

The feelings of the unvaccinated are not as important as public health and the chance to get back to ordinary life. Mandate the vaccine now. If you don't get it, fine, but you can't get on a plane or eat in a restaurant. Welcome to your 'freedom'.

Then, everyone who did get vaccinated will suffer again. Even though we did our part, even though we tried. To not get the vaccine is selfish and foolish. The excuses of not getting the vaccine for [insert reasons here] are just that, excuses. Besides the conspiracy nutjobs, I think most people who aren't vaccinated know better. I mean, literally millions of people have gotten the vaccine with only the extremely rare side effects. Hundreds of thousands have died from the virus. I can not accept any excuses and I'm tired of pretending like  their 'concerns' and 'hesitancy' matters when the greater good is at stake. No, I won't be nice about it.

As for access, every CVS, Walgreens, and most supermarket chains have pharmacies offering vaccines, with no lines these days.  And if you don’t know the vaccines are free, you must be living under a rock.  
In the end, there are no excuses, just pure selfishness."

In order of priority: the FDA must officially sanction those vaccines which have, through 165 million experiences, proven safe and effective. This will constitute a mandate for the military - and should for all federal workers. The next step is to extend federal mask mandates already in effect for air and train travel which should extend to refusing Medicare and Medicaid treatments for those without a vetted and acceptable reason for not getting a vaccination. This increase in requirements will then spill over to health insurance companies which will have legal basis for refusing to pay for those without coronavirus inoculations. All of these things will help provide political cover for the reprehensible state governors and state legislators who are afraid to protect the majority because they fear the extremists. The final persuasion, unfortunately, will only be when the hold out diehards see their friends and family and neighbors and co-workers pass away.

I am so enraged in my neglect I can hardly sleep.  But my daughter helped put things in perspective by telling me many companies and service agency employees are working from home where their sense of corporate responsibility diluted by their responsibilities to their families while many businesses are experiencing a dearth of employees.  So instead of my demanding the same level of professionalism to which I have become accustomed, I am providing more empathy on my end with the hope for reciprocation.

For many, getting the flu offers the possibility of concerned family and medical staff, and easy flight from the hard work of being human--or conversely, proof-positive that the fates don't have you in mind if you don't get it. This attitude of despair, layered over a secret yearning for suicide, was prevalent in my area of the world, long before Trump ran for office. These are the people that he and so many others take advantage of. An alarming number of people just happen to hit lone trees by the side of straight and empty country roads. Health problems, obesity, drugs, opiates, alcohol and the couch in front of the TV all just coincidentally keep the populace weak, uncritical, and ineffectual.

Everyone has access to the vaccine, usually at little or no cost. Everyone knows about COVID and the vaccines to fight it. Unless you're a hermit, it is impossible not to know. Several people I know closely are unvaccinated, not because they don't know, but because they refuse to get vaccinated.  Some for health reasons, real or imagined. Some for religious reasons. Some for their own private reasons.  If you're unvaccinated it's not because of barriers, it's because you chose not to get vaccinated."

Well, we all know who has mocked and denigrated medical experts and their advice through this pandemic.

And who has for decades blocked every attempt by democrats to enact universal healthcare.

How do you argue or even discuss rationally any topic with those who don't believe in science, facts, experts and don't care about their fellow citizens. 

The fact that taking the vaccine helps everyone, especially in an emergency, means nothing to them.

Most of us have had it with the party of greed and selfishness, and who believe they have the freedom to harm you because that's their supposed constitutional right.

The degreed experts said over a year ago that it was highly likely there would be new surges and variants. And that there will likely be more to come, maybe for many years.

Isn't it time for mandates whether the anti vaxxers like it or not. Seems not only wise but also the decent, caring thing to do. 

And hopefully those of us who are sane can somehow vote the GOP out, or we'll be having the same discussion 100 years from now."

Of course they do not admit to being members of the sheep flock -they will give excuses, such as not trusting the science.  How many polls even have a choice like ""I am refusing vaccination because it is what my leaders tell me to do and what my friends are doing""?

This does not just pertain to the effects of Republican propaganda, but also to other groups which may have a tradition or active cult of resisting vaccination. Belonging to the chosen group and doing what they do is often more important than life itself. Nobody wants to be an outcast."

Ironically, these people, who held such incorrect views, were the most organized and savvy advocacy group around. They would show up in force any time the committee considered a bill that was even remotely favorable to vaccination. This was pre-COVID, but what I learned talking to all of these people is that their views come from deep down places just like yours. If you get hostile and aggressive without taking time to listen, you will not persuade them. Many of them are not persuadable. That is why vaccine mandates are necessary. Some people get vaccinated due to the carrot. Others require the stick. It is just a fact of large groups of people, and it has been since vaccines were invented, that some portion has to be forced to do it by law. Just look up Jacobson v. Massachusetts and you’ll see a detailed recitation of the exact same argument happening in 1905 when the smallpox vaccine came around. The state mandates its use and people protested, but the mandate worked and the Supreme Court found it constitutional. Enough carrot, give them the stick."
2021-08-08 13:50:30,"Every ICU bed taken by a COVID patient is a bed that might be needed for others with serious illness, such as the elderly.
Do the people who refuse to be vaccinated not understand that their selfishness could lead to an elder person dying because of the lack of an ICU bed for them?"
2021-08-08 13:53:15,"I am feeling more sad than angry.  The pandemic laid bare the reality that there are many among us who have given up on the basic responsibilities of citizenship.  Respect for other human beings.  Respect for reason.  Respect for our republican institutions.  All of these seem to have fallen by the wayside these last 18 months.  In time, the pandemic disease will almost certainly wane and we will get the mechanics of our lives back.  But I am less sure that we will get our society back.  My sadness comes from the sense that we’ve squandered the very things that make life worth living."
2021-08-08 13:54:12,How is it an economic issue when the vaccine is free?
2021-08-08 13:59:13,So much emphasis in the American press on those who refused the vaccine.    What about those who got both shots early in the year and are now due for a booster only to find out boosters aren't available?
2021-08-08 14:00:24,"Anger is a cover for resentment.  And it seems like we are consumed with resentment these days -- for those who want things back to ""normal"" but then do everything in their power to not take the steps that would allow that to happen, for those whose sanctimonious judgements (on both sides) further take us, all citizens, away from what is important.  We, are in this, whether it is a battle against COVID, a war against our enemies, or coming together for the country, together.  And if we let our resentments continue to determine our actions, we are no better than animals, fighting over the last piece of food."
2021-08-08 14:01:18,"OK, you decide if I should be angry. 
A family of four moved in next door to me yesterday. Maskless, the mother, walks up close to my grandson, daughter and husband introducing herself. I followed with greetings of my own. My family are all vaccinated. 
After 5 minutes of conversation alone with this person she reveals she has covid, no vaccination, her two sons have it. She has not sought medical treatment or further testing. ""It's been two weeks, I'm getting over it, but my lungs still hurt."" ""I take a lot of vitamins and have been meditating everyday trying to relax my body."" No medical followup, no vaccination, no testing, no mask and she thinks she and her sons still have remnants of Covid.
It wasn't rage I felt, I was merely astonished and did not recognize the planet I was living on and who these people are occupying it. I guess I later found rage in: outrageous."
2021-08-08 14:01:48,"Thank you for this.  A family member refuses to be vaccinated and so the entire household is unvaccinated.  College educated, comfortably middle income, insured.  The rest of us veer from angry, righteous, frustrated, frightened, compassionate, and back to anger. 

When the anger overwhelms me, I will do my best to remember the blessing of my first shot."
2021-08-08 14:02:30,"Such a powerful observation here: ""the health care system, better known to the uninsured as a crippling source of debt than a helpful provider of cures.""

Medical billing in this country is one giant scam.  Prices are never given in advance, and facilities prey on the desperate, who have no choice but to hand over a blank check on the way in.  Naturally, this undermines trust.  Vax rates would probably be higher if people weren't justifiably scared of surprise bills."
2021-08-08 14:02:52,"I love that nurse's comment during the second shot.  Yes, understanding does not necessarily mean approving or even accepting.  The understanding can lead to a way to persuade behavior change, as any person willing to try to understand would know--not just Ms. Smarsh and someone like myself as a psychologist.  (BTW, part of my attempt to understand her mention of an insurance might involve concerns about having any adverse effects of the vaccination, despite that they are cost free and incidents of such effects have been at least statistically very low.)  Yes, anger--along with fear--can be very contagious, along with unfounded and distorted beliefs that can be readily manipulated by demagogues.  The temptation is to join it, although that urge can be mitigated by (as least somewhat smugly) by keeping in mind that it is a sign of maturity to redirect it instead.  Trying to keep a mature attitude can also thwart the demagogues' ploy of ""divide and conquer"" (for what? ""Follow the money"" for them).  The middle way between aggression and passivity is assertiveness.  Like a tightrope walk over Niagara Falls, it's the most difficult to do but best.  Ms. Smarsh provides an excellent outline of the process, although people working through any ""barriers"" to vaccination might not have as much of a tightrope walk as those using assertive persuasion to do so."

In my opinion children (since kids don't control their parents even if they are old enough to be vaccinated) and vaccinated adults (excluding those who have a valid medical reason why they couldn't get one) should have first priority getting those beds if they need them. The adults have made their choice. There are consequences to choices. One of the consequences should be no hospital bed or intensive care bed for the unvaccinated adults if a vaccinated adult or child needs it and there aren't enough beds for everyone who needs them."
2021-08-08 14:03:26,"Great article, and thought provoking. 

 I am very angry with the unvaccinated in my own country, where we generally have a better-educated population and an excellent, easily-accessed healthcare system, which is not profit-driven. The vaccine distribution - once it got going - was fair and focused, and by late May everyone over the age of 12 could get vaccinated with very little effort. 
Yet we are still afflicted by people who refuse the vaccine. Many of them are conservative Christians who have been mean-spirited and sometimes downright evil throughout the pandemic. Many of them are easily influenced by their peers and the internet. It is infuriating, and the time is passed for us to be gentle and accepting."
2021-08-08 14:04:22,"I don't know what the answer is at this point. I do know that righteous indignation, resentment, rage, and the desire to punish, is for many, a self satisfying road map that doesn't lead to a good destination. We seem to have set up a perfect system for our self destruction. COVID is a harbinger of many relentless diseases and problems that await us.  It's a terrible shame that we don't have the patience, maturity and the capacity for reflection that is required of adults to live in a functioning world. It's heartbreaking."
2021-08-08 14:04:31,"As a doctor and scientist I can state with certainty, it is unscientific that the FDA has not approved the vaccines.  I am hard pressed to name another medicine or vaccine that has proven as safe and as effective as the mRNA vaccines."

2021-08-08 14:05:57,"The author comes very close to telling us we need to blame the system and not the individual, and in our American culture of supposed self-reliance, that is hard advice to swallow. And from a philosophical perspective, I cannot accept it, because if I am only a victim of external realities then what am I? So in the abstract, it is easy to get mad at refuseniks, but once you look at a given individual's particular situation and circumstances criticism gives way to some kind of understanding where anger is tempered with empathy. Or so one hopes."
2021-08-08 14:06:05,"Great column Ms. Smarsh!  I drove to rural Florida yesterday to clean my mom's house. (She recently had knee replacement surgery) and persuaded my 81 year old dad to go to Publix and get the vaccine, a giant personal victory in this battle.  I find myself angry at many people also.  Thanks for the balance!"
2021-08-08 14:12:02,"I am a  semi - Retired Nurse Practitioner  who got the vaccine 6 months ago and yes I am angry at people who refuse to get vaccinated ! Public Health Officials for many months have been putting out  information on Social Media, the radio , TV  and any other way they can reach the pubic - Daily I see posts of Facebook, and tweeter with facts and advice . SO I disagree with the writer that Pub;oic Heath Officials need to so a better job- What would be helpful from them is stress  the safety of the vaccines and that they are Free and most people have no side effects and go about their normal lives. There have been vaccine clinics sert up at schools, in public spaces, community centers, churches, and even the New York City Subway.And groups have tried their best to to underserved neighborhoods to offer the vaccine.

Some folks are fearful and not educated enough to be able to sort out facts from fiction /conspiracy theories and false news . But these folks are putting the rest of us at risk and  I can no longer be tolerant and compassionate - not when children's hospitals in states with low vaccine rates are full of kids under 12 who obviously got infected either fom their parents , friends  or neighbors - and these kids are too young to get the vaccine. Other peoples reluctance or opposition to the vaccine caused this ! Public officials like the Governor  of Florida  need to let Health Offials handle this Pandemic and be Quiet!"
2021-08-08 14:12:16,"People love anger, they love to feel angry, right or left, it doesn’t matter, people love to feel anger.  
Especially righteous anger. 
Anger gives energy, it gives the illusion of purpose and meaning.  It feels powerful. It gives the illusion of control. 
It focuses on Those People, it deflects from becoming aware of self. It overwhelms thought processes, it sweeps away ability to think in a logical way. It feels big, it feels important. 
Righteous anger. It feels so good. 
It is addictive. People don’t want it to subside, it takes over, it becomes chronic, people actually go searching for something to feel angry about. 
I see this happening to old friends and family, and all I can do is to be careful about my own emotional health."

And I don't think it's ""venomous"" to talk about the possibility of not treating people who could get vaccinated and won't - I believe that adults should understand that decisions have consequences and be prepared to accept them. More than that, I just find it a very poor social bargain to trade the health and lives of our healthcare workers for these people."

Also one of the few - if not the only - articles I've read that addresses level of education as a factor behind vaccination refusal. Those with less education might be more inclined to vaccinate if there were more public service/educational announcements on their televisions and on social media. Not to mention a poster campaign similar to ""Uncle Sam Needs You!"""

I ask myself these questions every day. 

The pandemic, in all of its aspects, has been a call to action for humanity. There are many who have answered that call. I honor them and have tried to find, in a small way, personal actions to answer that call."
2021-08-08 14:30:56,"My anger is directed at 1. China, which brought this mess to the world and will not ever voluntarily own up to its guilt; 2. The media and the Democrats, who could have worked early with the Trump administration instead of spending 24 hours per day bashing it (Warp Speed has yet to receive the credit it deserves for fast-tracking vaccine development); 3. Trump himself for not listening to his advisors, especially when he was ill with Covid and not fully comprehending his situation; 4. The lunatics at all points in the political spectrum who will not get one of the most successful vaccines in the history of medical science; and 5. The seriously phobic who expect the entire world to shut down because they, the phobic, want to live forever in isolation, masked and distanced.  When is the media going to address numbers 1, 2, 4, and 5? I’ve been waiting since roughly March of last year. What action do I intend to take? Vote against every Democrat in 2022 (as in 2016 and 2020) and against Trump in the Republican primary if he chooses to run. We have to move ahead, but not in the “progressive” direction."
2021-08-08 14:31:34,"It's not just the ""hesitancy"" or yes, laziness to get the potentially life-saving vaccine that we all paid for with blood and tax dollars.  It's the willful defiance against the simplest of steps like wearing a mask, or avoiding situations that we know will cause spread, the obstinance and foolish bravado and antipathy that they show to everyone else. All while bemoaning and blaming others for economic disruptions, school and restaurant shut-downs.  They are taxing the health systems and hospital workers that we all must depend on for everything other than covid-19. Just drill down on the excellent charts and data provided in this paper and see how many ICU beds are available in your nearest hospital.  They are the luckiest people on the entire planet and all they have is grievance. Give me a break."
2021-08-08 14:31:45,"Yes, here in the USA we have problems with the anti-vaxxer and the unvaxxed.  But do you truly really think we will ever get past Covid?

Yes, there will come a point in time where there will be less exposure - like small pox - like measles - like the plague.  However, none of those diseases are truly gone.  They just are waiting until we meet their requirements to re-enter the public domain.  Even today we occasionally hear of cases of the plague.

So Covid is never going to go away, it is eventually just going to become less visual and less of a problem to the majority of people in this world."
2021-08-08 14:31:52,"I’m more disappointed than feeling any rage. On the one hand I feel truly sad some can’t find it in themselves to essentially “save a life” as the writer points out. On the other I feel truly sad we’re in a “profit-over-life” paradigm also laid out as a reason for our current state. Yet, I think the two are inextricably mixed. The writer hints at that in characterizing us as a caste-based society—assets and liabilities. Chilling. Let’s start looking at one another as individuals with innate value and not as dollar signs."

During this summer of the Delta variant and extreme weather disasters including severe flooding and out-of- control wild fires in locations which have never experienced them before, I thought about who made me angrier, antivaxxers  or climate-change deniers,   I realized the extent they overlapped.  Both are incapable of  empathy toward those who they're endangering and of rational decision-making based on evidence. You're a better woman than I am if you can manage to have a calm conversation with someone who refuses to listen to you  and you remain able to focus less on those whose actions are beyond your control."
2021-08-08 14:37:01,"A very important article. Covid is not the greatest pandemic humanity is experiencing. It is rage. Rage against the unvaccinated. Rage against those who would mandate vaccination. Rage against lockdowns. Rage against those who oppose lockdowns. Rage against politicians and their supporters. Rage against the police. Rage against white people. Rage against black people. Rage against the Chinese. Rage against climate change deniers. Rage against those who would impose restrictions in order to reduce emissions... Our rage seems endless. 

We will all, perhaps, experience incandescent rage at some time in our lives. Possibly the greatest rage occurs when we find ourselves completely powerless to alleviate the suffering of someone very dear to us, when things might have been different, we believe, if [x, y or z .] However fear and deep-rooted dislike of forced change are also great generators of rage.

It is natural, perhaps even necessary for a time, to look for someone or something to blame for what we perceive as an unjustifiably unjust universe. God, other people, whoever. But there comes a moment of choice. Will I allow this rage to permanently embitter and warp who I am, or will I choose differently? 

What that choice looks like will be different for different people.But there IS a choice. And it is really important. It will shape who we become and, collectively, who our communities and nations become. It will shape our future."

Many of my siblings, but not all, are  also not getting the vaccine, and they probably won't until a death hits them directly, and maybe not even then.  So, we limit our exposure, but it is causing a strain because we don't want to get together with unvaccinated family. As African Americans, we understand why this is, and no amount of ""But, in THIS particular case, the vaccine...."" will change anyone's mind.

2021-08-08 14:39:33,"First of all, Ms. Smarsh, let me say how much I enjoyed your thoughtful book. It was my best nonfiction read of last year. Thank you. I'm less outraged than weary regarding those refusing to be vaccinated for the general public good. Weary that they are always behind the curve on healthcare, education, and showing tolerance for all marriage. I'm weary of trying to drag all these people kicking and screaming into the 20th Century, let along the 21st."
2021-08-08 14:44:36,"Here's the thing... this anger is not something that just arrived, out of nowhere, with Covid. This anger has been seething since 2016 and is directed at that portion of our populace that embraced, and continues to embrace, the toxic, destructive politics of Trump, and which has now moved on to the toxic, destructive politics of anti-vaccination. Every demographic study clearly describes a near-perfect correlation between Republican, Trump-supporting red states and vaccination refusal.

We're not angry at poor, disenfranchised, health care-skeptical people who can't afford to miss a day of work. We're not angry at immune compromised people for whom the vaccination might prove worse than Covid itself. And we're not angry at unvaccinated children. We're angry at the Ron DeSantis's, the Greg Abbott's, the Tucker Carlson's, the Laura Ingram's and the mindless ignorance of the people who parrot their dangerous, nonsensical drivel. We're angry at the people who can, but refuse to be vaccinated.

But more than that, we're sick to death --- literally --- of being told that it's our responsibility, once again, to be understanding, compassionate, to walk a mile in their shoes, to not judge, not condemn, to offer our hand, to oh-so-carefully, gently persuade them out of their ignorance.

I urge everyone to write letters and help parents and families understand the science . Sitting back and feeling content while people die is definitely not a good idea. I want our President on television today pleading with parents to use masks since it’s our best defense right now . If the governors in Arizona, Texas, and Florida won’t do the right thing , then at least the federal government can hold press conferences focused on kids, young adults and the dangers of the Delta variant .

Whether it's the dissolving democracy I thought I once lived in, or a catastrophic global pandemic, I no longer recognize my country. Black, white, brown, plaid, poor, middle class, rich. It's all ME instead of WE, regardless of what one blames that on. And on that note, I'll say this: there are legitimate obstacles for lower income/poor people to have not yet been vaccinated, but my personal observation as one who spent a childhood both being poor and observing, obstacles are many times excuses that rationalize bad decisions. This opinion piece's data, and all others like it fail to account for human nature, which is indifferent to its host's circumstances. Human nature demands personal comfort...not always doing what's right—or even necessary."

It was for the Common Good, a phrase that is no longer in our lexicon.  I fear Americans no longer have anything in common beyond ""homo sapiens.""

We are at the point where health insurers need to mandate vaccines and deny coverage for covid-related illness, and full hospitals need to say ""we're so sorry, we can't admit you"" if you chose not to take the gift of a vaccination.  

We cannot expect first responders to sacrifice their lives, and their family's lives, to those who made their own choice not to vaccinate.

I do not enjoy ostracizing people, but managing the health & well-being of my elderly in-laws and primary-school grandchildren has been exhausting.  I cannot imagine how younger families are managing.  I have cut off unvaccinated friends - I cannot be the one who puts the kids at risk.

We have the power to end this, and it's at the tip of a 1/2"" needle.  We cannot cede this power to skeptics, deniers & conspiracy theorists.

We have made as much progress as we have (still six months before the earliest predictions of a vaccine!) because of scientists and researchers and supply chain managers and admins working together perhaps like the world has never seen before.

Their reasons run the gamut from fear of side effects to belief that the vaccine is suspect. And now that many hospitals have begun to mandate vaccines some are starting petitions to get public support to get the hospitals to reverse their decisions, and threatening to quit.

I'm fresh out of patience and empathy and now favor sanctions, including rationing of hospital beds, which should be made available to the unvaccinated ONLY if they are not otherwise needed and charged to private, not public, insurance or as out of pocket care. 

Just like for the people who pulled guns on firefighters when asked to evacuate, the consequences should be on them. Unfortunately with Covid, the consequences are on all of us: deaths, suffering, small business closures, schools compromised, isolation and its mental health sequelae, all of our lives disrupted. 

That is not freedom; that's tyranny."

2021-08-08 14:59:40,"When I am calm about the case levels rising and anti-vaxx people contracting the delta variant, I try to console myself that it is simply Darwinian forces at work.  Those vaccinated will survive and the Republicans who believe disinformation (about many subjects) will die off and all this may help rebalance the nation.

But normally, I am not calm.  I fret about my granddaughters' exposure since they are too young for life-saving doses.  I have a brother who lives in Europe who hasn't taken the vaccine because, ""of course you know there are problems with the two US vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna)"", none of which he elaborated upon.  I don't even discuss the subject with him anymore.  

A year ago, all this was tolerable because we just didn't know enough about the virus and there were no vaccines available.  That is not the case this summer.  ""Leaders"" like di Santis and Abbot are craven killers and I hope the voters of FL and TX remember that when they come up for reelection--or, God forbid--a run for the presidency.

All that said, I pray every night for those infected and for the exhausted, unrelieved healthcare workers who continue to fight valiantly to save them."

The latest covid legislation provides for up to three days of paid leave to cover missed work due to side effects.  This is not an access or economic justice issue.   I am sick of the excuses.

2021-08-08 14:09:40,"I’m saddened to see that most of the replies don’t reflect the content of the article. I have often said to people that a “good salesman” listens to his customers & respectfully answers their concerns.
Why, in God’s name, would you think that calling people stupid was an affective sales technique? 

It’s so interesting that when the angry vaccinated imagine the unvaccinated, they imagine a “knuckle dragging white man”. Never mind that all races show similar rates of reluctance to vaccinate. Never mind that the rural “Red” states are home to a high percentage of minorities who are unvaccinated at the same rate as whites. Don’t bother me with facts, folks.

DeSantis has encouraged people to get vaccinated & said mask wearing was appropriate in certain settings. He is only objecting to government mandates. Many businesses in Florida require masks inside & DeSantis supports their right to do that. Let’s get the science straight here…the science says that young children are the least likely to spread the virus & do not contract the virus at significant rates. The last I read no child without significant underlying conditions had been hospitalized by Covid. All adults have the option to get vaccinated including school personnel. How does “the science” support young children wearing masks? The CDC has bent to the politics of Covid. Yeah, I’m sure the some readers will be typing a reply to my comments but I have one rebuttal…follow the science."

It has never been like this in human history.  Change is accelerating yearly as the scientific and technological revolution accelerates.  The tools we made yesterday are helping us learn and create more today. The only way this is stopped is with the collapse of society.

This collapse is now a very real possibility.  The cause of it would be the minds of conservatives - unwilling to change, to even learn.  NOW humanity must change or die. 

Obviously there is much resistance.  This resistance is NOW a threat to our existence - both politically and environmentally.   I fear the outcome.

Christianity is a fine religion for children.  I enjoyed it greatly.  But an adult must put away childish things.  Personal choice??  WHAT ABOUT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY?"
2021-08-08 13:45:05,"Since COVID-19 vaccinations are free, economic status and insurance coverage doesn’t affect vaccination rates. Neither does majority/minority status. CDC data shows American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Native Hawaiians, Hispanics, and Other People have higher vaccination rates than non-Hispanic whites. Only Blacks have a lower vaccination rate than non-Hispanic whites. 

What matters is vulnerability. Those more likely to die if they are infected are most likely to get vaccinated. For example, CDC data shows 92.4% of Americans age 65-74 are vaccinated while 58.6% of Americans age 25-39 are vaccinated.

So, watch videos about this for the best expression of it, but know you can get relief by countering habitual postures.  Most of us, here, know we focus forward at screens much of the day, intensely.  This is creating a build up of tunneled stimulus in our neurobiology.  Anxiety.

Folks struggling to control or reduce intrusive thoughts due to trauma try moving their eyes side to side while revisiting those traumas, and find they can reframe the memories by seeing more than their internal picture.  

As we have been assaulted for years by a trigger happy party and a blood thirsty press, try this when you need to reset.

Sit down.  Rest one hand on the crown of your head, no pulling.  Drop your head, ear toward shoulder, easily.  No pushing.  Look the opposite direction up toward the ceiling intently.  No worry about blurry.  Keep that up until you want to stop.  The longer the better.  Rest.  Do the other side.

You will find you have reset your vagus nerve by engaging your para-sympathetic nervous system.  You’re should find yourself producing saliva, swallowing, yawning, even looking at things other than screens.

Ear touching can also trigger this reset.

Got to get out of the tunnel and use your outside eyes.  Helps a lot.  We can be informed, but need to know the story doesn’t change just because we checked, again.  Look at other things until it does."

At the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, I was working at a local urgent care and we were relegated to doing curbside triage, testing and physicals in the snow, wind and sleet without PPE. I'd have irresponsible, maskless young 20 something year olds, shrugging off ""I don't have the virus"" but wanting a Z-pak for a ""sinus infection"" with symptoms of the sniffles for the past three days. You know what, medicine isn't like going to Panera. You don't get to choose chips or an apple as your side. It's based in science. You can't deny the virus but then want antibiotics for a UTI or the common cold. We need to bring common sense back to the U.S. as a core value. Rage? Yes, I have plenty of it. And PTSD and fear. This isn't over by a long shot. We need to elect officials who believe in science and medicine. The virus isn't red or blue. Enough already!"

The first abomination was Scott Walker, arrogant and uneducated, who took pride in believing he invented divide and conquer. Then came Trump, the worst of all, who only because of a fluke of our 18th century government, got to become president despite losing the popular vote. Then Republican politicians worshiping in the church of Trump, used and use this terrible plague for partisan political purposes; to divide and conquer.

However, there are worse, more apocalyptic issues out there, all relating to climate change, global warming and the devastating effects of the resulting fires and extreme weather events. These may well prove to be unsurvivable. For political reasons, many conservative politicians and pastors prefer to keep their flocks uninformed and/or willfully ignorant so their coffers continue to be juiced by the fossil fuel industry and those who profit from it.

The author gently reminds us that for many of us vaccination is part of our overall privilege, as we have easy access, health insurance and jobs that would allow time off for vaccination and for the rare instances of serious side effects. It is a point well-taken that empathy, encouragement, help and support are the best reactions to this cohort.

However, this sort of contrived anti-science mindset for the sake of some sort of pseudo-libertarian fellowship or to stick it to the “libs” or to support Trump/oppose Biden or to declare a religious “Jesus will cure us” religious liberty right is treacherous.

He was to me a patriot.
Now I can go on social media and read comments from folks who claim refusing a vaccine is patriotic, forcing children into schools with no masks is patriotic, who believe taking part in an attack on the Capitol is patriotic, who believe a corrupt Russian agent who is still trying to enact a coup is a true patriot, who believe hating others and having guns is patriotic.

All around us the hideous selfishness of the Trumpers seethed as they flaunted the wokeness of their 30 and 40 something age-based immunity -- all while our elders died quietly alone in nursing homes and adult care facilities. 

From the beginning, Covid was going to bring suffering -- a lot of it.  But it didn't have to be this severe.  It was made severe by the machinations of that segment of Republicans skilled at leveraging the virtuous entitlement to anti-community -- they call it ""freedom"" --  felt by their base.

Trump realized early on that the virus couldn't be controlled and was scared he'd be blamed for it's destruction (because that what he would do.)  This lack of a national strategy is  what killed us.

The district has eliminated all covid cleaning policies, (yes I know Covid isn't spread via surfaces,) but what about the other viruses that can get people sick and lower their immune system to Covid? Yes, students should be back in school for mental health and learning reasons, but they should not be crammed together forced to breath each others air. As someone who suffers from Covid long haul symptoms, I am stressed, worried, and not coping like I used to, yet there is no mention of how to help teachers cope with the stress and huge workload. Education is a field that heavily relies on free labor from teachers expecting them to work long overtime hours that they are not paid for. I am in no shape to do that anymore and I am very afraid for my own health and the health of my students. The data from studies show that up to 1/2 of all students who get covid will get long haul symptoms. I would not wish this on anyone."

Surely, I thought, we would all agree that Covid-19 should be fought with every means at our disposal:  masking, social distancing, and finally vaccinations.
Silly me.
Now, I realize that this country is truly incapable of uniting on much of anything.
There once was a time, when we could do great things together, regardless of our politics.  “Politics stops at the water’s edge” was what I was told in High School.
Now, it is all about “owning the libs”, the “freedom” to make others sick, the sneering arrogance of the right wing talk show hosts.
So, I am resigned.  
My family is vaccinated.  We get tested regularly.  At work, I wear a mask though most of my co-workers don’t.  I try to stay away from those who are not vaccinated, even if some think this is rude.

In the U.S., Republicans, coalescenced with Ronald Reagan's ""government is the problem"" mantra, and minority groups, especially Blacks, who have had a legit history of government malfeasance, head the list of the unvaccinated. Those of us who still see that our government as basically a positive force for the common good have been vaccinated. Simply put, with this pandemic, it's time to put those grievances against the government to the sid, look at the facts regarding this virus and the vaccine and think, if only for a moment, for the common good of all Americans in which government is offering its help."

Our angry responses towards the unvaccinated only makes it less likely that they will hear us and get vaccinated.

And so it was the same for medicine.  There were public service commercials on TV urging people to get their Rubella vaccine.  Inoculation against German measles and Polio were a given.  And it was a rite of passage to attend a Chickenpox party so that you could get the virus, get sick, and be done with it.
Underlying all was a sense of community and caring about the welfare of others.  Am I naive? No.  I am fully aware that many forms of discrimination were rampant.  But despite the many problems of that time, it was reason and empirical thought that catapulted us forward."

My patients can’t afford to added family debt (hospital co-pays, funeral expenses) or less household income.
Their very need to work during this pandemic is why I’ve seen more than my share of cases and deaths, multigenerational household transmission, and then also the crisis of other care deferred.

So forgive my rage when one of my patients tells me that COVID is a hoax, or that they worry about trackers, or that they “monitor their immune system naturally” or they are suddenly afraid of vaccines (after taking others from me that are so much less effective).  
I hide it as best I can and ask them to call if they want to discuss it all again. I even schedule follow up calls.  
But my soul is crushed.  I can’t compete with Facebook and right wing media. 
And at this point this virus is endemic and still mutating."
2021-08-08 15:17:16,"I really needed the insight, compassion and wise forbearance so beautifully offered in this article. Let’s be thankful we live in a time when vaccines can be so quickly developed and deployed and use different strategies to reach different categories of the resistant. Different communities need to be addressed with leaders who have street cred with those communities. The right wing conspiracy theorists are a relatively small percentage of the unvaccinated. Let them go. Their intransigent irrationality will bring upon them punishment enough. No need to pile on. Use our energies to help those who can be more receptive. We all need to be more vigilant and resist toxic tribalism. Let’s be exceptional Americans."
2021-08-08 15:07:57,"I’m tired of this mess. Carrots and reasoning with the unvaccinated doesn’t work. Maybe it is time to start with the sticks and the biggest stick is economics. Perhaps it is time that Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Aetna, United Healthcare, Kaiser Prmanente, and the other health care insurance companies start raising their insurance premiums and co-pays drastically for the unvaccinated without a medical reason and for the businesses that don’t mandate vaccinations. It may be your body, your choice, but as far as I am concerned it is also your frigging bill if you get sick."

Guess what, your body is already full of antibodies from vaccines, you just don't remember getting them.

You have seen on TV every night, Americans of all ages, colors, religions, professions, regions, levels of affluence, getting the same shot. The messaging is everywhere: the shot is free, convenient, effective, and safe.

Here's a newsflash for those of you in that camp - getting the vaccine not only benefits you but everyone else around you, especially those who are immuno-compromised and children.  Get over yourself and how everything resolves around you and your personal ""freedom.""  

And I'm disgusted by people who parrot what they hear from Fox News that masking their children in school is ""child abuse.""  Or from other sources implying the vaccine is a ""bioweapon.""  Your children have already lost a year or more of school due to the pandemic.  Let's not make it two years ... or worse meaning that we see a large increase of children dying or saddled with severe side-effects that impact them for life. 

For once, think about someone else other than yourself and get the vaccine."
2021-08-08 15:17:15,"I reject the author's argument that mostly we should not be mad.  I'm mad at those who choose non vaccination.  I'm a progressive liberal in a rural red state.  I go to Walmart and I know that 60% of the folks there may be un-vaccinated.  Almost all blacks are masked with us white liberals.  My wife's office, she is the only person vaccinated in a room of 10.  So yes I'm mad.   We are just waiting to get Covid even though we are vaccinated.

If this transgression was different, maybe only the person holding this non vaccination viewpoint got sick we might feel different.  But it is not.  When my state has a ban on masks,  the state health department is woeful, and schools will soon be reporting lice in a youngster's hair but cannot prevent Covid with masks we are rightful to be mad.  

Been exposed to a Covid person try finding a testing center that has tests in stock.  Of course I guess you could go to the ER and grab a $1000 bill for the test.  Having a heart attack?  Be sure your hospital has room for you as many are filled with Covid patients.  

So yes I'm mad and will be staying that way until we have this pandemic under control."

They are the uneducated, rural, low income voter who has no medical insurance and who relies on right wing propaganda TV as a source of information.  These people have the same hopes and dreams as the rest of us but they have been born into a class where information and opportunity are limited and defective. They believe what any person in their desperate situation would believe, they believe the manufactured lies that are targeted at them. 
America is the largest caste system that denies its existence. There is almost no way an individual born into a lower caste here can ever improve their lot in life. Economic pressures have pushed all people down, not up, during the last 40 years since the GOP started its war on the people’s government. The rich elite have overwhelming power today over the total law making system and our laws have been turned against our lower and working classes. The law now blocks upward mobility as much as it prevents truth from reaching a growing share of our people. Until government attacks the caste system and breaks its undemocratic power the mass of people born into the wrong caste will never have a chance at health or justice. It is time to reestablish the protections of the New Deal for all Americans or suffer continuing deaths from the COVIDs of the future."

My entire job as a college librarian is to help people choose accurate information, and I am at my wit's end. The GOP currently deals only in lies, and so long as they do so, there is no hope. The unvaxxed might consist of more than just the most stubborn, uneducated members of the Right, but without them so much of the misinformation would go away."

The Uninsured. This large contingent of our population have a really bad time right now with healthcare. Most other countries take care of that problem with National Health Insurance, and their people are in good health because of it.
We can do the same by expanding Medicare to care of everybody. It will not be easy to accomplish, but it must be done.

In most cases all you have to do is walk out your front door to a mobile van to get a vaccination. It's as simple as that and it is free to everyone.

Unless major reforms are made with regard to what and how we teach our children, ignorance of facts, distrust of science and gullibility to conspiracy theories will put an end to our ""great experiment""  in democracy."
2021-08-08 15:31:33,"As a senior citizen, I was one of the first to take advantage of the vaccine, receiving my second dose of Pfizer back in mid-March.
Earlier this week, I woke up with a moderate cough and decided to get tested.  It was positive for COVID.  

I've been pretty careful, still not going out to many crowded places and wearing my mask when I go to the market.  But on Monday, I took it off for a few minutes while I got a haircut.  That's probably where I got it.

Yesterday, I got a monoclonal antibody treatment.  Across the room, I talked a little with a fellow patient, a young woman, like me hooked up to an IV.  She told me she was unvaxxed, her two children--- 3 and 4 years old--- were also sick, her live-in boyfriend wasn't sick but wouldn't get tested, and that she believed the virus to have been manmade.  She thought they had contracted COVID at a nearby casino, where her family spent a couple of days.

I listened to all of this without any anger or any more pity than I'd feel for myself.  She was wearing a mask.  And, most importantly, she wasn't judging my choices.

No, I don't feel angry towards the vaccine hesitant.   

I'm angry at the anti-vax militants who loudly proclaim that COVID isn't dangerous, that the COVID statistics are a hoax, that masks and vaccines are dangerous.  I'm angry at politicians like DeSantis who obstruct sensible public health measures.  And I'm angry at the angry spreaders of crazy conspiracy theories who are turning our country into a loony bin."
2021-08-08 15:31:44,"COVID-19 arrived in our country in January of 2020 and by mid March had taken off like wildfire, and it still is burning.  If we don't find a way to contain a wildfire it continues to burn and seeks new fuel so it can keep going.  That is hardly a surprise, and yet here we are.

Rage, grief, and traumatic stress seem like appropriate reactions to what is happening.  We have leaders  across the globe claiming that the fire is contained, that it is not that hot or dangerous. and that those who wish to keep you from walking into a building when you are on fire are fascists who wish to take away your basic rights.  

For anyone who understands that each choice we make has an impact on the collective society, it is mind-boggling and morally injurious to watch people in charge persist in denial and deflection at the level we see in DeSantis.

My current fantasy is that the issue be treated like a carbon tax.  If you don't want to get vaccinated, fine, but you have to pay for that luxury out of pocket.  People pay for weekly testing at 100% cost and pay an additional fee, for a general fund to cover the short and long term costs to society of community spread. 

In other words, since the consequence of watching their community and family burn to the ground is not enough, stop subsidizing such destructive decisions and eliminate free testing for those who are unvaccinated."
2021-08-08 15:32:07,"Sorry, I'm done with excuses and out of patience. The shots are free, the costs of not getting them are enormous. Accurate information has been out there for a year. Some people do not get to endanger the lives of others to preserve their false beliefs. 

Mandatory vaccines for health care workers, teachers, cops, fire, and transit workers, restaurant, grocery store, and hotel  workers, anyone at all who interacts with the public, anyone who wants to go to a theater, sports or cultural event, airport, train, or bus station, who wants health care or goes to school (over age 12), who gets government grants, subsidies, or benefits, etc. Higher insurance rates and out of pocket health care costs, social exclusion, and fines for those who don't. 

Done, done, done with this deadly con game."
2021-08-08 15:32:13,"What does insurance status have to do with the failure to get vaccinated when the vaccine is FREE?  At some point citizens have a duty to inform themselves -- especially when the truth is widely communicated via every possible means.  Vague concerns about ""distrust of the system"" and disparities of race and class also just have no bearing on a vaccination program that's plainly aimed at everyone.  We need to stop making excuses for bad conduct based on willful ignorance and illogical ""feelings.""  

As for the hard core anti-vaxers and COVID deniers, why is anger not appropriate?  The key thing is not to avoid anger.  The key thing is to take that anger and ACT on it by recognizing that these people are a danger to the country and defeating them in as many elections as possible."
2021-08-08 15:38:25,"What else, in God's name, can be done to get people vaccinated? More education? The information has been readily available to anyone who can read, has a phone or TV. (And electronics are not solely the possessions of the well-to-do.) Shots have been available at pharmacies, supermarkets, parking lots. Community and religious leaders have spoken in town halls and pulpits across this country. Aside from some sort of nationwide subliminal messaging project, what else should we do?

At least several times a week, there're articles earnestly explaining the unvaccinated to us - fear of needles, distrust of the government and/or medical establishment, lack of access, politics. Then there're the articles about the growing, nationwide anger at the unvaccinated, which usually also include several paragraphs about an unvaccinated someone who is, was, or had a loved who is or was, sick. The heartache is palpable, the mea culpas  heartfelt. But ultimately the message is that we shouldn't be angry. We should be more understanding, work harder to have those hard conversations with our unvaccinated loved ones and friends. No.

We need a national vaccine mandate. Tie it to federal funding. Tie it to Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment and welfare benefits. Employers hesitant to enforce mandates will breathe sighs of relief. So will insurers, who could now require the vaccine as conditions of insurability. The question is - do we have the will to really fight this pandemic?"
2021-08-08 15:38:26,"Theee first article that I was able to finish in regard to the anger many of us are experiencing around those unvaccinated.  I was not confronted, not made to feel shamed because of my emotional state, not told to turn it into wonderfulness.  It allowed me to feel recognized, heard and accepted.  All the things nonvaxers want too I suppose.  It gently offered ways around the emotion while accepting it as valid too.  It CLEARLY told us one of the ways systemic racism is coming home to bite us.  Very very well done.  I will share it."
2021-08-08 15:39:35,"I believe one thing preventing vaccine passports is fear of the violent mindset of anti-vaccine folks.  Who is going to enforce a vaccine passport, after we have read about grocery store clerks being murdered after requesting a customer to pull up their chin-hanging mask?  We would need armed guards at every point, wearing full combat gear, to accomplish enforcement of a vaccine mandate.

I myself am terrified of confronting these people.  I have never quit wearing a mask in indoor public spaces, and I can almost feel the unspoken vitriol directed my way.

This underlying threat of violence among a recalcitrant group of our fellows is a death knell of our democracy and of our former greatness.  That’s what I’m mourning."
2021-08-08 15:40:50,"I've seen a few articles like this one, urging us to try to understand vaccine refusers. 

Why is this our job? They don't seem too concerned about understanding our feelings? 

My life is constrained due to their decisions. They want to live as if nothing is wrong, ala the Sturgess motorcycle gathering this weekend. I don't get to do the things I would want to do because I care about my safety, and the safety of others. 

People want to have their freedom, and I sympathize with that. Expecting me to not be angry when their freedom of choice ruins my day, week, month, year or my life? That's a bit much."
2021-08-08 15:41:43,"I’m sorry, I just cannot find any empathy or understanding for people who chose not to get this life-saving vaccine and who turn around, and through their actions, sicken not only themselves but those (like children) who cannot get vaccinated. I cannot think of a more selfish and misanthropic thing to do then refusing to be vaccinated and even worse spreading misinformation to influence others down this dangerous and evil path. Disgust and anger seem to me to be perfectly rational responses, even if practicality may demand otherwise."
2021-08-08 15:46:20,"In my practice I am encountering two general categories of unvaccinated people.  The first group is worried about side effects and may not understand how effective the vaccines are.  This group can be persuaded to obtain the vaccine if it is made easy and convenient to receive.  This group skews non white and poor.  The second group have fallen deep into conspiracy theories and can be as surprised and indignant as if I had just said ""Vote for Hillary Clinton"" when the topic of a vaccine is brought up.  When I then compare the COVID vaccine to a flu shot or polio vaccine the temperature decreases but they do not change their mind.  Nonetheless, mandates for the vaccine and natural infections will eventually create immunity for these folks."

2021-08-08 15:47:03,"A fine piece, but perhaps the woo-woo crowd was left out of the equation .

2021-08-08 15:57:01,"Wonderful article, very well written. It really clarifies for me what is happening. You have some great ideas and I hope people are listening. There does seem to be a disconnect about people having access. So many people don't have internet, have language difficulties, and have jobs that don't allow time off for vaccination. More companies should do onsite clinics, and clinics need to go on the road in a bus to meet the unvaccinated where they live."
2021-08-08 15:57:31,"I fear our Healthcare workers at the frontlines are completely burned out and will quit with justifiable anger and residual trauma.

2021-08-08 16:00:40,"I'm in favor of tempering and channeling anger into constructive approaches. Whatever it takes. The problem is we simply may not have time for gentle persuasion. The virus certainly isn't going to wait around for it.

One problem is that, unlike polio, where the suffering and scars where visible, the suffering today is largely hidden behind ICU walls and quarantine measures and patient privacy rights, etc. I'm not saying we have to put it on display, but we should at least be talking about it in some detail and in proportion to the scale of the horror. It's not fear mongering to do this; it's prompting a basic human response that has helped us survive throughout history but that today's toxic misinformation and political polarization has suppressed in too many people."
2021-08-08 16:01:56,"Fantastic article, thank you for it. Especially this:
""...myriad news stories investigating the vaccination divide fail to mention the words class, education or income once.""

I've saved a response to comments in another major paper that feature a plethora of insults for Trumpists and/or the unvaccinated. I re-post it often and will share it here, fwiw:

""It's not IQ; it’s EDUCATION. When you have the privilege of high-quality, well-resourced education (which should be a right for every child), you come out different. Same with access to positive exposures to other cultures. It's poor-quality EDUCATION and very narrow cultural experiences that produce minds vulnerable to addiction, brainwashing, and science denial.

We are responsible for this, by allowing public education resources to be linked to property values, thus providing the best education to the already more-privileged. When we invest in stellar public education for ALL kids equally, regardless of zip code, this will change everything. We can't keep cheating children and wasting their minds, while expecting a different outcome from education-deprived areas.

Please recognize that every time any of us sling low-ball insults at Trump supporters or science deniers, we personally contribute to making the divisions worse and the repair task more difficult. Anti-social media’s greedy culpability is best addressed by boycotting, and building IRL relationships."""
2021-08-08 16:04:22,"There are so many excuses. Being “wary of healthcare “ and it’s ensuing cost is just another one. You’re afraid to lose a day at work? What if you lose weeks, months, or can’t do your job at all anymore because you become a Covid Long Hauler? What if you are in the hospital on a ventilator for months? THOSE are catastrophic health care bills to be afraid of, not the effects from the shot and missing a day of work. That day of work will seem so insignificant when you’ve been on a ventilator for weeks. 
Every demographic has it’s excuse, rationalization, call it what you will. You can find an excuse or you can find a way. That’s the only way this nightmare will ever end."
2021-08-08 16:05:25,"Anger at private citizens and the voluntary decisions they make is understandable but yes, in the end, non-productive.

Anger at governors like Noem, DeSantis, and Abbott exploiting a public health disaster resulting in the deaths of citizens, including children, to out-Trump one another for political advantage in future elections is another matter. 

And witness Marjorie Taylor Greene's recent cheering of wasted shots and low vaccination rates in Alabama to see how low we have fallen. She is a member of Congress, sworn to uphold the Constitution and serve the best interests of her constituents, but instead she is reveling in the death and suffering of others. 

And of course, it's devastating to think about where we might be now had we had a president in the early days of this crisis with even a thimbleful of competence and empathy and whose main concern wasn't how he would look in a mask. We are paying dearly for that now.  

COVID has exposed deep fissures in our collective belief in democracy and the common good from which we may never recover."

2021-08-08 14:51:31,"So much of COVID's reemergence has to do with the irresponsible actions of Governors and legislatures in red states – with politicians using the pandemic to trade the lives of their constituents to further right-wing social agendas.

Take my state of Tennessee, for example:

During the reemergence of the pandemic with a much more contagious (Delta) variant – thanks to the anti-science tenure of Bill Lee and the Tennessee legislature – Bill Lee has focused almost exclusively on ensuring more guns can be put on the street (managed to get his open carry legislation passed) and making sure critical race theory content is outlawed from being taught in Tennessee classrooms.  

Put plainly, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee doesn't care about how many Tennesseans dies of COVID-19, he's concerned with arming more ""law-abiding"" citizens (code for white people) and making sure the oppressive racial history of the U.S. (especially the South) is not taught in schools.

Talk about someone who won't give up The Lost Cause. Bill Lee? Seems more like Robert E. Lee."

Marjery Taylor Greene gave a speech where her fans cheered proudly of their unvaccinated status and she ridiculed those who did. Her actions will lead to someone's death. It is ignorant and dangerous and, yes, it makes me seethe with anger. 

Others are even worse and some of those have died of their own ignorance, only waking up to reality on their death beds. While some finally confess their error, how many did they infect before they died? And how many of those infected others? We'll never know because they don't believe in contact tracing either."
2021-08-08 15:38:14,"Whatever, there are a few facts.  First, the only way to battle infectious diseases is, precisely, government mandates, including vaccination.

It wasn't so long ago that when one traveled internationally one had to have the little yellow card (passport??) indicating having been vaccinated.  Without it you simply couldn't travel.  The same for going to school.  The virus knows no individual rights not to comply, nor do the laws that require stopping at red lights, having insurance for your car, etc., etc.  If it isn't idiocy, what in the world is it?"
2021-08-08 15:35:33,Maybe accept we cannot order people to suit our wishes?
2021-08-08 16:02:25,"I'm at the end of my tether.  And it's not just at the proud unvaccinated.  It's at the people who exploit the unmasking by pretending they are vaccinated, lie and expose those who are.  They come into our library with no masks or masks under their nose and force me to be the mask police.  We were jubilant when the vaccines were announced, spent hours trying to get appointments for ourselves, aging parents, friends, and children.  Then we spent hours on long lines in our cars in the dead of winter... Now the unvaxxed are being fed, given gift certificates, and being begged.  Like others my rage is at politicians.  At the very least they are spineless and won't issue mandates in fear of not being re-elected.  At worst there is Marjorie Taylor Greene who not only is risking the lives of her constituents, but anyone who approaches their door to encourage a vaccine, may be met with a rifle. We did what we were supposed to - but are in a worse position.  We lost jobs and businesses and our lives have changed forever.  I'm trying very hard not to lose it at each outrageous act of defiance and stupidity."
2021-08-08 15:37:41,I don’t worry. I’m vaccinated and I trust the vaccine. The unvaccinated are only a danger to themselves. Why the rage? I feels like you’re just mad because you did something and they didn’t. But that is their choice not ours.
2021-08-08 15:40:09,"This massive bifurcation of America was all part of the Republicans’ plan to destroy democracy — and it seems to be working. Sure, those who heeded medical and CDC advice and got the vaccine back in the spring did the right thing. They swerve inoculated, spent a day or two feeling lousy, but knowing that it was far better than having a ventilator tube down your throat for three weeks, only to die in the end. And we did it to keep others safe as well.

Trump knew how virulent and deadly the virus was over a year ago, when he called it “a hoax, folks,” and refused to be publicly vaccinated. He and his vile henchmen, including Stephen Miller, saw the pandemic as a brilliant way to thin out the herd of undesirables in this country — you know, the ones who receive the entitlements and prevent the wealthy from being even wealthier. There is no forgiving this kind of satanic action on the part of Trump and his sadistic cohort of felons and miscreants.

There is no real schadenfreude in seeing the staunchly resolute unvaccinated writhe in agony in their hospital beds days or hours before they expire. But there is real anger — healthy anger — to be directed at certain state governors (yes, that means you, Abbott and DeSantis et al) who preach against masks and vaccines with alacrity while their ERs overflow with coronavirus patients and others needing intervention for cancer, heart disease or injury are turned away and told to find another hospital. 

Keep the anger. It’s healthy."
2021-08-08 15:45:35,"My sales org has a very aggressive target to hit this year- we just hired a bunch of new people- before I could even train them all one of them is now in hospital with covid.  He is around 30, white, unvaccinated - now he is on disability before we could ramp him. 

you can be sure we will add vaccination status to interview questions - unvaccinated need not apply."
2021-08-08 15:24:31,"The biggest irony in the anger towards the unvaxxed is the hate we feel for the very people whose lives we claim to cherish. 

My solution? I let go of my anger but I also won’t relinquish my freedom of movement and a face brushed by fresh air. (Except for public transit and hospitals). 

The question must be asked—who do these policies help?

What’s the worst that could happen if we just “vax and let live”? 

Won’t the virus become endemic? Won’t it spread and evolve just as slowly if we allow people to get it? Some will die and some will gain immunity. Either way, the virus will have fewer and fewer hosts, no?"
2021-08-08 15:42:28,"Here’s a thought: maybe a little judicious anger, occasional yelling, some gritted-teeth explaining that a lot of what the unvaccinated believe is incredibly wrong, and vaccine mandates, are a lot more decent&respectful than treating the unvaccinated like heathen children who need gently to be brought into the flock. 

I’m not a missionary, just a guy who’d like to get through the next year without croaking in an ICU, and would seriously like to be able to get around more this winter. 

Then there are a couple other little details that start out with maybe it’s okay to be a trifle vexed with people who a) are literally getting their fellow Americans killed while they fool around, and b) don’t seem to have much inclination to consider anybody else but themselves. 

And that’s before we even get to the part where large numbers of these clowns literally argue for getting everybody infected ASAP, and literally say that we need to let the virus just wipe out the weak. 

So yeah…not incoherent with rage, but a tad bit vexed seems in order."
2021-08-08 15:46:21,"I don't think there is room for anger whether you are vaccinated or not. It depends on us, the citizens of every country, to take care of ourselves and our families.  Wearing masks inside and sanitizing our hands should have become a habit by now.   Reducing numbers of Covid cases in the US or Canada, is not going to help; the virus has to be in control everywhere globally only then we can  put our masks away, but not too far.  I do not listen either to the leaders or the media. I can do three things myself: avoid crowded places, wear my mask in crowded places like public transport, and not touch my face with dirty hands."
2021-08-08 15:52:59,"This reminds me of all those hand-wringing articles that posited that the real reason more rural, less educated white Americans voted for Trump was because of economic insecurity and cultural misunderstanding when study after study after study after study pointed out that the biggest reason was racism followed by sexism. To me, being unvacinated at this point is akin to those who choose to drink and drive with the caveat that many who do that have an actual disease while many of those who selfishly choose to remain unvaccinated are doing so simply out of spiteful stubbornness. I say, let's just get on with the mandates before it is too late for all of us just like we made the very act of driving while drunk illegal even when there was no showing of actual harm. We've tried the carrot, time for the stick."
2021-08-08 16:01:32,"Until passing legislation to punish entities like Mercola (I refuse to link Doctor to that name) and Fox, there will always be a portion of the population that will be unreachable.

2021-08-08 15:53:27,"Apparently, not all rage, anger,  emotions etc are yet equal. Everyone just shut up and be patient and loving and content dying all over the place while the paramount emotional needs of the hesitant, deliberately uninformed and loudly unwilling get sorted out."
2021-08-08 16:04:48,"Although I am not a Christian, I try to quell my rage (I try to avoid things that make it bubble to the top) by asking myself ""What would Jesus or ____ (insert your own) do?""  (I also why more evangelicals don't ask this for themselves).

I will never understand how professed Christians who believe in the sacrifice of Jesus on behalf of the human race cannot be bothered by sacrificing a little freedom or comfort by abiding by distancing guidelines and wearing a mask.  Such small measures will protect them and us and us from them...and they don't even need to deal with a vaccine. If they are to believe that Jesus died on the cross for their sins, how hard can it be to mask up and save others?

But your favorite spiritual religious figure understands the exalted and toxic (and everything in between) nature of humans.  Accordingly, that figure would exercise compassion for the fear and ignorance of others and work without judgement or harshness in trying to give aid and comfort to those that fall prey to the mis(dis)information and politicization of this deadly event. 

Further, that figure would call out those bad actors for what they are.  Accordingly, I focus my rage on those figures and trying to be more understanding toward those who really ""know not what they do"".

It ain't easy...if it were, we'd not be struggling with our outrage.  This mental model helps me; and I'm unsure why not practiced by so called true believers."
2021-08-08 12:08:11,"The highly contentious breakthrough cases are another source of anger and despair we shouldn't brush off. This week my fully vaccinated husband tested positive with one. My five-year-old daughter and I (both negative) are now homebound for 10 days because of exposure. He's isolating alone in our bedroom, while she's missing her first week of kindergarten and I'm taking care of everyone alone. It feels like spring 2020 all over again. 

Of course I realize how fortunate we are. His case is mild and he's going to be ok. We have the resources and space to quarantine at home and miss work. But anger isn't rational. We played by the rules, did everything right and yet here we are. It's infuriating. 

I've spent the last week drowning in rage. Reading this helped calm it. So much here that resonated and made me reflect on where my anger comes from and where it goes. Thank you, Ms. Smarsh."
2021-08-08 15:45:48,"Let's put this in perspective.  The breakthrough rate for COVID cases for those already vaccinated is 0.02 % based on CDC data.  If our nation was vaccinated, instead of a moving average of daily cases of 108,513 we would have a moving average of 22 cases per day.  No one would be talking about vaccine mandates, or mask mandates, our hospitals would not be filling up.  Our nation would be fully open, our kids would be returning to a normal school year.

You're damn right I'm mad!!  This was preventable, it is entirely the fault of the unvaccinated.  Trump, DeSantis and their ilk, have a lot to answer for."
2021-08-08 15:01:08,"Thank you from Walnut Springs, Texas, one of the most impoverished and vulnerable communities in Central Texas.  It's so easy to blame everything on Trump.

Done deal. ...And the four friends I've lost so far might still be alive...Annie"
2021-08-08 04:12:46,"Personal responsibility and accepting the consequences of poor decisions have to still matter.  We now have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.

I have no sympathy for fools.."

2021-08-07 21:13:37,"I am not ""furious at the bad actors among us"" as much as I am saddened and disappointed. Another thing I am certainly not is surprised.

I can easily believe the Ms. Smarsh's truth ""that many unvaccinated people are scared just like us."" After all, I witnessed an amoral, racist buffoon stoke their fears about immigrants and Muslims to get himself elected in time to make our current predicament demonstrably worse. For all their bravado, the anti-vax conservative clan is an incredibly skittish lot.

I wish Ms. Smarsh all the luck in the world in bringing ""the right help and information"" to the unvaccinated in her community. Given my experiences in similar such efforts over the last five years, however, I don't think I will be wasting my time on such futile efforts. I guess I just don't love the poorly educated that much."
2021-08-08 00:06:06,"The author is a better person than I am.
I am bitterly angry about all of the people who deny the vaccine. And I'm tired of trying to cajole them, coddle them, reason with them--it's like trying to negotiate with a toddler, in my opinion.
My life and livelihood, as with many others, has been turned upside down by this. In the spring I held hope that, perhaps by fall, we all could start moving toward what looked like normal life. But these vaccine deniers--whatever their reasons--have turned that hope to despair. The politicians who have callously enabled this to make it appear that Biden has failed, and their ignorant followers--I heap scorn on them.
So--no. I'm not having it. The author, and other good people who can take a longer, more nuanced view of the situation, can do so. 
I will hold those who are proudly ignorant, obstinate, those who deny and scorn the vaccine or other measures to try to contain covid, in the utmost contempt. Politicians as well as the followers they lead.  SHAME ON YOU!"

2021-08-08 13:37:03,"From what I have read, the biggest predictor of vaccine acceptance is a relationship with a medical professional.
If you have no insurance, or lousy high copay essentially noninsurance, you have no trusted medical professional.
Instead you have propagandists providing “news”. 
It doesn’t help with today’s crisis, but maybe it can spur people to finally demand National healthcare for all. 
So far it hasn’t worked for the gun problem, “it’s not my kid that’s going to get killed at school”. Until it is.
But it might be your or your mom or your brother that ends up in the hospital.
Maybe it would help if we set up a payment charity for those people who are terrified of a having to take a day off because their immune systems fire up with the vaccine. What do they do when they get some other bug that makes it so they can’t go to work?"

Best way to deal with your anger? Treat them like the pariahs they are. No vaccination - no eating in restaurants, no shopping in stores, no attendance at public events, no traveling, no admittance at any public facilities including hospitals. And raise their insurance premiums through the roof.

In other words, NY Times editors need to do a better job of policing the numerical hyperbole of its opinion writers that rests on innumeracy.

Easy for you to make these comments, because ""you"" are not a health care provider stuck in the trenches dealing with COVID-19.
And especially people like me, the ICU physicians and especially folks trained to do VVECMO, it has been utter Hades.

Do I have any sympathy for the unvaccinated?
Absolutely NO.
But, I still do my level best to provide the current standard of care, and work to bring the ones in peripheral hospitals who are dying, especially ones less than 50yo, and find ways to get them a bed and convince the ECMO team to give them a chance... YES< EVERY SINGLE AWFUL DAY!!!

A week ago, six of us sat in our faculty meeting and said it to our Boss, head of CCM for seven ICUs:
""We have had it. We can't do this anymore. We are also humans, not Angels.""

One colleague of mine, in a moment of sheer sarcasm, said its survival of the fittest, not only in health but also in intellect/mind.
Instead of listening to WHO, CDC, and your own physician, if you listen to some unknown quack out there or a malicious entity out there spewing hate against science, then you have already sealed your fate. 
Don't cry when it turns around and bites you.
And don't ask for sympathy; the well is dry."

In no uncertain terms, I make it abundantly clear to their loved one that this was a life threatening crisis they could have avoided. If their hospital charges bankrupt them, they could have avoided it. If their kids cannot go to college because their parents spent their life savings on COVID medical bills, they could have avoided it. If my patients live thru the disease, I urge them to make sure that everyone they know does not make the same mistake they did.

Second, and equally important, if they live long enough to vote in the next election, I urge them to hold Florida Gov DeSantis for much of this crisis. His failure to mandate masks was inexcusable.

Who has made healthcare a Kafkaesque obstacle course instead of a simple human right.....all so the rich could eat better ?

Who has caused tens of millions of Americans to be uninsured, underinsured and afraid of medical sticker shock and practically divorced from the idea of regular healthcare that every other rich nation's citizen enjoys as a birthright ?

The Greed Over People party will do anything to save a dollar for millionaires while millions of Americans waste away without affordable and accessible healthcare.

Yes, there some on the left and in the middle who won't get vaccinated, but we all know who perfected American healthcare unaffordability, inaccessibility, contempt for science, government and facts.

The answer is simple. Our experts lump the brain, which projects emotional health, and the mind develops professional expertise as the single entity of the mind when these are separate. The brain is under the radar screen, brain education is not only ignored; the brain is miseducated. As brain education is a mess, our emotional health is a mess. So our cutting-edge mind education generates prosperity but we are unable to emotionally handle money. 

Our sports stars are the symbol of what is wrong with America. They earn millions during their brief careers but become bankrupt within four years of retirement. They make huge money with their excellent sports talent but spend it with their emotionally challenged brains. 

Emotionally challenged brains is America's #1 crisis that needs to be healed. Unless this crisis is addressed our social standards will continue to decline.

What America needs is to create a whole new Brain Education/Emotional Health Industry. It is emotional health that generates wisdom. Emotional health is wisdom. Imagine turning America from an emotional health disaster into an emotional health superpower. Imagine an America where the brain and mind are both powered by emotional health!"

Since the pandemic erupted, here in San José we’ve been treated to large amounts of road rage.

Aggressive freeway driving increased for a while, but the return of traffic congestion is impeding the 2020 onslaught of 100-mph speeders.

More noticeable is the effect on city streets. A number of people are blasting loud exhaust and audio systems. We’re besieged by sideshows, screeching tires, and people driving 60 mph on city streets designated for 30 or 40. Streets have become a cacophony of noise and a source of danger. For road cyclists it’s the Wild West.

Traffic-law and noise enforcement have all but disappeared in the wake of the pandemic, so people are misbehaving with impunity.

This is the peri-pandemic increase in anger I see in physical form. Anger about people’s vaccinations or masking shows up mainly on my Facebook newsfeed. That is easy to tune out, unlike the rise in drivers blasting misogynist or N-word-laden hip-hop and triggering car burglar alarms with their exhaust systems."

Early on, and sometimes since, the NYT has gone all soft and empathetic on that black populace as people fearful due to a history of malfeasance by the so-called ""medical community."" So we are to be sympathetic to some abstainers but not to others who may be similarly skeptical for other reasons about a rushed Rx?

If producers were entirely comfortable they would have full approvals by now.

I was fully vaccinated in March, but two years before suffered sudden hearing loss two weeks after a different vaccine. Only a powerful regimen of prednisone restored 80 percent of my hearing. It is a very specific hearing loss syndrome.

Trying to ridicule and shame people hasn't worked yet. Only barring access to certain public venues makes sense now. And by the way, why is Sturgis not forced to fence off its land to bikers? Can we have a detailed story on that process?

Kill IP in this case. Massively invest with all other nations in vaxing the world ASAP. Make the lives of those who refuse miserable. Use carrots, yes; but use stick.

2021-08-07 19:29:23,"If the rage is based on a feeling that “We were so close, but...."", that was a false belief.  It was based on the transmission kinetics of the original Wuhan strain and the hope that vaccination would eliminate transmission.  Since the Wuhan strain has an R0 of between 2 and 3 (the transmissibility index), immunization of 2/3 of the populace (1-/R0) would halt viral propagation.
But the epidemic is now a different virus - the delta variant.  This has a much higher transmissibility (R0 of 7 or 8) and immunization only lowers transmission, but doesn't block it.  Immunization of a much higher proportion of the population, well over 90%, (R0[unvac]-1)/(R0[unvac]-R0[vac]) , would be required to halt the virus and only if transmission by vaccinated individuals is still low (R0[vac]<1).
There was never any hope that an immunization campaign would halt the spread of a virus of delta's transmissibility.  Vaccination only slows its spread, but doesn't stop it.   Covid19 vaccination main benefit is to the individual, in that it mostly prevents serious disease in the infected.  Once the delta variant arose, the continued spread of covid19 became inevitable.  We were never close."

There was no mention of vaccination status or even wearing masks (we are under a indoor mask advisory condition). I asked why, the management company was going to suggest to the board moving it to our spacious garage and opening our big garage door, to the board.

The board paid a lawyer to come up with language to add virtual meetings to our governing documents, but then the best they could come up with getting the required signatures was people had to make an appointment to sign the documents with one of the trustees. This was in January, the height of the third wave. They could have simply mailed out the documents with a request for a signature.

I’m wondering if the association will be liable if we end up having it in the lobby and people get COVID-19. I plan on wearing a N95 mask (even though I am fully vaccinated) which I have not done since this whole thing started.

We all know there are a statistically significant numbers of unvaccinated that do not deserve our scorn.  We also know that there are a whole lot more that do, and deserve more than our scorn--they deserve legal actions against them. These millions of unvaccinated (and the vaccinated that continue to spread Covid, like Lindsay Graham), are mostly from one party, and mostly follow Trump. Trump got the vaccine but in typical style is not following up with urging others to do the same (as he should have done for the past six months) for political reasons, and most of the unvaccinated adults are his followers, his mass, his social disease.  Yes, social disease.  Look at almost any metric, and these are not decent people. A relatively accurate broad brush stroke of the unvaccinated are poorly educated, poorly informed, gullible, racist, ""freedom-loving"" Trumpers.

The story gives details right up until it just says they were careful but recently he caught it anyways. From an unvaccinated adult? A child of an unvaccinated adult?
2021-08-11 11:19:32,"Responsibility for every man, woman, and child who dies from COVID from here on out lies at the feet of Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson, and Republican sychophants who see defiance of COVID vaccination as a way of ""owning the demns"" .

The anger is great, and rising."
2021-08-11 12:03:10,"The CDC has missed so many opportunities to communicate clearly about the importance of adults getting vaccinated to protect kids. When adults get vaccinated at high levels, the case rates among children plummet, because adults are the main source of transmission. Where are the billboards and PSAs spelling this out for adults?

Kids sacrificed a year of their schooling for adults (a policy that now looks like a mistake, in retrospect). It’s time for adults to step up and get vaccinated to protect them."

I cannot believe how selfish and self absorbed so many Americans are.

I now have 2, 30yo new hire employees out sick with covid who were unvaccinated.  I am worried for them and for any long hauler symptoms they may carry.  

Our company pays for all testing, all illness and has generous time off.  They send boxes of PPE to every employee. They even have vaccine available on premise at our office. We have a CVS in the building and you can make discreet appointment.  

It’s just unbelievable to me that so many still refuse."
2021-08-11 11:55:04,The pandemic is another sign of man’s failing and selfishness like the planet. We knew for years the earth was in trouble and did nothing. It seemed with the first wave of Covid people didn’t care about other adults dying. Now with young children at risk they better start caring with the school year beginning. I worried from the beginning with people running into large crowds without masks after the first wave. With the amount of unvaccinated people it just couldn’t work.
2021-08-11 11:12:51,"There are so many people that cannot get vaccinated or for whom the vaccines do not work fully due to compromised immune systems.  And then you see people who won't get the shot as a political statement, won't take the two seconds to put on a mask or claim that avoiding masks is patriotic.  They say they are doing so because they love freedom, but let's be honest:  they are just self-centered and selfish, and don't care about their neighbors.  If you think this is harsh, tell me what word you would use for someone who cares more about making a political statement or avoiding a modest inconvenience when the potential risk is a child -- who cannot get vaccinated -- getting sick."
2021-08-11 11:54:32,"Presumably some people who hesitate to get vaccinated truly believe their decision affects only themselves. I’ve seen a [very] few ads along the lines of, “I got vaccinated so I can see Nana again.” This plays to self-interest.
Why aren’t there ads saying, “I got vaccinated to protect my neighbor’s medically vulnerable child”?
It’s so frustrating that governors and others oppose face mask mandates and vaccines in the name of individual freedom and parental rights. Yet, they ignore the rights and needs of the most vulnerable. 

I hope school districts fully reopen, and not have to shut down within days or weeks due to an outbreak. If some states refuse to require masks, allow vaccinated parents to request classrooms where masks are worn and teachers are vaccinated. Provide the exact same curriculum to children of unvaccinated parents who disdain mask wearing, in classrooms with unvaccinated teachers. 

Don’t stigmatize the children, just have their parents explain that, “We are a family that doesn’t believe in vaccines and face masks, so you will be in class where you won’t wear a mask. Your friend’s parents believe differently, so will be in a different classroom for now.”

And require masks on buses, at least."
2021-08-11 11:22:05,I don't understand.  There was the ice bucket challenge in support of those with ALS.  You often see stories of whole teams or classes of children who will shave their heads in solidarity with a classmate with cancer.  Why cannot we all wear a mask in support and solidarity for the protection of those who may be more susceptible or vulnerable to the Covid virus and it complications. That is also the reason for vaccination programs.  It isn't to just keep the economy going or make sure people don't miss worker school.  It is for the community and for those who might  experience the worst effects of a disease that might only mildly affect another.

Under typical circumstances, communities rally around a child that has cancer. It is so frustrating to see so many people without masks at the grocery store (one of the only places we go). It feels like the convenience of other people is more important than the safety of my children. It is a very lonely place to be. As a society, we have prioritized individual desires over the needs of the most vulnerable. It speaks volumes about the values of life in our country today."
2021-08-11 11:32:43,"We fell all over ourselves protecting older Americans at the beginning of this pandemic. Now children under age 12, *our future*, are being sent to school  without so much as a mask mandate. Since they are not eligible for the vaccine, what’s the next best solution? Everyone at school wearing a mask. And before you say “just keep your kids home” , you need to understand that remote learning was an unmitigated disaster for everyone involved. We are social creatures, especially the young. They deserve to have society prioritize their needs instead of the needs of people that are now eligible for vaccines. Can’t believe I have to write this. 

“Let’s send kids under 12 to school without a mask mandate and see what happens.” Worst leadership plan ever. For young kids nothing has changed since this pandemic began. In fact, the delta variant is MORE contagious."

This much respiratory hospitalization in summer is unusual, and air pollution is aggravating things. Vaccinated were 59 of 292 for hospital admissions and 7 of 40 for deaths last week, or better than 4-1 in their favor, and that’s with the vaccinated casualties being older on average than the unvaccinated ones. We can help push our latest surge back down with vaccines and masks."

I have to conclude that they really don't care about other people; they will not take any action, however small, to save others from illness and possible death.  And these are the people who will also try to prevent us from minimizing he effects of climate change, for much the same reason.   Amoral?  You make the call."

Do they have no concern for innocent people they might kill, or are they just standing their ground?"
2021-08-11 13:08:33,"It is past time for adults everywhere to start acting like the grown-ups they are supposed to be. These protests over vaccines and mask mandates are nothing more than temper tantrums. The vaccines are a testament to human ingenuity and determination, and it is beyond maddening that adults will not do the smallest possible thing, get a shot in the arm, to protect those who are most vulnerable and who utterly depend on us, our children. The willfully unvaccinated should be ashamed of themselves.

And please stop with the ""vaccines don't stop the spread so there's no point in getting them"" madness. The vaccines act like a firewall that greatly help slow the spread because there is nowhere good for the virus to go. Breakthrough infections are a result of too many unvaccinated, not the vaccines. Grow up, get informed, and get your shot."

But, the fact that they are being allowed to put all children, and especially those with health issues, at risk is morally appalling.

2021-08-11 12:25:36,"The phrase “No man left behind” is often trotted out at times of chest beating patriotism, but the truth is in today’s US the dominant culture is the pursuit of individual success even if it means walking over everyone else to get there. Blame 80s corporate excess and Reagan (and Thatcher in the UK) for emphasising the individual over the good of society. 

There are good, unselfish people in the States, I have a great love for them and what the country could be. There’s just too much propaganda online to allow others to come round to the “no one left behind” way of thinking."
2021-08-11 12:34:23,"While it would be nice if we protected our vulnerable at all costs, that is not how the world works. It’s not even possible to do everything it would take to do so. Before covid blew the lid off everything, the vulnerable were left to their own every flu season (for  example), and little awareness was given to it.  Covid just made people aware.

My children have  severe food allergies. I have never expected the world to protect them, and don’t want ‘ nut free’ zones in schools. We have always taught  them to be vigilant and manage themselves. It’s nit perfect but it’s also not possible to eradicate every food allergen bc someone is allergic to everything. 

We will not have a zero covid world. We will not have a world that serves as an incubator for the vulnerable. This is not new. We never have. Yes it is sad but it is the reality millions have always known."

Is that unacceptable because it’s “socialist?” These vaccines need to move beyond emergency authorization to actually be authorized, and authorized for children.

2021-08-11 13:28:11,"If you have read this article, chances are that you have already been vaccinated.  All this criticism vented towards the unvaccinated is falling on deaf ears.  We need to take a more pro-active stand, and step up the pressure ourselves among our family and friends if we really want to make a difference.  Many studies show that personal friends can help influence people to do the right thing.  Sure it won’t impact everyone, but it’s a start.  One idea would be to start shunning people in your own life who are not vaccinated. Tell that unvaccinated family member or friend that they are not welcome in your home until they are vaccinated. It’s easy to criticize people from afar but if you aren’t willing to act on that, then maybe you aren’t that invested in it. We also need the health insurance industry to step up.  Yes, they strongly recommend the vaccine but at this point they need to start charging a surcharge to those who can get the vaccine but refuse to do so.  They are willing to charge us for everything else, so why not this too?"

2021-08-11 12:24:01,"To all the people who state the vaccines are useless because people can still spread disease after vaccination, keep in mind it is not to the same degree as an unvaccinated person. Studies show it is a much smaller window of spread of the infected person had the vaccine (a few days versus a few weeks). Both a candle (vaccinated) and a trash can of oily rags (unvaccinated) can be lit on fire. Which one do you want in your home or next to your child? Stop slamming the best tool we have to curb this thing."
2021-08-11 13:36:05,"What is so significant about the wearing of masks that it has become THE hotbed issue of 2021? Logically, any policy or procedure that protects our children from death & disease should be a slam dunk, but mask wearing bucks that logic.

Trump's rise to power was all about thumbing his nose against the so called ""left"" which allegedly looks down its nose at all the ""disaffected regular folks"". Trump's $1.7 trillion tax cut specifically reduced the property tax deduction which was his way of ""sticking it"" to the ""left"" and his easily manipulated followers loved it. Trump lookalikes, including DeSantis of Florida and Abbott of Texas, took up the ridiculous, but effective campaign tactic Trump created and even though he's out of office, Trump continues to create rallies where he spouts lies & exaggerates but rakes in $$ from the ""easily mislead"".

In 2024, the republican who angers the ""left"" the most will be the next GOP presidential candidate. I conclude that madness, not COVID, is America's biggest problem."

2021-08-11 15:31:09,"Our daughter has Rett Syndrome and uses the same type of vest that Ethan does on a daily basis.  It has been so incredibly hard to keep her safe from covid over the last year and a half.  Especially for our other children.  We decided to pull our children out of school a week before NYC announced it's first shutdown.  We found deserted swamps and forests to go to in New Jersey where no one else was around, just to get our kids out of the house.  I was the only person who left the house to do shopping, chores, etc., for months.
I feel like I haven't taken off my mask since I began wearing one in March of 2020. We still don't let our children go into a playground if any other children are there.  So many sacrifices.  It amazes me that so many others refuse to do the smallest little sacrifices, like wear a mask, when others have had to give up so much more.  I look at my youngest daughter, who at 10 years of age is 11 months younger than her sister with Rett.  She has never complained about wearing a mask.  Not once.  She even wears it while walking down deserted sidewalks.  If a child can do it, why can't so-called adults?"
2021-08-11 16:17:03,"This is an ethical quandary - can someone be made to take a vaccine to protect others? Certainly they can be asked out of altruism, but you can't force someone to do this. Even though the risk is very very low, there is a chance that a handful of people will have an adverse reaction to the vaccine and possibly die. Is it still okay to sacrifice these few to save a larger number? Health officials would say yes because they are simply playing a numbers game, but the individual who had the adverse reaction may say no. Yes - we are in a horrible situation right now, but let's not blame others for their personal decisions. Covid is here - it isn't going away - let's focus on the original goal of flattening the curve so that hospitals aren't overwhelmed."
2021-08-11 16:52:26,"I don't think that there's enough altruism left for most people to get vaccinated, mask, and physically distance to protect those who are especially vulnerable to Covid-19. At least, in my red state, Iowa, it's as if a decision has been made that the pandemic is over. Almost everyone has returned to the pre pandemic normal in spite of the Delta variant.

People who are especially vulnerable to Covid-19 are going to end up as ""collateral damage"" of the pandemic. That's the way that it's going to be since most people have decided that the pandemic is over and have returned to their pre pandemic life."

We refuse to take meaningful steps to keep guns out of the hands of deranged and criminal people who kill them, we keep them ignorant through sub-standard schools, we burden them with lifelong loans for the privilege of working and finally we are leaving them to suffer the worst effects of climate change. Not taking precautions in a pandemic is just part of that sorry pattern"

2021-08-11 14:46:57,"The Texas Tribune reports that instead of ordering mask mandates, Our Dear Texas Leaders are going to recruit more nurses from out of state to come and care for the thousands of unvaccinated people who chose getting sick over getting vaccinated and are now clogging up hospitals all over the state. So the governor is willing to ask nurses to risk their health to help save a bunch of refuseniks who thought getting COVID would be preferable to getting vaccinated or bothering to wear a mask to protect themselves and others. Asking people who did the right thing to put their lives on the line in order to save people who trumpet their “right” to infect themselves and others is grotesque. It would be far more ethical to mandate masks and require vaccinations."

2021-08-11 16:53:34,"I am absolutely as angry as the mom in this article and possibly more. Stop with the false equivalency of saying its a parent choice. No good parent makes the choice to send their kids unprotected into schools and willing to endanger others because of their political positions. More importantly, you better think twice if you think you will be allowed to indulge in the same self-centered selfishness when it comes to my kids at school. These are the same people who don't generally vaccinate their kids because they want to rely on herd protection conveyed by responsible parents who do vaccinate their kids. ENOUGH. Looks like the anti vaccine parents are going to have to go back to preschool and learn the basics of the obligations of living in a shared society where we care about public health. Perhaps they need to be schooled by their own children."
2021-08-11 14:44:18,"We've known for some time now,  that even those who are vaccinated can get or give COVID.  Masks and social distancing (even for the unvaxxed) have proven to be effective.  So one has to wonder how their son got COVID.  Probably someone else in his home had been interacting with others, was not wearing a mask/distancing, and got asymptomatic COVID."
2021-08-11 17:22:07,"Currently, the effective reproductive number (transmission) is higher in states with higher vaccination rates, so the claim that unvaccinated people are to blame for transmission isn’t quite true as there isn’t clear evidence that vaccinations stop transmission.

Vaccines reduce the severity of COVID, but coupling the evidence above with the CDC’s study in Provincetown MA, it’s not clear that vaccines reduce transmission. Consequently, blaming unvaccinated people for what’s likely an immunoevasive virus is not only at risk of misinforming readers about the virus, it also won’t help us progress towards agreement in the public health management of endemic & immunoevasive COVID. The challenges we face are to reduce the rate of severe outcomes, which requires vaccinating people (for their own benefit, not for any transmission-reducing benefit until we gain evidence that vaccinations do in fact reduce transmission) and talking about how we can improve our focused protection of immunocompromised patients. 

The focused protection efforts have been demonized in the past, but, whatever you thought of them in the summer of 2020, the concept of focused protection in a respiratory viral epidemic is essential for long term management of endemic COVID for exactly the reasons we’re seeing here - the endgame is that the virus wins by immune evasion and endemicity, and we need sustainable mitigation & protection policies & programs.

Sincerely,
An epidemiologist"

Two of my neighbors work in primary schools.  One, who remains unvaccinated, just returned from Alabama.  She is not a teacher, but has direct interaction with students.

The other is a vaccinated kindergarten teacher.  She travelled to northern Florida for the 2 weeks preceding school reopening - with another teacher.  If you look at the maps, the north half of FL is a red-hot Covid zone.

They tell those of us who are vulnerable, ""Just stay home then!""  fine. we will just stay home. But our kids need an education also so help us fight for a remote option rather than continue to blame us for the lockdowns. I will never understand human behavior during this time."

 I cannot believe that the CDC has not issued a warning regarding the poor protection of cloth masks especially now with Delta and school starting.   

We all need evidence-based data and the hard facts immediately regarding various mask choices.  

Some are only 40% protective compared to 95%.   

Nobody wants to read about the breakthrough infections from cloth masks and the Long Covid damage to school children. When it comes down to innocent children's lives this makes me so angry. 

Premium N 95 types of masks also need to be manufactured to fit a child's face properly.   

Another critical missed opportunity to educate and protect the public, especially our children by the CDC and the WH."

What on earth is the classroom environment going to be like? Unfortunately, all the masked kids can’t all be put into the same class. Children in these public school districts *will* be seated next to students whose parents won’t let them wear masks. If I had a high-risk child, I would have to home school them. That’s the only way they’ll be safe."

This surge was entirely preventable.  As it is, I’m sitting on the couch now with mild GI symptoms hoping my unvaccinated coworker who got COVID last week didn’t give it to me despite the vaccine.  I have a transplant patient in my family.  Really love how the FDA and CDC are dragging their feet on 3rd shots for transplant patients as well.  Argue about it long enough the problem is going to solve itself because all the transplant patients will be dead from this.  I can tell you what is certainly in no way safe, that’s getting COVID."

This shouldn't have happened. Instead of spending the past year and a half lamenting the inadequacy of online learning, leaders, parents and teachers should've been looking for out of the box solutions to improve it. At worst only the very young and disabled kids should be in live classrooms with teachers, spread out across all of the schools in their county. 

Theres no reason why in 2021 online learning cannot be interactive, schools mobile and every child equipped with an active internet device. The push to get ""back to normal"" caused this mess. But still leaders, and parents seem unwilling to change their approach."

The right doesn't care about the truth of the issue. They enjoy angering pro-vaccine ""others"" and mocking what they view as left-wing efforts to control right wing lives. I sometimes think anti-vaccine people enjoy the idea of making the ""wimps"" on the left sick because liberals ""can't take the virus like a man.""
Arguing the scientific aspects is not possible. These antivaxxers are zealots who enjoy making people upset. They are the equivalent of spouse beaters. Their self-worth only kicks in when they teach the ""others"" not to ""mess"" with them.

With all this taking into consideration is it really asking too much for folks to do their part to slow or stop the spread of Covid by wearing a mask and getting vaccinated!? If you still say no, then you're a selfish person not an American patriot."

We need one federal norm for all people when nation is under crisis instead of letting local governments play politics against national interests and push people towards dangers of deaths ya worst long term consequences thereafter due to infections. We have witnessed such craziness from few governors who threatened even local school authorities to stay away from mask mandates ya loose the school funds which may be even unconstitutional. They don’t care for your children’s well-being except trying to appease liars & stay in power by brainwashing people against experts advices as well scientifically proven facts for saving lives.

I’m furious as well. Ms. Chandra lives in the state of Utah which is the home to the Mormon Church which claims to be Jesus’ only true church on the earth. Yet, as the article states, only 53% of its citizens have been vaccinated. Apparently, the Golden Rule is no longer a part of Mormon theology. It is time to stop treating antivaxxers with kid gloves. Businesses need to start requiring proof of vaccination before admittance and strictly enforcing it. All other types of public facilities need to do the same as well. The antivaxxers may claim to be freedom fighters, but they are misguided misanthropes. They, through their irresponsibility, are sickening others like Ms. Chandra’s child and allowing this virus to continue its deadly course. It’s time to hold them responsible and make them see that they are a blight upon our nation and our public health."

In the past week, the attorney general of louisiana, now the covid center of the world, pushed parents to defy mask mandate in schools because children's faces should be uncovered in order to spread God's love. Yep! That's right. How much more depraved can you get? What would Jesus do? Obviously, spread infection to children."

Sometimes you just have to accept the outcome of life’s dice rolls."
2021-08-11 14:28:06,"The comments section is something else on this one.

That said, the real tragedy here is this:  We haven't had clear message from the CDC or a national mask/vaccine mandate, which would be reasonable at this point (620k dead, and rising, in case we have all forgotten) because the GOP leaders, at nearly every level, are more concerned with winning elections and gaining power than ANYTHING else, so they pander to their hysterical, ignorant followers in order to garner votes and cash.  They've allowed unchecked disinformation on ""news channels"" and social media to proliferate because they know that even if a bunch of kids in Florida/Texas/Louisiana die, they will win.  It's sick.  

Why didn't the government take up the charge of making N95 masks for kids, mass produced and free to all, for fall school openings?  Because half the country is bleating about ""freedom"" and spewing ignorant nonsense about heartworm medication as a ""cure.""  Common sense and common good are no longer winning anyone elections, so why bother.

People will line up on 9/11 to 'Never Forget' the 2977 people killed that day, and jump through all kinds of hoops at an airport to fly, but won't blink an eye about the number of Covid dead, never mind those sick with long Covid, and will refuse put on a stupid mask to protect THEIR OWN CHILDREN and people who are most at risk.

Good luck this fall, folks.  You're gonna need it."
2021-08-11 14:16:24,"Sadly, I think the sentiment expressed here, which was completely valid January through May, i.e. that the unvaccinated are putting others at risk, has largely been overcome by events.  It applied to the old virus, but not to this new disease, delta.  

It’s hard and jarring to keep up, after spending months acclimating to the conclusions and understanding of the old virus, to the sudden and blindingly swift substitution of the new strain, with very different characteristics.

Under delta, Pfizer appears to be only very weakly able to prevent mild/asymptomatic infection, and unlike the old strain, vaccinated people seem to shed equal amounts of virus.  Even worse, it may *increase* asymptomatic cases (by reducing severity of mild cases), which may possibly cause more community transmission due to more carriers being unaware they are contagious and continuing to be out and about.  This may or may not overcome the small benefit in efficacy against mild/asymptomatic infection.  We are back to masks and distance as your best way to protect others.  

Vaccination is still of course a good idea for your *own* benefit (ie a 10-fold reduction in risk of your hospitalization or death), but it’s no longer clear whether it’s a negative or positive on overall public Ro now that delta has essentially exterminated the old strain."
2021-08-11 12:12:44,"I do have compassion on this child as I too have a son who struggles with virus-induced asthma. But if vaccinated people can be carriers of Covid and spread it just as much as the unvaccinated, how would getting vaccinated help him? It seems that the real issue is that he can’t be vaccinated. I know some would counter that if everyone is vaccinated the virus wouldn’t be able to mutate and spread, but we are not an isolated country - the Delta variant was in other countries before it came here, and unless the whole world were vaccinated I don’t see his situation changing."
2021-08-11 19:00:01,"I want my 10 year old vaccinated NOW.

I would be happy to sign a  consent / waiver form if that was necessary.

Don't hold up this life-saving vaccine from our kids!"
2021-08-11 19:11:59,"People seem very confused about breakthrough cases and vaccine efficacy. Yes, breakthrough cases are more likely with Delta, but that is only compared to Alpha which presented almost no breakthrough cases.

In addition to protecting from critical illness, the vaccine is still relatively effective at preventing infection and therefore limiting the circulation of the virus.

This mean that more people need to be vaccinated to effectively drop the transmission rate. It does NOT mean that the vaccine is ineffective at limiting the spread of the virus."
2021-08-11 19:34:32,"The reason the Delta variant exists is that the virus was able to weave its way through the unvaccinated population, mutating along the way to become more and more efficient. That's what viruses do. If people do not vaccinated and the vaccination rate remains stubbornly low, then we are likely to see the next COVID variant emerge. This process could go on for years. What's more important? Resisting vaccination and proving that our so-called ""individual freedoms"" are still intact? Or getting vaccinated and allowing all people in our society to get back to living full, healthy lives?"
2021-08-11 19:29:49,"Our son now age 18+ was born a brittle type 1 juvenile diabetic and we were always careful whom we were around and even careful to make sure our home was uncluttered and clean. 

Flu season was always hard, since so many people did not stay home when they had the flu.  Up until COVID 19 this was still the case.  People went to work, religious services, school when sick.

Since others didn't seem to think keeping their child home when sick was necessary, we homeschooled as did friends we have.  Thankfully, as he matured his immune system did as well.  

Since the 80's we have become such a me me me minded society, where not thinking about others has become the norm, and we now see the results.  

Wearing a mask has become a me me spoiled brat 'I don't want to' idea, versus 'of course I will, if it will keep a child or an adult with a compromised immune system safer'!"
2021-08-11 17:41:27,"We do not live in a closed off country. If we were the unvaccinated would not have as much risk as they have today, not quite herd immunity, but more stable and potentially descreasing  numbers of cases. 
But, we have allowed people to enter the US with and without vaccinations. We've seen reports of illegal immigrants released into the US with active cases of covid. We've seen the limits to access to the US by foreign workers dropped by the current administration. 
Vaccination is the way to address these risks, but considering the behavior of the virus I wouldn't put all the blame on the unvaccinated."

While I feel bad for these children and their families, the effort, time and resources being expended on keeping these most vulnerable alive is unwarranted.

It seems we are headed that way. Especially with Covid, the Delta Variant and politics entering the health arena (a pox on governors with misguided ambitions). With children now susceptible, it is time for action leading to mandates without hesitance.

Government wonks say ""all politics is local"" (which I whole-heartedly believe). Austin is already exercising this  ability. San Francisco too. Except in SF's case, city workers are balking at mandates. Fine, take a vote city-wide (electronically) and those 160-ish in SF alone can choose to seek city government employment working for Abbot or Desantis.

There should be no coverage, public or private, for unvaccinated COVID patients who do not have a valid medical reason why they can't be vaccinated.  There should be no pushing aside other patients to make room for desperately ill COVID patients.  They should not be permitted on public transportation, in restaurants, stores, theaters, parks, churches and anyplace else where people gather.

This should go for those who refuse to have their children vaccinated against potentially lethal diseases like measles as well."
2021-08-11 19:29:51,"Meanwhile red states like Arkansas, where surges in the Delta variant are forcing officials to be realistic, are now recommending students wear masks to protect themselves. 

Not Florida's bombastic Republican Ron DeSantis (who glibly shamelessly, and stupidly, says he knows nothing about all those ventilators being sent to his state). Student health doesn't seem to figure in his unrealistic cartoon world view."
2021-08-11 18:41:30,"Those who cry ""personal freedoms"" as the reason they will not get vaccinated are simply telling the world that their idea of ""freedom"" is more important than the welfare of their fellow Americans. The unvaccinated are either extremely selfish or extremely ignorant. There is too much real data out there that tells everyone that the Covid vaccines are both safe and effective at preventing serious illness and helping prevent the spread of the virus. To willfully not get vaccinated for any non health reason is pure ignorant selfishness. Such people should be denounced by all caring Americans. Governors like Abbott and DeSantis who push rules designed to override attempts at preventing viral spread by masking and vaccine mandates should be impeached for malfeasance."
2021-08-11 19:30:02,"There are no words sufficiently strong to denounce the people who refuse to be vaccinated. If it were only their safety at risk then it could be an individual choice, but it’s not. Their selfish behavior puts all of society at risk. As to the Republican Party………. there can only be total condemnation."
2021-08-11 18:45:44,"So all these people who have resisted mask wearing until now, are they going to continue to vote for the Republicans who believe that choice for mask wearing is more important than saving the lives of their neighbors from illness and death?

That’s the real question going forward.

We already know that unvaccinated, non-mask wearers get sick more often and die more often as well as spread the disease more often.  Maybe if enough of them get sick and/or die they will reduce the voting population for Republicans or perhaps change the attitude of others who “aren’t sure.”  A very Scrooge-like outcome, but in this case, it could be realistic."
2021-08-11 17:32:37,"This mask issue in Texas is like shouting into a well. It shouldn't even be an issue at all. Texans screaming about their freedoms is ridiculous. No one loses any freedom wearing a mask. I'm so angry at our ""governor."" I'm just hoping he is voted out of office. If someone doesn't want to take the vaccine, fine. But mask wearing in public should be mandatory and Abbott has written a executive order prohibiting mask mandates. Thank goodness so many school districts and city governments have overridden the executive order and decided to mandate them anyway."
2021-08-11 19:39:07,"This is no longer the United States of America that many of us in at least our 50’s once knew. It is as though the last flicker of humanity in a large portion of the citizenry has simply died out. Citizens are now instead consumers with selfishness and personal gratification top on the list. It is not even “America First.” It is “Me First and maybe if I take a moment consult my conscience, also my wife and kids.” 

This seems to represent the apotheosis of the Land of Opportunity. Another way of saying that is “Where’s Mine?” What kind of monster is so preoccupied with his freedom and the uncomfortableness of a mask that he willingly and knowingly helps spread death to children and the infirm, and brushes that aside as the “price of freedom”? 

Such people are not Americans. They are themselves the Walking Dead. It is time to call things out for what they are. 

The time for political correctness is over. If a (Smallpox) vaccine was good enough for George Washington to order his troops to take to win our Independence, when he was his own CDC, our civic tolerance for those who want to drag us all down by choosing not to receive the vaccine must end. People who are convinced the World is flat are going to have trouble adjusting. People who choose to resist vaccination except when legitimately and reasonably justified, do not need to be accommodated. Let them form their own leper colonies and spread their version of freedom amongst themselves."

It makes me so sad that much of this could have been/could be prevented if we would look out for one another and behave in ways to protect our most vulnerable. Instead, American society is so focused on ""me, me, me"" and ""my freedoms"" that we put children in this horrible situation."

Please continue to share stories like this, about those who suffer, as that might break through the wall of false belief and denial for at least a few of the victims of the covid minimizers. For the minimizers themselves I have no hope. Some believe what they are selling others are making too much money off it, but we must remember who they are and hold them accountable when all is done.

One thing I've noticed on social media is that minimizers are now claiming masks prevent people from feeling empathy for others or prevent children from learning to be empathetic or some such. Putting aside how bizarre this theory is, I want to speak about another form of masking which clearly is preventing the minimizers from feeling empathy--the beautiful glass buildings, or in some cases the ugly modernist facades, behind which those who are sick are gasping for breath. In the modern world we mask illness and death so much that the minimizers feel more empathy for a cute six year old annoyed at wearing a mask--or not even annoyed, for the minimizers are happily annoyed on their behalf!--then they do for the child or adult who is suffering terribly, or dying. We must unmask so these projectors of their own lack of empathy onto others can see what they have wrought."

A virus is living demonstration of how our lives are interconnected. So if you can convince people that their only obligation is to themselves and their nearest family, you will prime the electorate to expect nothing from, and give nothing to, the common good.

They would voluntarily give you the shirt off thier back and the shoes off their feet.  However, if the government tells them they MUST give you thier shirt and shoes they will fight it tooth and nail. 

Freedom is valued above public health initiatives and freedom is valued above nearly any program the government is pushing. There is an ingrained distrust of government that I hadn't experienced until I moved here. Most Utahns believe the government is too big and too powerful, and will push back against what they view as overreach, even if the intention is good. They would rather have higher covid numbers than let the government mandate masking and vaccination. Losing personal freedoms is scarier than covid. 

I am vaccinated, and I hope more Utahn's choose to be as well. But I don't harbor any animosity toward my neighbors who choose otherwise, and I certainly don't blame them for this boy's covid infection, as his mother does."
2021-08-11 18:08:42,"There are loads of immunosuppressed folks out there... not just children... I live with one.   And for me & us, the shutdown never ends.  We of course are vaccinated and are extremely hesitant to see anybody.

I remember the 1980's, when I lived near San Francisco, and everyone was terrified about AIDS until its true mechanism of transmission was elucidated... and then we thought, we don't exchange body fluids in the manner or at the frequency of AIDS sufferers.

And then we learned that clotting factor & blood transfusions were spreading AIDS to a lot more people than anybody ever thought.

It is likely that at a low rate unexpected and undocumented mechanisms of COVID transmission are out there.  Please, wear a mask & get vaccinated to save the lives of those who might be victims of those currently poorly understood pathways."

How can Republican Governors De Santis and Abbott impose State controls on School Boards and other democratically elected bodies, that want to protect their students with masks, social distancing and mass vaccination and then argue they stand for individual freedom of choice ?
Parents should be the ultimate deciders of their children safety.

It would stop the arrogant unmasked in their tracks and save a lot of lives. Our children deserve protection from these monsters."

She cannot attend the local district’s preschool,starting soon, because of rapidly rising infections. She’s extremely vulnerable. The virus has meant that despite her remarkable development, there’s little chance of her having contact with other children. Her parents know one other family with two young daughters, whom they trust, but visits are infrequent. She’s been called a “ miracle baby.” But scienceand skilled nursing got her this far. The same science gave us the vaccines.

2021-08-10 00:18:17,"Why don't we have an open trial for parents willing to vaccinate their kids? Our government should not have a business-as-usual outlook with deadly pandemics.

2021-08-10 01:02:51,"Thank you for writing this piece. It is infuriating that we have the technology to save the lives of hundreds of children that are bound to die between now and the end of the year, and yet we are not allowed to make use of it. Parents should have the right to decide what is safest for their children. Why should only antivax parents be given that choice? There is no option that involves no risk. With how contagious the Delta variant is all children who are not homeschooled will get Covid, and the health outcomes for thousands of them will be much more dire than the side effects of a vaccine that's already been safely used by hundreds of millions of adults and thousands of children (the lucky ones that were chosen for the trials). Yes, the vaccine can cause myocarditis. But so does Covid, and at a much higher rate."
2021-08-10 01:05:12,"Why can't the FDA with the present data at hand approve emergency use. If there are some parents who are wary and prefer to wait several months, let them wait. But those parents who seem fine with the present data and advice from other experts, let their children take the vaccine. That will expand the pool of testing too. Amazing how the FDA has to walk on egg shells due to political pressure and not to medical considerations and trade offs.."
2021-08-10 01:09:39,"There is a Catch-22 with COVID vaccines for kids under 12: If they get approved soon and it is perceived as too early, and just one child (god forbid) has a life-threatening response, the result would be a wave of vaccine refusal on the part of terrified parents. If they get approved three or four months from now, thousands of kids will likely experience a life-threatening illness, but somehow that will be considered politically acceptable."
2021-08-10 01:09:48,"Does anyone publish data on the effects of the COVID virus on kids? Hospitalizations, intubations, recoveries, deaths? I've seen very little and knowing more would help all of us better understand the issues."

Since some parents believe in the garbage posted on social media by foreign and domestic protagonists whom have no credentials to back their claims, I can understand why they are confused, and that is the point.  They should know better and talk to their doctors who provide them care.

Undermining any government and its people are easy when its people are gullible and leadership that care only about elections and less about its nation."

2021-08-10 01:16:15,Michelle - we understand you are worried about your kids.

Don't let your anxiety affect your ability to report the facts.

(NYT just published an article on long COVID in kids).  I will be first in line to get them vaccinated when it is approved, but that will only protect them from getting seriously ill/hospitalized--they could still get infected and develop long COVID. Until COVID is eliminated even our vaccinated children will still be at risk."
2021-08-10 01:25:57,"Let's face it ---the FDA is ""snake bit"" about now.  If not the controversial approval of Aduhelm, the new therapy for Alzheimer's, it is the lack of full approval for the COVID-19 vaccines. 

Dosing for children is far more involved; they are not little adults.  Why we're seeing a dramatic increase in pediatric ICUs is almost exclusively because of ill-informed or otherwise willfully careless adults who are neither vaccinated nor masking. Yes, we need to vaccinate the under 12s as soon as the science tell us it's safe and effective. But there's much that can be done to protect them beforehand."
2021-08-10 01:25:58,"COVID vaccines for kids can and should wait until more study is done.

2021-08-10 01:33:31,"""Meanwhile, as the Delta variant sweeps through the country, every day brings new stories of overflowing pediatric wards.""

That is an actual falsehood. There are no true stories of overflowing pediatric wards. CNN tried to run a story about an overflowing Children's hospital in Miami, in a huge banner on their frontpage nonetheless, and then had to remove mention of it because it was false and the number of kids with Covid in the hospital was tiny.

There is no urgency because children under 12 are barely affected by Covid. Yes, it would be nice to have those vaccines available, but Covid has been barely a blip to the young kids, much more mild than the various flus and certainly about as deadly. And we never freaked out about the flus. Pneumonia is much more dangerous than Covid to kids, and we certainly don't pull kids out of classrooms for fear of that.

The kids can spread Covid, which is probably the biggest of the tiny threats that is there. There was no scientific justification for closing schools last year, considering the level of infections in the schools that were open. My kid was in school full time, face to face, with zero days missed due to quarantine. And is going back with no trepidation or vaccine (first grade). Once vaccines are available for him, we will get it. But really, enough of this fearmongering. Kids are as safe as they usually are going back to school this year."
2021-08-10 01:33:46,"I told my colleagues this past spring that I think we're entering the most dangerous stretch of the pandemic. This fall is going to be an unmitigated disaster. We'll have vaccinated, unvaccinated, and partially vaccinated kids back en masse without having done any of the hard infrastructural changes necessary to keep teachers, children, and their families safe. 

At least last year we had diminished numbers to help offset the spread. We're going to have packed classrooms, a deadly more infectious variant, and ongoing political gamesmanship and pressure to both mask and unmask. 

You don't have to be an epidemiologist to know this isn't going to end well. I've lost all patience with those who wring their hands about barbaric and ignorant moments in history. We've proven ourselves no better than ancestors who had no access to the science and data we do. It's inexcusable. 

If this follows the debacles in India and Indonesia, we'd better be prepared to lose many children for forcing an agenda that has not once bent to the will of the disease. Instead, we keep insisting that partying, sports, vacationing, and work (the only excusable/understandable one) come before safety.

 I hope some realize the price they may be paying for what lies ahead."
2021-08-10 01:35:46,"The Biden FDA and CDC have reverted to pre-Trump lethargy and indecisiveness.   We are seeing what happens when ""the science"" is left to its own devices, flailing about in secrecy while elected officials are left without the information needed to make executive decisions about the tradeoffs - economic, social and health - they are elected to make.   The FDA should not escape accountability.    Instead, it is shrouded in secrecy as people continue to die.    Unacceptable."
2021-08-10 01:36:46,"I am a pro-science, pro-vaccine liberal, and I don't share the hurry or feeling of helplessness that the author describes.

I also take heart from my European friends, who've been sending their kids to school, unmasked, since the beginning of the pandemic, and the doctors in the UK, who are making no apologies about delaying approval for the vaccine for kids under 16 (except those with high-risk conditions) until abundant safety data is available. 

I want the FDA to take the same care with our kids. We'll vaccinate when it's fully approved and not sweat it in the meantime."

2021-08-10 01:38:40,"Thank you for your intelligent and thoughtful column.

If the NYT and other newspapers were to print the names, ages, and locations of each and every covid death under 12 years, the way 9/11 deaths were reported, maybe this process would move faster and the Republican governors blocking vaccines in Texas and Florida would not be able to face reporters."
2021-08-10 01:40:29,"As long as your kids are wearing masks at school, and as long as their schools maintain covid safety protocols at all times, you really shouldn’t worry too much. You likely live in a high vax area as well, which should somewhat ease your fears. 

The people who should be worried are those who live in areas where the vaccination rate is low and where parents are storming the boards of education, demanding that schools ditch the mask requirement. I wish their behavior blew my mind, but having taught science in Alabama, I expected this. They’re not worried about vaccinating their children because they won’t even vaccinate themselves. 

The only thing we can really do at this point is whatever it takes to protect ourselves and our kids. Even when a vaccine is available, you’re going to have parents who won’t allow their kids to take it. There will be even more hesitancy regarding vaccinations for kids under 12, I think. Covid is going to be a fixture in our lives for much longer than those of us who “believe in science” thought and I don’t know if yelling and screaming will do a bit of good."
2021-08-10 01:08:43,"I’m frustrated with the FDA and the Biden administration, esp., the CDC. Yes, not as much as the previous administration — that was lack of administration.

The FDA is taking its own sweet time to approve vaccines for kids, and give its full approval for all adults. 

The current rampant spread even in blue states can be singled down to one person’s reckless decision. That of Rachel Wollensky. Removing indoor mask mandates for the “vaccinated” was so short sighted, given there are no enforcement mechanisms to check if people are actually vaccinated. This one decision is putting kids, adults and the vulnerable at a much greater risk, and has caused needless suffering and deaths. The states are just “following CDC guidelines”."
2021-08-10 01:06:57,"Unfortunately, you are wrong on the facts. First, you are misrepresenting the AAP's letter. You are better than that. More importantly, sometimes the ill effects of vaccines do take time to materialize. Please read the wikipedia article on the vaccine for Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Developed in the 1960s it did in fact cause severe illness and death through a rather scary mechanism called 'vaccine enhanced respiratory illness', a mechanism similar to a dengue infection.  RSV is a seasonal illness, and the impact was not felt for many months until the next RSV season when children who had been immunized suffered natural infection. 80% of vaccinated children where hospitalized. Some died.

The point isn't that we should expect something similar with CV19. The point is, we should leave this to the experts. The FDA and CDC are guided by years of experience. They are going as fast as they can. But experience has taught them to be cautious. They know the difference between adolescent and mature immune systems. You don't. 

Be humble. Be cool. Let the scientists do the science. Sometimes you just have to wait. 

Meanwhile, try to get the facts right."
2021-08-10 01:15:34,"The people who claim they refuse to vaccinate their children because of the minuscule chance that the vaccine might harm them are perfectly willing to expose their kids to the chance that COVID could made them very, very sick.

2021-08-10 01:43:11,"It's relevant to quote the Facebook CEO when it comes to introducing Covid vaccines for children from 5 to 11 NOW. Said Mark Zuckerberg: “The biggest risk is not taking risk. In a world that is changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.” How do we expect schools to open in Fall if children are not vaccinated and fall prey to the pandemic? Statistics teaches us that demanding 100% certainty is equivalent to living in a fool's paradise. We need our future generation to be safe from the coronavirus. Time is of the essence here. The United States has garnered the largest number medals among all nations in each of the three categories - Gold, Silver and Bronze - in the just concluded Tokyo Olympics. Where are our geniuses who can claim the gold or the silver or even the bronze in vaccinating our children?"
2021-08-10 01:45:46,"I have two kids under 12 - and will NOT send them back to public school until they are both vaccinated. I suggest other parents who might be similarly disposed communicate our concerns to school districts and local and federal health agencies, to whatever extent possible.  My sense is that, generally speaking, our community and governmental leaders are much less sure and confident in their decisions than they might appear, and are open to reasoned discussion of these rather unprecedented issues."
2021-08-10 01:47:45,"I've an 11 year old, was going to start school in person in a few days. Watching the Delta stats, even in a good area on vaccination and protection - they're higher than when we closed the schools initially! I can't send him to school unprotected. 

I've been signed up to be part of a trial, anything that would get it faster. Watching what happens with long COVID to kids - I can't take that risk. He will get one more half year of online school, even if it's not as good."
2021-08-10 01:49:47,"Again, policy appears to be driven by the reluctant and ignorant rather than by science.  I get it, policy is complicated.

As a parent of 8 and 10 year olds, the delta variant has me more concerned than last year.  I don’t want to rush something, but neither do I want the FDA to perseverate over this so long that the risk of mass infections outweighs the risks of potential side effects.

A vaccine is always a calculus competing risks.  There is no thing as certainty, just like “beyond a reasonable doubt” is a jury’s standard."
2021-08-10 02:00:00,"----""The problem is that the F.D.A. won’t be blamed for avoidable Covid cases the same way it would be blamed for unexpected vaccine side effects. All of its institutional incentives therefore point toward excessive wariness.""  ---

2021-08-10 02:00:50,My kid turns 12 in mid-September and starts school in mid-August. It seems crazy that I can't get her vaccinated one month early given the risks of the Delta variant.
2021-08-10 02:01:06,"Why can't we do both? Emergency authorization is just that. An emergency medical treatment sent out with limited testing. There's still a disclaimer on the vaccine. You're effectively volunteering for a clinical trial. If you're willing to participate, go for broke. The child is your responsibility. If you as a parent judge the benefit outweighs the risk, go ahead. You have the legal authority to vaccinate your child with two months testing.

For those who are wary, the FDA can offer a second validation at six months. It's not like doctors stop collecting data just because the FDA approved an emergency authorization. If you don't want to participate in a clinical trial, don't. That's your prerogative. If children start showing signs of black death or leprosy or whatever other pox you want to mention, you can say ""I told you so.""

For those who do opt out though, I would weigh the decision heavily against a school year just around the corner. We don't have any coherent plan in place. Skip school? Or stick your kid in a viral incubator? Your choice but I would err on the side of too much inoculation rather than too little."
2021-08-10 02:01:34,"The FDA has never before had as much information about a vaccine as it has for the COVID vaccines NOW.  Why is it delaying its approval of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines?  

Many people justify their delay in being vaccinated by the lack of the FDA's formal approval of the vaccines.  Those who have not been vaccinated are factories for the evolution of new and possibly more deadly mutations of the virus.  This has to stop ASAP.

So, to the FDA, stop sitting on your hands and get to work.  Either approve these vaccines or tell us why you cannot NOW.  Every day that the FDA delays means another several hundred lives lost and increases the likelihood of a catastrophic explosion of infections in the fall and winter."
2021-08-10 02:03:17,"The slow approval of the vaccine isn’t a failure of science — it’s a sign that science is working. The vaccine was approved swiftly for adults because covid is an emergency for adults. It’s not an emergency for kids.

The vaccine has to clear a higher bar of safety for kids. One of the concerns is that it causes a very small risk of myocarditis in young people, particularly boys. Remember, the risk of severe effects from covid in kids is also extremely small. This slow process is science in action."
2021-08-10 02:03:18,"I completely agree with the urgency. My daughter’s camp has shut down for the second time in a few weeks due to small outbreaks.  I don’t think I can take the lack of childcare and a demanding career again after what I went through this spring. I can feel the dread of what is coming this fall. Until we can keep our kids safe, it’s going to continue to be utter chaos for families."
2021-08-10 02:05:41,"This article does not go far enough. The FDA messed up bigly. How? By failing to require a greater number of participants in the pediatric trials that commenced months ago. Given the stakes involved, the decision to ""go small"" in terms of number of subjects in the 5-11 year old trials for both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines was an egregious and unforced error.  The blames rests squarely with the FDA, not the sponsors. Worse still, Peter Marks, the head of CBER, needs to explain why the FDA did NOT request larger pediatric trials to account for the possibility of a rare effect."
2021-08-10 02:13:50,"There are many assumption in this article from people calling for a rushing out of the vaccine - people outside the process - and, even as the father of an 11 year old, I wonder if this isn't a time to let cooler heads prevail. A botched rollout would be an absolute fiasco; for the kids involved, and for the greater vaccination campaigns, both here and around the world, both with this pandemic and future efforts. We don't actually know the motivation for the delays, but we do know that kids don't get nearly as sick as adults. I am, like so many parents, terrified that schools are starting back up and we're throwing children into a potentially very dangerous environment, but I don't believe forcing the hand of the FDA is the solution."
2021-08-10 02:26:33,"Yes it can wait. It can wait for the FDA statisticians and scientists to be extremely confident that these mRNA vaccines are safe short and maybe even medium term for kids. They need to get this right. If they need more time to get it right then so be it.

 As it is, even people who got the vaccine themselves are reluctant to give it to their kids because they understand the reality that long term safety data simply won’t be available for years to come. The FDA needs to check every box possible in their due diligence before telling Americans that they can inject it into their kids with confidence. I’m not sure our institutions- whether it be the FDA or CDC— can risk another major discrediting event before losing the trust of even rational Americans."
2021-08-10 02:34:28,"In the meantime, until the vaccine is available to 5-11 year olds, mandate the vaccine for everyone 12 and older, plus masks for everyone.  I have an under-12 child who, if infected, will at least have to miss a significant amount of school (he will be tested in order to attend) and have his life disrupted yet again, even if he is totally asymptomatic.  How is that an acceptable outcome, at this point?"
2021-08-10 02:36:18,"Thank you Michelle. The FDA needed Act Up to waken them from their stupor during the early days of AIDS epidemic.  It is time for parents, grandparents and anyone who cares about our kids to be heard.  Ultimately, when the vaccine is available to children on an emergency use basis, it will be up to the parents to decide whether or not to vaccinate their young children.
BTW, I am the grandparent of an infant who became ill with SARS-CoV-2 despite the fact that both parents are vaccinated."
2021-08-10 02:41:58,"My grandchild is 3 years old and is scheduled to start preschool in the fall while his dad works full time and his mom takes an internship as part of her degree program. I work full time too. One of us may have to cut back on work or school in order to safeguard this dear child's health. We are fully vaccinated and yet we have barely changed our routine since the initial lockdown, because we don't want to risk a delta infection. I wonder how long is this going to go on. Sure, we can care for him and even teach him at home. But when will my grandchild ever be able to safely make a friend? And yes, I'm well aware that we are the fortunate ones."

2021-08-10 02:50:48,"I hope the parents who are so worried about their kids health make sure their lunches include no processed junk and that when they come home they don’t have sugar laden drinks and snacks. Preventing disease is much more than a shot in the arm. The data clearly shows that the risk of hospitalization and death is higher in unhealthy individuals. And no, the one person you heard of who was healthy and still got sick doesn’t change the statistics."
2021-08-10 02:51:51,"If every eligible adults would get vaccinated, kids would be at much lower risks (and this wave probably wouldn’t have been so bad to begin with). It infuriates me to think that people who believe in science now have to worry about their kids because of other adults who refuse to do the right thing."
2021-08-10 02:52:03,"This is a public health emergency. Aren't FDA review personnel living at their offices (or at home and working on an around the clock schedule) until their job is done? If necessary data are in the possession of someone not the FDA, then have an airtight schedule for its submission and if delayed, get a warrant for FDA enforcement personnel (if any are left) to go get it or for NSA to hack it out of whatever equipment it's stored on. Pharma companies with such data are in regulated industries and have much narrower protection against administrative searches and seizures. This  should have been done six months ago."
2021-08-10 02:56:34,"There are tremendous politics away from science that are obviously at work and will not at all dealt with by doing things like blaming teacher's unions or anything of the sort.   It seemed right to me at least kids themselves were not on the urgent list for care when they should be.   And I will generalize, perhaps it is useful to think of a much larger potential population than a lot of the U.S. population wanted to think about.   Times have really changed from the latter twentieth century in this country.  If people only had a reference point to when vaccinations for children tended to be mandatory.  Like here in California.  Things have not changed all that much.  A lot of us have strong feelings on the fact that we benefited as we did.  The level of complacency is not acceptable. Start work on it as soon as possible.   This country seems retrograde on any kind of future thinking."
2021-08-10 02:59:53,"Michelle Goldberg has good reason to be scared for her children. We started back to high school today with students all wearing masks, but we had 3 assemblies where the whole student body was crammed together sitting on the floor closer than airline seats. Most students are not vaccinated. They were all screaming and yelling, so lots of forcefully expelled air was floating around. I called it, ""The Not OK Covid Corral."" All of the teachers are mystified as to why social distancing is suddenly gone with the wind. Kids are crammed tightly together with over 40 students in small classrooms not built to accommodate these numbers with not even elbow room between them. Many students took their masks all the way off or had their nose poking out in the assemblies. Administration is oblivious to the risks and gleefully packs the students in to the overcrowded classrooms instead of hiring more teachers. Studies show that 1/2 to 1/3 of children who contract Covid will also contract long haul Covid symptoms. I now have long haul Covid symptoms, and so I am frightened and angry that more isn't being done to protect our students because I know how debilitating it can be.
I give it three weeks before we all start dropping like flies, including teachers like myself who are vaccinated. It is like watching a train wreck in slow motion and not being able to do a thing about it."
2021-08-10 03:03:54,"I am all for vaccines. I am vaccinated. AND I support the FDA’s “fastidiousness”.  An undetected or under-examined but serious side effect in children would be a public health disaster — not just for this vaccine, for all future vaccines too. We would lose the public’s trust. 
Incidentally, the FDA requested more safety data because of concerns about post-vaccine myocarditis in kids, primarily boys. That’s worth looking into."
2021-08-10 03:04:54,"Yes. This. Thank you! You hear us. Those of us who have parented through this pandemic are exhausted. We once again feel we’ve been thrown to the wolves and asked to fend for ourselves. My employer is demanding that we all return to full-time, in-person work. No vaccine requirements or social distancing. I’m once again trying to determine if my family could afford my loss of income so that I can stay home to keep my kids safe for just a few more months. I can’t believe I’m considering tossing away three advanced degrees and thirty years of struggle by our foremothers to homeschool my kids. It appears our country has learned nothing from this pandemic. Bars and restaurants in my progressive liberal city are full, while mothers continue to exist in a perpetual state of complete overwhelm, anxiety, anger, and dispair as we realize that once again, no one sees us and no one is coming to save us. So here we are, Enslaved by someone else’s “freedom.” Ladies take hold of the weapons of the weak: drag those feet, feign ignorance, obfuscate, avoid. Hold on to your paychecks if you can, even as give your employers the absolute bare minimal effort required to avoid getting fired. Take all the leave you are entitled to. Use what energy you have left and use it to directly support your sisters and neighbors and their kids.  We can hang in there for three more months for our kids. We have to, because no one else is going to keep them safe. I hope I’m wrong and the FDA surprises us."
2021-08-10 03:05:19,"The recent NY Times article about children who suffer from long-term COVID yesterday is alarming. I can’t help but wonder if potential for long-term neurological damage as a result of long COVID could be greater for children than for adults. Children's brains are still growing, they still acquiring skills, and still developing the sheath that protects their nervous system. I know, from working with children who have developmental delays, that there is a world of difference between learning something spontaneously because it is age-appropriate and just happens, and learning something for the first time as the result of guided and persistent therapeutic effort.  It is imperative that every effort be made to get vaccines to children as soon as is safely possible, without delays based on bureaucracy."
2021-08-10 03:06:03,Excellent analysis. The FDA is indifferent to the deaths that could be avoided if it moved faster. After hundreds of millions of vaccinations nobody actually believes that the FDA will actually now say that the Pfizer vaccine is unsafe. But it is taking its good time in approving of the vaccine. This is government at its very worst. Some Presidential leadership is desperately needed to get the FDA to move in a timely manner. Our lives depend upon it.
2021-08-10 03:12:48,"I agree with Michelle. It is time to expedite the vaccination approval process to include all school
children and if the data supports it, all infants regardless of age. Given the reality of the highly infectious delta variant, this is a public health and a national security emergency. It is time to mandate universal vaccination and masking in order to end this pandemic, to prevent further potentially more dangerous mutations, and to allay suffering, deaths, and illness. We have no other choice unless we are ignorant, foolish, and lack any patriotism and civic virtue."
2021-08-10 03:15:18,"Standards and protocol are established for good reasons.  
Sometimes, desperate times call for desperate measures, but this is not that time. 
Remember why the FDA was established in the first place, remember it’s purpose. 

Stampeding over all proper rules of order, precedents, and protocol may get the results that some want, but it also will bequeath the stampede process precedence to the next problem — or political party."
2021-08-10 03:16:02,I’m interested to know how many parents who hired teachers for pod learning last year will be continuing pod learning this fall. These comments describing situations where children are already quarantining for 10 days after not even 1 day of school are maddening. How on earth will parents manage work and childcare with these constant disruptions?
2021-08-10 03:19:04,"""Kids under five, unfortunately, will likely have to wait until the beginning of next year"".
    I am worried about kids under five. It looks like a vaccine for younger children likely won’t be available until late fall or even next year, that is too long a period to wait. Already we are seeing more hospitalization in children and even deaths. So how do you protect your children?
    Indoor mask mandates are absolutely necessary to protect our children.  I am not concerned about my children or other unvaccinated children who are around fully vaccinated people, but I’m very concerned about unvaccinated people being around others who are also unvaccinated – whether they’re children or adults.
   The Delta variant is highly contagious, there is no room for error. If there is somebody who is infected who is unvaccinated and there are other unvaccinated people around, there is a higher likelihood that those unvaccinated people are going to contract Covid-19 – and that includes children.
 The FDA should approve emergency use of the vaccine as early as possible. I can understand their difficulties. Children are not just little adults. Young children may need different doses. They may need a different number of doses. They may not need as many doses. The dose depends on the maturity of their immune system. But 99 percent of experts in this field are convinced that the vaccines are absolutely safe in children."
2021-08-10 03:21:12,"I want my kids vaccinated too, but I also think we need to face the fact that COVID-19 is becoming an endemic infection. Even when kids are vaccinated, immunity will wane over time, and new strains will evolve that evade vaccines (though hopefully this will cause only mild illness). Currently, the risks of Covid to kids are on par with what we accept from other viruses like flu and RSV and from decisions like getting in a car. I’ll still have my kids wear masks and get them vaccinated when I can, but perhaps it’s time to stop letting risk of Covid rule kids’ lives."
2021-08-10 03:22:06,"It's a failure of gigantic proportions not giving the vaccines full FDA approval. It's another gigantic failure of what we normally assume to be our priority as a society, our children!,  not having the vaccines for children under 12, including toddlers. Science gave us the answer; bureaucratic processes gave us delays, costing countless lives, immense pain and suffering."
2021-08-10 03:26:13,"""I’m not qualified to make judgments about how the F.D.A. collects safety data""

2021-08-10 03:26:17,"Thank you for this article! I have been saying the same thing. I live in a red county with soaring delta rates and people are being so cavalier with the whole thing that it’s giving me terrible anxiety about the start of school. You should have heard the vitriol and total rubbish at the last school board meeting!

I’m just so ready to give my young kids a little protection that we can take into our own hands because I’m tired of depending on strangers who have largely proven themselves completely undependable. So much for Midwest nice."
2021-08-10 03:27:18,"Please mandate teachers’ vaccinations.  The teachers unions in NYC and other cities are against mandates, and many teachers are not vaccinated."
2021-08-10 03:31:27,"Ms Goldberg writes that pharmaceutical companies want to ""expand the number of 5- to 11-year-olds in their clinical trials in order to better detect potential rare side effects."" Why use the adjective ""rare"" here, or even ""potential""? Doing so makes it sound like she's working for the vaccine manufacturers--they are attempting to detect side effects of the vaccines. The reason the FDA is probably showing less urgency about vaccinating children is that, thankfully, they have until recently been almost entirely spared negative effects of covid-19."
2021-08-10 03:32:10,Wonder how many parents may lose a child under 12 to Covid in the coming weeks and will then blame the FDA for its foot-dragging and will sue to get some form of justice/revenge.
2021-08-10 03:33:04,"Thank you thank you thank you for this piece. It is infuriating the very people who probably wont get their kids vaccinated are the ones making the FDA walk on eggshells - slowly. Meanwhile if the logical majority could vaccinate our kids, we as a nation would be closer to herd immunity. And a lot of parents could sleep at night again. Well, as well as parents can sleep on any given night."
2021-08-10 03:33:04,"The FDA is not indifferent to the pending disaster if kids don't have access to the vaccine. They are are scientists, who sit as a  deliberative body, analyzing data, and looking at the effects of the vaccine on children, as they did on adults. It is unfortunate that the virus is speeding along at the same time. But, we need the FDA is do their job and make the best decision(s)  as to the efficacy of the vaccines that they can, based on their expertise. 

In the meantime, while we await approval,  parents need to protect their kids proactively to the best of their ability. If that means keeping the kids home from school...do it."
2021-08-10 03:40:15,"As a parent of two children ages six and 10, I appreciate the balance of your article describing a very complex issue, as well as your disclosure about deleting your tweet.

2021-08-10 03:54:56,"Thank you, thank you for saying this, Ms. Goldberg!  I feel like I've been screaming this into the void for many weeks now, ever since it became clear that delta was a whole different animal.  Our children are about to go back to school, and the balance of uncertainty clearly favors letting them get best-guess doses of the shots immediately--at our own risk, of course, with the understanding that efficacy may be imperfect--until the science can be settled.  Hundreds of millions of doses have been given with negligible problems, and ten-year-olds' immune systems can't possibly be so different from those of twelve-year-olds.  I understand the temptation to follow procedure and avoid liability, but in this case the bias toward inaction is literally killing children.

I personally know parents who lied about the age of their children to get the shot early, and I'll bet there are many others who have too.  They shouldn't have had to do so."
2021-08-10 03:56:22,"It will be extremely important for the vaccines to be approved for children 5 years of age and over, particularly with school starting in the next few weeks. Children that attend school need to be protected for themselves and their families, especially if they have older grandparents in their household or visiting frequently."
2021-08-10 04:05:14,"I went to the CDC web site to see the death rate of children under 12. That had died with the Covid Delta variant.

I could not find it. I could not find any statistics on that web site, at all. 

What we do know is that over 600,000 Americans have died, ""with covid."" Since January, 2020. Here in WA state, the death toll is 6,168. 80% of those deaths were people age 65+. There are 0% deaths, 18 and younger.

Covid is not a threat, to children. It never has been.

What is really going on, here."
2021-08-10 04:12:13,"As a middle school teacher and parent of three young children, I implore the FDA to expedite this process. Those of us who are willing to vaccinate our children should be allowed to do so.

Another school year of fear and masks is truly impossible."
2021-08-10 04:12:51,"Here’s the problem I have with this article pushing the FDA to hurry their approval for Covid vaccines for kids. To date coronaviruses (SARS, MERS and Covid-19) act very differently in kids v adults, especially older adults. That’s not true for flu and other respiratory pathogens. Ask any scientist why. They can’t tell you. It’s still somewhat of a mystery. So why is it unreasonable to assume that vaccines could, I emphasize could, also act very different in kids? Especially long term with new MRNA vaccine in kids with more naturally, rapidly dividing cells as part of their growth. 

I see no reason, with these medical and scientific questions still unanswered, to rush a vaccine to kids for a disease that poses a 0.005% mortality rate and relatively low morbidity rate in them.

If we’re going to follow the science, we should only follow it where it KNOWS the answer. We should be cautious and patient following where it’s speculating."
2021-08-10 04:28:08,Not with the Delta Variant. Kids are no longer safe.
2021-08-10 04:28:20,We all know people at work that drag their feet to get projects completed. They could cut the approval time in half if they really wanted to.
2021-08-10 04:31:59,"Thank you for this article. I agree with you that the covid vaccines can't come soon enough for children. My family is in the same position as the author -- we have a child too young to be vaccinated. We decided to homeschool our child until he can get vaccinated but most families can't do that (I was a teacher in a past life so I have the expertise to go it alone and the time to implement it and my child really enjoyed it and did fantastic last year). But it's still not ideal and it's not a possible reality for most American parents. I can't imagine how unnerving it must be to have to send your children into a group situation with a little-known variant (i.e. crowded schools with the Delta variant) and some parents have to do it without even masking their children. From what experts say, it seems like children aren't at high risk of dying of the virus but it does seem like many are having long-term health issues from it. I read in this newspaper that scientists think 11 - 15% of children who get Covid contract the long haul version even if they have little to no symptoms. I am concerned that we may be dealing with a cohort within an entire generation that has health issues from the covid they contracted as children near the end of the pandemic when there was actually a vaccine that could have prevented it. That would be a sad tragedy."
2021-08-10 04:38:50,"Thank you, this had to be said. As back to school approaches amid the raging delta variant and a large chunk of the adult population refusing to get vaccinated because of misinformation and conspiracy theories— I’m getting anxious to let my young kids sit in a classroom with 25 other unvaccinated kids for 7 hours 5 days a week. If one child gets delta they’ll all get it.

We have enough long term information and the vaccines are safe. Delaying availability to children is ethically and morally wrong."
2021-08-10 04:39:08,"On top of all the other horrors or putting our kids at risk of infection, is the fact that every infected person is another possible incubator of the next variant. Kids are just like adults in that regard. The more of them get it, the more opportunity there is for the virus to develop another successful variant — successful from the virus's viewpoint, that is."
2021-08-10 04:51:54,"The biggest reason to vaccinate kids isn't to save kids. It's to save adults. 600,000 adults have died of Covid in the U.S. and kids under 12 are accounting for an increasing portion of the remaining disease transmission that keeps the pandemic growing. I fully support the idea of my nine year old son taking the almost certainly very small risk of the vaccine in order to help save lives of others. Hundreds of American adults are dying each day, and we're not doing all we can to stop it."
2021-08-10 05:12:49,"I completely identify with this article, and with many of the comments here. I am afraid that the pendulum has swung all the way in the opposite direction, and we’re about to jump head first into an uncertain school year. We are in worse conditions (as in cases and trend thereof) than last year around the same time, when many schools (rightfully) decided to remain closed. And now we have delta.

I’d also point out that as more adults get vaccinated, we’ll be gradually cornering this virus into our kids, making it more likely that it will mutate to be able to transmit more efficiently in that population. We are playing with fire."
2021-08-10 05:14:04,"The FDA is far from an objective organization and they often make recommendations that have nothing to do with trials.  Lots of meds approvals attest to this - they slap restrictions on meds without data and approve meds without data.  But Covid is now a political football, thank you Trump et. al. and politicians think they have power over Nature.  Anyone following the studies of lungs of even non-symptomatic Covid patients would opt for a vaccine for their kids over the resulting permanent and not yet understood scar tissue in their lungs.  It's much more frightening than people realize."

Too bad, we want to go to bars, don't want to wear a mask, don't want to get the vaccine, want to do whatever we want. Want to get your kid vaccinated?

2021-08-10 02:48:00,"I'm a physician and parent and I feel like I'm being gaslit. There is an active campaign afoot trying to convince America that Covid, primarily a disease of the elderly, has become a disease of children. The data show that this is not true, but it doesn't matter. In fact, this is the fourth article or column in the Times pushing this narrative in the past 24 hours. Is it the Teachers' Unions? School has started in parts of the country already and teachers don't want to go back to the classroom. They say it openly. (Google ""Randi Weingarten""and ""scream bloody murder"" and see what you get.) Regardless, the data show that a child under 14 has a 0.009% of dying from Covid, while a child dies from pneumonia every 39 seconds. Moreover, data from around the world find that the IFR (Infection Fatality Rate) is very low for children and younger adults (2 in 100,000 at age 10, and 10 in 100,000 at age 25).  And it's getting better, not worse, as more people get vaccinated. Unfortunately, math doesn't fit with the narrative of the ""lockdowns forever"" fanatics. While a handful of children will get seriously ill with Covid, ALL children under Covid restrictions are being traumatized, some seriously. Disturbed and opportunistic adults will keep catastrophizing and find risk where little exists, ironically hurting children unnecessarily along the way. Being in lockdown and living under restrictions have become a way of life for too many."

The reason the delta variant has likely become so widespread is because of those who choose not to be vaccinated. So those same people are causing the FDA to be overly cautious about approving the vaccine for children? This is absurd, particularly as states like Florida and Texas are banning mask mandates in schools. The way the anti science, anti public health minority is being pandered to is why we are in this wave to begin with. Why are we coddling this contingent at the risk of seriously risking the lives of those least in control of their own health? I am, once again, disgusted."

2021-08-10 04:23:09,"Another concern with the delay in vaccinating children is the potential for their developing long-haul Covid after infection. So far this syndrome is considered rare in those who have been fully vaccinated.

See the article in the August 8th NYT: ""This Is Really Scary: Kids Struggle With Long Covid."" Quoted from that article: ""Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, cited one study suggesting that between 11% and 15% of infected youths might end up with this long-term consequence, which can be pretty devastating in terms of things like school performance.”"

In Germany we are having the same discussions, however at this time there is a prevailing attitude that it is too early to administer the vaccine to children. There is also the quandary that by redirecting production to children's vaccines, the rest of the world will have to wait even longer for vaccines.
But there is another issue: one year ago, the priority was to vaccine adults in order to protect those most at risk, the elderly. Now there is a push to vaccinate children in order to protect adults. At a certain point, the current vaccines will not be effective against new virus variants. Will we then vaccinate babies in order to protect kids? 
Why does it look like there is no long-term plan and people are desperately looking for a silver bullet to end this pandemic? I am not happy that my children have to wear masks in school all day, however I am more worried about them getting struck by a car while bicycling to school than I am about their catching Covid."

I  have agonized for months about preschool for my 4 year old. but I cant send him in good conscience when all the teachers aren't vax'd and there's no mask policy.  And we are one of the lucky ones, who can make the choice for me to not work (for yet another year). Most parents have no choice but to send their kids back to school and cross their fingers.  THERE IS A COST TO WAITING"

2021-08-10 06:00:28,"Here, here.

I would like to vaccinate my 1 and 6 year old kids to protect them from the risk of long term effects. I’ve read too many chilling medical studies of how this virus gets into the vital organs and brain. The current situation places them at great risk for infection."
2021-08-10 06:02:12,"When I was vaccinated for polio, my parents were thankful for the vaccine but they also knew that any vaccine does have risks. 

When I brought my children for vaccinations, their pediatrician informed me each time that every vaccine does carry a well documented risk.  The doctor and I trusted that the vaccines were put to scrupulous testing and declared as safe as possible. 

Children’s bodies are different from adult bodies in many ways. There’s more body processes and differences to consider than merely adjusting dose to weight.  

Every vaccine carries risk. Every fully FDA vaccine you’ve ever had has carried risks.  Read the small print, get vaccinated, and let the FDA scientists do their job."
2021-08-10 06:04:08,"If you assume unlimited funds, development of a vaccine for kids makes perfect sense. If you take into account all that is involved in research, testing, analyzing, producing distributing and administering the vaccine it adds up. Double blind studies of kids is sensitive stuff. Determining the proper dosage and modifications to the adult version is costly. Administering the vaccine kids is relatively difficult. And side effects are a bigger deal for kids. 

Most required vaccines are given to kids because kids are generally more vulnerable. With COVID, they are the least vulnerable. 

The question is whether the costs outweigh the benefits. If you ignore the costs, the answer is obvious. But why would you ignore the costs?"
2021-08-10 06:11:02,"I miss the Joe Biden who carried the number of dead in his pocket and promised that we couldn't fix the economy until we fixed the virus.

Why are we're rushing into the school year so bound and determined to start it by dismantling half of the classroom protections we used last year. I guess it's just politics. 

We can yell, kick, and scream for vaccines, and maybe you're right that we should. But the reality is that school's beginning and there's no time to get them all vaccinated first.

Once Covid spreads through the school, they're going to be quarantined on Zoom anyways. All the wishful thinking about in-person learning with full-capacity classrooms in the world won't change that. And once case loads get really high, there will be pressure to shut down for weeks. This happened the last two autumns in a row.

Why don't we learn?"

The rush to school, the lack of federal action to mandate & enforce safety in all schools concerns me, as a parent, greatly. I am highly disappointed with President Biden in failing to get all children vaccinated before school reopening. I hope his inaction doesn’t result in the myriad of deaths unnecessarily fostered by the last administration. 

Schools begin reopening in the South this week. The people need federal action without delay. Governors in the South have proven incapable of handling the pandemic and keeping the people safe."
2021-08-10 07:21:10,"What is equally crazy is that we don't have more vaccine mandates for teachers, caretakers and others who have relatively close contact with children 5-12.  It seems this should be a no brainer.  What we have is another instance in which 4 years of Republican attacks on government institution led to a hollowing out of those institutions and now they seem unable to speed things up when necessary."
2021-08-10 07:21:54,"Long COVID impacts at least 10 percent of all those who get COVID. If you think kids lost ground last year because of the loss of in-person schooling (and many did-my daughter taught a remote section.), imagine that kid with long-COVID, and its resulting ""brain-fog"". Of course, ""brain-fog"" appears likely to be ""forever"", 

Expedited availability for under 12 year olds is a far lower risk than the risk of long-COVID and its lifetime damage to learning. There is no imaginable side effect from the vaccine that can do anything like the damage to a young child as COVID.

With delta, every child is pretty likely to get COVID if they attend school in person un-vaccinated. 

The CDC is apparently more afraid of Republican lie-spew and nonsense than damaging children."
2021-08-10 07:32:54,"By promoting the idea that the FDA isn't doing its job, Ms. Goldberg helps undermine the authority of government scientists who are qualified to authorize a vaccine. She's playing a small but important role in reducing respect in vaccine science. 

Just as certain folk pile onto twitter to try and force ideas that lack real merit, Ms. Goldberg is using her very privileged platform to push an idea that she does not have merit to claim. Her goal: add pressure to the scientists who make scientific decisions.

Mixing politics with science. It doesn't matter if it's progressive or reactionary politics, it's not right.

And by the way, the American Academy of Pediatrics, a Stanford professor of pediatric infectious disease, and a dean of the Brown University School of Public Health are not qualified to authorize a drug. Period."

I see Dr, Jha just about every day on television throughout this pandemic and trust his professional opinions.

2021-08-10 08:15:12,"Great column. 
The FDA seeks perfection when ""good enough"" should more than suffice, and in this instance would likely save many more lives as a result, especially given the extremely low incidence of complication shown by mRNA vaccines already with adults; and that's not even considering the strong likelihood of children having now become much more common vectors of transmission, given the Delta variant's new dominance."
2021-08-10 08:25:08,Agree with this column 100%! My nephew is 5 and we would all feel more relieved if he could get vaccinated (though we won’t be fully at peace till my 1-year-old nephew can be vaccinated). This delta variant is hitting kids harder than any other variant (who cares about the reason why). Time to protect this group before the delta variant reaches too many kids!
2021-08-10 09:07:47,"As it is in all federal agencies, you can be certain that the problem here is not the scientists and engineers who do the work. It’s the lawyers."
2021-08-10 09:29:30,Thank you. The FDA is terrible. They create hesitancy by not approving the vaccines off EAU and 1 in a million pauses. And they exacerbate the problem by not moving on kids despite the data they have. No sense of risk/reward during this ‘war’.
2021-08-10 09:46:16,"This is a global pandemic. If more of the world population isn’t vaccinated, it is not going to protect us here. We are all interconnected. Vulnerable adults in other countries should have access to the vaccine before children. And, there are plenty of pro-vaccine, pro-science people who have experienced severe side effects from the vaccine. That cannot be ignored and the FDA and CDC should authorize more research to help treat these people for their illnesses."
2021-08-10 10:07:03,For broiler chickens raised for the consumption in the U.S. recommended vaccination programs start at day one.  By the time a broiler reaches the age of 10 weeks it will have received 7 vaccinations.  The American people should learn from this.  We should start vaccination of  babies at one day of age or possibly right after delivery.  This way the medical profession which so strongly advocates vaccinating every one will be sure to stop variant viruses in their tracks.  Unfortunately in the world of chickens variants still arise even with present vaccination programs to control corona viruses.
2021-08-10 10:27:03,"I believe the screaming earlier in the year was to open schools no matter if it would put students, teachers and staff at risk.  Now with 12 and over able to be vaccinated, it’s to scream for vaccinations for younger children.  What if you live in a state like Florida and Texas where governors force open schools, ban mask mandates, and numerous children are being infected?   It seems to me there’s always another obstacle.  Basically of course, those who are able should be vaccinated and all should wear masks until the epidemic is over.  In the meantime, various options for school should remain including virtual.  It saved lives despite the screaming."
2021-08-10 10:30:00,"I feel for Michelle and all parents dealing with this terrible situation.  If we are weeks or even a few months away from vaccine approval, might it not be more prudent to delay the start of the school year?"
2021-08-10 10:59:25,Agree that the FDA is dragging its feet unnecessarily here. It’s time for emergency approval at least for 5-12 year olds so we can keep the schools open.
2021-08-10 11:02:55,"From reading Michael Lewis's latest book, Premonition, it seems pretty clear that leaving the actual response to a pandemic to either the CDC, which is more a research institution, or the FDA, which as the author points out, has institutional motivations to prefer caution to a rationale response, is a mistake. 

This is a job for a task force of medical experts who can weigh the pros and cons of moving with less than perfect information.  This is true especially in a rapidly changing environment, where guidelines formulated for one variants may not be good for a variant that spreads 3 months later.

Given the institutional constraints on the CDC and FDA, I'd go with the pediatric doctors in this case, and start vaccinating all school aged children immediately.  Let's do this before we fill up the pediatric ICUs with preventable infections."

I really DO feel for you. This describes our situation perfectly. I hate to bring up tfg's name. but. He offered to Bob Woodward in Feb 2020 this was ""scary stuff"" and then in March 2020 told the world it was a hoax and would ""magically disappear."" 600+k  have now died in the uS of something that could have been prevented. And, when reality did not conform to his election dreams, he threw an angry Insurrection at Congress (January 6, 2021) with death threats that WERE realized (7 now having died because of that day). Why  is this man not in jail, and why is the  vaccines he rushed into production not available? Stay safe Michelle."
2021-08-10 11:22:23,"As a parent with two children under age 12, opinion articles such as this are important.  The point that the AAP is pushing to expedite vaccines is worth noting.  However, other comments probably require further clarification.

Pediatric wards are filling up: but what percentage of the patients are unvaccinated teenagers who are eligible for the vaccine (I believe pediatrics can include people up to the age of 21)?

I have yet to find statistics for young children aged 12 and under  regarding how often Delta is a serious concern.  Either the statistics aren't available yet, or this opinion piece did not do sufficient due diligence.  

Discussing the issue makes sense, but it seems premature to fault the FDA for proceeding with caution."
2021-08-10 11:29:44,"I agree this is frustrating. And pushing out the swine flu vaccine during the Ford administration before was a poor choice. However, there is a difference here. How to counter SARS Co-V 2 has been the subject of decades of study. How else would they have gotten out this vaccine in less than a year when a typical vaccine takes 5-10 years to develop? We have put shots in the arms of nearly 200 Million American adults and seen drastic reductions in disease, and the virtual elimination of hospitalization, serious intervention, and deaths among vaccinated people with negligible medium and long-term side effects. This is the most safe and efficacious vaccine in human history, so let's titrate the dose, and get on with it for heaven's sake."
2021-08-10 11:39:02,"How much of the push to get back to school is really a push to make parents go to work? Why not offer remote options this fall and extend more federal stimulus money to let parents stay home with kids during this crisis? Then once the vaccines are FDA approved — which should be expedited, as argued here — let kids return. It’s just not safe now, esp with the lack of mask mandates in many places. 

I also want to add that I understand many kids — esp from families with less financial resources — suffered not being in school, falling behind in learning, experiencing social isolation, maybe not having enough food to eat or a safe place to be. I also think we should acknowledge that some kids thrive in remote learning, especially kids who experience bullying in school and kids who are more introverted. In-person school can be an overwhelming and even traumatizing experience for many kids. Offering ongoing remote options could be helpful even aside from COVID."
2021-08-10 11:40:04,Terrific piece and very rational . It's time the FDA recognized the urgency of the situation and very limited side effects of the vaccines in use. There has been plenty of time for adverse reactions to develop! I find the FDA's actions shameful.
2021-08-10 11:40:21,It’s fine to call out the FDA to speed things up if you’re willing to live with consequences of potential adverse effects that could have been discovered with further testing.
2021-08-10 11:52:58,"I normally cannot stand this columnist, but I agree with her 100% on this topic.

Her argument is one of the reasons I’m against a vaccine mandate for the masses. If you give emergency authorization for a children’s vaccine based on only two month of data, at least you’re giving tens of millions of parents the option to vaccinate their kids in the coming weeks. It could conceivably prevent hundreds of hospitalizations and probably dozens of deaths. Yet folks who are wary of the vaccines can always delay their children’s vaccination until more data is released, because (ideally) no one is forcing them to submit to a needle. We’ll see how long that lasts…"
2021-08-10 11:58:39,"I recommend reading Michael Lewis book, the Pandemic story, which paints, in great detail, the failings of bureaucratic agencies when confronted with a national emergency---where speed and execution should be maximized. Granted there is still a lot we don't know about covid and now emerging strains of the virus, but, still, flexibility and out of the box thinking, necessary ingredients in national emergencies is just not in the DNA of bureaucracies."
2021-08-10 12:00:47,"The Trump approach toward vaccines was based on a Warp Speed strategy.

The resulting Trump Vaccines have (predictably) two elements associated with them: (1) massive profits for the pharmaceutical industry and (2) side-effects on many people (accompanied by a minimalist reporting system to capture the statistics related to such side-effects).

While Ms. Goldberg is entitled to her opinion - that the Trump Vaccines are desirable - many people are reserving their opinion until better (and more complete) reviews are completed.

Seeing Ms. Goldberg aligned with the Trump Vaccines is however an interesting element. 

But she should be more tolerant toward those who are skeptical."

So far, my conscience, and a fear of being unable to prove her vaccination status later, have held me back.  But I battle the desperation daily."
2021-08-10 12:08:30,"It appears the vaccine is safe for children, as it is for adults. Children have been inoculated for decades against various diseases. The prevailing question about the Covid vaccines is how long they will last? We know they are safe for most people. Younger children should be able to get the vaccine if their pediatricians and parents agree they’re cleared for it."
2021-08-10 12:12:21,"I have three children, ages 16, 12, and 7.  The older two are vaccinated.  The youngest, obviously, is not.  

This makes for crazy times.  The youngest is a sitting duck.  It's hard and frustrating to know that she could get Covid at school, the store, etc., while the rest of us are protected.

I share Michelle Goldberg's feelings about this.  If the vaccine is safe for a 90 year-old, then it is safe for a 7 year-old.  Let's get on with this and get the kids vaccinated.

Our country is so weird.  It is either all about kids, helicopter parents, bragging on social media, and over-parenting, or it is straight-up negligence in which we don't seem to really care if kids get vaccinated so that they can be safe as well as have as normal a childhood as possible in a pandemic."
2021-08-10 12:17:28,"I feel even worse now than in 2020 as a parent.  I was hopeful for a little bit when vaccines came out but the slow pace of rollout for children has been frustrating to watch especially as we see a more transmissible variant on the loose converging with schools reopening in person.  I know that my elementary school child cannot go through any more remote school - he suffered and continues to suffer from psychological distress and trauma from this past year and a half, along with academic losses.  I have been so disappointed in how little this country cares for its children -  schools were closed to protect adults; remote school was awful; gun massacres in schools; separating children from their families at the border and putting them in cages.  This country treats children despicably and it is easy to do so because they do not have voices or votes…"
2021-08-10 12:18:41,"As this corona virus continues to mutate, do we have any way of knowing whether it may have a greater affect on age groups that were less susceptible to the original Covid-19?  For example, the 1918-19 influenza pandemic — which (before vaccines) infected one-third of the world’s population and killed between 25-50 million people—disproportionately affected younger, healthy people.

According to the CDC website re that epidemic, “Mortality was high in people younger than 5 years old, 20-40 years old, and 65 years and older. The high mortality in healthy people, including those in the 20-40 year age group, was a unique feature of this pandemic.”  

We absolutely need the FDA to step up its approval of the vaccine for younger children."
2021-08-10 12:24:36,"Five grandkids here; all under the age of eight.  There does seem a curious lack of urgency for the vaccine for young kids.  Thank my heavenly stars they don’t live in Florida.  They HAVE to go to school. The six and seven year olds have not been in school since March 14 2020.  Their little family, I fear, will implode without the consistency of school.  They’ll most likely have to wear masks.  That’s okay.  The alternative has become unthinkable.  How much can young families take?  And yet, I can certainly see that most parents will want to know that that the vaccine is safe, safe, safe… little bodies seem so much more vulnerable.  All that said, I sure would like to hear more about the progress of the vaccine trials.  Really, while we hated Trump… there needs to be a very prominent and well named task force giving us updates… if for nothing else to give hope for a light at the end of the tunnel."
2021-08-10 12:25:33,"I have been to a pediatric ICU.  You don't want to go there.

When my daughter was three months-old, she was on a ventilator at a children's hospital due a respiratory virus, RSV.  She survived, and is healthy today.  We are grateful.  However, it was close.  We nearly lost her.

Those days were the hardest of my life.  She was intubated, unable to talk to us, and all we could do was wait and hope for good news.  It was terrifying and life-changing for us.

Like I said, you don't want to be there.  Get your kids vaccinated.   And FDA, approve the vaccine for everyone."

The mechanism for mRNA vaccines (biontech, moderna) delivers the mRNA in a lipid vesicle to the cells that make antigenes. Astrazeneca and J&J use killed virus particles that are acting as a mock Corona virus particle. So, there are no virus particle fragments of the Corona virus delivered to your body which makes it impossible to have any Long covid symptoms from the vaccine."

Waiting until a few kids in your child's school wind up in the ICU or pass away from Covid will be too late. But that is the approach many parents are taking. They refuse vaccines. They refuse masks ( which hurt no one). And prefer to throw the dice instead. Until.........160,000,000 doses and counting. How many test subjects do you need?

The FDA has been dragging its feet not just on the vaccination of children, but on final authorization and booster shots. The consequences are more people getting sick, more people dying, more disruption to our lives.

The FDA has to be speed the process in general and it has to be less risk averse.

The simple truth is, nothing bad would happen to these kids if we gave them these very safe vaccines today -- but something might very well happen to them if we do not.

At the very least, physicians should be free to make their own judgment regarding all three of these options. I have no doubt that most of them would recommend the vaccines."

So here in TX we will have fully open schools, no remote learning options, no masks allowed, and kids 5-11 unvaccinated — what could possibly go wrong?? It makes me so mad. We are putting helpless kindergartners in harms way. 

I already have multiple friends who are fully vaccinated and got COVID in the last 2-3 weeks from their unvaccinated children getting it at camp. This includes outdoor day camps that required masks.

Otherwise, Vioxx would still be killing people unnecessarily and most vaccines would contain preservatives that only enrich the manufacturer using multi-dose vials,

Safety and efficacy are not merely marketing ploys.

Now the risk-benefit assessment is different. It would seem that if the vaccine proves to be safe and effective in this group, the benefit side of the equation is now heavily weighted. A safe return to in-person learning this year and developmentally-necessarily peer socialization hang in the balance for all children. To withhold vaccination with full knowledge of its safety would be paramount to denying many children freedoms they have never really known -- my 5-year-old does not remember a time before masks and lockdowns.

2021-08-10 13:13:20,"Nothing is stopping the FDA from giving Full Approval of the use of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in those who are 18 and older right now.  While that does not address emergency vaccination for those under 18, it would reduce the prevalence of the virus in adults, an important end in itself, and indirectly reducing the rate of childhood infection.

One complication of full approval of a drug is that this generally opens the door to off-label use, which in turn could imply that children of any age might be injudiciously vaccinated.  However, nothing is stopping the FDA from giving full approval for adult use NOW while specifically prohibiting off-label use for persons of any age.  While this could open the door to legal challenges, that is no reason for delay when lives are at stake.  

In the meantime, Experimental Use Authorization for children should proceed independently at full speed.

This is unfortunately not currently the case in K-12  public and private schools serving the under 12 years old cohort of the population.  It is the case that 100% of the faculty and staff of K-12 public schools and governments local district state and federal should mandate that 100% of the adults in K-12 schools be vaccinated while we wait for the F.D.A. 

The F.D.A. should proceed with all due haste to finish up their vetting process and fully license the COVID-19 vaccines for general use and for use in children from 6 months to 12 years of age. 

The sooner the vaccines are available and mandated for all children attending schools the sooner the pandemic will be brought under control in this country.

Candidly it is my opinion that there is no valid excuse for avoiding vaccination for one's self or ones dependent children short of documented and valid medical considerations.  Furthermore it is my opinion that so-called religious and philosophical exemptions should not prevail as an excuse to avoid vaccination.  Religious exemptions are simply acts of placing superstition over proven medical science and do not stand the test of logic."

1) We cannot have it both ways; on one hand criticize the FDA for speeding the approval of a treatment for Alzheimers that has marginal activity because the company will reap billions in revenue and investigate them for corruption, while criticizing them for taking time on a vaccine for healthy kids that will also bring billions to pharmaceutical companies.

2) The pediatric group could theoretically advise its members to prescribe the vaccine for children under the age of 11, Off label use is permitted by law. Very unlikely though that any pediatrician will do that for fear of liability. So instead of advising their members to prescribe the vaccine based on available information they deem sufficient, they are shifting the blame (and potential liability) to FDA."

Yes, Republicans are terrible and carry a lot of blame, but the current government could and should be doing more. Why isn't the Biden administration mandating masks for all schools receiving any federal funds? The latest data shows that covid viral loads are the same in unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals, so vaccines in adults will not protect children nearly as much as masks and mask mandates would.

Why didn't the Biden administration prioritize expanding trials for children the day it took office? A lot of these trials didn't begin until this spring, and there are calls now for the FDA to conduct a 2 month review of data from those trials rather than 6 months? What are the risks pro and con of this decision?

The American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) said in Oct. 2020, almost a year ago,  “It is counter to the ethical principle of distributive justice to allow children to take on great burdens during this pandemic but not have the opportunity to benefit from a vaccine … because they have not been included in vaccine trials."" The Biden administration appears trying so hard not to offend Republican sensibilities that it won't take the necessary measures to protect schoolchildren. Mask mandates? Expediting the data on making the vaccine available to children? Why have these trials begun so late in the first place?"
2021-08-10 13:34:32,"It’s unconscionable that leaders are not mandating masks in schools teaching children that are not yet eligible for the vaccine. What’s the point? Without mandatory masking, the schools will all be remote learning in weeks. This totally defeats the purpose of sending them to school in the first place! It’s one thing to have this fight over masking and vaccines when you are eligible for the vaccines. It’s another thing entirely when the youngest among us are not eligible. As a parent I’m hoping for the best, but political leaders need to understand that if scores of young kids get sick or die, it’s 100% on them. Remote learning was a nightmare, treat the pandemic in schools like we did a year ago and we may have a fighting chance."
2021-08-10 13:38:21,Thanks Michelle. School has started here in Atlanta and many parents took matters in their own hands. They decided they couldn't wait and went ahead and got their 11 year olds vaccinated. I can't blame them and wonder if I should do the same. There is so much risk in middle school of 1200 kids that are not even allowed to wash their hands before lunch or have the option to eat out side. Our children's heath at risk. We need the vaccine now.

And I suspect that the experts you cite are correct that it would be safe to authorize the vaccine now, or at least expedite the trials on a faster track than the one the FDA has chosen. But consider the consequences of your announcing this plea and the FDA agreeing to do so. We already hear vaccine skeptics and hesitants argue that approval for adult vaccines was ‘rushed’; your column and FDA action would then be ‘proof’ that the FDA was responding to outside pressure to approve vaccines before it was comfortable in doing so. You might be happy that your children could be vaccinated, but what about the millions of children whose parents would not allow them to be vaccinated? Are you really willing to make the statement that your kids are more important than theirs?"

I have a 9 year old and a 12 year old (vaccinated).  They both go to the same school.   They have been in person learning since September of last year.  Not one single kid at that school has had any significant effect from COVID other than a few with typical flu symptoms.   I have no feeling of desperation other than the typical parenting stuff.  My wife is a nurse and I had COVID, so I'm sure they've been exposed.

You say yourself, ""odds are they'll be ok""....99.995% odds they'll be ok (and don't start with long COVID).  Approx. 400 kids under 18 have died in the USA from COVID.  Around 6000 have died in car accidents since then.  Do you ever put them in a car?  Does anyone ever do any risk analysis on anything other than COVID?

Please stop with this fear mongering and go back to ""Trump Bad Man"" articles twice daily.

Anyway, we are all vaccinated except for my daughter and she'll get it I suppose once it's authorized, but this is too much."

2021-08-10 13:37:13,"I am more than ready to get out and yell and scream — but who’s listening? I helped “teach” my grandson last year. I’ll do so again if need be, to protect him. But honestly, I see no need if he can be vaccinated when school starts.  As a child, I clearly recall standing in school lines to get my “shots”.  Everyone did. No protesters. No blatant stupidity. I am furious with people who won’t get vaccinated to protect themselves and their families.  Even if they won’t do it for the common good, for their fellow citizens, they risk the very lives of those they love. It is reckless, selfish, and so wrong on so many levels.  It is a shameful waste of resources, and ridiculously expensive to care for people who didn’t need to get sick, much less die. And our “system” (aka you and me, the taxpayers) will foot the bill for that care. I know nurses who are disgusted by this willful ignorance but still trying to keep these people alive. But children? Little People who can’t make their own decisions to protect themselves? What an epic fail we are as a society that some huge number of us choose not to protect our own children.  There is NO acceptable excuse for what is happening. Jesus weeps."
2021-08-10 13:43:37,"I saw the reference that the vaccine was safe but I didn’t see anywhere in the article a comparison between risk of vaccine versus risk of COVID.

I am all for vaccinating children as long as it’s for the purpose of protecting the child. My concern is vaccinating children to mitigate the risk it hem spreading it to more vulnerable cohorts.

The indication from medical studies in the uk is that it is not at all clear that the risk posed by COVID is any greater than that posed by a vaccine.

Children don’t have a say in this, it’s being imposed on them, therefore we have to be ultra sensitive as to whose benefit it’s being administered for, that includes fussy and over protective parents."
2021-08-10 13:45:16,"One word of caution:  Thalidomide.  

The FDA declined to approve it without extensive additional studies.  The FDA proved right."
2021-08-10 13:47:08,"Opinions based on personal anxieties about individual children are not equivalent to policies made on an epidemiological level about millions of children. I too am worried about my four year old but this is not enough if a reason to rush an approval. 

To approve any medical intervention for children the efficacy has to be extremely high and the side effects minimal. It is ridiculous to say that most side effects show up within two months. The issue here is not how long it takes for symptoms to appear, it is whether we have enough participants in a trial to truly get the full range of potential side effects. This takes large samples over a stretch of time. The approval for ages 12-15 only had 2000 kids in the original trial and it took about four - five months after millions of kids started taking it to see that there were potentially serious consequence such as myocarditis. 

It is true that when more kids get infected there will be more kids who get sick and a few who will die. But from an epidemiological perspective this is still very rare with only .002 percent children dying from the virus and very few getting seriously ill abs or having long effects. It’s not impossible —  but it’s not likely. All to say that there are good scientific reasons to get as much data as possible and be cautious before rushing to approve a vaccine with a new technology for developing bodies."
2021-08-10 13:50:43,"I was one of the first vaccinated for polio, in 1956.   People forget that the polio vaccine carried risks. The vaccines were improved. 

When I brought my children for all their vaccinations, their pediatrician discussed risks with me, every single time.  That was good practice.  The doctor and I agreed that the vaccines had been fully tested and were as safe as possible. We trusted the FDA to study and test. 

Every vaccine you’ve ever had does carry some well documented risks.  Read the small print.  

Children’s bodies are different from adult’s bodies in many ways. Difference in processes to consider than merely adjusting the dose to weight ratio. 

Some of my children are medical professionals who have dealt and are dealing with this pandemic.  They have small children themselves. Be careful and let the FDA do its job."
2021-08-10 13:52:13,"If it's true, as Ms. Goldberg states, that ""It’s likely that the loud anti-vaccine movement has contributed to the F.D.A.’s fastidiousness"", the F.D.A. must be reminded that it has to stick to the science and deliver for our little children ASAP. 

As we anxiously wait for a safe and reliable vaccine for our little ones, however, our top American leaders (including Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden, for instance) have to join forces and remind ALL Americans that our common Enemy in this particular War, no matter our political preferences, is Covid and its variants and that everybody eligible (12 years and older) must get vaccinated. 

If we don't join forces as Americans against this deadly virus, we will continue to suffer too many unnecessary human casualties across the battlefields where Covid likes to attack."
2021-08-10 13:53:54,"How do you know it's politics stopping vaccine approval? There is no indication that the FDA is concerned about anything but safety. We need to be patient with regard to vaccine approval in kids. Children are not little adults. They are different. In the meantime, there should be a mask mandate in place. I am unfortunate enough to live in TX, and children comprise 19% of our cases. The fact that most kids don't get very ill from the virus isn't the only issue. Kids can spread it even to vaccinated adults and adults can still get sick from it. But we need to be sure the vaccine itself is safe for kids too."
2021-08-10 13:57:40,"We have been dealing all year with a joint custody problem. My partner’s ten year old’s father isn’t taking enough care to protect her. Like my partner and me, he is vaccinated, but he take the girl out to restaurants and he allows unmasked play dates and even sleep overs. Worse, his grown daughter won’t get vaccinated (for reasons of misinformation promulgated online), and comes over frequently for dinner with them. When school was in we switched our handover day from Sunday (after the weekend) to Friday (before the weekend) on the idea that at least we could get the girl tested Friday eves on the way to our home and if she had been infected during his weekend, five days previously, there was enough time until the test that the test would show an actual true positive result. But during summer, they go out any which time. It is maddening to have not only a vector into my house but this child at such high risk. I feel that she, and my partner and I, are doomed. The only thing that will change this situation is if the girl gets vaccinated."
2021-08-10 14:00:35,Schools should not be open until a vaccine is available for children. Period.
2021-08-10 02:14:36,"The FDA ""paused"" the Johnson and Johnson vaccine campaign for a full ten days when it was called into question after blood clotting appeared in a few vaccinated persons. 

Less than one in one million people receiving the vaccine developed heart issues, and yet, instead of working over the weekends and into the evenings, the FDA took its sweet time, maybe even barbecuing over the weekend, before putting out a caution advisory before re-authorizing the vaccine. 

Tylenol executives and designers worked around the clock seven days a week to solve the safety issues over its bottle cap design when there was a poisoning. Why can't the FDA when so many lives are at stake?"
2021-08-10 02:23:25,"The trump cult infested the CDC and FDA, during the 'former guy's' administration.

     Members of the FDA are delaying and evading the traditional approval of the Pfizer Covid-19 mRNA vaccine, despite a stellar production of antibody protection against the SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and an impressive safety record.

     Tens of millions of young Americans are needlessly being denied a life saving vaccine, one that protects children from chronic vasculitis problems in their lungs, hearts, intestines, kidneys, and brains. And the members of the FDA ponder, postpone, delay, their unholy blessing on a vaccine that has benefitted older Americans."
2021-08-10 14:06:18,"Dynamic risk assessment is a statistical tool that might be useful in speeding up FDA approval and the availability of Covid-19 vaccines for younger children.

Widespread testing for conversion to Covid-19 positive samples would show how many young children are getting infected (even without symptoms) and whether the vaccines might prevent illness upon exposure. Cardiomyopathy is a known rare complication of both infection and vaccination, but the long term effects of Covid-19 infection may not become recognized until years later (impaired growth and development, impaired cognitive function, chronic fatigue, etc).

Waiting 6 months for all the data to be collected and then analyzed 'will leave too many younger children vulnerable for much too long.

Studies on dosing for different ages and sizes are reasonable but shouldn't take long to determine the dose needed to give protection and any side effects of immunization.

In the end I think ""all God's children"" will need their vaccinations."
2021-08-10 01:46:36,"I have a 5, 9 and 11 year old starting week 2 in mask-optional metro Atlanta schools. Last year there was a virtual option, but the county decided in May (pre-Delta) that they would not offer that in the fall. 

The 9 year old is already in quarantine for 10 days due to exposure of a classmate that tested positive. My other 2 are told to continue to go to school unless their brother starts to show symptom over the next few days - guidelines that also seem to pre-date the realities of Delta. 

Metro Atlanta already, after 1 week, has over 900 Covid positive kids and faculty in its schools. Even kids that don’t get sick will be in and out of at home “quarantine” all semester - disrupting learning and making childcare planning a scramble.

My kids went remote last year and sacrificed a year of growth and socializing …to get Covid weeks before a vaccine is made available feels like that sacrifice was for nothing.

I wish I could be optimistic about this and engage in the wishful and magical thinking many of my fellow parents have (“We want to see their smiles!” “Kids need to socialize!” etc.)

The delta variant apparently eats wishful and magical thinking for breakfast."
2021-08-10 14:10:56,"We know that masking and social distancing help mitigate the spread of Covid-19. Why are DeSantis and Abbott gambling with the health and lives of kids by prohibiting school districts from taking simple measures like this to help reduce the pandemic’s spread?  They claim to be pro-life and will do anything for an embryo, but are actively inflicting harm on our children for calculated political gain. Revolting doesn’t begin to describe them."
2021-08-10 14:14:45,"The virus needs human hosts to survive and propagate. When the adults have been vaccinated or otherwise have acquired immunities, the virus will turn to the children. Among the children the virus will mutate into greater lethality. Stop it now."
2021-08-10 14:14:54,"There seems to be a conventional wisdom that because children most likely won't die of covid, that it's not a big deal if they catch it.  That drives me nuts.  Pediatric wards are not supposed to overflow.  I still have trouble finding reliable analysis of the types of long term complications and their likelihood in young children. 

To make matters worse, it seems that many employers are going to be encouraging their workers to go back to the office after Labor Day.  Which raises the risk that I could, despite being vaccinated, transmit Delta to my under age 5 child who won't be able to get vaccinated any time soon."
2021-08-10 14:21:21,"Regardless of vaccines or not, as a parent I am concerned about the detriments of 1) classrooms  closing for 2 weeks at a time for ""quarantine"" after there is a single case of Covid  (which is and will continue to be common practice in many areas of the US especially large cities) and 2) the detriments to kids, many of whom are as young as 2, and still learning to talk, of having to wear a mask for so many months, and trying to social distance all the time at school, even during sports.  It is documented that their risk is low - so why do we have to keep subjecting our kids to all of this?  What is that doing to them social emotionally?  If the kids' vaccine will allow more normalcy with very low risk of side effects, then I am all for getting it sooner.  But until then, maybe the better solution is to allow vulnerable kids, or kids whose parents choose it, to use a virtual academy until this is over, and let the rest of the kids go on with their lives as normal as possible - podding up, washing hands and reducing large gatherings at school.  Better yet - if a higher % of adults could just be more considerate of the kids, and get vaccinated, then Covid rates would reduce to negligable levels again."
2021-08-10 14:03:16,"I know that statistically my kids have a very low, but non zero, chance of getting severely ill or worse due to Covid, but God forbid anything like that were to happen, all these statistics will be meaningless to me, especially when I know that those vaccines are out there. FDA really, really needs to hurry up, please!"
2021-08-10 14:02:50,Considering that AP reported that 75% of the P-town breakout was a breakthrough breakout - they were all vaccinated - obviously the best way to end this media epidemic is for the vaccinated to die off.
2021-08-10 13:50:34,"Israel has begun vaccinating 5 to 12 years old with no ill consequences. FDA should give approval, and kids should be vaccinated immediately. But here are some hard truths which thus safety-obsessed neurotic society doesn’t want to hear. COVID is becoming endemic. Vaccination reduces the likelihood of a serious disease to a minuscule percentage point, but it is still there. Some vaccinated people, including kids, will sicken. Some will die. The percentages will be roughly the same as with flu, but I’m sure hysterical parents will nevertheless insist that we all stay in lockdown permanently or wear a triple-layered mask at all times. Well, no. We have vaccines, they work as they are meant to work - on the statistical basis. The time has come to go back to normal. Life cannot stop because there is some danger to some people. Stay at home if you are afraid."
2021-08-10 14:02:30,"So how do those who agree with Michelle's comments make their voices heard at the FDA?  They currently only have public comment open for various formal proposals through a (likely beaurocratic) comment database, and I don't know that vaccines for kids are even on the list.

Thoughts or tips?  I can't imagine the NYT comments section is likely to move the needle very much."

2021-08-10 14:15:32,"A pill like a baby aspirin where you ground up and mix it with jelly and spoon fed, can be given once or over a two week period for under five year olds."
2021-08-10 00:52:17,"Another very good reason, Ms. Goldberg, for children under 12 to receive a Covid vaccine is that they are the very last age demographic to be eligible. Now that some state governors and other officials are taking a pass on mandatory mask mandates, it becomes even more critical to get these kids inoculated.  

At present, the younger children have only masks for protection.  And many will soon be in school in close contact with other kids where masks will be optional, or perhaps even prohibited altogether.  What's more, we know the Covid delta variant is especially transmissive.  Children under 12 are getting sick with this variant, and are being hospitalized.  And many of the disease's long term side effects are still largely unknown for this group.

The data has already shown the vaccines are exceedingly safe for older kids and adults.  What really is left is carefully monitoring of any vaccine after-effects on younger children.  As noted by Dr. Jha, this can typically be done with 2 months follow-up. 

And please note that no amount of positive statistics will mollify the anti-vaxxers.  They'll remain opposed to these life-savers no matter what amount of evidence is produced.  

So the FDA should proceed with emergency use authorization for kids under 12.  At the same time, prudence would dictate that 4-6 follow-up studies also be done during this time.  But let's start getting these inoculations into young arms very soon.  Lives are literally on the line while we wait."

2021-08-10 01:30:16,"Not having vaccines for kids is maddening.  One of the reasons we got the vaccines so soon for adults is that we used parallel tracks of development instead of sequential ones.  That really sped things up.

But not so for kids.  The standard protocol for vaccine development (Fauci) is first adults, then teens and then kids and then toddlers.  OK fine.  But protocols are what you follow when you don't know what else to do.  Covid is an emergency which requires altering protocols.  

Bureaucrats love protocols.  They often base their careers on closely following protocols.  That's how they get promoted. This is a mindset that is  difficult to break.

Hundreds of millions of doses of mRNA vaccine have been administered and people are doing fine.  If there was a problem, it would have shown up by now.  But we have to wait for the FDA to work through its protocols.

The teenagers are doing fine with the shot.  No problem.  According to Fauci, the issue with kids is setting the dosage because they are little people.  So what takes so long?  We have experience dosing kids with vaccines.   Consequently, we should have a rough idea of the reduction in dosage for little people.  Start there and fine tune it.  

Kids are getting terribly sick from Delta.  There is no time to waste.  Adults are refusing to get the shot which is putting our unvaccinated kids in jeopardy.  Let's figure this out and fast."
2021-08-10 14:37:30,"The only reason to vaccinate kids is to control the spread. Covid kills less kids than the seasonal flu. Those are true statements. It’s also true that kids, unlike adults, can be easily forced into vaccination. So it’s practical to force vaccination on kids in order to get the desired result (mass vaccination). If the media and Dem leaders would tell the truth, people would know it and agree. But instead we’re left with all this nonsense about outlier cases of kids dying from Covid, when in reality the risk of side effects from the vaccine are probably just as high as the individual risks of Covid to kids. Yes, kids should be vaccinated for Covid. No, it’s not for “their” safety."
2021-08-10 14:41:31,"Let me get this straight.  Governors and/or local governing authorities pass mandates and laws and regulations requiring masks in certain public situations and might in the future (hopefully) mandate vaccination and the ""individual freedom"" lawsuits jam up courts, putting a stay on such orders.

Where then are the lawsuits against these bodies that impose optional requirements?  Is not endangerment of life against the law?  Michelle's anger comes through in this op-ed.  I'm with her.  What our elected officials are (not) doing is unconscionable."
2021-08-10 14:44:48,"I have to disagree with the thrust of this article, that vaccines should be approved for use in children asap. 

We have a new variant circulating.  It's been reported that it is more dangerous for children, but I have yet to see hard data on this.  I have yet to see data on whether the children who are hospitalized have other conditions, and if so, what conditions they have.  

I want my daughter to get the vaccine, but not in a rushed manner.  And I also want to know there is a benefit to her PERSONALLY that exceeds the risk.  I do not want her vaccinated to protect adult FOOLS who refuse to take the vaccine.  This is too important to rush.  We need to see hard data."
2021-08-10 14:48:04,"We so agree with this opinion on vaccines.  We made an appointment for our granddaughter, whose 12th birthday is early October, but she is a gymnast and is in the gym 4 times a week, so we are very worried about the next two months.  Fortunately, most of her classmates are vaccinated and the school has already mandated masks. In the gym, she is grouped with older girls, who are vaccinated, but they probably will reintroduce masks for everyone, especially in common areas with recreational classes and parents of young children wanting to observe, which our gym never let up on.  Even with these precautions, we are still worried about her getting Covid, as we have read how fast it is spreading with the unvaccinated population, as it is 7 to 8 times more easily spread because of the amount of virus multiplying in the nasal cavity, even with immune or vaccinated folks.  Like you Michelle, it makes you feel somewhat helpless, but not as helpless as those parents living in FL and TX.  Praying for all to get vaccinated and stay safe by wearing masks."
2021-08-10 14:50:26,"While Michelle Goldberg is well within her rights to give her children Covid-19 vaccines, that can be unethical since people at high risk have priority.
Many do not seem to appreciate that we are in a type of life boat situation, with insufficient vaccines. In such difficult situations, the people with higher risk have priority.
Some scientists, social media publishers, plus other publications and other ethically challenged people have been touting unethical behavior, urging people at lower risk to get vaccines before many at higher risk can be vaccinated.
Such unethical behavior has increased the world-wide death counts from the disease, the dangers of even more dangerous variants and food insecurity in many places around the world."
2021-08-10 14:55:06,"Jha is just completely wrong in his assertion that FDA ""doesn't take into account the consequences of delay"". They always weigh risk v benefit. Their policy in the case of COVID was to permit Emergency Use Authorization to get vaccine quickly into the population. On this, they were quite successful. In addition, for many new therapies, most notably in oncology, an accelerated approval pathway has been established for years now and has allowed approval of new therapies WITHOUT establishing improvements in overall survival (OS), the gold standard, compared to standard of care. 

While I share the frustration of slow vaccine approval for children under the age of 12 (a population of 50M, btw), it is in fact FDA that has the tough job of weighing the risk v benefits. Dr Beers may cite his ""experts"" as believing that only 2 months of follow up data is needed, but let's remember the President of the American Academy of Pediatrics is an elected role, and is not necessarily competent to ascertain what comprises a safe trial design. 

There is history of which FDA is aware, though Jha may not be. In July 1976 President Gerald Ford was immunized on TV against swine flu & encouraged all Americans to be vaccinated. By December, a rare side effect called Guillain-Barre, a paralytic syndrome appeared at a level of about 1/1,000,000. Because of this, further vaccinations were suspended. FDA believes the new RNA vaccine platforms to be safe, but knows they must go cautiously forward."
2021-08-10 15:06:47,"DFA's protocols are not designed to maximize benefits for citizens (although they may have ben OK for protecting officials from unwarranted criticism when Bad Things happen).  But the time to update procedures, to take account of the harm caused by delay, is now."
2021-08-10 15:10:33,"What a difficult time for parents! My granddaughter is three, and about to start public school. She is used to masking, and won't leave the house unmasked. She doesn't know any other life. But my daughter is scared, never takes her shopping or any other indoor spaces. My daughter is going back to teaching, and is scared of bringing the virus home. This is taking a terrible toll on everyone. And why? So the unvaccinated can enjoy their precious ""freedom"" while a safe vaccine is being developed for children. Please hurry!"
2021-08-10 15:17:53,"Ms. Goldberg, in a future column please acknowledge the courage of the parents who are allowing their children to be participants in the vaccine study.   Note that the purpose of the test is to determine the frequency/duration/severity of any side effects to the vaccine in addition to determining its efficacy.  

Those parents must have been briefed on those purposes for informed consent to have been real.  

They consented nonetheless.   Other parents owe them deep gratitude.  DPD"

We need to get the FDA to move.  

The numbers that they have asked for (with a 6 month delay) will not have the power to answer the risk question they are asking.  This appears to be a political maneuver.  

Meissner & Monto (blocking forward action on FDA committee) need to feel the push from parents and pediatricians to give this vax EUA for 5-12.  Especially with cases going up and schools starting."

 FDA ought to get off its back, and get going.  WHO should have called the Pandemic a lot earlier than it did.  The CDC should explain the mask and 6 feet social distancing guidelines a lot better than it has.  The list is long, on top of the nonsense perpetrated by some Republican senators, congressmen and women, governors, Trump, and their ilk."
2021-08-10 15:14:53,"Can’t wait for children to get vaccinated!
But we need to keep the risk to children in perspective. So far 350 children have died from COVID per the CDC website update one week ago. Tragic? Of course it is, but this number needs to be kept on perspective. During this same period of time 51,000 children have died from other causes. And, in any given year 12,000 children die from accidental causes.  I’m not saying one shouldn’t worry about his/her children and COVID, but people should worry more about everything else that can kill your children.

2021-08-10 15:27:28,"""... data about those vaccines’ safety in children exists, yet bureaucratic caution could force us to spend the next few months taking our chances with Covid instead.""

 The ""bureaucratic caution"" is about not rushing approval for vaccinating children before a critical mass of data exists which could inform us as to whether or not it is safe to vaccinate our children. 

Parents are not taking much of a ""chance"" if they make sure that their kids are fully masked and appropriately distanced when returning to school.

I, for one, can wait another few months before more definitive data with regard whether or not it is safe to give the vaccine to children under 12 becomes available."
2021-08-10 15:34:20,"My daughter caught the chicken pox when she was 7 years old, before the chicken pox vaccine was approved in the US.  Her pediatrician kept telling us that the vaccine would be available shortly and that it was in use in Japan and Europe.  So she got chicken pox while we were waiting for vaccine approval.  My child developed encephalitis and it was terrible.  We thought we were losing her.  She was in the hospital for a week and we didn't know whether she'd survive or, if she did, whether we'd live with permanent damage.  The ordeal lasted a couple of months, the worst of our lives.  She gradually recovered with the help of an anti-viral drug that had been developed for AIDS patients.  I would not wish our experience on anyone.  If you think your child's chances of serious complications or death are miniscule, you will not think that if you happen to be the one."
2021-08-10 15:35:01,"I share your frustration Ms. Goldberg. I live in Toronto, ON and in some ways the vaccination program is going more smoothly here. But I’m worried for my 11 year old. Not only for his physical health from Covid but also his mental health and development if we have another school year interrupted again and again by quarantine and being sent home for virtual learning."
2021-08-10 15:35:17,"Can someone please explain why natural immunity is never discussed?  I was vaccinated only because my job required it. My wife and daughter both had covid and according to the science, have strong immunity against covid for some time.  My other was exposed twice but never developed any symptoms, so she is good as well.

The push for vaccines, and vaccines only, is not based on science.  It is based on authoritarian wish list by the Democrats.  Stay away from my kids.  Period."
2021-08-10 15:41:38,"As a teacher in Florida, where our governor didn't allow mask mandates, I'm pretty certain that the parents who don't mask their children will be the same ones that won't vaccinate. This feels like it will never end."
2021-08-10 15:43:20,"We need to vaccinate our children now! 
Otherwise they will continue to pay the heaviest price in this pandemic."
2021-08-10 15:50:08,"I appreciate Michelle Goldberg wants this. What I don't understand is why she is given a pulpit in which to engage in her irrational ""frantic helplessness.""

There are two things not covered.

1. How many times do we need to see data showing that the risk to children is *trivial.* That is not the same as zero, but if as a parent you *ever* put your child in a car, you should contemplate a balance of risks. I am fully aware most people (myself included) find this very difficult. But, I do not think it at all unreasonable that a New York Times columnist should hold herself to a slightly higher standard than worrying about ""taking our chances with Covid"". This (not!) just in: the odds are *wildly* in your favour.

2. Not discussed, is the gross social inequity of hoarding vaccinations for ourselves, while covid continues to run rampant through the developing world. We (and the Germans…) made the vaccinations; we get to use them first. There is a real-world political inevitability and indeed even basic fairness to that, and frankly without Operation Warp Speed maybe none of this would have happened. Equally, there comes a point where one has to wonder whether it is morally appropriate to vaccinate children so that the statistically ignorant can feel comfortable, when the cost of that is deaths in their hundreds of thousands.

And, per Delta, and Lambda, there is is an entirely selfish way to think about this. These are the pools from which mutations and variants will emerge."
2021-08-10 15:53:01,"Those of you touting “herd immunity” as a strategy cite numbers of death (mortality) as why children are low risk. That ignores other poor outcomes in kids like long-COVID syndrome or MISC (=ICU admission) that kids are surviving, but are not good and (with vaccines) maybe be preventable. Aside from the fact that some children are immunocompromised (because kids still get cancer in a pandemic), or live with immunocompromised relatives, these are all good reasons to go the vaccination route which provides better immunity than natural infection without all the poor outcomes. 

Just because your family members survive COVID19, that does not make it a good strategy for a community. You are welcome to choose herd immunity for your family, but as a pediatrician, I am desperately waiting for my young children be eligible for vaccination. I wholeheartedly agree with the AAP stance asking for safe vaccine trials for kids with the same urgency that was used to guide adult trials."
2021-08-10 15:54:18,"The coronavirus pandemic is by any measure an extraordinary global and U.S. emergency. The EUA regulation should allow Covid-19 vaccines to be available to children, at least as young as five years old with full disclosure of known or potential risks via the all-important product insert, where clinical data and warnings are plainly disclosed.

Allow parents to decide. Many will decline but vaccination risk versus benefit should, to a greater extent, be judged by the parents. Give parents a greater choice about their childrens' health. As the level of disease risk increases, the perception of vaccine risk decreases, as we see happening now for adults and children down to twelve years."
2021-08-10 15:55:37,"So Michelle Goldberg wants to blame pediatric covid infections on FDA “bureaucracy”, scarcely indicting unvaccinated parents and neighbors?  Her column mentions the high rate of child infections in areas that   already have low (adult) vaccination levels and high community spread. That figures, of course.  Is the FDA culpable for the low vaccination levels and high community spread?  And would those areas vaccinate large numbers of children if only the FDA gave authorization?"
2021-08-10 15:58:28,"I'm not sure why it hasn't gotten through to people in this paper that the vaccines do not protect the vaccinated from infection at nearly the rate that was hoped. Observe Israel and Iceland; both are seeing rising cases in vaccinated individuals and re-implementing stricter NPIs despite having much greater total vaccine coverage, and more compliant populations, than the US. And Israel has authorized both adult booster shots for the immunocompromised and vaccination for at-risk children aged 5-11 already.

If totally protecting children from infection is the goal, vaccination in general is not going to accomplish this in the way people are hoping. The vaccines have proven to be effective at preventing serious illness and death in certain adults, for a certain period of time.  Until such time as it is shown to be effective at doing so for children, above children's already low mortality rate, why the rush? Children can get ""long Covid"" from infection whether they're vaccinated or not, since the vaccines do not prevent infection very well. 

We're holding on to the dream of herd immunity through vaccination in this country, and it simply isn't going to happen. The current vaccines are too leaky."
2021-08-10 15:58:34,"I understand the panic here but let's just recognize this is new technology. I'm 60. If the long term affects are deleterious, I'm willing to take that risk. 

I'm just not so sure I could make that leap for a child. 

And I think a lot of the commenters here aren't thinking their position through. 

That said, how long can we realistically wait? If people would do the right thing to protect our children by masking and following protocols to keep them safe we could be cautious. 

Unfortunately, a large portion of the country just does not care about anything but what they want. They won't bend for guns, why would they bend for this?"
2021-08-10 16:00:26,"How quickly the lie that ""everyone should be free to make their own decision about getting the vaccine"" has been exposed as the lie that it is.  If the vaccine is not approved, then nobody gets to make that choice."
2021-08-10 16:07:28,"Michelle Goldberg writes, ""The problem is that the F.D.A. won’t be blamed for avoidable Covid cases the same way it would be blamed for unexpected vaccine side effects.""

This has been known for decades. The FDA has killed tens of thousands by delaying life-saving treatments.
It has also declared ""safe and effective"" what turned out to be dangerous drugs, subsequently withdrawn from the market. Both the Blues and the Reds continue giving us this double whammy."
2021-08-10 16:22:01,"I think that a lot of parents are overly worried about the threat of covid to their young children. Year after year recreational swimming results in the deaths of far more children than covid will. This is a simple fact. But nobody is seeking to restrict recreational swimming because of the avoidable loss of life. Why? Because the overall benefits of swimming far outweigh the risks. The same is true with covid and in-person schools. Doubly so, in fact.

My six-year-old will get the vaccine when it's approved and available. Until then I have less trepidation about him attending school than I do about him swimming, which is very little."
2021-08-10 16:26:59,"I'm so glad to see this article because it is truly maddening how our kids are getting ignored by the CDC. When they lifted the mask mandate indoors, they made life even harder for our children (When we take our unvaccinated children to the store, do we really trust that all unmasked people are vaccinated?). These kids are helpless. We as parents are helpless. And no one seems to care. 

As a side note, my child is one month shy of 12. (I have a countdown to her birthday on my phone!) But arbitrary rules mean that I can't take her to get vaccinated until the exact day she turns 12. Each day that goes by could be the one in which she gets sick and suffers life-long consequences. It's maddening. How could we as a society care so little about children?"
2021-08-10 16:32:38,"Great piece! The FDA also should speed up approval of the Moderna vaccine for 12-17 age group. EU and Switzerland have already done so. When time is critical to get as many kids as possible vaccinated, having a choice is important and will encourage more people to get the vaccine. The article mentioned that the FDA is possibly stalling because it didn't want to give the appearance of rushing into things. That's great in normal times. We are in the middle of a pandemic. Every minute counts!"
2021-08-10 17:26:47,"The FDA suffers from Thalidomide Derangement Syndrome.  Just authorize it, or doctors should administer it sub rosa.

We know from experience with older children that:
1. The vaccine works
2. Side effects are rare and insignificant.
Many other vaccines are given to everyone from infants to adults.  Their immune systems aren't so different."
2021-08-10 13:34:27,"There have been 18 deaths, nearly 1000 serious adverse events and nearly 16,000 total adverse events among the 12-17 age group from the Covid vaccine.  In my very small circle, there were multiple cases of menstrual oddities and a case of myocarditis at our local (VERY small) drs office. We have zero long term safety data. The reason to proceed with caution is so we don’t do more harm than good to the younger age groups."
2021-08-10 02:41:38,"This needed to be said and I'm grateful you said it.  As an academic pediatrician, I have some qualifications to make a judgement. The risk for children is greater now. The delta variant is as transmissible as chicken pox. This means more kids will get sick, and even if the same percentage get MIS-C or Long COVID, that translates to more morbidity and mortality in our children. Those of us who believe in science, who see this vaccine and it's distribution as our generation's moon shot, understand that vaccines can have side effects. We accept this, as we do for other vaccines, and we want the opportunity to protect our loved ones as they go back to school."
2021-08-10 17:13:35,"With millions of unvaccinated children about to head back to school, the FDA needs to pick up it’s game or risk a disaster on their watch."
2021-08-10 15:49:27,"The risk to kids is unknown, but we now have a pretty good idea that with the Delta variant, they can get sick, end up with lifelong side effects and they might even die.

Back in the 80's and 90's, the HIV community was also dealing with this approval nonsense.  The difference was that with HIV, the odds were very high that you would die.  So the battle was to get experimental drugs out so that those who were likely to die, could take them.  It was a huge push, but the HIV community changed how the NIH and CDC approached the release of drugs."
2021-08-10 15:28:54,"This is a fact and I have been yelling it the entire six months they have been saying “September” was the goal for younger kids vaccines. 

School starts in AUGUST. This always comes before September, at least on all the calendars in my house. Politicians and administrators across the spectrum have been whistling through this proverbial, and now due to Delta literal, graveyard. 

I get it. We are tired. But we are never too tired to do what it takes to protect our children. I just did not think I would have so many enemies to battle. Covid is enough but now inorser to protect my unvaccinated 11 year old I must also do battle with “unmask our children” zealots, GOP politicians who probe each day there is no limit to how many people they will kill to protect fake “freedoms” to hurt others that have NEVER been in our Constitution... but even worse I am also up against Democrats who instead of being the early and appreciated protectors have quietly all hidden behind “available vaccines” and been cowed by protesting death cult members. 

I get it. I am clearly alone now. But I don’t care. I will protect my own child by any means necessary even if it means keeping him home and as far away from people intent on “unmasking my child” as I possibly can."
2021-08-10 15:25:49,"As a parent of an 8 and 10 year-old who start school in three weeks, it's time to start yelling and screaming.  The FDA needs to provide emergency use authorization for children under 12!"
2021-08-10 15:54:36,"1) way too many adults and teenagers in the US refused to get vaccinated, they will also not have their children vaccinated
2) vaccines are needed in the Global South, esp. in Africa
3) Alabama and other states are letting vaccines go to waste
... this needs to be addressed along with developing vaccines for children and finally VACCINE MANDATES - only exceptions are for those allergic not some phone religious excuse."
2021-08-10 16:42:13,I believe it is a mistake to start school for children under 12ys old without a vaccine available to them. Keep the remote schooling until children can be vaccinated.
2021-08-10 15:26:49,"Ms. Goldberg, thank you. We share with you, your concerns.
While there is delay in seeing FDA approval, all loving parents have a growing concern for their children. In less than three weeks most schools around the country will reopen. We will be allowing our kids to expose themselves. In the absence of the vaccine for children, responsible parents would have their children to wear the Masks, as a precaution. Yet, there will be parents, who would opt to send their children without a Mask. These ignorant and gullible parents, together with those reckless and negligent elected leaders, who are anti Mask and anti Vaccine, pose a greater risk to the community. Instead, should these individuals holding Office, not be pushing the FDA to expedite vaccine availability? Should these individuals, not be working with their State health services leaders, and educating their constituents why it is important to have the Vaccine, or wear the Mask, until the Vaccine is available? It is not just the FDA we are having a problem with, the elected representatives in the various States as well."

2021-08-10 15:36:52,"Once again, we're (collective) in a situation where the intelligent people are being forced to accept the will of the morons.  Beyond the comprehension of any thinking mind that  this dilemma is even happening- that we should be bowing to the will of people who don't believe in science- we truly are in the dark ages once again and the 'prophecy' of the movie ""Idiocracy"" is becoming reality.  Having commented previously on the subject- there isn't a school district anywhere where you don't have to show proof of vaccination for DPT (diptheria, polio, tetanus,  as well as hepatitis B). while I'm sure there are anti-vaxers who protest that requirement, doesn't lessen the frustration of the more science accepting population for another vaccine required NOW to add to that list.  For those of us who truly care about our kids. My daughter is grown and vaccinated but i'd be pounding on someone's door/desk/head if she were at greater risk of being denied protection of the vaccine due to some unnecessary delay.
I'm afraid that as with gun violence or opioids, until one of those slowing the process, suffers a devastating loss of their own child to covid-19-delta, nothing will move along with any increased speed. Get everyone vaccinated- make it mandatory, as well as wearing masks, believe me you do not want to be intubated awake, nor watch that happen to your kids."
2021-08-10 15:43:14,"The irony is Mrs. Goldberg is trying to politicize this issue.

The SCIENCE says it is incredibly rare for children to get ill from Covid.  This must be weighed against potential long-term safety risks from the vaccine.

2021-08-10 16:11:37,"Since it is unlikely that vaccinations for children under 12 will be available anytime soon, which even if the FDA authorized “emergency use” tomorrow, it would take several months at best to get these children vaccinated. 

Furthermore, not all of these children would be vaccinated since their parents aren’t trusting of vaccinations, so shouldn’t schools districts begin to plan for segregating unvaccinated kids from those who are vaccinated? 

Even high schools should consider segregation in the basis of vaccination status of teenagers….

Obviously, segregation has many negative connotations and consequences, but any tool to increase vaccination rates should be considered at this stage of the pandemic. Unfortunately how prepared are schools districts to implement changes that minimizes the educational experience and effectiveness?"

Understanding that children can begin puberty at different ages, but these different ages lapse over between the ineligible under 12 group and the eligible 12 and over.  

It is also understandable that many parents of younger children approaching puberty may have more concerns, that raises many more questions."
