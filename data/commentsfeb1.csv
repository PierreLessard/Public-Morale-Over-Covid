The big picture is that China launched an  unprecedented mobilization and containment efforts, including building up hospitals in under a week and calling up the military to provide aid. Such efforts couldn't have proceeded without Xi's involvement. Evan a China novice can deduce that. They demonstrated what's not possible elsewhere can be accomplished under their system.

The Japanese learned this ages ago, which is, in part, where bowing originated, and why in the middle-ages their cities were scrupulously clean - regular bathing, laundry and general cleaning - while the rest of us were living as proverbial pigs in the muck. Yes, I know they do shake hands but that's generally reserved for the more intimate circle of friends.

Same mindset as these kinds of people have relied upon to remain in control regardless of the circumstances. When they cannot affect nature they sacrifice people to appease the invisible divine powers behind it all. China has no tradition of government that can adapt to the unknown."
2020-02-10 18:54:50,"We still can't trust either the number of infections, nor the number of deaths. This means the lethality and the rate of spread of the infection has a large error component. We do not know what we are fighting. 

Reports continue to describe people with symptoms who can't get get tested because of test kit shortages--even deaths from the symptoms are not counted without a confirming test. China needs to allow medical professionals to make a diagnosis without the test based symptoms and proximity to others who have had the flu until there is an abundance of test kits.

We do not know when people become capable of spreading the disease. Specifically, we do not know if people with no symptoms can be spreaders. 

A number of the fatalities have been fairly young and healthy. There is also a pattern of people getting sick, starting to recover, then hitting a relapse days later. Are we seeing the same victim pattern of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that claimed many young, healthy people? In that epidemic, the body's own immune system began attacking the body, and those with the strongest immune systems were most strongly (and sometimes fatally) attacked. 

There appears to be far more we do not know than we do know."
2020-02-10 18:59:27,"Has anyone addressed the need to increase food safety standards in China? It would appear that the investment to change current practices would be less costly than containing an outbreak, again. 

Food safety is used as a scientific discipline describing the handling, preparation, and storage of food in ways that prevent food-borne illness. The occurrence of two or more cases of a similar illness resulting from the ingestion of a common food is known as a food-borne disease outbreak.[1] This includes a number of routines that should be followed to avoid potential health hazards. In this way, food safety often overlaps with food defense to prevent harm to consumers. The tracks within this line of thought are safety between the industry and the market and then between the market and the consumer. In considering industry to market practices, food safety considerations include the origins of food including the practices relating to food labeling, food hygiene, food additives, and pesticide residues, as well as policies on biotechnology and food and guidelines for the management of governmental import and export inspection and certification systems for foods. In considering market to consumer practices, the usual thought is that food ought to be safe in the market and the concern is safe delivery and preparation of the food for the consumer. Just asking."

But in a country known for weak regulations, now is the time to call for democratic leadership. The CCP’s push for wealth and power has created a corrupt system skewed toward financial gain. The leaders are patriots, but the system is corrupt. The death of Dr Li symbolizes what is wrong in China.

2020-02-11 17:34:50,"Time for people to consider plant based diets!!!

Except for Ebola, it's almost always China at the epicenter of new viral infections. And like Ebola, all linked to the slaughter of exotic animals, in markets where people buy and eat almost anything that walks, crawls or swims. 

I wonder why you never have these pandemics originating in India, which is poorer and just as populated as China?"
2020-02-10 16:23:57,i cannot imagine being stuck on that vessel. even the passengers who were allowed to leave could be infected and still asymptomatic (how does one know when to begin counting the 14 days with others on board capable of infecting you at any time?)...with that many new cases there is really no way to know.
2020-02-10 16:25:58,"So now we have a comparison between the liberal and democratic government of Japan and the authorization Communist state of China.
Japan, despite being a much richer nation and with far fewer cases, has been unable to effectively test all the possibly infected on one ship. The crew of the ship are left living closely together  where spread of the infection seems inevitable. Even with foreknowledge of what to expect. the numbers of infections is rising steeply.
This is a very difficult epidemic to control. Let us judge China's efforts after we see how others cope."
2020-02-10 16:26:19,The Cruise Ship 'experience' has become now a nightmare event.  Will it fade out?  Certainly patrons will have second thoughts on living in close quarters in an incubator for two weeks.  These floating cities are unhealthy.  There are better options out there to enjoy travel.
2020-02-10 16:31:34,"What Japan has done to the people on this ship is a crime.  They should have moved all passengers to on-shore quarantine immediately, and asked other countries to fly their citizens home.  They could have used the empty cabins for isolation of crew members for a short time if the logistics of getting everybody off the ship and into appropriate isolation was not possible.  A cruise ship is an incubator, not an appropriate place to institute quarantine."
2020-02-10 16:33:39,"I wonder how the staterooms on cruise ships are ventilated. Presumably there is a series of ventilation systems that move air among and through the rooms. If microdroplets can carry the virus, then are passengers “quarantined” in their state rooms not at risk of breathing in such droplets? if yes, then staying in one ‘s own stateroom is not necessarily protective. 

My heart goes out to everyone on the affected ships. They are trapped in an environment that puts them at heightened risk."
2020-02-10 16:42:55,"The way the crew is being treated, with close contact in dining, sleeping and showering (4 to a shower), is ripe for the virus to spread among them.  Not only is this unfair, they now have the opportunity to spread the virus to even more passengers. Also, the 14 day quarantine will need to be extended due to the new cases."
2020-02-10 16:47:47,"I have no doubt that most of the workers on the crew live in tight quarters.  This means that if one is infected it will spread quickly among the crew.  The crew bring the meals to the passengers locked in their room. If the crew member is infected, but does not yet know it yet, they could easily spread the virus to those passengers quarantined in their cabins. Clearly enough people on the ship are infected to tell us that the control measures in place are not working.

Quarantine is supposed to stop the spread of infection not doom those stuck in quarantine to wait to get infected by the others in quarantine."
2020-02-10 16:50:37,The usual corporate PR baloney that everyone is “trained” for the situation and everything is under control.  Workers deserve the same protection as passengers.  If the ship doesn’t have the room to provide separation for its employees they should be evacuated.  There are other ways to meet passengers’ needs besides ￼sacrificing human  lives.  These corporations that are so smart about making money can figure it out.
2020-02-10 16:57:46,"The only positive in this nightmare is maybe the cruise industry will get significantly downsized. These ships are massive polluters, and situations like this show how dangerous it is to have thousands of people living together in very tight quarters.

I feel sorry for everyone affected."
2020-02-10 16:58:14,"Ironically, the only way off this ship is to test positive for the virus. Given the interminable wait and uncertainty, that would almost be a relief."
2020-02-10 17:00:10,"For a rich country like Japan, which is well prepared for earthquake disasters, saying they don't have the means to test all the passengers and to set up a temporary quarantine to better isolate the people who are not sick but subject to risk of catching the virus in tight quarters is  inhumane."
2020-02-10 17:03:23,"Due to the nature of their work, the crew would have had the highest amount of exposure to the virus, so it seem ridiculous that they are the ones who are not in quarantine and are actually preparing and serving food to those who are."
2020-02-10 17:05:59,"Why can't an American or International hospital ship be dispatched to Yokohama Harbor to help care for these folks on the cruise ship-Including the crew? Or as an alternative set-up a field hospital dockside. Very scary to see that the worlds two most technologically advanced countries, the US and Japan, seem to be floundering about, and simply throwing up their hands at the plight of the folks on this ship.

 It ought to be a huge heads-up for the international community to see just how easily contagious diseases can bring even the most advanced nations to a stand still."
2020-02-10 17:12:49,"A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Given the conditions in which the crews are operating and living, through no fault of theirs, it is no surprise that the number of cases in that ship is rising. It is an unfortunate situation with no easy solution."
2020-02-10 17:13:48,"My heart goes out to the crew workers and passengers who are living through this nightmare. My husband and I had always said we would never take a cruise--we're very passionate about independent travel. However, after hearing so many wonderful things about the Inside Passage cruises in Alaska, we took our very first cruise last year on a Princess ship. Somewhat to our surprise, we had a fantastic time. Sadly, I only learned later about the environmental toll of these ships and the worker's dismal living/work conditions. And now, reading about this quarantined ship...well. No more cruises for us."
2020-02-10 17:15:31,"To have such large numbers of cases on the Diamond Princess cruise, must lead one to think that the crew are spreading the virus from one passenger to the next. As stated in the article the crew are insufficiently trained, and not adequately gowned.
They also live in very close quarters to each other. This will unfortunately lead to more and more casualities, and eventually all could succomb to the disease. We know that masks are inadequate and thus even the preparation of food and drinks by the crew, and the handling of the crockery and cutlery may be a mode of transmission."
2020-02-10 17:17:04,"I've been on a cruise ship with 100 people, it was pretty nice ( and expensive) but cramped nonetheless. 

I can't imagine myself willingly entering one of these bee hive cruise ships. Ever, for any reason."
2020-02-10 17:22:06,"This is interesting.  In an ideal situation quarantine facilities for the lesser number of crew would be on shore to reduce the crowding typical of crew member accommodations.  The problem is... if onshore some of those crew members will escape to visit the nearby city potentially spreading contagion.   So the desire to contain every one on an easily guarded ship understandable.   This may even work if strict hygiene is observed;  if disease spreads unbounded on the ship and conditions greatly worsen people will start to swim ashore and then nearby cities will definitely become contaminated.  So, this is an interesting test case for containment, and what may go wrong.  I'd rather observe from a distance. 

Norovirus, coronavirus... crowded disease incubating cruise ships are not looking very attractive.  And there is no way to disinfect them in a couple of days either, no matter what the c-suite claims."
2020-02-10 17:24:30,"It is highly unlikely that this virus can be contained in light of how far it has already spread.

Keeping people quarantined on the ship is also unlikely to solve the problem.  It will eventually lead to everyone being infected - and subsequently immune - at which point they can leave the ship.  

So the best procedure at this point would likely be to get all the people on the ship into the mess hall, everyone takes a good cough at everyone else, then incubate until everyone has lived through the infection, and then disembark.  
From the currently available information I would guess that would take care of the problem within ~ 3 weeks or so.
The way they are doing it right now will lead to the same final result, but it will take a lot longer."
2020-02-10 17:26:04,"In hindsight, I wonder if quarantining people on shore would've been a better move. All these people cooped up in a ship, even such a large ship, might be making the situation worse, or easier for the virus to spread. Plus, the crew is not trained to handle this type of medical emergency. I feel so bad for everyone in this situation."
2020-02-10 17:30:13,"I see a fair number of photos with bio-hazard clothed people with unprotected personnel nearby.  I hope the hazard suit-clad people are yet to board the Diamond Princess and not just getting off at the end of gtheir shift(s).  

Michael Collins of Apollo 11 said it best of the protections against lunar critters were pretty funny at best (a week of quarantine after splashdown, etc.).  They opened the hatch on the command module!"
2020-02-10 17:37:59,Just another reason why i would never go on a cruise.  My worst nightmare even before a virus were introduced.  To each his own I guess but maybe people think twice before going on a cruise ever again.   Those poor people stuck on that ship.  I hope it ends O.K  for everyone on there.
2020-02-10 17:39:10,"Everyone on that ship is going to get sick. They’re spreading it around the ship, they may as well leave their cabins and be less miserable while they wait to show symptoms."
2020-02-10 17:42:51,"Another reason to never take a cruise.

Basically you are stuck and on your own.

Whether you are a passenger or employee, the cruise ship companies don’t really do anything to mitigate the issue.

It must be like living in a gigantic Petri dish."
2020-02-10 17:43:57,"The situation on this ship is only going to deteriorate.

They MUST get everyone off of this ""incubator"" and into on-land quarantine and not wait until half or more of the passengers are infected.

There's no possible way the crew, mostly young, uneducated people from 3rd world countries, given their cramped living conditions, etc. can possibly avoid infection and spreading it to the rest.  They lack biohazard training, education, and equipment.  

Let it go a little longer without taking decisive action and this ""Death Cruise"" will become truly awful.  When riots break out and passengers start jumping over the sides what will Japan do? Send the ship out into the ocean and doom the rest?

The CDC/WHO need to come up with a plan and implement it immediately before the nightmare gets any worse."
2020-02-10 17:44:49,"Being quarantined on the ship, in close quarters, is like being in a death trap. Even now it’s not too late to remove everyone from the ship and put them somewhere else where conditions can be better maintained and the situation monitored until the situation changes. Keeping them on the ship will only guarantee that the virus continues to spread and someone dies. 

This situation is also bad for business. Who would want to take the chance that they might end up stuck for weeks on a ship with nowhere to go and no options? Anyone who works for a living should think about taking that cruise, no matter how good the offer."
2020-02-10 17:47:13,Cruise lines make tons of money. Why doesn't Princess Cruises provide another ship where low risk crew members and guests can be separately quarantined for 14 days until they are cleared to go?  The logic of quarantining thousands of  guests while allowing scarcely protected crew members to rove around is insane. This is not just Japan's problem. The cruise line needs to take some responsibility!
2020-02-10 17:49:08,"Novel corona virus, norovirus, measles ....  If a hospital is the best place to go to get sick, it seems like a cruise ship might be a close second."
2020-02-10 17:50:03,"That ship is a floating Petrie dish. My heart goes out to all those aboard. It is possible that some scientific understanding of this zoonotic disease will emerge. For example, studies may be done of those who do not catch the disease to see if they possess any unique antiviral features in their blood which enabled them to resist the disease."
2020-02-10 17:53:57,"Aren’t you glad we have dedicated public servants willing to look for and at actual data to shape a response to a situation with is filled with hard choices?    

Clearly people are going to get hurt and some will die.   Mistakes will be made, likely obvious in hindsight.   

Having individuals with deep knowledge and experience and an understanding of the second and third order effects of decisions is comfortingly.

Is it possible, that an event like this could reawaken an understanding that competence matters???    I hope so."
2020-02-10 16:58:57,Cruise ships are the worst place to be with a virus outbreak. The company should do the right thing. Get everyone off of the ship and place everyone in a safer location. That is the only way they will contain the virus.
2020-02-10 17:45:17,"Currently the penetration rate on Diamond Princess = 136/3700 = 3.67%, whereas the total penetration in Wuhan = 16902 confirmed cases / 11.08 million population = 0.152%. That means that the number of confirmed cases per person on Diamond Princess is 20 times that of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus!
I understand the concern that infected passengers may spread the virus more broadly in Japan, especially densely-populated Tokyo. However, it will be an even bigger burden to Japan's health-care system if most or all of the Diamond Princess passengers & crew end up infected and having to be treated there. Hopefully a measured-risk approach can be taken to get these people back to their home countries and dispersed to contain this."
2020-02-10 16:31:34,"i worry about all the bad PR for Princess Cruises. It's not really the cruiseline's fault they have become a floating test tube for a pandemic

Actually i don't worry that much because it's a suitable tradeoff for the lack of bad br for the bilge pumping and smokestack spewing they do every day in sensitive glacial areas throughout the world."
2020-02-10 16:37:05,"This is a recipe for disaster.  When you only remove those who are already symptomatic, it means that they have already come into contact and potentially infected every other person with whom they have interacted.  Gloves, masks, suits - useless when those gloves could have touched a contaminated doorknob.  

They need to institute circuit breakers!  Remove people to military installations where they can be isolated effectively but also be in the sun and fresh air - best germ fighters ever!  Three or four people in a 250 sq ft windowless cabin - contagion run rampant."
2020-02-10 16:53:29,"All right, well, it's becoming increasingly obvious that a cruise ship is an inappropriate environment in which to quarantine against this disease."
2020-02-10 17:41:08,"I'm not a scientist, but this just seems to me to be exactly the wrong thing to do - closing up 2500 people in a confined space with a virus.   Headline in 3 weeks, ""2500 people infected on cruise ship."""
2020-02-10 17:43:02,Oh this is just too rich. The cruise ship as metaphor for the planet.
2020-02-10 17:46:40,In the mean time Japan and the rest of the world has completely failed and abandoned the people on the Westerdam - they have been barred from docking because of one suspected (unconfirmed) case.
2020-02-10 16:15:41,"The whole point of quarantine is to isolate the infected and those they have come into contact with so there is no spread. The down side of this is that some in the group who are not sick will get sick and some will die. 

Wash your hands frequently and do not touch your face unless you just washed your hands and face."
2020-02-10 16:47:54,You almost have to wonder if it would be better to try and use a military base to off load all these people.  All the crowding will spread the virus as people cannot get any separation.  What a mess - another reason I will never take one of these mega ship cruises.
2020-02-10 17:34:47,They need to isolate those people from each other.  The ship is an incubator.  It shares all its air and water and eating areas.
2020-02-10 17:47:33,"That ship is a floating nightmare - a death trap. The people on board should be moved to a land quarantine where there can be more distance between them, severly ill people can be identified and moved to hospitals, and those who are healthy can be isolated from those who are sick.

The medical services for huge concentrations of people have been demonstrated to be woefully inadeaute, lethally inadequate by this latest epidemic. More epidemics will follow. 

Systems need to be put into place avoid spreading disease.

I find it horrifying to even imagine being cooped up for days on end with people on a huge ship and don't understand why anyone would be motivated (other than excess boredom and having too much money with nothing to spend it on) to decide to go on such stupid cruises. It's like being trapped in a huge crowd for days on end. You couldn't even be removed from the floating garbage can if the chip had to be abandoned.

I think people will believe any thing in advertisements - no matter how much it violates common sense."
2020-02-10 16:29:30,"There's a pretty obvious question hanging out there. How come China can successfully test 1,800 crew members on World Dream but Japan is struggling to test 400 on Diamond Princess? I would think Honk Kong and Japan are medically equivalent.

I've already discussed the moral questions associated with onboard quarantine. This is a strictly technical question. Why doesn't Japan possess the ability to test the ship's passengers and crew when China can? Not enough test kits? Improper sterilization tools? What? There should be a fairly obvious answer.

How we can spill so much ink without even asking the question?"
2020-02-10 16:51:24,"This is an outrage!  There is no way to protect the crew and passengers within the close confines of a cruise ship.  

I see that the dock area around the ship has already been closed off.  So couldn't the Japanese army set up single-person, or family sized tents, at safe distances from each other, in the docking area?  (And out in the clean air?) The entire area could be fenced in to prevent departures or incursions.  Each tent could have cots,  a heater, and meals ready to eat or some such, plus books and a radio.  

This wouldn't be an easy task to set up, but neither would it be that difficult.  Housing facilities for other sorts of mass catastrophes are already invented and surely available.

But to leave these poor people in their present dire situation, unaided, with no way off the ship but to become ill?  Is Japan going to just sit there and watch them be removed, body by body?

  I say Shame on the Japanese government!  Where's your compassion?  Where's your common sense?  Where's your decency?"
2020-02-10 16:51:50,"Seems as if the people on this ship are destined to remain until 14 days after the most recent positive diagnosis.   Every time there is a new case,  they have to wait a fortnight to see if there is another to start the count again.

This is a disaster.   Crew can pass infections between passengers, since there isn't a kind of prison-door serving hatch for providing the inmates with food,  and of course they can also infect each other.

Are the Japanese government happy for these people to languish until they are either all infected,  or the all-clear is given to the survivors possibly many months hence?

Since the people on this ship really are all in it together,  it does appear rather primitive that we have a class of servers and another of elevated status who should be put at far less risk.   This is a medical situation,  not a master-servant relationship, where the underclass takes much larger risks while also doing all the work."
2020-02-10 17:50:11,"This truly sounds dreadful. It's now known that many patients in China caught their virus while in the hospital. I'd imagine this situation will only be worse. The crew as well as the passengers are in danger.

There is also no way to get through a 14 day quarantine there as people keep falling ill which would I'd imagine continually reset the clock. This could go on for a long time and unnecessarily endanger many people. 

Sounds like an international health entity needs to get involved here. The passengers and the crew need to get off the ship and put into a safe quarantine space. It also sounds like they ALL need to be tested ASAP and those who test positive separated from the others immediately."

2020-02-10 16:33:23,"A few years ago, communist China on the mainland began limiting the number of its tourists that were allowed to visit democratic Taiwan (an island of 23-24 million).  It did it to hurt Taiwan’s economy and bring Taiwan to its knees, bend it to its will. That policy is a blessing.  Taiwan was spared widespread viral infection because millions of mainland tourists were not allowed to visit Taiwan.  Isolation has its upsides too."
2020-02-10 16:38:34,"1) hey WHO, you’re mobilized. Is it possible to set up a mobile lab at Yokohama port so everyone on the ship can be tested, ASAP?

2) hey Princess: How about putting your VP in charge of health and safety on the ship to enforce your standards and practices for hygiene and give the crew and passengers a morale boost?

Here’s the thing about cruise ships and hygiene: we live within sight of the main cruise terminal in Seattle, gateway to most Alaska cruises. During the summer from Friday to Sunday 2 enormous ships dock at the port we can see. There’s another port downtown that also supports a cruise ship. 9 ships a weekend from May till nearly October.  Our conservative guess is anywhere to 2500 to 3000 guests and crew on each cruise. The ships arrive between 5 and 6 am and sail with a new compliment of passengers around 4pm. In theory, those ships are cleaned from top to bottom in those 12 hours. Short of hospital grade disinfectant - which doesn’t even kill everything (MRSA) - it feels like a mathematical impossibility to have those ships really clean by the time each new cruise sets off. Granted, thousands more people DON’T get sick on cruise ships than do, and only the really gnarly norovirus stories make news, but the stew of humanity, food prep, shared spaces, and buffets coupled with the short turnaround time has put us off the idea of cruising completely.

Under those conditions, particularly for the crew, it’s impossible to stop the spread of the virus. Heart wrenching"
2020-02-10 16:42:30,"When a quarantine becomes an incubator, something needs to change."
2020-02-10 17:11:13,"Another example of why I will never sail on one of these floating incubators.  What a nightmare for those stuck on board!  Attention passengers, we are currently serving bronchodilators and IV fluids on Lido deck."
2020-02-10 17:11:29,"What kind of circus is this that 10 crew members are infected, and are sharing buffet-style meals with their fellow crew members?  Their fellow crew members who are serving the thousands of passengers on the ship.  Other articles in the Times today indicate it takes 5-14 days for people to show symptoms.  I'm not an epidemiologist, but if this quarantine is for only 2 weeks and infected crew members are sharing meals and close quarters before serving thousands of passengers, then this isn't a quarantine.  It's a petri dish!  In 2 weeks more people are going to be released to spread this around the world because of how this is being handled."
2020-02-10 17:56:05,"Since we know theirs may be spread by asymptomatic people, then it's not enough to test temperatures.  They need to be testing for the virus.  But I guess the tests are not 100% accurate.  
Seems clear at this point the virus is spreading on the ship.

What a nightmare for everyone trapped on the ship.  

If they are waiting for the virus to clear they may be there for ever."
2020-02-10 16:54:36,"If someone on board decided they had enough of this insanity and jumped overboard, what would happen?"
2020-02-10 17:45:41,"From the beginning I have not understood why quarantining people on a cruise ship made any kind of public health sense. Infected people in a contained environment = larger-than-life Petri dish. 

Now, all you cruise critics, it might not appeal to you as a vacation choice but I bet you go to buffets elsewhere, you fly on planes but I bet most of you don’t have an antiseptic wipe to clean the germ-covered tray table, you get in rental cars but you have no idea how well they were cleaned (steering wheel=turning Petri dish) or you ride on jammed commuter trains and subways (that pole=vertical Petri dish). So, it’s not like you are insulated."
2020-02-10 17:57:23,"I don’t get it. Take the people off the ship and isolate the healthy ones for two weeks. The longer they are there, the more likely they will contract the virus."
2020-02-10 18:06:22,"A week ago it seemed perfectly reasonable to keep them all onboard. It still may be.

Perhaps the new cases of coronavirus are all a result of pre-quarantine infection. In that case, the onboard quarantine may continue to be the right answer.

However, I hope the medical community will do a careful analysis of the situation. If the shipboard quarantine is endangering the crew and passengers, perhaps other arrangements should be considered in the future.

For example, the UK and US evacuees from Wuhan seem to have been quarantined more successfully on land in isolated facilities. Perhaps such land-based and isolated quarantine centers are less risky than shipboard quarantines.

After all, this situation will arise again in the future. The medical community should carefully study the situation"
2020-02-10 18:06:37,Who is advocating for these people? Shouldn't Princess Cruises be trying to work something out with the Japanese government to come up with a better solution? Or are they too afraid that it will cost them money?  Why hasn't the American embassy and the embassies of all the passengers and crew and the Japanese government figured out a way to help these people who are being held as virtual prisoners? Certainly there are better solutions than what is currently being done? I've never wanted to go on one of those giant ships. This just confirms my resolve.
2020-02-10 18:07:07,"Obviously this is terrible for everyone on board. However this will also turn into a valuable controlled natural experiment.

Given almost 4000 people are now isolated on board, some being more isolated than others. We should be able to see how well the virus spreads under difference circumstances and also accurately measure rate of serious illness and potential deaths.

This should provide us with the most accurate understanding of the infectiousness and seriousness of the disease.

So far observing death rates from outside of Hubei province (so rest of China + world), this infection looks very much to have a similar virulence as the seasonal Flu and the panic around the world is both irrational and counterproductive."
2020-02-10 18:11:48,"This is criminal.  Everyone on the ship should be tested for the virus, then be quarantined off the ship accordingly.  This is like a slo-mo horror movie:  everyone on that ship will eventually be exposed to the virus, starting with the staff.  Their situation is unconscionable."
2020-02-10 18:16:43,"Add another reason to why, at age 65, I’ve never taken a cruise.  It’s much easier to see the world, in a more meaningful way, when you are not tied to one floating hotel."
2020-02-10 18:20:38,"I'm not remotely qualified to say what should be done, but it's hard not to ask if the Japanese government is following best practice in keeping the quarantined people on a ship."
2020-02-10 18:23:36,"I've just booked a 2 months budget/economy cruise for February 2021. And, the closest it gets to the far-East is New Zealand. I reckon the chances of getting an upgrade on the ticket look pretty good - given as how cruises seem to be fast becoming the world's least favourite vacation.

Assuming that I (and humanity generally) are still around in 2021."
2020-02-10 18:29:57,Tokyo Olympic is only 150 days away. Does IOC have any contingency plan or will it wait until the last moment?
2020-02-10 18:34:37,"It's a terrible situation for those on board  ship. Given that so much is unknown about this virus, it's best to be cautious.  The issue is not about the discomfort of a few, it is to protect millions of lives."
2020-02-10 18:35:58,"Hope the Japanese government or the cruise-line owners/operators are supplying all on board with plenty of high-quality duct tape and plastic sheeting.  And proper quality of individual room and hallway air filters and related supplies (and disposing of whatever comes off the ship as biohazard).

If people, especially non-symptomatic people, are by law or policy being forced to remain quarantined (which may, in the immediate, be the less-worse option for humanity?), the least the entity imposing or enforcing said law/policy can do is provide each person aboard with the basic resources — material and informational — to protect themselves and one another from highly-contagious illness, whether airborne, waterborne, food-borne, or other known or possible means of spreading."
2020-02-10 18:44:48,"Everyone on this ship is in serious danger of contacting the Wuhan virus given the extremely close quarters. This is an archaic method of quarantine that should never be allowed. The Japanese government should have provided a more secure, but separated environment as we've done with those airlifted back to the states from Wuhan. Any deaths will be the responsibility of the Japanese."
2020-02-10 18:46:41,"This is not an acceptable treatment of fellow human beings.  Leaving them on a ship while this while a potentially life threatening virus spreads and offering them face masks and hand sanitizers to deal with it is cold and inhumane.  Ships from each country whose citizens are on board the quarantined ship should be summoned to immediately pick up those people and bring them to their home country for adequate treatment.  The governments of each of the countries involved should demand the release of their citizens and send medical teams to accomplish this.  If President Trump or Mr. Abe or the CEO of Princess Cruises were on board, you can be sure they would not be left to fend for themselves."
2020-02-10 18:47:52,"My guess is that corporate execs or lawyers are cautioning against any actions because, given the unknowns, those actions could result in worse outcomes, unintentionally. This reluctance to act for fear of blame has resulted in a patently absurd situation that shames not just the cruise line and host country, but each of us. As a society we need to recognize in extraordinary times blame is not the worst enemy. There is no societal benefit here to sacrificing these passengers and crew. Actions, without certainty of course, must be taken to liberate and care for them, immediately. Human rights."
2020-02-10 18:49:25,"What happens after the current 2 week quarantine period ?  It seems likely that the ship will have significantly more confirmed cases as time goes on.

Does that mean the ship quarantine period just continues ad infinitum ?  Till they all get sick and recover ?  (or not).  

Or until tensions boil over, and the passengers or crew start some form of unrest.

There is only so much time you can spend in a cabin, cooped up with an unknown timeline.  Even shorter if you are unlucky enough to have an inside cabin with no windows."
2020-02-10 18:51:34,"If you want to know why the Japanese are being cautious-their health ministry reports that there are 410  designated hospitals with about 2000 beds total in all of Japan capable of handling people infected with the virus. Now compare that capability with just the passengers on the ship or even only those that are sick. They are simply incapable of handling an epidemic. Neither, for that matter is China, who are  doing the best they can and taking draconian measures to try and contain it;  nor are we. So as bad as things are within the ship, it could get a lot worse if proper precautions are not taken."
2020-02-10 18:51:59,"I know the object of any news organizations is to draw eyes and interests to their Newspaper, they are businesses after all. Still the fear mongering over this one virus is way over the top. Here are the pertinent statistics about the Corona Virus from WHO:

80% of the cases are mild needing no hospitalization
15% require hospitalization but will recover
3%-5% of people will need intensive care
2% of cases are fatal

As with most epidemics the number in all categories go down in time, as more and more people recover and build the antibodies that fight off the virus. All-in-all China's very aggressive approach to the virus seems to be paying off. 

As always the only thing we have to fear is fear itself."
2020-02-10 16:53:22,May this be the death knell for the hideous cruise ship industry.
2020-02-10 17:49:18,"Separate, but related comment: Cancel Cruise Ships."
2020-02-10 18:01:46,"After 14 days...then what?

From the Maritime Bulletin ...

“Ghost Ship WESTERDAM refused entry country after country, no port to dock
 
Hapless cruise ship WESTERDAM with 1257 people on board has become a Flying Dutchman, a ship from techno thriller movie – she’s rejected entry by country after country, port after port, and her present port of destination is unclear. The ship is (was) on a 14-day Taiwan & Japan cruise, she departed Hong Kong on February 1, with 1455 passengers and 802 crew on board. WESTERDAM was scheduled to call Japanese Ishigaki Island, Naha, Okinawa, Nagasaki and Fukuoka (Hakata), and complete her cruise in Yokohama on February 15.

That cruise had been canceled shortly after it started, after the Japan banned WESTERDAM from visiting any port in the country. The ship headed for Manila, but she was banned ...  After some time spent on high seas, on Feb 4 she arrived at Kaohsiung Taiwan, to be expelled from Kaohsiung next day, for the same reason of coming from Hong Kong, based on the same fears.

As of morning Feb 10, WESTERDAM is steaming in South China sea in southwest direction, port of destination not identified. It may be Vietnam, it may be Thailand, it may be Singapore. The problem is, the ship has to dock somewhere sometime soon, she can’t sail oceans forever, like a Ghost Ship from legends.”

2020-02-10 16:49:29,"I sincerely hope Princess Cruise Lines gives every staff member aboard the Diamond Princess a cash bonus worth at least 25% of their yearly salary and 4 weeks paid vacation.  Despite being “highly trained in safety and public health standards,” the crew has little chance of not being exposed to the virus. 

You can be pretty sure PCL will be offering a free cruise to the passengers after this misfortune."
2020-02-10 16:57:45,"This is sad, the cruel and inhumane treatment of the crew reeks racism. In many ways, the slow death imposed here is worse than the cure offered by the army in Zaire in the movie Outbreak."
2020-02-10 17:33:40,"The fact that Japan let the crew live in those cramped quarters was monumentally stupid. If the virus is indeed transmissible by air and it is viable for up to 10 days, I suspect that all of the crew are now infected. Since the crew members prepared and delivered meals and cleaned rooms, the entire ship's complement should be considered exposed to the virus.

Thus, they should all be removed from the ship and placed in a larger space where they all can be isolated from each other. Keeping everybody on the ship is just a morbidity and mortality experiment."
2020-02-10 18:26:57,Let my people go!
2020-02-10 16:45:59,The japanese govt needs to get off their bum and take responsibility of all ship passengers and crew and start thinking of reducing the number of passengers on the ship who have no symptoms and move them into hotels / govt owned housing that have agreed to quarantine measures and get them to finish their quarantines there. Then the ship crew can start having space for themselves in self-quarantine. This can become a national crisis situation quickly if there are 1000 + new cases that need to be treated.
2020-02-10 16:46:50,"Quoting from the ship's website <a href=""https://www.princess.com/news/notices_and_advisories/notices/diamond-princess-update.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.princess.com/news/notices_and_advisories/notices/diamond-princess-update.html</a> 

Feb 4, 2020: ""Princess Cruises can confirm that the first phase of health screening of all guests and crew onboard Diamond Princess, by the Japanese Ministry of Health, has been completed. We were notified that amongst the samples that have completed testing, 10 people have tested positive for Coronavirus.""

Feb 6: ""Princess Cruises can confirm the nationalities of the 41 people who were tested positive for Coronavirus ...The Japanese Ministry of Health has confirmed this is the last batch to be tested and ...""

Quoting from this article published Feb 10, 2020: ""Japan’s health ministry said on Monday that so far it had tested 439 people on the ship for the coronavirus."" and ""on Monday as Japan’s health ministry said that an additional 65 people had tested positive for the virus, nearly doubling the total to 135.""

What a tragedy unfolding in front of the world, a microcosm of Wuhan."
2020-02-10 17:03:11,Very likely no one on that ship is Japanese.  Thus the Japanese government could not care less about the people on board.  They only care about keeping them isolated from the Japanese populace.
2020-02-10 17:09:28,"The management of this situation on cruise ships appears to be an utter disaster!

Having thousands of people locked in a semi closed environment, re-breathing infected air, is unbelievably poor management.....it reeks of scientific (microbiology) and medical ignorance compounded by what appears to be a financial decision to limit money expenditure: moving people to  an onshore location for quarantine, off of the cramped ship.....

On ship infectious epidemics seem to be routine now, especially w cruise ship companies making larger boats that can house many more people......

We can only pray that a microbe (viral, bacterial,etc) akin to the Ebola virus never breaks out on one of these floating petri dishes!"
2020-02-10 18:33:19,The Japnese authorities have been callous and reckless on this issue from day one.
2020-02-10 18:03:48,"Trap healthy and sick people in tight spaces with poor air circulation.  What could possibly go wrong? 

The only way that ship empties out is when everyone has gotten sick, which will happen."

2020-02-10 18:08:53,"Thank you for the 135 additional reasons to reinforce why I will never set foot on a ""cruise"" ship of any kind."
2020-02-10 18:31:46,"The Japanese government has essentially imprisoned uninfected people with infected people in close quarters, vastly improving their chances of catching the virus.

A saner approach would have been to have removed the infected to a segregated quarantine hospital as they manifested and quarantined the remainder elsewhere, there to remove those as they manifested."
2020-02-10 18:13:15,"All passengers and crew on this ship need to be removed and quarantined immediately. It is amazing that health specialists haven't made very clear that isolation techniques used in hospitals and treatment centers use _negative pressure_ rooms. to isolate air flow from ill patients These rooms are designated specially equipped to prevent cross contamination from _contaminated air flow_. To have kept passengers and crew confined onboard creates a living petri dish. Without the proper equipment ie, negative pressure rooms, those on this ship are being made ill in a negligent and incompetent manner. Unbelievable health specialists haven't publicized the negative effect of confinement."
2020-02-10 18:55:22,"On a separate-but-related topic, this article reminds me of Neil Gorsuch's verdict on an employee who left his truck to save his own life and was fired for it.  Naturally, Gorsuch's opinion was that the employee's paramount duty was to stay with the merchandise in the truck, regardless of risk to his life.  In this situation, straight out of a medical thriller, where employees are confined to their place of work, turning it into a literal death trap, all rights stripped away, it is a true horror show.  Is it not possible to enact a quarantine while also protecting human rights?  After this, I wonder how easy cruise lines will find it to get employees from any country."
2020-02-10 19:00:23,How the Japanese government is coping this situation  is truly disappointing. Suppose coronavirus is cleared before the olympic and the game opens as scheduled. What would happen  if the corona virus erupts again during the game? Would Japanese government confine 20 thousand players and countless visitors to the players village just like they are treating the passengers on this ship now?
2020-02-10 19:01:31,"What country is the ship registered with, and who is ultimately responsible for it?  This current situation can’t go on indefinitely, as they will likely all either catch the virus or succumb to despair.  Don’t some of those still healthy people have jobs they need to return to or risk losing?  There does not seem to be any plan."
2020-02-10 19:03:38,"To anyone on board the ship who is reading these comments, know that many around the world are wishing you well, and wellness.

Sure hope the cruise boat company or the Japanese government, or at least the Japanese Red Cross is providing ample free, highly-qualified and CISM-trained confidential and legally-privileged individual psychological counseling and group mental heath care for all on board, and on an ongoing basis for the duration of the quarantine.  Although not ideal to do so, it’s easy enough to provide such services via both telephone and video conference (with proper protections of privacy).   Failure to do so further endangers those onboard, both in the immediate and the long-term."
2020-02-10 19:06:03,Floating Petri dishes - cruise ships.  Viral and bacterial infections are common on cruise lines.  Avoid them.
2020-02-10 19:07:59,"What a difficult situation for everyone on this ship. As an immunosuppressed individual (thanks to great drugs that give me much improved quality of life), I am of necessity a germaphobe. Thankfully, most people don't have to worry too much about getting sick, but I have to be ever observant; wipe down surfaces on grocery carts; keyboards; remote controls; door handles; table trays on airplanes; hotel room high touch surfaces; use a knuckle on an elevator button. Hand sanitizer used and hands washed ad nauseum. How difficult to get so many people (passengers & crew) on this ship into new habits overnight in order to minimize their risk. Are their food trays being sanitized? Are delivery personnel wearing disposable gloves? Who is supervising the employees and insuring hand scrubbing? How often are high touch surfaces in common areas being Cloroxed? Why aren't we hearing details re. these type precautions?"
2020-02-10 19:08:26,"The Indian crew member who asked his government to free him from the ship seems to have overlooked his contractual agreement with Princess Cruises.  Governments may intervene possibly to remove passengers bt the crew is a different story.  

It sounds as though 84 year old Ayako Jinnai is traveling alone.  Traversing a cruise ship holds many dangers for young fit people, windy conditions, wet decks, boarding on/off bobbing tenders, etc, I am amazed no family member accompanied her on this trip."
2020-02-10 19:10:38,"I live in a small remote city in Alaska that welcomes at least 20 cruise ships each year. Most of these cruise ships have populations larger than our city. Our hospital has  a very limited ability to care for sick cruise passengers and even less space on a very busy dock for an extended cruise ship docking. Please people, think carefully before you get on one of these ships."
2020-02-10 19:12:22,"As of 8 February, 64 individuals were found to have been infected with 2019-nCoV among passengers and crew members. All individuals testing positive were disembarked and admitted for medical care in infectious disease hospitals in the Yokohama area. Close contacts of the infected passengers are asked to remain in quarantine for 14 days from last contact with a confirmed case. Thus, the quarantine period will be extended beyond the 19 February as appropriate only for close contacts of newly confirmed cases."
2020-02-10 16:31:42,"I’m not sure if this new viral sensation is all that great. Seems like a lot of viral things that go around these days in that it’s mostly hype. Not much different from a cold or flu other than the attention it gets on the news. 
 The part of it that gets me that has been glossed over is the fact that people eat cats, monkeys, rats and tiger balls and then get sick. 
 Time to radicalize the food industry and get away from cruel inhuman and dangerous practices. 
NOW!"
2020-02-10 17:09:19,"I fully understand the risks that all on board are taking and that many of the crew are surely going above and beyond in what I can only imagine to be a living hell. 
But, raising a practical question in response to the statement that the ""crew is highly trained in safety, etc."" -- at what point does a person reach his or her breaking point? They may be trained to handle an emergency -- a fast-moving crisis that can encompass any number of things. This is an event with no end in sight.
The majority of the crew are likely not ""professionals"" in the regard that they have been trained to handle a prolonged crisis, yet they are being counted on to be responsible beyond what most of us could endure for more than a day.
And finally -- and I know that this is the least of concern for some, but not for all -- how will they be compensated for their service? This is well beyond the call of duty.
For all intents and purposes, ""the cruise"" has been over for a while. Many cruise line employees rely on passenger tips upon debarkation. That's pretty much a non-event for these employees.

Anyone who's seen the ""Patriot Act"" episode on the cruise industry knows that the working conditions and protections are hell. These folks live in tiny rooms with bunk beds, that double as food stores! Yes folks, before the outbreak Binay probably slept next to bushels of potatoes. I had to take notes as I read this article. The list of stupidities practically ran off the page. Way to go /Royal Princess/ there is nothing in this world that you will not do to save a penny and maximize your profits. You had better hope that no one dies on this 'scruise'.

In other words all of the air from the cabins and other habitable quarters on the ship would be exhausted  and not recirculated as would usually be done.   All the replacement air would be brought in from the exterior of the ship and either heated or air conditioned before being distributed to the cabins. All the outside air would have to be brought in from a source that is well away from air exhausted from the ship so as to prevent contamination."

Our excellent cabin steward, a young Chinese man, lived in a refrigerator sized room with four roommates. We are questioning whether we would be wise to do this trip again. The entire cruise business needs to be examined and downsized. These ships may be better employment than these folks would have at home, but as they become incubators of disease, something must be done."
2020-02-10 19:40:58,Thanks for bringing to the attention of your readers the life and challenges of the crew.  I saw on the BBC a video of British tourist indicating that it was an inconvenience but that they were doing fine aboard the cruise ship.  I also agree with one of the commenters that more attention needs to be focused on wet markets as a reservoir and subsequent amplifier of the these virus that can spill over to humans.
2020-02-10 19:44:18,"The average age of Diamond Princess passengers is quite high. A lot of retired couples, many with preexisting medical conditions.  There has been no info about the passengers of the ship in HK.  You might recall that when the first bad news arrived (the man from HK who had visited China before boarding the ship was found infected), DP still allowed passengers socialise actively.  I guess there will be litigations.  Not one, may be two as crews would also regard the current conditions of work negligently endangering their health."

My heart breaks for the employees crammed into such tight quarters, forced to work 12  hours a day.  While the conditions are much better than what employees must endure, it would not be a picnic either as a passenger quarantined in a claustrophobic interior room.  I pray that Japanese officials will soon remove these people off the ship.  This is not sustainable."
2020-02-10 20:03:10,"A few years ago, I caught viral pneumonia from the high school where I was teaching. It took two failed antibiotics before they found the right one to treatment. At the age of 35, I felt like I was on my last legs. I couldn't walk more than five steps, had to use a ventilator, and lost about 10 lbs. I was out for 5 weeks, but slowly recovered. At least 5 other teachers also developed the same thing.  Infections spread quickly in shared spaces, but even more so on cruise ships and airplanes. People often don't think of these risks, and I still take precautions to this day after my ordeal. Sadly, they are not always enough. Best wishes to these crew/passengers and hopefully it will be contained soon."
2020-02-10 20:05:26,"The best thing to do right now is to take everyone including staff, off the ship and put into quarantine.  Those kept in their cabins along with the staff can become infected at any time.  Enough already.  Take everyone off the ship.  It's the only way."
2020-02-10 20:06:42,"""Unlike the passengers they serve, most of whom come from wealthy nations, the ship’s employees are overwhelmingly from developing countries like India and the Philippines.""

Given that the number of infections continues to increase even as they passengers remain isolated in their cabins, it's possible that crew members are inadvertently spreading the virus.  What a shame that these workers seem to have nobody to advocate for their safety and well-being."
2020-02-10 20:16:58,"One more reason to never ever go on a cruise.  Eventually everyone on this ship  will either have the virus or be found to be immune. At the point epidemiologists will have the perfect scenario to test the ones who remain immune, and perhaps find clues into making an effective vaccine."
2020-02-10 20:18:35,"I don't understand what the endgame is here. The original intent of the 14-day quarantine was to make sure that anybody who had been initially infected would be showing symptoms by the time the quarantine was lifted, as up to a 14-day incubation period was suspected. But now, you have people that are very likely getting infected on the ship, since the quarantine started. Doesn't that reset the clock on the length of quarantine needed?"
2020-02-10 20:19:19,Can’t the ship land on a mostly deserted island or shore where the passengers and crew can separate a bit and not be trapped together in close quarters?  And have supplies airlifted in regularly?  That would seem to decrease transmission among them...
2020-02-10 20:41:12,"I wondered about is bringing in more cruise ships (one or two), and getting those poor souls out of the windowless inside cabins - especially those with kids. It would also allow some space to spread out the staff on board. 

Alternatively, perhaps Trump Inc. could do something philanthropic and offer up some of their empty hotels - not gonna happen. 

There are also some very large US armed forces basis in Okinawa and elsewhere in Japan. In Canada, Canadians have been repatriated to such a place in Ontario. 

There is also a 1000 patient care capacity (including intensive care) on the USNS Comfort currently in the Caribbean, and USNS Mercy with a similar capacity. Other nations, such as China, have smaller hospital ships, although the UK does not appear to have one."

2020-02-10 20:15:27,"This is the most outrageous, racist thing I have witnessed in my entire life.  Out of everyone on this boat these are the most likely people to get sick and they are all clustered together to spread the disease among themselves?

Are they a different breed of people with innate immunity or is it just that their lives don't matter as much as everyone else on a true ""quarantine?""

How can this even be called a quarantine if passengers and staff are still exposed to the most recent case? Then the clock starts over.

Why isn't everyone on the ship taken off, tested and the ones who are negative quarantined in a government facility like the ones in the states?  The ones who test positive can be quarantined in the hospital."
2020-02-10 20:23:50,"The threat of contagion aboard the Diamond Princess must elicit a fear among the victims that feels like that felt by the passengers and crew of the Titanic. Only, this is in slow motion. It is beastly to keep all those people incarcerated in a floating disease chamber."

Sunlight and UV light kills viruses. Sunshine is literally the best disinfectant.
This is a respiratory, airborne, virus. 

They should be quarantined in smaller groups without shared air ventilation. We should remove our citizens to be quarantined in the US. This is a terrible way to quarantine. It guarantees most people in the quarantine will become infected.

The statistics are frightening.
This is from Wikipedia:
""On 4 February 2020, the ship was in Japanese waters when 10 passengers were diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus during the 2019–20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. A total of 3,700 passengers and crew were quarantined by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for what was expected to be a 14-day period, off the Port of Yokohama.[11] On 6 February, 10 cases were identified.[12] On 7 February, the total number of people on board with confirmed coronavirus infections grew to 61.[13][14] Another three cases were detected on 8 February, bringing the total to 64.[15] Six cases were detected on 9 February, while another 66 were detected on the 10 February, bringing the total to 136""
  Something needs to be done very fast before more people die. In 6 days this illness has spread from 10 to 136 passengers. This is a tragedy.
   Princess cruise is owned by Carnival Corporation and pic. the company's headquarters are in California
the company was made famous by the American TV series "" The love boat""."

2020-02-10 19:40:28,"This is inhumane and must be stopped!! How can they not have already tested everyone on the ship? Of course the Japanese have enough tests, they just don’t want to use them.

Test everyone and let them return to their home countries, especially the poor crew."
2020-02-10 20:56:37,"I've worked on and vacationed on cruise ships.  The cabins generally run to tiny unless you pay a premium to get a larger cabin with an ocean view. The idea that I might get stuck in one of these interior, claustrophobic cabins would make me crazy.  Most cruisers are there only to sleep or have a quick drink before going to dinner. Have compassion for these people...they are in a very rough situation."
2020-02-10 20:57:36,"What no one seems to get is that in the case of cross-infections working their way through a large enough population a quarantine doesn't work.  This is especially true if we take into account that we don't know how effectively the virus can spread via air or via the crew.  To wait on that ship is to wait to be the next to be infected.

The Japanese government has clearly not thought through this scenario, or if they truly have, they are sacrificing the safety of the people on board the ship to supposedly protect their nation, which won't work anyways because with each case of the virus people have to be taken off anyways.

The solution to force that government afraid of making any decisions in this case would be for some passengers to go against the grain and drop one of the lifeboats to make their dramatic (and newsworthy) escape to land.  This would immediately focus the news story on the failures of the Japanese government to care appropriately for these people.  

To wait in that environment is to wait for cross-infection to spread."
2020-02-10 21:05:00,"This is an atrocity.  The crew, especially the cooking staff, have been allowed to handle, prepare, and serve food to the passengers, when nobody actually knows how many of the crew members were initially exposed to the virus.  Keep in mind that there is a 14-day incubation period, and for the crew members to be serving food inside a sardine can environment during this time is a time bomb waiting to go off.  I am appalled that the passengers and crew were not  segregated where the passengers could have been taken to shore and quarantined inside a gym or some other large building and have food prepared and delivered by trained personnel that have been given a clean bill of health to do so.  I don't believe that, if this ship was tied up somewhere in the US,   the USCG or CDC would have allowed this type of operation and consequentially make the situation worse."

2020-02-10 21:25:52,"As bad as this situation is, I don't see any alternative.  I suppose one could argue that the 400 or so Americans be flown back to the U.S. and continue their quarantine here, however if one of them is infected, spending 12 hours on an airplane will guarantee that they all become infected.  Also that solution does nothing for the majority of these passengers who are not American.  As for those that are Chinese, they should be grateful that they are not in China. Contrary to what has been posted here the crews of cruise ships are well trained at preventing the spread of viruses. Cruise ships have been plagued with norovirus for years and their crews have had to deal with it. I  personally was on such a cruise that had an outbreak of norovirus.  Also, despite the close quarters cruise ships have ventilation systems that are generally more efficient that most land facilities. Lastly, although the crew quarters are cramped, they are considerably better than what U.S Navy sailors and even some officers are subjected to. Once again I'm speaking from personal experience."

The US has many military installations in Japan. Don't they have some extra space somewhere where they could house those Americans so they could do their 14 day quarantine and get out of there? It sounds like the ship quarantine keeps  getting extended because they keep finding more cases."
2020-02-10 20:50:39,"I hope by food, they are serving hot, well cooked stuff. No salads, cut fruits etc. And no meat please. Along with food make sure folks are given vitamins, especially D since they are cooped up indoors on a ship, this if they are not already taking them. Separate food trollies, no table cloths, no accessory decorations. How are they washing clothes? Eeks, common washers? What about sewage from bathing and bathroom. What are they doing to dispose off stuff? I sure hope the Japanese government is not being foolish in courting bigger disasters by not allowing the so far unsymptomatic people, to disembark to facilities which can be cordoned off. It is also galling to think Carnival cannot pay to get testing kits and instead depend on the Japanese govt. to supply them. They are a rather rich British-American enterprise who can afford pay for any supplies and kits. Please folks trapped on the ship, demand bottled water, kettles so you can drink hot teas. 

Honestly it’s almost as it Corona is being made to become an awful monster of a disease through our amazing lack of planning on scale. Actually I won’t be surprised if folks get Norovirus and other horrid infectious bugs when staying in such close quarters. It is cruel to the ships staff, imagine the horror of cleaning people’s toilets daily, living in fear of infection. I sure hope we have warmer weather a bit early, it just might help all these poor, poor people just get off that completely contaminated boat."
2020-02-10 20:53:37,A lot of comments here blaming Japan. A better question to ask would be - are the UK and the US offering to send airplanes to repatriate their citizens that are currently on the ship and take care of those of them infected? Of course not! No one wants anything to do with this illness. Everyone's #1 goal is to keep it away from their shores. So I really cannot blame Japan for doing the same.

And we assume that because we are modern with all our vaunted technology and medical techniques  that we are immune from the ravages of nature.  As such we become complacent in our arrogance and sloppy in our preparations.   Like climate change we  call the possibilities all a hoax and cut off funding for research and live in denial.

Am I right in assuming that once the 14 days is up, everyone is free to leave? And am I right in assuming that at that point in time, there will be some people who will perhaps be carrying the virus? If so, are they going to make everyone stay on the ship indefinitely? I feel like I’m not making sense, but at the same time how does 14 days work when people are continually coming into contact with one another via the crew?"
2020-02-10 21:58:22,I hope the passengers stay strong and will be able to leave soon.
2020-02-10 22:01:42,"I'm not a doctor, nor do I even play one on TV, but doesn't this sound completely nuts? 

I mean, clearly at least some people brought it on-board, but if you wanted to make sure as many passengers as possible would be infected, you couldn't pick any better way than to keep them all close together in a confined environment with shared air. 

Surely there has to be some onshore location far better suited to both minimizing the spread of it as well as identifying and treating the infected? I mean, this is just making no sense.

It is a positive feedback loop of the worst sort. People have to be quarantined for two weeks (the approximate time it takes to show symptoms. But keeping them in close quarters for that period  increases the risk of further transmission ... which will then need to lengthen the time on-board. 

If new cases are still being discovered (as at least a few have been today), wouldn't that mean that anyone they'd been in a cabin with or had contact with then need to be watched for an additional two weeks? 

Is there something I'm not seeing? (Serious question - any doctors in this discussion here? This genuinely makes no sense to me.) Is there any medically justifiable reason for handling this in what appears (to my untrained eye) to be the worst conceivable way?"
2020-02-10 22:02:30,"Why on earth are crew members then expected to prepare meals for those guests trapped on board further increasing the likelihood of transmission of the virus. All the meals should be prepared off the ship and brought on board in sterile packaging to everyone - crew included. 
keeping the crew together in confined spaces below decks whilst also expecting them to provide services (especially food preparation) to guests is a recipe for disaster which is clearly occurring."
2020-02-10 22:06:41,"What could be scarier?
I'm no expert, but hey, here goes...
Steer that boat to an island. Put distance between The WHO tent encampments there; a barrier between those testing positive, and those not yet.

Offer excellent food and proper medical care. Treat everyone with respect and honor their human dignity. Bill me and every other first-world citizen collectively for the cost of carrying this out.

In all fairness, it's important to note that Japan is not the ""host"" country or home port for this vessel, but merely a port-of-call. The vast majority of the passengers are not Japanese citizens. Consider how most Americans would feel if the US government allowed a ship carrying potentially hundreds of infected foreign nationals to disembark in New York City? Then you'll understand the position the Japanese government is in. However, I do believe the Japanese government are acting in good and they are doing the best they can under the circumstances. In any case ultimate responsibility falls squarely  on the cruise line and its investors. What are they doing to solve the problem?"
2020-02-10 22:29:42,"A reasonable mitigation step would be to park a second cruise vessel alongside allowing the uninflected crew and potentially some uninflected passengers to reside there.  This would help limit the spread of the virus.  
Of course this would be at a cost.  Is the cruise line ready to do what it needs to do for the safety of the passengers?"
2020-02-10 22:35:38,"A few decades ago I was on a very short cruise from Long Beach to Ensenada. It whet my appetite for a more lengthy cruise, but kids came along so we opted to put that off for awhile. 

My wife & I are starting to lose interest in a cruise, not just because of this but also because of the numerous instances of food borne illnesses such as e coli. Packing thousands of people into tight quarters with no government oversight of food handling practices just doesn't seem like a good idea."
2020-02-10 22:36:51,"The cruise ship does not have a ventilation system that can filter out viruses so all you've done is create an experiment to see how rapidly this virus will spread.

At some point you will infect pretty much everyone since they are all in a contained space."
2020-02-10 22:41:19,Is the air handler on a cruise ship one pass air or is it partially recirculated air? Is it absolutley confirmed viral particles cannot make it thru the recirculation system and not still be viable?
2020-02-10 22:44:02,"Not to be confused with the Norovirus, or ""cruise ship virus,"" or the winter vomiting bug. Most people survive but a lot don't, ""results in about 685 million cases of disease and 200,000 deaths globally a year"" Wiki
This virus spreads with ease as it takes very little of the virus to infect. No respiratory involvement usually, comes and goes in miserable few days. Fecal route to food and surfaces."
2020-02-10 22:45:01,"Some years ago I decided that I did not want to travel on a large cruise ship because of the risk of illness. At that time it was norovirus I was worrying about. 

I always imagined I was probably exaggerating the danger. Now that the new coronavirus has arrived, I guess I was actually right -- something of a surprise, because I don't always trust my own judgement."
2020-02-10 22:57:16,"I don't understand at all why people couldn't be taken off the ship and quarantined on land.   I would think that the virus would travel in the air throughout the ship. This is not a hospital quarantine set-up. 
Why don't people already know that you are risking your health on board these ships?  There's nowhere to run! 
And, of course, people need to stop participating in a needless activity which causes injury and death to sea animals."
2020-02-10 22:10:33,The question I have is - why are they still operating their cruise ships? How are they allowed to do so? Especially in south-east Asia.
2020-02-10 22:25:14,"Keeping them trapped on a cruise ship is creating a plague ship. The contamination will spread more easily among people who are breathing from the same ventilation system and being fed by a crew that's going around to everyone, and picking up everyone's germs. It's foolish and cruel to quarentine them on the ship. They should be brought on land to a secure medical facility so that they won't be picked off one by one by being restrained on the ship. Ships are not designed to be biohazard containment centers."
2020-02-10 22:35:52,"This cruise ship named the Diamond Princess is owned by Carnival Cruises,Corporation and operated by Princess Cruises, a subsidiary. The corporation is based out of the US in Miami, Florida and evaluated in excess of 18 Billion dollars with Billions in profits annually.  The current moored ship sails a British Flag. Yet Wikipedia has the Carnival Corporation labeled a British-American cruise operator with the only company with 2 international stock listings. They have a combined fleet of  over a 100 vessels and 10 cruise ship ""brands"". They purposefully have a multi billion dollar/pound entangled corporate structure that is created to avoid taxes,criminal  penalties environmental laws of toxic waste disposal in excess of 18 and 40 million dollars and I am afraid also avoiding labor laws and safety and security of their passengers and crews.
This is all about Corporate Greed and minimizing losses. The crew is also multinational mostly from third world countries with minimal labor rights-so I am guessing disposable. Carnival could afford to send their own private fleet with on board medical evacuation protocols and supplied tests, sterilized and medicines,etc, but they have already considered their losses and have to as the country of  Port (Japan)is taking the blunt of containment and care . The passengers are also disposable I am afraid. They will be entitled to a ""full refund"" according to the company's website. That refund is a lot cheaper that emergency hospital care."
2020-02-10 23:07:22,"My wife and I have traveled worldwide for decades.  Last year, we dipped our toes into cruising, with Viking Ocean Cruises, and found we enjoyed the experience.  So we're taking another Viking cruise in a few weeks, this time to South America.

Are we reluctant to travel given the coronavirus outbreak and what's happened to the Diamond Princess?  Not in the slightest.  We plan our trips carefully and carry cancellation insurance.  What happens along the way, happens.  We don't worry too much about it.

As for the holier-than-thou who slam the cruise industry, I say this:  Thanks for not taking cruises!  You free up space on the ships for the rest of us."
2020-02-10 23:17:05,"Prisons and cruise ships have a lot in common. Lots of people living and working in tight quarters, and at least while at sea, or during a forced quarantine, the inability to leave anytime you want.  Likewise, both are large scale petri dishes of communicable diseases. On cruise ships, it's usually norovirus; prisons typically battle staph infections.  I nearly lost a leg to staph my last stint.  

I hated prison and never wanted to take a cruise ship.  You pay in advance for a cruise. You're on the time payment plan in prison. Both can be bad for your health. I would council to avoid them both."
2020-02-10 23:20:41,"I find it interesting that a majority of the comments here are self-congratulatory regarding not taking cruises. What I got from this article is that we are in a Downtown Abbey + coronavirus nightmare. Folks whose lives matter little are asked to serve others whose lives mean, from the sounds of it, just a tad bit more to the company. It's barbaric."
2020-02-10 23:25:57,"It is time for the American government to step up and evacuate the hundreds of Americans passengers from that ship. Given the sizable U.S. military in Japan, there is surely the expertise and ability to conduct an evacuation. Then, if necessary, the Americans can be repatriated and quarantined at a base on American soil. Removing those passengers from the ship would ease the burden for everyone else, and give the cruise ship staff access to more comfortable accommodations for the duration of the quarantine."
2020-02-10 22:22:25,"Feel bad for the passengers and crew.  I understand the danger of letting all off the ship, but seems like everyone on board is going to catch it as they are quarantined in such close quarters. 

I'd never go on one of those huge germ boats; the frequency of norovirus outbreaks has been warning enough for this landlubber."
2020-02-10 22:21:24,"Just now, a Hong Kong apartment building is suspected as a site of airborne transmission of the Coronavirus.  The building is locked down and all the occupants have been sent to quarantine camps.    

So, having 3000-4000 thousands who are crowded in the boat is not the wisest ideas.

2020-02-10 23:33:02,"One thing that does not make sense about the quarantine is the notion that it will end in 14 days. This will be useful only if passengers have never come in contact with other potentially infected individuals during the quarantine period. However, the passengers in the cruise are exposed on daily basis to crew members who might have already been infected and infectious but yet to show symptoms. In addition, the food itself could be contaminated. Thus, authority either keeps the quarantine in perpetuity or try another alternative strategy. This is because after the 14-days- quarantine more people may be infected than now given number of cases is increasing every day."

On February 4 Princess Cruises wrote..

“The ship plans to go out to sea to perform normal marine operations including, but not limited to, the production of fresh water and ballast operations before proceeding alongside in Yokohama where food, provisions, and other supplies will be brought onboard.”

Ballast operations is a euphemism for flushing the ship’s sanitary (used toilet water) holding tanks.....

This is known as “blackwater” in the industry. The feces and urine are treated to get moisture out. Other than that, it’s dumped in the ocean.”

Are people confined to their CB cabinets or is it business as usual -,buffets, bars, and lots of contaminated surfaces. This is CNN not Ebola - people in the US receive their care at home. Personally I would never set foot on one of those floating death traps."
2020-02-10 23:59:15,"How does this quarantine stay limited to two weeks? If fresh cases are discovered today, and the incubation period is thought to be two weeks, doesn't the quarantine have to extended another two weeks? And then another two weeks as still more infected people are discovered? It looks like everyone on board is doomed to get the virus."

Keeping these people on the ship while the disease spreads is not a solution. And ending the quarantine process in a few days and letting everyone go home is just going to mean that the ship has worked as an incubator for the disease.

2020-02-11 00:48:13,"For years, my wife and I have discussed the +/-'s of taking a sea cruise.  Mostly it has centered around the opportunity to visit foreign shores versus the risk of acquiring Legionnaire's Disease caused by the ship's HVAC systems.

Now we have been watching the disease experiment on board the Diamond Princess.  We are learning of how a pandemic spreads, when forcing a control group of 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew to stay onboard a quarantined ship.  We have watched how the 10 cases of coronavirus on Feb. 4th have grown to 135, in just 6 days of confined living.  It must be terrifying to be on that boat.

The story of the Diamond Princess has ended our discussion of ever taking a cruise, once and for all."
2020-02-11 00:49:03,"Everyone’s health matters. The cruise has ended. It's quarantine time. Spread out the crew onshore or on the ship. If the crew cannot live in tents at the port, then have the crew live in tents or just spread out on the many public guest spaces of the ship. Much more challenging is figuring out how to serve meals and take showers with minimal contact. Many customers know the crew lives in close quarters and want companies to be compassionate to their crew."
2020-02-11 00:49:27,"I have never been on a cruise ship, because I abhor crowds, closed spaces and the sensation of not having freedom. Norovirus gave support to my resolution, as it used to be the virus of cruise ships.
Now the corona virus looks like a horror movie turned true aboard a ship. The poor people inside that ship are doomed to get sick if nothing is done to screen all of them for the virus and let those who are not infected get out. They may be quarantined out of the ship, if necessary. The government of Japan that imposed the quarantine is responsible for the sickness of these people and for any deaths. The owners of the cruise line should care for their passengers and crew and not permit this situation to continue, as it is not only bad for the health of the people on the ship but to their reputation.
I have imagined lots of scenarios aboard a cruise ship that justified my avoidance of that kind of travel. But being restricted of my freedom to disembark was not one. Now I know that is a posible and dreadful possibility."

2020-02-11 01:14:13,"If I was on that ship, I think I'd jump in the water and let the outside world rescue me.  There's no way those folks are getting out in another week or so.  They can only release folks AFTER they have the last person identified with coronavirus has been cleared for 14 days.  Right now, the clock resets every day."
2020-02-11 01:02:57,"If the particular prefecture, or even the entire nation of Japan, cannot manage to quarantine these people in a way that better protects those not yet infected, why on earth doesn’t the ship fuel up and sail to someplace that can, and will?"
2020-02-11 01:10:35,"To quarantine the whole ship for a prolonged time like that seems foolish and cruel to me. Soon or later everybody on that ship will get the virus and get sick. They really should test everyone on board, and sort them. Immediately remove and treat the sick, quarantine the infected, quarantine and then release the healthy. Those people should not be kept together like that. I think Japan is just making excuses about not having the capacity to test. If Hong Kong could test 1800 people aboard the ship there, why can't Japan? Japan is clearly more resourceful than Hong Kong."
2020-02-11 01:16:26,"“.. keep the contagion from expanding on Japan’s shores, is endangering the health and safety of the crew.”

Great that Japan wants to contain the risk and help preserve the health and life of the world’s population.

HOWEVER, given that usually these days many of the crew on such ships are not Japanese, could this be another incident of Japanese racism and classism?  (America isn’t the only population known to harbor and enact such)."
2020-02-11 01:18:35,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the crew and passengers are closely followed-up and are medically examined and tested for 2019-nCoV when displaying any signs or symptoms suggestive of 2019-nCoV disease.

The quarantine period is scheduled to come to an end on 19 February.

WHO added that all individuals testing positive were disembarked and admitted for medical care in infectious disease hospitals in the Yokohama area."

2020-02-11 01:23:48,"Once I became infected with a respiratory infection on a cruise ship, the same line now quarantined in Japan. At the time, a few years ago, I noticed that the hygiene on board was sadly inadequate. No alcohol sanitizer offered or available, and no restroom on the floor with one dining venue. The upholstery looked dirty, and I never saw anyone cleaning handrails. 
Having the crew going from room to room delivering meals is probably a guarantee of increased rate of infection. Indeed, it probably will be discovered that someone in the crew is  spreading the infection. In China, the medical people are wearing hazmat suits. Doesn’t that tell you something?"
2020-02-11 01:32:24,"A few of the comments here seem to attribute dark motives to the Japanese response, but I don't think it is that at all.  I've spent a good bit of time working in Japan and I believe the answer is far simpler.  While Japan is wonderful at perfectly performing repetitive acts under controlled circumstances, the same does not apply in dealing with sudden, unexpected, and catastrophic events.  A few years ago Fukushima shown a light on this tendency.  This is is a less catastrophic yet otherwise inept reaction.  Americans can't be counted in to put the peanut butter in two successive peanut butter sandwiches, but when Houston floods people in boats step into the breach.

PS:. It's probably too late, but I want to make clear that this is a cultural observation with no racial content.  The Japanese-Americans I've known have been just as adaptable, agile, and independent as anyone else in America.  And I have known Japanese who stood out from their fellow countrymen in those respects.  I describe only Japanese organizations and how they affect the people within them."

2020-02-11 01:38:14,"You can blame Japan - they may be slow trying to solve the serious issues.

Instead they are confined to this ship which acts as a giant incubator where infection continues to spread.  Those on the ship and their loved ones must be beside themselves.
2020-02-11 01:45:09,"How in anyone’s right mind would it be intelligent logistics in keeping 2,500 people confined on a ship in a constant damp and moist environment and think it would not breed more of the virus? They created an incubator!! 

We have records of this from centuries ago! I don’t know...slave ships, ships used for exploring, etc. There was always an outbreak to write about because ships are the perfect floating Petri dishes!

Someone please intervene. Officials could’ve easily made a quarantine camp OFF the ship. Yes. Isolate - but use intelligent and humane logistics. This is embarrassing!!"

Erect large tents behind barricades on the pier. Put in cots and those curtains they have around hospital beds. Move much of the crew off the ship to the tents.

No room on the pier? Moor one or more barges alongside. 

The Japanese Navy may even have barracks barges for temporary crew housing when they do maintenance on a ship’s berthing areas."
2020-02-11 02:18:30,Keeping everyone on ship guarantees unnecessary deaths. The policy is ridiculous.
2020-02-11 02:26:08,The Japanese are botching up the response. I liked the fact that the situation of the crew from poorer countries are highlighted. It just seems like the governments are ok to offer them up as sacrifice . I wonder what the response would be if it was a US or EU flagged cruise liner. The only hope for the crew is the Indian government’s ability to evacuate them. I am not sure about the Philippines
2020-02-11 02:36:45,Quarantine on a cruise is an oxymoron.  Everyone will get sick. I am surprised no-one has jumped overboard yet. The decks look about 40-50 feet from water and short swim.

There is no way the crew could have been completely prepared to use the protocols to keep themselves and the passengers uninfected.  They should all be removed from the ship immediately and safely removed to a location where those who are infected can be treated and those who are still virus free can be protected.  Every day they force them to remain on the ship the dangers of cross contamination and infection increase.  What are they waitiing for. Someone described the ship as a vast petri dish. The risk is terrifying to the passengers, the crew and their loved ones."
2020-02-11 03:49:31,"The attitude of the Japanese authorities is nothing short of medieval. In medieval times when the plague was detected in a village, they'd lock the village gates and abandon everybody to their fate inside to protect those outside. Back then there was little else they could do for the common good. It seems some of us haven't progressed all that much since then in some fundamental ways in spite of all the airs we have about ourselves. There is no excuse for this downright cruel handling of this situation. Modern, humane quarantine, designed to give as much protection as possible to the quarantined in addition to protecting the rest is not that hard to figure out, as shown by many of the common sense comments here."

It's inevitable that the crew living in close quarters will  spread the virus. But what I don't get is that the crew are still cooking for and taking care of the passengers!  Isn't it common sense that this puts the passengers at risk as well?  I don't understand why meals prepared on land would not be delivered to all by a team in hazmat suits, as well as the crew being isolated and protected.  Poor poor handling of the crises."
2020-02-11 04:11:52,"About time there was some coverage on the poor crew on these slave galleys. Simply disgusting what the Japanese authorities are imposing on the crew and passengers. It is a violation of fundamental human rights. They could easily remove the crew and passengers to safer, more humane quarantine facilities.

Take a week-long cruise and if the ship is so unlucky as to get hit with the coronavirus, passengers could get a couple additional weeks free - in quarantine."
2020-02-11 04:37:43,So basically everyone on that ship has been condemned to sooner or later get the disease. How terrible.
2020-02-11 05:09:18,"Who is in charge of the care on this ship?

They need help."
2020-02-11 05:39:45,"This seems like a good way of testing a lot about the virus and world health scientists should be rushing in.
1. test everyone  to see who tests positive, but has mild symptoms or is asymptomatic.
2. educate everyone on the ship about contagion control
3.  Continue to test and monitor everyone to see how long the latency period lasts, how easily its transmitted, severity of various people with the disease."
2020-02-11 04:32:15,"Long term, combating epidemics like the Coronavirus are going to require a belief in, and an investment in, science and facts.  In America, these appear to be values from a distant era.  Donald Trump has proposed cuts across the board at the National Science Foundation (NSF) in his 2020 budget request to Congress.  Now, I realize that Donald Trump's red hat supporters agree that ""Fine People"" were walking with Neo Nazis in Charlottesville, but I also hope they understand that pandemics like Coronavirus will not discriminate based on skin color."
2020-02-11 06:31:06,"The best thing to do is to transfer everyone on board to a secure temporary outdoor hospital (like in SARS). The staff are humans too, and their lives precious. They should not have to endanger themselves by working in cramped conditions to keep passengers fat, fed and happy. 

Doctors know to treat every life the same. They do not value ""passengers"" over ""staff"". It's mind boggling why the Japan govt fails to grasp this."
2020-02-11 05:52:02,"I think they have to let people, one by one, leave ship and keep then isolated in some places where they can get help. It is stupid idea to keep them together. Base on what they will decide that is safe for all of them leave ship at once? Eventually all passengers will get sick."
2020-02-11 06:33:02,How about robots ! The cruise operators should be brainstorming and using what's available. The Japanese are famous for their robotics research. There are already robots delivering takeout and groceries. How about robots delivering food to passengers and crew (who should be separated from each other either at port in tents or in the many public areas abroad the ship). Take a cue from what one Washington State hospital is doing - using a robot to check on a patient.
2020-02-11 06:53:46,"Come on, Japan! At least bring them food! It’s a death sentence to force these crew members to deal with food prep, delivery and sanitation, all of which are likely to spread the disease."
2020-02-11 11:08:26,"OK; how about the countries that have significant numbers of passengers on board bring them back home where they can be properly quarantined and treated if necessary. We in the US could certainly do this. I'm sure Europe could do this even if it meant sending a plane loaded with passengers from several European countries and then sorting it out once it lands. 

If we did this it would get the numbers of passengers down to a more reasonable level and allow the crew to spread out so they aren't confined below deck and sharing such tight quarters. What we've got there now is a disaster in the making for thousands of people. We shouldn't leave our citizens in such a spot."
2020-02-11 12:31:46,"Questions:

Who is the actual liaison for the ship’s crew members and Japanese officials and any medics?

Who makes final decisions? Is it Carnival Cruises HQ, ship crew or Japan?

How is food being prepared? Is it running low? At this point can only frozen pre-packages meals be prepared to avoid contamination? 

How are children, babies, and the elderly being looked after since their needs are more acute at this time?

How are crew who need to visit passengers including sick ones being physically protected from contracting virus? We’re they provided proper and adequate non-reusable PPE equipment?

How is bodily waste being collected on ship to be properly disposed of since it contains the virus? Or can it survive a long time outside the body?

How are public spaces, rooms and bathrooms being properly disinfected and daily? What is the chemical being used?

How are clothes being washed?

What happens to the belongings of sick passengers?

For 2,500 ppl what is the ratio of medics to passengers? Are these medics rotated so as not to burn out?

What is being done to keep passengers mentally and emotionally stable? 

Will heated quarantine tents be set up soon on land for passengers to slowly disembark and be tested and treated?

Are passengers still able to reach out to loved one?"
2020-02-11 12:25:28,Can this virus stay with the ship itself?
2020-02-11 13:07:48,"Japan’s leadership is demonstrating on the international stage either sheer incompetence and underwhelming preparedness, or a complete lack of respect and empathy for people who are risking their lives on that ship. My guess it’s more likely the latter when you consider Japan is a world class competitor in all faucets of the health care industry, and that’s saying a lot for a culture that has such a high regard for respect. For them to say “sorry we aren’t capable of testing 3500 people” is tantamount to criminal behavior. At last count Japan’s population was estimated at 126 million people. Are they serious?"
2020-02-11 12:35:55,"This is a farce, a deadly, horrible farce! They are all sealed in with the infection. A Canadian passenger assumes she is going to board a commercial aircraft as soon as the 14 days are over; she doesn't understand that she in far more danger of being infected herself than she ever was before the ""quarantine"" first began! No proper testing, no proper quarantine ~ nada. They should have taken the passengers OFF the ship and put them into army barracks or another safe place where they could actually be quarantined instead of placing them in this petri dish ~ conditions where we all know the virus is rife to spread!!!!!"
2020-02-11 14:57:21,"For quarantine, as new cases are identified, does the 14-day quarantine clock start over?  In theory, these folks could be on the ship for an unknowable amount of time if the clock restarts with each case.  Awful situation...for crew, for passengers, for their loved ones on shore."
2020-02-10 19:26:04,"China, rightfully, likes to brag about how fast they get things done.  After a bungled start with this crisis, the world hopes they quickly apply their high energy and deep skills to this nightmare."
2020-02-10 19:35:19,"Oddly enough, the Coronavirus might actually defeat Donald Trump's premise that he alone is driving our economic engine. Is this really the time to cut America's social safety net? How will the NIH and the CDC be funded in Trump's attempt to legitimize tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy? There's still plenty of money for the military but you can't shoot the Coronavirus with a bullet. You can't summon a skilled work force into existence or put Chinese-made goods for American companies on American shelves when the Chinese are unable to manufacture them. The dots are all there but will Trump be able to connect them?"
2020-02-10 19:42:33,Living through this nightmare now managing a factory and office in Shanghai. People who think this will be only a “blip” on the world economy this year do not realize the extent to which the government is willing to let commerce die in order to eradicate this virus.  My feeling is that this will knock GDP growth in China to negative this year.  Companies who rely solely on China for critical parts of their supply chain will suffer greatly.
2020-02-10 19:42:35,"There's an order of magnitude more people infected with the flu currently. I've seen stats saying 12,000 will die from the flu in the US alone this year. Why, *exactly*, is coronavirus scary and the flu is not? I'm frustrated in that I can't find a clear, smart answer to this. There was a Wired article that was a joke, please don't reference that. I'd like to see some real statistics or clear explanation."
2020-02-10 19:48:23,"This economic situation has come to resemble a slow dripping faucet rather than a catastrophic drop in supply chain/production activity. And just as China continues to quarantine its own citizens in an attempt to get ahead of the virus, the rest of the world continues to quarantine China in an attempt to ward off an increase in economic downturn or viral spread. The US markets, though, seem oddly detached from the potential for further disruptions, (as write the Nasdaq has hit a new high intraday) and are either anticipating there is no need to worry or, more ominously, completely ignoring that events are about to get much worse."
2020-02-10 19:49:10,"Absolutely. Notwithstanding the human tragedy and horror stories of quarantined ships, fear of the virus is even more economically damaging than the virus itself. Chinese GDP will tank, and take down the rest of the globe with it. This is psychologically far worse than SARS, and the nearest vaccine (even with accelerated FDA approvals) is at least 18 months away."

You can see it in the environment. You can see it in the lack of regulations to safeguard the people. You can see it in the spread of Wuhan virus and its lethality. 

Those safeguards are in place in the USA now, but trump is deregulating by executive order and putting us at risk. 

He cares little about anybody but himself. 

When China suffers, the rest of us will suffer, too. And trump has damaged the economic tools needed to deal with it. We are heading down the road to destruction."
2020-02-10 20:31:24,"Why has the United States been filled with immigrants from East, South, and Southeast Asia when I and many people I know have lived a life for serfdom for the past forty years?  Why is there a ceaseless press for more immigrants to the United States when the American economy does not even sustain a viable middle class economy for many of us who have been in the country for one hundred, two hundred, three hundred years?  Why is there an endless propagandizing by corporate media that the United States is still first world country (of course, in comparison to some other countries, that is true) when it is for many of us functioning like a failed state?  

I get it.  The millionaire and billionaire elites who control everything do not see this, or do not care about this situation, or feel that it benefits them by causing more strife, providing cheaper labor, or importing a fresh group of ""innocents"" to manipulate.  But in reality, the many people I know/see working for Uber and Amazon, with nary a chance of saving a dollar, are sick to the core of this system.  

Moreover, they do not need a bunch of people coming here to compete with them for serfdom jobs in the ""gig"" economy, or to become their overlords by engaging in the parent-pleasing ""look what expensive university I graduated from"" superficiality.

That is really what this whole ""experiment"" has evolved into, and there is not a single voice among the nation's elites who will do anything about it."

2020-02-10 20:55:05,The way China is handling the coronavirus reminds me a bit of the way the current US administration recently handled the TBI cases among military service members in Iraq.  Another preview of what authoritarian power structures can do to people.  We might want to pay attention.
2020-02-10 20:57:09,"The corona virus has led to falling demand for oil, which strengthens Vladimir Putin's hand as he seeks to corner the petroleum market.  As the newly designated head of OPEC, or ""ROPEC"" as we should now call it, Putin is in a perfect position to destroy the U.S. fracking industry with the help of his admirer and ally Donald Trump.  Once the nascent U.S. oil export business is shut down, Putin will have a free hand to alienate the U.S. from its allies and exacerbate tensions with China.  Putin will make Venezuela another Cuba. He already controls the Middle East, including Libya and is building alliances in West Africa.  During the Cold War, Russia created a Mutually Assured Destruction System called ""The Dead Hand.""

Graves dating to 1338–1339 in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic.  In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China.  Epidemics that may have included the plague killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the fifteen years before it reached Constantinople in 1347.   At recently as 1855–1859 the third Yersinia pestis plague pandemic started in China, spreading to all inhabited continents and killing 10 million people in India alone.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death</a>"

One thing we can be certain of is that this won't be the last. Preparing for the next one might be a good idea."
2020-02-10 21:22:20,"Many foolish comments which display a myopic political zeitgeist about a biological process which does not respect geo-political boundaries.  

Mature sober reflection is indicated.  If the pathogen has evolved to infect hosts via  an influenza type vector (i.e. breathing aerosolized viral loads into the lungs) and the pathogen kills upwards of 2 to 3 percent of those infected who have acute clinical symptoms, even only 1/3 of the American population becomes infected, that is roughly 100 million people and if only 20% of the cases become acute and require hospitalization or breathing treatments and antiviral combo therapy, then that is 20 million inpatient confinement.  If 2 to 3 % of all cases progress to respiration cessastion over 3 to 14 days post infection then that is possibly 2 to 3 million deaths.  The pathogen is particularly lethal to those with compromised immune systems and comorbitites such that the death toll among children, the sick and the elderly (over 50 in this case) could be staggering and create many orphans and widows.    Let me be blunt, we have not seen such a potentially lethal pandemic since Spanish Influenza in 1919-1920 which wiped out families and villages in days or weeks in the US.  What is coming this way is not pretty and not containable.  No it is not Soviet genetically strains of Anthrax. Marburg, Ebola and Small Pox, but make no mistake, the damage to the economy and the social and political fabric of American will be long lasting."
2020-02-10 21:38:16,"The lessons learned from this viral outbreak is that no nation should ever become economically, financially, strategically, dependent upon china. Nor for any manufacturing and industrial goods, services and technologies from China. 
China handled the crisis first and foremost as  a grave threat to the political well being of the government, the Chinese Communists.   There was no concern at. any level for the wellbeing of Chinese citizens.  
China prizes the image of the Communist Party above the health of the nation.  The first thing that Chinese authorities did when warned about the virus was to arrest the doctor who posted the warnings, interrogate him, demean him and compel him to sign documents swearing he will not do it agin.  That good doctor has died and the people of China are outraged an ashamed. The government of course censored everything and tried to keep details of spread of the virus a state secret and even downplayed the death of the doctor.  
No matter what trade or other agreements we have with China they must be assessed in the reality of the world that the Chinese officials have created.  China will defend it's government no matter what the cost. Thousands critically ill and hundreds dying mean nothing.
Four members of the Peoples Republic Army were indicted today for theft from Equifax of the personal data of more than 145 million Americans. 
Let's begin to end relationships of every kind with China. The next virus may be deliberately targeted at the U.S."

In all likelihood, this President will not survive politically what is coming this way.  All war games of biological weapons attacks usually end with failed containment and mass casualties which disrupt economies and supply chains (food stuffs) on which the continuity of urbanized civil society is dependent. 

Those GOP senators who voted to acquit have spared their President only temporarily from the judgment of history and his date with a dark destiny.  Unlike the Spanish Influenza epidemic of 1919-20, there will be no tolerance by the citizenry for the loss of so many lives and the untold damage it will cause.  A 2% to 3% mortality rate would be staggering if even only 1/3 of our 325 million citizens became infected.  The political consequence will be seismic and immediate a the science deniers and healthcare haters in the GOP are tarred and feathered.

So calm yourself, understand that there are risks beyond our control, and others within our control. Know the difference as accurately as you can, and then take sensible action in regard to the latter. Wash your hands. Avoid large groups. Understand that with this virus, no-symtom contact can still be infectious contact, and do what you can to limit it should the larger picture indicate a potential risk in your area. 

As to those risks we cannot control, there will always be those.
Asteroids, earthquakes, lions and tigers and bears, oh my. Don't go down that road. Every healthy day is a good day. Cherish it, make it brighter with your presence. Understand that we are all of us on borrowed time, and so it is a gift to be alive, here and now.

The second season of the 1918 pandemic was worse.
Were the folks who got it early gladly inoculated against the later, more lethal strain? Like when folks exposed their kids to chicken-pox to have them go through it at a time of life less risky for complications?

We also need to take this chance to see this crisis as a wake-up call to rethink how we can build a healthier and more sustainable global economy  without this kind of risk, man-made or natural, that potentially could have caused the collapsing or at least paralyzing of the world economy for a long time to come."

2020-02-10 22:46:00,"The bulk of cases are in Wuhan. The rest of China does not have as many cases. The problem with this level of quarantine is that it can often be more deleterious to society than the disease. The disease kills by an immune system being under vigilant initially and then hyper vigilant. We should not let the world economy suffer the same fate. 

Schools in areas with cases should remained closed. Public gatherings limited, and face masks should be mandatory at factories and offices.  People one degree of separation from people known to be infected should self-quarantine. Hot spots should quarantine to slow the epidemic."

Not buying things from other countries probably also means not selling anything to other countries.  No.  Better than trying to make sure that the US grows, manufactures, consumes--and cleans up--everything it wants, we should try harder to be part of the world."
2020-02-10 20:44:44,"I work in world trade ( air cargo) and I can tell you there is close to panic at what could happen if China becomes essentially closed for business. In the short run I already see charters popping up for auto parts, but these should be on a ship not an airplane, this is only done when a factory is running out of a critical part and will shut down without it. This is a short term solution to bridge the gap so to speak. This could get really ugly for the whole world not just China. I know it might be hard for some Americans to understand but pretty much anything manufactured in our country has components from elsewhere. And there are no winners in a pandemic whatever Wilbur Ross thinks."

The problem being that its governmental systems and much of its other support systems remain in feudal times.  Under stress there appears to be very little difference between Xi's government and the Emperor & Mandarins of past dynasties.  Xi's people seem to be just as unwilling to take any risks or to engage in creative thinking as their counterparts of 2,000 years ago.  A Chinese economy would never produce an Apple or a Tesla, or a NASA, too much risk to the Mandarin if something went wrong, the Emperor might lose face.

There are many reports of the outbreak of dangerous virus among animals, most recently pigs, in China which forces the culling of large herds of animals. This is why the West has a prohibition for the import of any animals, fowl, etc. from China. The science of the transfer of virus from animals to humans has been proved.

The current President's health is increasingly worrisome with particular emphasis on his mental health, possible drug use, slurred speech and free-association patterns in his public appearances.

The more silent carriers there are, the lower the proportion of fatalities.  Also, Wuhan was not alerted on time to the dangers of this outbreak whereas the rest of the world is vigilant so the number of infected will most likely never reach the number of people infected in Wuhan."

Communist and theological dictators are totally unfit for it. Rise of China under this more secretive and brutal Communist party is now a global threat.

On the plus side.  China determined a change was needed to medical coverage - with the result that a much larger share of the population now has health coverage as well as lower expected co-pays.  China also improved processes for collecting and sharing data across the three segments responsible for providing healthcare (military, local authorities and centralized government).

Still needed:

* close the popular “wet markets” where small scale virus jumps like this happen frequently- with very few getting traction

* change incentives for municipalities that lead them to discount growing epidemics (see happens a lot above) - instead it remains a crime to fear monger

* change the (current) low standing of the (pretty solid) public health agency in the national bureaucracy pecking order

* improve coordination (beyond data gathering) across the three primary providers of healthcare.

So there is China’s “to do” list.  As in the US, reworking political structures is easier said than done.

Instead they are falling back on political firmness and broad sweeping steps that may address the problem but not efficiently - in terms of economic and human cost.

2020-02-11 01:25:59,"This piece is not only a fear-mongering misrepresentation of the situation; it’s racist too. Sure, the rate of infection and death thereof is alarming, but remember that this virus is new, and not nearly (so far as we know) as infectious as other diseases which have plagued mankind for ages.

Comparing a modern country with vast resources and power in a global economy to Europe in the Middle Ages is insulting. Per the insinuation, 40% of Europeans died in the 14th Century bubonic plague to which this article alludes, with deaths higher in some regions and lower in others. This will not be the case for the new virus, and sensationalizing what’s happening is irresponsible and ingenuous. The people at greatest risk right now - Chinese people near the epicenter - deserve all the respect we have, along with those who have died, even if their deaths are the result of government incompetence.

China today is not analogous to Middle Age Europe. It is not just racist, but dangerous to think otherwise. People are people and we should treat all of them as such. Instead of diminishing an entire nation of people to something we in the “West” are so proud to have clawed ourselves out of, why don’t we acknowledge that these are people who are just as smart and worthy as us, that they are suffering at the hands of a cruel disease which could have taken hold anywhere, and that they deserve all the assistance we can give despite the autocracy under which they live?"

If they continue to maintain a strict quarantine, their supply chains will start to fail.  Either way, they risk structural and/or political collapse. 

If the situation isn’t brought under control, the rest of the world could get pulled down with China as we depend on Chinese-made parts and raw materials.

China will need to thread this needle very carefully--opening up commerce as much as possible while keeping in place a quarantine where warranted.

Frankly, if such a novel illness appeared in a U.S. city, I don’t think we’d do much better than the Chinese. It would be harder for us to establish a quarantine—our states make independent decisions and might reject federal guidelines—and many Americans are used to working when they are sick."

A British national, who has not been named, may have unwittingly spread the virus to at least 11 people in the course of his travels from Singapore to France to Switzerland to England, according to public health authorities and accounts in the British media. Infected Britons in England, France and Spain likely caught the virus from him.

This came home to me this week, when I learned that a medication on which I depend for my health and safety is now on back-order and won't be available for a month ... because it is manufactured in China. After much scrambling, my doctor has prescribed a less effective substitute.

I'm no protectionist, but we have lost our way when we cannot even provide our own citizens with the necessities we used to make so well. We have forced many of them into unemployment in order to ship products halfway around the world, pointlessly burning oil and polluting the oceans in the process.

Such markets are mostly to be found in the hinterlands, among the “countryside people,” as the citizens of the more developed cities such as Shanghai and Beijing tend to contemptuously refer to them. In the thirteen years I have lived here, I have never seen the populace more openly vocal in their condemnation of the set of affairs that set this crisis in motion, and of how the government fumbled in dealing with it at the start.

It should not go unmentioned that besides being a major producer, China is now a major consumer of goods and services from throughout the world.  Idled Chinese workers with lost wages will soon hunker down thus depressing demand.

Despite the hubris of the leadership in both China and the US -- we are likely to soon find we are all in this together.  Not only will the contagion of the actual disease spread throughout the world.  The coincident decline in economic activity will do so also.

Consequently, there is no comparison between the two. I will start to worry when the death count reaches 1 million plus and about at least 1 billion people have been infected by it. Until then, this is just a small problem for China to handle internally where they have the most infected and the rest of the world needs to ensure Chinese folks travel is highly monitored or even restricted.

In re all the manufacturing being done in China, I ask WHY? Why would anyone in their right mind have a single point of failure. I think the companies who have ALL their eggs in one basket deserve to suffer. Perhaps this is a wake up call for everyone to diversify."

Therefore, it stands to reason that China and rest of the world put a permanent ban on the trade in wildlife as one measure to control the spread of coronavirus.

Its China's demand for wildlife products, for traditional medicine, or as exotic foods, is driving a global trade in endangered species.

When will the Chinese authorities wake up and ban these appalling practices once and for all? Supposedly it should be easy, given Xi Jin Ping's total authority.

And why timed just in the middle of the traditional winter flu season when coughing and sneezing people normally catching it, are instead seen as potentially contagious with the coronavirus and all in all creating a vicious circle of terror and panic?

2020-02-11 20:25:09,"I have long been troubled by our top companies shipping their production overseas.  They saved money, to be sure -- but by using countries where worker benefits, including wages, are controlled by autocratic regimes and set as low as necessary to get the business.  In essence, we have been supporting dictatorship exploitation of their people to make a buck, even when that creates such dependence and destroys our domestic capability.  

Apple is the worst offender.  I would delight in seeing this grossly overvalued and obscenely powerful company go down the tubes.  

Now Ford, GM , others may rethink their strategy.  Or have a Congress not bought and paid for demand repatriation.  Fat chance of that, so only the prospect of going bankrupt without products to sell will force others to use sanity over greed as the prime motivation behind their decisions.

There is a push-pull relationship emerging here, as it always does in the case of authoritarian regimes. The more difficult the actual situation, the more the authorities have to suppress actual information. In the end, unless someone comes up with a quick and accurate means of diagnosis and a corresponding means of treatment, Xi Jinping will have to wait and hope - like his countrymen, although he certainly is much better armed."

2020-02-08 21:38:53,"Xi needs to go to Wuhan and see the disaster his dictatorship has wrought. He should visit the grieving relatives of Dr. Wenliang and beg the country for forgiveness for his death. Then he should vow to allow the free speech his constitution promises. Otherwise, one can only hope that his cowering reveals to the country what kind of wimp they have at the helm."
2020-02-08 22:38:54,"Two variables - Chinese reluctance to not pass upwards bad news, and very large population centres - is not going to change anytime soon. But one typical feature of zoonotic virus ignition that could be permanently fixed is to permanently end the trade in exotic animals. If this, as well as major improvements in mass farming of domesticated animals is addressed, then a piece of the pandemic puzzle could be fixed.

Forgetting every other metric; how many trillions of dollars globally could NCoV-2019 end up costing? Which leads to the obvious question of whether allowing the resumption of trade in exotic animals worth that risk? 

Is the global community prepared to tell China (and other countries where it's rampant) that it's not ok?"
2020-02-08 22:18:38,"I am curious why media outlets report the numbers of infections and deaths as fact. At best, they require the qualifier “confirmed via testing, which is limited.” And reading between the lines, require scrutiny as to the source, with a qualifier like “cases reported by the Chinese government, but not yet confirmed by international experts.”

I say this because a Chinese MD I know who is working in the US as a post-doc, and who personally knows many of the doctors called into Wuhan to treat patients, has said that these doctors have told him the official infection numbers are extremely underreported. They were estimating more in the ballpark of 100-200K by last week. This would line up better with epidemiological estimates published based on early infection rates, and would better explain Xi’s heavy-handed lockdowns etc. It does not seem plausible that he would tank the economy over the official numbers reported."
2020-02-08 23:02:19,"I've spent a fair amount of time in China over the last 20 years.  There is no shortage of smart and creative people there, just as capable as people anywhere else.  The problem is a political one.  The people have made a grand bargain with the government: keep us fed and relatively happy, and we will put up with authoritarianism and limited rights.  But at some point, folks there will wake up and realize the government is not keeping their part of the bargain. The waking up will happen when enough people realize this.

The lack of a free press is probably the most limiting factor.  Once they get more free speech and press, it will just be a matter of time before people start taking control of their own lives.  This health crisis may not be the tipping point, but it will be a step along the way."
2020-02-09 00:06:49,"Mr. Xi is fortunate that the Chinese proletariat are not interested in freedom.   As long as their lives improve modestly - not by Western standards, he has nothing to worry about.   However,  the odds of a prolonged quarantine until late spring are high.  This will hit people's wallets hard especially privately owned factories.   The shutdown of factories will intensify the push for manufacturing outside of China.  Xi will be left with few a options - devalue currency and a large-scale bail out."

2020-02-08 23:20:02,"Despite the outcry about spreading rumor and misinformation, it has become obvious that the actual objective is to discourage the dissemination of facts and the truth. Ultimately any hope of actually facing the realities inherent in a pandemic starts with providing timely, accurate information to every individual and all nations. The most destabilizing approach is to hide the facts and then to be exposed as corrupt and/or incompetent. The facts indicate the Wuhan Coronavirus is a novel pathogen for which there is no pre-established ""herd"" immunity. There are no human beings with antigens to resist infection. The opportunity to limit this epidemic was lost by the self-serving decisions made by the Chinese Communist Party in December, when the first few cases could have been isolated. The extraordinary quarantines now imposed throughout China & the dramatic near cessation of economic activity makes the Wuhan Coronavirus an event unprecedented in modern times. As the virus inevitably spreads through the slums of India, Africa and the refugee camps of the Middle east, there will be no hope of prevemting global transmission. It is now probable that a majority of earth's population will be infected over the next 2-3 years. Total fatalities will depend on the evolution of the virus, effective efforts to slow transmission by limiting travel & the rapid development of a vaccine. That's not racism, it's simple biology. The best achievable outcome depends on recognizing these realities."

People are expected to be back to work next week.  How many will report to their designated factory is an open question.  The global economy is now, at the least, two to three weeks into a supply chain disruption.  It will take only a couple more for the disruption to begin impacting the Global consumer.

It looks to me that the Chinese Government decided to sacrifice the City of Wuhan to save the rest of the country. Xi invoked a Mao phrase. Mao did not have any hesitation in sacrificing millions in his view for a greater good. 
The only lesson we will learn from China is how not to manage a serious outbreak."
2020-02-09 02:23:56,Mao's stepping back from the Cultural Revolution was not a move of strong leadership but of a witnessing the colossal failure of his messianic persona.  Deng at Tiananmen Square showed a vicious side of him which ruined his international reputation.  Xi doesn't like to deal with situations that cannot be managed by simply intimidating the opposition to his leadership.  The coronavirus cannot be defeated with political repression.
2020-02-09 02:31:03,"This got to be a venerable Communist tradition: think of Stalin who disappeared from public view right after the Germans attacked the Soviet Union in 1941 (a disaster for which he was criminally unprepared because he'd refused to heed multiple intelligence reports warning him of the impending attack). He blamed (and executed) many of his his generals for the initial defeats of the Red Army. Of course, when the tide eventually turned and the Russians won the war, Uncle Joe took all the credit for the victory. Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose, indeed."
2020-02-09 03:10:07,"Not in any way to diminish the suffering from and impact of the Wuhan coronavirus, but let's keep a little perspective. The C.D.C. estimates that up to 42.9 million people got sick during the 2018-2019 flu season, 647,000 people were hospitalized and 61,200 died. In the current season, half over, it is estimated there have been at least 22 million flu illnesses, 210,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 deaths from flu.

While we appropriately pay serious attention to the evolution of Wuhan coronavirus, let us not let it cloud out the ongoing risks from flu and the need to act accordingly. If quarantining cities in China, cruise ships, and others is sensible and legitimate, maybe we should consider the same for anti-vaxxers here in America.

As with the 40,000 annual deaths in vehicle crashes, the flu is not a ""sexy"" news story, so does not get nearly the coverage deserved. On the other hand, the Wuhan coronavirus, makes for excellent clickbait. That is not to deny the legitimate stories, many hooked to the unknown elements. Novelty and the unknown get attention, until what was once novel becomes the new normal. That's human nature. Think of suicide bombers. In the mid 2000s when they started happening as more than a rare ""curiosity"", each had huge news coverage, complete with psychological ""analyses"", biographies, detailed descriptions, etc. Now when there is a suicide bombing, it is simply covered as any other bombing, ""suicide"" simply being consigned to being an adjective."
2020-02-09 03:17:54,"If the coronavirus outbreak had started in Canada, the PM would have already apologized to the whole world. Xi has no decency to at least say something to the world community -- acknowledge the outbreak like a gentleman, be humble and ask for help and cooperation from everyone."
2020-02-09 04:11:10,"It’s not easy!  
Technology and economic growth is one thing, but changing one’s culture?  That’s something different.  

Ask America about its guns.  How many more gun related deaths were there in America than in other developed countries?  More than the coronavirus?  If the world would balance individual liberty and community interests as vociferously as it responds to a pandemic, we wouldn’t  be in a situation of needing to shut down economic activity and causing global trade disruptions."
2020-02-09 04:54:46,"If one takes a look at the official figures released each day, one will find that the mortality rate is always around 2%.  Always. Every day. Talk about having it under control!

On Feb 1 at 23:39, the CCP accidentally leaked these figures online: 154,023 confirmed cases, 24,589 deaths.  Putting the mortality rate closer to 16%.  These figures have since been deleted.  Was it a mistake or were they real?  Who knows."
2020-02-09 05:05:58,"One thing that gives some indication of the chaos now ensues in China is this: local police forces of different jurisdictions/provinces are robbing each other's face mask supplies like highwaymen.  

Drove of police cars would surround an armored truck carrying 300,000 face masks and wouldn't let it pass until they leave behind 200,000.  These things are so prolific that the central government ordered them to stop.  None obeyed. 

How will this turn out?  Who knows.  A truce was declared recently calling a stop to these activities.  But if supplies and confidence level continue to dwindle, it's every man for himself."
2020-02-09 05:12:24,"The case fatality data is limited and known to be incorrect. Because the epidemic is in the growth phase it is incorrect to calculate the fatality rate from current fatalities divided by current case counts. Fatalities lag case confirmation by about 2 weeks on average. So to correct for case count growth the correct calculation is to divide current fatalities by cases 2 weeks prior. That gives a much higher number, in between SARS and MERS."
2020-02-09 06:29:02,"Any hint, however light, that Xi may have his power diminished if the outbreak becomes out of control, if it is not considered as such now, will proved to be wrong.  Personally, I have infinite faith that those on top there will remain on top.

Instead, the Xi Jinping led authoritarian regime in China resorted to a massive cover up effort to hide the truth,even silencing the Whistle-blower doctor by allegedly shooting him dead,or resorting to a sort of loyalty test to categorise friends and foes in the international arena.

It's also disturbing that US media sources aren't being more transparent with reporting the fumigating taking place in the streets, suspected coronavirus patients being locked in their apartments and the severity of police patrols, mask enforcement, overwhelmed cremation centers, etc. 

If they're trying to contain a mass panic in the US, they're doing well. It's astonishing how every other day the general population feels so removed from ""the other side of the world"" until a virus kicks in and suddenly they're perceived as neighbors."

It is their oxygen and they believe they will stop existing without it. (Btw, most people in the world including small children and old women are more secure than these men are, and have no need for armies or weapons in order to feel safe. ) 

Unfortunately, ""strongman"" tactics only work well for situations like killing citizens, detaining them in camps, and torturing and disposing of dissidents by dismembering them. 

""Strongman"" tactics do exactly zilch in the face of viruses. This is why Xi and his friends will fail, resulting in many deaths. This is our world, yet we have allowed a handful of small, scared men to ruin it and kill untold numbers through their cowardice, greed and hate.

Alas, it is unlikely. Being a product of the Cultural Revolution, Xi learned self-preservation, in every sense, is the first principle. He would continue to rule with an iron fist from a distance, using every excuse to purge his potential rivals and suppress any dissent. That makes him a small man in the Chinese annals"

That painful era never examined.  Will Xi, following in his footsteps, get off with impunity as well ?  As a Chinese born person, I often wonder if it is within the Chinese nature to tolerate authoritarian rule, or is it the  manipulative strength of this system that makes it so enduring?

Incidentally, Wuhan was the site of the October 10, 1911 uprising that sparked the Sun-Yat-Sen led revolution overthrowing four thousand years of dynastic rule in China.   Sun’s last words on his death bed were, ‘the Revolution has not been completely successful; Comrades, we need to put in more effort’."

2020-02-09 14:10:25,"If art reflected life, then just as the microbes put an end to the world domination of the Martian invaders in HG Wells’ “War of the Worlds”, this flu just might derail Xi’s pretensions to the title of dictator for life. 

What specific incident suffices to stir a population to general resistance generally becomes clear only after the fact. The perceived failure to put the people’s health ahead of the ruling party’s prestige might damage the trust and confidence in government that even autocrats rely on to stay in power. 

So, it is hard to see at this early juncture if this health care debacle is the first chapter leading to popular unrest that forces change or merely a temporary manifestation of unease before the status quo is restored."
2020-02-09 06:06:21,"Not in any way to diminish the suffering from and impact of the Wuhan coronavirus, but let's keep a little perspective. The C.D.C. estimates that up to 42.9 million people got sick during the 2018-2019 flu season, 647,000 people were hospitalized and 61,200 died. In the current season, half over, it is estimated there have been at least 22 million flu illnesses, 210,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 deaths from flu.

While we appropriately pay serious attention to the evolution of Wuhan coronavirus, let us not let it cloud out the ongoing risks from flu and the need to act accordingly. If quarantining cities in China, cruise ships, and others is sensible and legitimate, maybe we should consider the same for anti-vaxxers here in America.

As with the 40,000 annual deaths in vehicle crashes, the flu is not a ""sexy"" news story, so does not get nearly the coverage deserved. On the other hand, the Wuhan coronavirus, makes for excellent clickbait. That is not to deny the legitimate stories, many hooked to the unknown elements. Novelty and the unknown get attention, until what was once novel becomes the new normal. That's human nature. Think of suicide bombers. In the mid 2000s when they started happening as more than a rare ""curiosity"", each had huge news coverage, complete with psychological ""analyses"", biographies, detailed descriptions, etc. Now when there is a suicide bombing, it is simply covered as is any other bombing, ""suicide"" simply being consigned to being an adjective."
2020-02-09 13:28:12,"Xi Jinping is thinking ahead of the current crisis.  

Every crisis presents an opportunity.  Mr. Xi will not waste this opportunity to reform the government after this health crisis in efficiency, transparency, and responsiveness.  Mr. Xi is thinking ahead on how to handle the coming 2nd round of trade talk with us.  Mr. Xi is pondering how to improve the relationship with EU.  And Mr. Xi is dead serious about social harmony and ""no poor people left behind in a rising economy.""

President Xi is the leader of China in charge of everything.  And Premier Li is the government leader in charge of administrative affair including health and environment.  Mr. Li gets his hands dirty just like his famous predecessor Premier Wen, who often visited disastrous areas in times of crisis."
2020-02-09 13:50:44,"CDC is offering a team to 'observe and help if possible'? Frankly, if  was the head honcho of Chinese public health, I'd be saying 'thanks but no thanks' too. Particularly since Americans seem to believe that Chinese science is back somewhere in the Middle Ages.

How about the US pitches in and supports the WHO - which many other countries are already doing? The UK has so far seconded a fifty strong team of microbiologists, infectious disease specialists and epidemiologists. Plus $10 million cash. It's a start. Better than moaning on the sidelines."
2020-02-09 05:33:38,"I think about all the ""medical generals"" issuing orders from a high, safe distance, and then I think about the people quarantined in windowless cabins below decks on cruise ships.  The generals breathe fresh air and the quarantined aboard ships breathe the poisonous recirculated air shared with the sick and dying.

There is a lesson for all of us in this:  Don't get sick.  Who knows what innovations they may come up with to protect themselves."
2020-02-09 08:02:25,"Nowhere am I able to find an answer to why both SARS and Coronavirus viral outbreaks in humans, have originated in China. There are more primitive, less hygienic counties in Africa and Asia with less sophisticated medical facilities. What is it about China that has caused these two viral outbreaks to jump across from animals to humans in that part of the world?"
2020-02-09 12:19:02,"Soon, we too will have such a wonder system to operate under when the Democrats nominate a Bernie Sanders, or Elizabeth Warren and or Michael Bloomberg.

I can't wait to see who wins!"
2020-02-09 12:27:39,"China under an authoritarian government hamstrings it’s national problem solving ability by severely restricting freedom of speech and to some extent thought. The nation has a lot of minds that, given increased freedom of expression, can make China far more innovative and responsive to their society and empire in times of competition as well as emergency. Their government’s repression of speech and micro management made the response to the spread of the virus ineffective."
2020-02-09 13:26:09,"As we watch the administration dismantle government agencies created to foster health & safety,  America behold your future.  Corrections please if I am uninformed, but it doesn’t appear China has many regulations and that’s where these plagues always seem to begin.  (Remember all that poison dog food China dumped on our market?) 
 
Let’s hope all those who gleefully & greedily drive the movement to destroy the buffer that safety measures provide will face up to the life-altering consequences before it is too late."
2020-02-09 14:28:00,"""Dear leader"" Xi may has not only receded into the shadows but it is clear he is determined to keep the rest of the world in the dark. His refusal to accept president Trumps offer of CDC virologists means that there will be no quick end to the hysteria now gripping his nation or how many are at risk. No one yet knows the source of the virus, how it is transmitted, its incubation period or how virulent it is. 

What we do know is that government officials quashed the warning issued by Dr. Li Wenlian, someone brave enough to step into the light with a stark warning that has proven prophetic. It's also proof that China has learned nothing from the SARS epidemic it foisted on the world nearly 20 years ago. Worse, there is no reason to believe that something worse won't emerge in the future.

Perhaps worries of coronavirus becoming a pandemic are unfounded but its adverse impact on the world are no less worrisome. China is a major supplier of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment to the US. What happens when those factories are forced to shut down?"
2020-02-09 14:28:26,"The situation in China has become so severe and out of control mainly because of the initial suppression of the real danger it poses by the government.

All dictatorial countries have the tendency to suppress bad news. Chernobyl, SARS and now Corona virus. This shows the value of a free press and the need for complete transparency on the part of the government to contain and handle such catastrophe. 

When we call news media as fake news and treat press as the enemy of the people can we be reassured that such efforts of suppression cannot happen here?"
2020-02-09 13:23:53,"This article typifies the double standard being applied to this possible ""pandemic"".  The undercurrent is that the ""type of government"" that is China is not equipped to handle the crisis because it is not Western, or not the United States.

How ironic, because trump wants the US to be more like China in the type of governmental system.....regulated to the point of controlling everything, but subverting the population by not being able to manage because the resources are being applied elsewhere.

The unspoken truth is that China has too many people and does not care that there is a culling of the herd... after all, the norovirus is not cancer, which is possibly the last frontier of saving lives as a domestic policy."
2020-02-09 05:42:47,"Remember the good old days when it took more than angry Tweets for the NYT to begin coverage like this?  

Goodness knows, I'm no fan of authoritarian regimes and especially the direction so many countries are taking, including our GOP, but perhaps we should see how other countries do before condemning China's efforts and Xi's leadership.  They are buying us precious time and we seem to squandering it."
2020-02-09 09:59:03,China is a thousands of years of old civilization and their people and leaders may act and handle  things in their own way. If their leader is not visible in the public but is providing resources and supplies I think that should be more than enough and it is the Eastern way doing things.
2020-02-09 03:00:25,"So I am reading this article about President Xi, China, and the coronavirus and I am thinking:

If President Xi Jinping is having trouble managing the coronavirus spread in China--with plenty of rumors that the epidemic is being underestimated by the Chinese government--imagine how safe we can feel when the virus fully hits the U.S. 

As I see it, in the U.S, a perfect storm is brewing:

First, we have the politically inexperienced, willfully ignorant, incompetent President Trump at the helm, who more often lies than tells the truth, has demonized science and evidence, blames others and takes no responsibility when things go wrong, and basically, has no idea what he is doing as president and really doesn't care.

Second, Trump is slavishly backed up and reinforced, no matter what he does, by the Republican Party and mighty Fox News that turns a blind eye to Trump's failings and destructive impulses, and refuses to let Trump be held accountable, no matter the damage done.

Third, let's not forget the individualistic, libertarian, rebellious American people.  How will they behave when ordered to be quarantined?  Especially if they are truly sick with the coronavirus.  How much will they care about infecting other people?  Or might they be so worried in our have versus have-not society that they don't have enough money to make ends meet and/or may be fired at their jobs, so they go to work anyway, no matter how sick & the consequences?

What is the answer Republicans?  Pray?"
2020-02-09 05:07:51,If anything positive can come from this peehaps it's Xi's downfall and greater freedom of speech.
2020-02-09 06:24:24,A no-show during a humanitarian crisis of this scale shows what an out-of-touch leader Xi is.
2020-02-09 12:53:12,"Despots usually hide from truths, why would he be any different?"
2020-02-09 13:28:16,"If you look at China objectively, and not through Trumpian eyes, Xi has been a miraculous leader for China.  As Americans, we love to point fingers at China over concerns ranging from free speech to their authoritarian government in general, while half our population rapidly supports President Trump, who has created a faux reality in America simply to enable his political career.  Which is worse, Xi or Trump.  I say Trump.  The coronavirus is a very serious situation that could happen anywhere.  Certainly, if it happened in the U.S. to the extent it's affecting China, Trump would still be out playing golf.  Economically, China - a wonderful trading partner for the U.S. -  has been slandered for ""stealing"" American technology (they haven't, it was handed over voluntarily), stealing American jobs (complete nonsense, American businesses gleefully moved jobs to China) and stealing American money (a reference to the trade deficit, as though it's China's fault we have such high demand for their products).  In reality, China plays a large role in providing products that drive our economy.  Xi has had to endure our idiot president for over 3 years now, plus the demands of a nation of over 1 billion people, protesters in Hong Kong (that's died down) and now the coronavirus.  While I don't support authoritarian rule, it's hard to criticize it when we have the same thing here in our (once) great democracy."
2020-02-09 13:48:05,"Chinese government-controlled media blame “foreign entities” for publicizing the public health efforts, arrest and death of the physician.

President Trump gave his word that the Chinese tell the truth.

Once trust is breached many times, it is difficult to restore once."
2020-02-09 02:55:43,Dr. Li Wenliang is a hero. He has a pregnant wife and was going to have another child in the summer.  He is  real hero for what he has done.  What about his wife and child? Where are they?  Should we be starting GoFund Me campagne to help the family of a man who died because he spoke the truth?
2020-02-09 04:44:58,"Looks like the beginning of the end for Xi and probably the Chinese Communist Party. You can't fool all of the people all of the time. Of course, the Chinese people aren't fooled. Neither is the rest of the world."
2020-02-09 04:27:14,"With all the knowledge gained from SARS epidemic 17 years ago it is shocking that trade in live wild animals hasn't been prohibited in China. SARS jumped from civets to humans, and live civets were also traded in Wuhan. A country that incarcerates and monitors millions should be capable of clamping down on this abomination and debunk the superstitions of positive health effects related to eating these poor animals, also including pangolins, rhinos and sharks. We should pray to god that the virus won't make it to Africa or India."
2020-02-09 06:07:14,Three private flights from China arrived in NZ in last ten days according to the NZ herald newspaper. And no one seems to know who was on the flights. Maybe President Xi was on one of them. Just  a thought.
2020-02-09 07:31:46,"He is the supreme leader and also an elderly pensioner; there is no cure for this virus; contagious viruses don't discriminate; doesn't matter how rich or powerful you are - a contagious virus doesn't know the difference between rich and poor, power or poverty;  and will kill whomever is in its path. All humans are vulnerable to contagious viruses."
2020-02-09 03:05:14,"Quite possibly he is a man living in a sealed bubble. Fearing his enemies might use the virus to attack him.
  A nation led by a mad man might see this as an opportunity for regime change world wide. A way to deal with enemies.
  Of course it could happen to his regime as well."
2020-02-09 04:33:27,"Reading the early paragraphs of this article, my focus was drawn to what seems a secondary point in the discussion of internal CCP political sensitivity.  A couple of phrases, ""the June 4th incident of 1989"" and referring to the ""armed crackdown"" on Tiananmen Square. My assumption is that Mr. Buckley and Mr. Myers risk revocation of their visas or the loss of access to Chinese authorities, if they were to write in plain English about the slaughter of hundreds (probably thousands) of citizens at the afore-mentioned Tiananmen Square, on June 4th & 5th, 1989. This oblique reference to that horrific massacre of innocents must delight the bloody hierarchy in Beijing. By slithering through the concealment created by adapting the CCP's preferred phraseology, the writer's can protect their professional advantages & continue their assignments while  insuring that the heroes that died in hopes of a Chinese democracy will sooner be erased from that society's political memory. This is a terrific illustration of the mutual corruption demanded by the Xi regime as a condition of continued commerce. This unchallenged substitution of bland euphemism for the unflinching truth creates the oxygen that Xi, Trump & Putin need to thrive. These corrupt compromises have metastasized throughout ""journalism"" & have become standard practice in American political commentary. This is the same toxin produced by the Wuhan nCoronavirus. It fills the abcess destroying our democracy."

And it is tragic that the Chinese worker have been used by international corporations as slave labor .

General Secretary Xi is having a rough second term. Five bucks says he'll opt for early retirement before his enemies in the Communist Party retire him themselves.

It's discouraging to see how many commenters use this story to slam Trump. He's likely the most offensive President we've ever had, but trying to liken him to China's communists only shows how little most of us know about that malign regime. 
.
Another five bucks says most of us had never heard of Wuhan before last month, despite the fact that its population is larger than NYC's. That's how much most of us know about China.

It's time for Americans to start understanding what's coming at us from Beijing. When Xi goes, there are 100 more just like him to take over. And they all want to bury us."
2020-02-09 07:54:58,"Emperor Xi, having decreed from on high that his underlings stop the virus in its tracks, now sits majestically on his throne in the cordoned-off Forbidden City, safe from infection and in a perfect position to blame those underlings for failure.

He's hoping that the Chinese people won't conclude that failure to stop the epidemic means that Heaven has withdrawn its mandate for his rule.

So it's been in China for more than two thousand years."
2020-02-09 14:34:44,"China, and many other parts of the world, are acting as though it’s better for their economy and stock markets  - if the entire city of Wuhan were to be killed off by this virus rather than tell the truth or help these people. If China really cared about its people in Wuhan - then they would have allowed the international community to help with this virus weeks ago. WHO has been praising China over and over, could that be because of the mass amounts of funding they just received by China, rather than helping these people. Praising a country where they are now physically throwing people in quarantines / camps, which the new study shows almost half of the original infected people were indeed infected at the hospitals. Sounds like the WHO also only cares about money, and these people now in quarantines will most likely be infected in these quarantines like the hospitals.

These quarantines will be proven later as the reason the disease spread to so many people and so fast. These are quarantines but more like jails that will kill you with a virus. Are American hospitals prepared for this? I noticed none of the hospitals are being named in America where the Wuhan patient’s are being tested or monitored. We are already starting to censor our news about this disease as well."
2020-02-09 11:38:02,"Some years ago I attended a lecture by the photographer Edward Burtynsky -  who drove across China with a crew to photographic China for a book.  (""China"" was published by Steidl in 2005.)

Someone in the audience asked Burtynsky if anything shocked him about China.

Burtynsky answered that he and his crew often drove across China for days without seeing a single bird.  

Pollution has killed much of the bird population of China.

President Xi is hiding because of the Coronavirus.  You'd think he'd be hiding because China has become an economic powerhouse partly because China's leaders are okay with poisoning their citizens by befouling the country's air, soil and water.

Any decent person would be ashamed of having done this."

There biggest fear is outsiders.

Bottom line however is the 1 to 5% upper crust these educated and successful people , I do not see them bailing on the party.  Xi MAY be sacrificed but no way the educated top of the pile plans to upset the system.

Don’t see any signs of a new generation or a challenger to Xi.  Guessing Xi and his pals sacrifice Li and his lieutenants, pronounce a new beginning, universal communication, lock up and even execute a few for “ failing the people”.

The thinking part of the world knew when China shut down a city of millions and allowed no transport in or out of the city that there was a deadly crisis that was already out of control.
This is Chinese version of Chernobyl -- the cover up that will allow many people to be infected and die because the government cannot admit its own failures.

Mr. Xi has made himself alone the face of China. He takes credit for all thats good like Mr. Trump does with the economy, however, when things go wrong they want to be invisible. The coronavirus is having a devastating effect in China at many levels. It is much worse than the government admits. Deaths are much greater than reported. Many more people are effected. It is much more widely effected. It is having a worse effect on an already badly performing economy. Mr. Xi cannot be seen because this is shaking his control over China. Most likely not enough to end his control but very likely to shake it.

Coronavirus is or soon will be a pandemic. It began in China. It has become much worse because of China government lies. This lies on Mr. Xi and he knows it so he has become scarce.

This is the time to keep politics out of this tragedy and have a laser sharp focus on fighting a common global enemy the Wuhan Corona virus (WCV) that can only be observed under an electron microscope. 1) WCV does not discriminate between a Chinese in Wuhan or a 60 year old US citizen in Wuhan. 2) What we have also learned is that the mortality rate so far is 2% and higher in those with a weaker immune system such as those 60 and above and the morbidity rate is a lot higher requiring hospitalization in many cases. China is fast building hospitals at the rate of 1 every 10 days. 3) China does not seem to welcome visits from any WHO or US experts. Makes sense as experts can help very little by going empty handed and without vaccines or FDA approved treatment. 4) US can offer to rapidly provide sanitized ready to eat balanced meal packets and fresh frozen vegetables, fruits and tons of 100% pomegranate juice to the epicenter of WCV with a population of 20 million. Also if there is a shortage of appropriate masks and detergent containing antibacterial soap along which should also have antiviral activity, the US should send them over. 5) As more and more people get infected more and more people could potentially die. 6) there are several unknowns at this time. 1 key unknown is the average time for which a person remains infectious from the time of estimated exposure."

In the 2008 Sichuan earthquake which had killed over 69,000 people then President Hu Jintao sent Premier Wen Jiabao to visit the victims. During the coronavirus outbreak, current President Xi Jinping sent Premier Li Keqiang to Wuhan. Unlike leaders in other countries, Chinese presidents are supposed to stay above it all like emperors of old and they have their premiers to do the PR work. To answer the question, Xi is in Beijing where he's expected to be and is managing the crisis from behind the scene.

I thought Chris Buckley has lived in China at one time and it's obvious he's no fan of the regime. Either he's ignorant of this protocol or playing ignorant to score points. We have a serious crisis going on in China which is also affecting the rest of the world. Since news of the outbreak, we've been inundated with stories after stories from the NYT of despair in Wuhan and what the Communist leadership isn't doing right. Is everything really that bad over there? Is China collapsing and is Xi applying for political asylum in Russia? Is the virus out of control and are we all going to die?

Clearly the police and secret state Xi built has contributed directly to the mayhem in Hubei, now extending worldwide. The first known case was December First 2019. In an open society, this could have led to an early alert... instead, lying about the existence of the epidemic became a state mission in the next 6 weeks. Those not cooperating were punished. Apparently individuals reporting dismal conditions in Hubei healthcare are Xi-disappeared.

Xi said: “Our progress will not be halted by any storms and tempests.” yes, but a pandemic could stop you, dictator. Pericles was judged in Athens, 2,450 years ago, for his mishandling of Athenian society, forcing people to live in a way which caused a devastating epidemic (during a war Pericles partly instigated). 

Xi's model of government, where one brain decides of all, as if it were an emperor from 2,000 years ago, is thoroughly obsolete: it condemns China to be led by one tiny nervous system instead of a great collective mind. Dictatorship of one, advocated by Marx, is fundamentally the antithesis of collectivism, ironically enough.

This total dictator is now hiding from the Coronavirus pandemic that his own practice of the state caused. Xi views the state as a conduit to his power, instead of an intelligent, all-knowing substrate for an all empowered society. That state fascism has proven a danger to the entire world. Out!"

CNN sprinkled these words in their report: ""slipped unnoticed... a bare-bones military plane ... his second visit to a war zone as President after a similar Christmas Eve trip last year to Iraq ... shrouded in secrecy ... Trump golfed as usual on Wednesday ... boarded a military plane at an undisclosed airport ... Trump's plane landed ... in pitch darkness.

Is this merely click bait?  The NY Times and these reporters fail to report real news about the coronavirus. 

From Pharmaceutical Technology - 

The Wuhan Institute of Virology has said that an application has been filed seeking a new patent on Gilead Sciences’ investigational antiviral drug, remdesivir, believed to have the potential to treat the new coronavirus.

Remdesivir, originally developed to treat Ebola, is not licensed or approved anywhere.  However, the drug is being advanced into human clinical trials for coronavirus treatment in China. This comes after the drug showed early signs of effectiveness in coronavirus patients in the US when given with chloroquine, an existing malaria drug.

Chloroquine is marketed in China and can be obtained via independent supply. Meanwhile, remdesivir has intellectual property barriers in the country and a patent application was submitted on 21 January.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology added that the drug ‘will enter major countries around the world through the Patent Cooperation Agreement (PCT) approach’.

In addition, the institute said that it made the patent application to protect the national interest, and will not exercise its rights if foreign companies collaborate with China to fight the coronavirus outbreak."

Effectively taking on the discredited feared cult of personality of Mao Zedong and the Mandate of Heaven of Chinese Emperors to reign and rule until his death.

Xi Jinping can't punch down and blame his underlings for this coronavirus crisis without looking cowardly and weak.

 And by definition since he has no governing political peers he can't force one of his former peers to take charge and risk blame for failure or take credit for success.

Mr. Xi sent the nominal Prime Minister of China Li Keqiang off to Wuhan to show the face of the government. A task that he should have done himself to show command, control and empathy.

But Mr. Xi has apparently cowered and covered in place inside the elite leadership compound near the Forbidden City. Mr. Xi is the princeling son of a Long March legend father who Mao Zedong purged and Deng Xiaoping resurrected.

What ""government handling"" ??!  The realities of ""who said what when"" - in the middle of any such crisis, are almost never recoverable.  My own ""guess""; and it is exactly that, would be that the Wuhan cops called the top medical officials in Wuhan and Hubei and asked what they should do.  It's well established historical fact that panic can cause more harm than the microbes- and in the early stages, we didn't KNOW diddly about what this disease was really going to do.  So the cops on the beat received the un-nuanced message to shut rumors down.  Then acted like cops; trying to do the right thing...

Pointing fingers - and at something so nebulous as ""the government!"" is a feeble-minded reaction.  Both the Chinese social media mouths, and the US press, could do much better.

Ask yourself - exactly what would YOU have done that would - definitely - have been ""better""?  And how many deaths from panic would be ""ok""; and how many deaths from the spread of the virus- by people fleeing - would be acceptable?

“Chen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who had been doing critical reporting from Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the epicenter of the outbreak, went missing on Thursday evening, just as hundreds of thousands of people in China began demanding freedom of speech online.”

Rather, it was to note how we come to accept, at our own peril, threats that become culturally acceptable (e.g. massive vehicular deaths) or the new normal (e.g. suicide bombers.)

Influenza is somewhat in a category of its own, inasmuch as it functions variously as a normal and as a potential threat.  It may kill 30,000 in a ""normal"" year, but it can spiral orders of magnitude, such as the 1918 flu, which killed around 600,000 Americans.

Americans and probably all of humanity are not good at threat assessment. Look at our response to 3,000 killed on 9/11 and compare it to our response to threats that annually kill many more people. In is entirely understandable that the average person fears the unknown threat more than the known threat. However, it is the responsibility of leaders and any media claiming to hold to journalistic standards to put threats in perspective, to shape the narrative and response in a way that serves the people, not to simply pander to human fears nor to minimize actual threats."

Why were there no calls to censure the US? Double standards...

The point is, coronavirus associated deaths is just a part of the story.

Like not completing a course of antibiotic(yes, I know viruses are not susceptible to antibiotics, this is an analogy) because one starts to feel better, the bugs sometimes come back with a vengeance. We have to keep the pressure on. First and foremost, this means a continuation of good hand hygiene practices the world over. It is also critical that we support Wuhan during this critical time. They must be close to the breaking point. If order breaks down there, this will spread like wildfire. We need an international relief effort.

For one thing, US medical, transportation and other infrastructure is a mess. The medical equipment and know-how is the best but the way it is used and delivered is obsolete and inefficient.

Another reason is much simpler: any attempt to forcefully segregate a large population of  really or presumably infected people would result in an outcry by the self-proclaimed 'progressives' and it would take weeks, if not months, to get a legal OK to do anything of the sort. In addition, a lot of medical professional would bluntly refuse to deal with coronavirus patients and there is nothing in the world you will be able to do about it.

This instance in the southern Chinese province is the first time the virus has been detected outside the body of a patient , so health experts are advising people to be diligent about hand hygiene.

Zhang Zhoubin (張周斌), deputy director of the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told local media that the virus is primarily spread through airborne droplets and can also be transmitted through direct or indirect contact with infected objects. People will expose themselves to an increased risk of infection if they eat or rub their eyes after touching with their hands objects compromised by the virus.

Another health official in Beijing said at a press briefing on Monday (Feb. 3) that the virus can survive on indoor surfaces for up to five days.

I'm sure he covered as many bases as possible.

The more interesting moral dilemma is the cruise ship. I'm reminded of the C.S. Forester story where Hornblower's crew is exposed to plague. The British judgement was, yes, you are all absolutely subject to die for the safety of the fleet. You are quarantined until dead or we say so.

At the same time, you couldn't screen for plague in the 18th century. The passengers have a legitimate grievance. The question then becomes how to do you safely screen passengers when you don't know how the disease is spread. You can test for the virus. However, you might infect other passengers in the process of testing and releasing them.

Dilemma. A successful passenger egress is basically impossible. Even with better information, the logistics are daunting. I'll bet those passengers aren't going anywhere for awhile. The more things change, the more they stay the same. The Diamond Princess is flying a black flag."

It crazy to see those TV business analysts at msnbc and other stations are telling people this no big deal... this fantastic for the markets... keep making us rich... something really ugly and awful happening right now with the stock markets here and in China.

2020-02-10 20:24:26,"With another Coronavirus emanating from China, the world has to play a delicate game with Xi, to convince him to stop being embarrassed, and admit he has a serious epidemic  and take help from others.

Let's applaud the WHO's leadership for having overcome China's reticence in letting them help. China now lets the WHO offer strategic expertise, though strangely China still refuses tactical help. Without the WHO's help, this contagion will kill thousands and cause a worldwide economic downturn.

The problem is two-fold:

(1) Xi's policies:
The WHO is helping, as much Xi lets them. They are informing China of best practices. Hopefully China listens.

(2) China's ""wet meat-markets"" (which Xi's policies permit):
Dr. Ian Lipkin, Columbia University's world-expert epidemiologist, helped China with its 2003 SARS epidemic. He  has said that China must shutdown all wet meat-markets, where live animals are slaughtered in front of customers wanting fresh butchered meat. These markets are called ""wet"" because blood (and thus water to wash away potentially infectious blood) is prevalent.

Under Xi, China's poorest are also under social pressure to ""rise"". Eating meat is one indication of one's social class. With prices of safe meats like pork skyrocketing in China, its underclass must buy lower-quality meats at wet markets. Meat from bats, which are often infected with virii, is sold in Wuhan, China. This is believed to have caused this pandemic, which began there just over 2 months ago."
2020-02-10 20:27:06,"Fingers are crossed all over the world, because before the day before the quarantine of Wuhan, millions of people fled, many got on Airplanes flying to areas where relatives live, thousands probably came to the United States, i hope officials here are monitoring them. Last Monday all flights from China were stopped, which means by this time next week we will know if we dodged a bullet. In China police and the army are literally going from house to house looking for these people, in China it is against the law to house these ""Wuhan refugees"" who basically put millions in danger. I have all the sympathy, but there is an obligation when something likes this happens to do the right thing and stay in the quarantine, rather than flee and turn something that is bad into a world wide catastrophe."

Run by top-notch Tokyo University, Royal family, and national industry elite, Unit 731 ran a smorgasbord of outlawed bio weapons that were used in the field of battle in China.  Flea bombs for plague, virus, etc.  This is all well known, like the ballon bombs carrying cowpox virus to the US West coast.

While the virus may not have the very high rate of transmisivity or the CFR (case fatality rate) of an ideal bio-weapon, it enjoys significant advantages. It is available for free and can be employed without an identifiable, provable hostile source. The introduction of covert spreaders (or super-spreaders) into a location that might otherwise be acting to protect its population could defeat the best peace-time public health infrastructure. Very few societies can boast of a robust bio-defense capability. This is an unforgivable failure, particularly for the affluent nation's. The potential of utilizing a novel virus as a bio-weapon must be widely acknowledged and corrected. Focusing public attention on this threat is an essential step in mustering the necessary resources and will help persuade citizens & their governments to adjust the allocation of their defense efforts."

So we will not know enough to make a judgement till around 1-2 weeks out at least. 
With regard to Diamond Princess, I hope that Japanese authorities pay close attention in the next 2-3 days. Time is limited if the spread is truly exponential, at this point the rate of new cases (cumulative case count doubled in 2 days) is looking like the unchecked rate experienced in China just before the lockdown.

With over 37,000 infected persons in close to 35 countries, WCV is highly contagious and to date the mortality rate is 2% but could go higher as the medical support needed by patients to recover will be stretched thin. 

1 silver lining in SARS and WCV is that most infected persons will be cured on their own with optimal medical support. Persons with suboptimal immune system such as persons >60 or those with inherent or acquired immuno deficiency will have difficulty clearing the virus or preventing spread within the body especially with the lungs.

The lessons from SARS are key to build on for eradication WCV just as SARS was.
1) Quarantine and containment goes a long way.
2) Proper masks, eye protection, hand washing with detergent containing soaps, application of hand sanitizers and avoiding exposure to untested exotic animals in wild animal markets like civet cats (the source of SARS virus).
3) Staying away from persons  running fever or coughing who are not your patients or family members.
4) To ward of an infection from a microbe for which there is no vaccine and building a robust immunity one needs to ensure intake of balanced meals.

As reported by CNN: has a second reporter on the virus, Chen Qiushi, disappeared? And if so, why?

The Chinese government might think limiting information sources on an epidemic is smart and will scare reporters and residents. It might scare tourists, along with foreign governments and diplomats they want desperately to take them at their Word.

Until the Chinese government makes a clear and convincing case (not words) over an extended period of time that journalists, residents, diplomats and tourists are all safe, why go?

Maybe they should see Jaws.

The Chinese government sometimes feel describing them as “inscrutable” is unfair.  But with 50,000 sick and 1,000 dead projected by next Sunday, and their behavior to date, perhaps they would be more comfortable with “unfathomable”. 

The condolences of Americans and everyone else are extended to the deceased, their families, and the Chinese people. This is very sad.

Is the Chinese government making the ordeal worse?"
2020-02-09 19:39:30,"I am tired of all the outrage about cordoning off Wuhan. While what is going on there is truly and horrible, horrible disaster, what were/are the options? People shouldn't criticize until they truthfully answer the following question: if teleportation were possible, would you feel okay about Wuhan citizens, coming to your city or town to access services?"
2020-02-09 17:27:03,"These are the questions I have:
- Does the notoriously bad air quality in China help explain (in part) the higher death rate there? Are people’s lungs diseased so they are more susceptible to infection?
- Given that they disease can be contagious before it is symptomatic, is a pandemic now inevitable? Should the diagnostic question now be not “Have you been to China?” but “Have you flown in the past two weeks?” 
I’d love to hear any responses to these, or hear others’ questions."
2020-02-09 17:51:22,"Wait, so is the global toll greater than the global toll from SARS? Or is the toll in China higher than the global toll in SARS? Or are we just talking about mortality in China across the board? I’m a little confused about the two headlines (one on the main page and one once you click on the articles). I’m on the app, by the way."
2020-02-09 18:06:37,"Just what exactly would the US government do if we had a virus epidemic? Or, say, a retrovirus epidemic?  The government would blame the victims for their unhealthy lifestyle, and many in the population would claim that God was exacting revenge. Certainly the US government would not be providing free hospital stays. 
   Why is there so much finger pointing? That is just so easy to do, and so satisfying, for some reason."
2020-02-09 19:16:56,"At this point, we need to assist China with ALL of the help that they need. From face masks to canned goods. China is capable on their own but at the very least it will show some good will.
Outside of that I think we have been doing and are doing what we should be, canceling flights, planning and enforcing quarantines. There are only two things that will save the USA from what does appear to be the modern day version of the Spanish Influenza pandemic that afflicted the world in 1918. 1) Cutting the country off from whatever country becomes significantly infected. 2) A vaccine that is ready in less than twelve months."
2020-02-09 19:55:08,"The Times should not only continue but enlarge its coverage of the voices in China protesting the official response to the public health crisis and calling for freedom of speech. As one commenter suggested, A medical Tianamen in progress."
2020-02-09 20:44:04,"I read an article about the coronavirus mutates at a molecular level and how it becomes so deadly for some people. 
It involves the virus entering the cell. It does it very efficiently and creatively. 
No, folks, this is not flu or a bad cold. 
The coronavirus virus strikes the lower respiratory system, not the upper. 
Old and young are being affected and science hasn't got a handle on it yet. Many in China get very ill too quickly and because their medical system is completely overwhelmed, their patients are dying instead of recovering. 
Many patients may get dehydrated from fever and go downhill from there. 
Crisis always reveals weaknesses/gaps in society. Our Hurricane Katrina comes to mind. 
This is terrible for China and for people trapped on cruise ships. How many doctors are on those cruise ships? Medical supplies? Crazy situation."
2020-02-09 21:35:54,"Hard to understand how China got here. They have as close to total control of their society as anywhere. Why haven't they eliminated the sale of wild animals- the source of most of the viruses that jump to other lines of food sources, then to humans- in their food chain?"
2020-02-09 21:37:30,"The reporting to date would appear to lack a sense of proportion.
In Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, there are around 11 million people, of which some 800 have died - as a proportion of the population, even though it is spreading, that's a miniscule number. How many die of ordinary flu in a year, or malaria?"
2020-02-09 21:38:01,"Unless I missed it, the Times does not seem to be carrying the story of the business meeting of the global gas company  at the hotel in Singapore, where numerous people were infected and then traveled back to their home countries. This includes the Briton who from Singapore stopped in the French Alps and spread it to at least 5 people, including a child (causing the precautionary closure of two schools) and then traveled onto Brighton where he went to a pub. This case did not originate in China and could be a vector for international spread because travel hasn't been banned from Singapore as far as I know.. And it seems to indicate ""super spreaders,"" infected people who spread the virus quickly to a much higher than usual number of people. The Times coverage is great but has a socio-political slant. I would like to see more medical/clinical stories on how it spreads, on individual cases etc."
2020-02-09 21:39:57,"I can't find an article anywhere that mentions how long the virus and symptoms last in the people who have recovered. How bad were their symptoms? What were they? Did most get pneumonia and need antibiotics and fluids or did the symptoms resolve on their own? How many of the 37,000+ are still sick?"
2020-02-09 21:42:09,"I checked the statistics on line and it seems that last year alone about 80,000 Americans died of the regular flu and its consequences like pneumonia.  So far out of a population of millions in China around 800 have died.  So why is everyone being so hysterical?"
2020-02-09 21:48:44,"At the height of the SARS scare in the U.S. I needed to make a round trip flight from Atlanta to LA within a 24-hour period. It was a job interview. The flight was a little over 3-hours one way. I landed, went to the interview, spent the night and flew back home the next morning.
I got the job and within a week of my trip I became ill with an upper respiratory ailment that nearly cost me my life. It was touch and go for about four days. My poor new employer wound up paying me for thirty days that I could not work.
My point in raising this experience is to say that people who live relatively isolated lives in small towns like me are susceptible to some of the diseases that others are immune to and I believe that what ever made me sick was akin to the SARS virus that I contracted on that trip while closed up on those planes for hours. My lungs were permanently damaged from that ailment and I am vulnerable to pneumonia as a result.
Wearing a mask when traveling in planes and outside of our normal areas make sense given that we do not have immunity to the same diseases that others do in places far outside of our homes. If I had only been just a little more careful I could have avoided getting sick. A mask could have given an extra layer of protection that I was unaware that I needed."
2020-02-09 21:52:25,"Although sad, this is a great example to the world how pathetic a communist nation works.....they hide and lie to their people to protect the falsehood about how tremendous the ""my comrade"" system works.

2020-02-09 22:01:19,"The real question is, of course: what is the denominator?  Deaths are assessed with great certainty, cases? Not so much.  This is vital information for both containment, protection of the vulnerable, and reducing fear.

Also? Get your flu shot if you haven't.  Flu is peaking in the US now and has already killed tens of thousands of people."
2020-02-09 22:06:41,If they would stop eating everything that walks and the Chinese Government have some honesty about what is going on.. they would not be in the mess they are in.. Stop and Think about what you are eating.. China is killing our Animal World!!!

2020-02-09 22:09:37,"Why do I suspect that the fallout from the Coronavirus could have been worse if it had happened here in the US than in China where it began?  

The US is grossly unprepared in dealing with such a crisis.
Look at the photo showing the shop employee checking temperatures of shoppers in Wuhan. Apparently they are doing what it takes to contain the spread. 

Do you think we can do something like that here for the greater good? Think civil rights organisations, activist lawyers, nation wide injunctions, circuit court appeals, supreme court, etc.

Do we have a plan on how we will tackle such an emergency? Or do we just bury our heads in the sand and pray?"
2020-02-09 22:14:04,"This routine update from CDC is very helpful.  It has a chart that shows relative death rates for various diseases....the percentage of people who die from contracting the disease.  While the actual number of deaths from common flu is large, the death rate from the flu is very low -- far less than 1%.  It looks like the death rate from this coronavirus is somewhere around 2% but it might be higher because there is so much still unknown.  Dr Fauci said 'we don't know what we don't know'.

At a 2% death rate, if 49,000,000 Americans get the coronavirus, we'd have 980,000 deaths.  Plus, the burden on the health care system would be huge, and who knows how our nation's businesses and schools would react.  And if the coronavirus is more contagious than your average flu virus, we could end up with a lot more than 49 million people in the USA catching it, and well over one million deaths, in less than a year."

And let us pray for all those poor souls aboard that ship off Japan. The human race is connected by a thread , and the wars we fought are pathetic and stupid, the pet projects of the vain and egotistical adventurers. This virus will be defeated by human beings from all corners of the globe, trained in their field by other humans who passed on their knowledge. Just as it took many men and women from many countries working off the theories and studies of many more before them, each a rung up the ladder to discover and perfect antibiotics, these antivirals have the same trajectory. Men and women , different colors and different races working hand and hand to save the human race ...and yet we continue to kill each other in wars. Bless the peace makers. Continuing to fight wars against each other is not only completely insane ,in many ways  it’s suicidal."

So those people if infected will have to continue their lives, go out to work and shop, contaminate four more people each and finally drop to the ground.
That's life in the US."

In the last five days, they reported an average of 3,400 new infections each day, an average of 6% fewer new infections per day as compared to each previous day.  This was down from 10% increase for the previous three days.

In the last five days, they reported an average of 77 deaths per day,  an average daily increase in new deaths of 5.4%.

If that 5.4% daily increase in new deaths continues, 55 million people will die of corona virus in the next 365 days.

2020-02-09 21:51:15,"From the MSM and other posts there are many people saying that the coronavirus is nothing to worry about since in a normal flu year the U.S. has about 45,000 flu related deaths.  They say just chill, compared to that this is nothing. But I keep circling back around to the fact that China also gets the flu and has at least 100 thousand flu related deaths every year but they hardly every quarantine more than a school or apartment building.  So what is really going on that they feel the need to quarantine 60 million people (the equivalent of California and New York state combined) and shut down much of the rest of the country and economy with economic loses I can only imagine are in the tens of  billions per day.  The official numbers coming out of china don't justify the measures they are taking. It must be worse."
2020-02-09 22:49:49,"Considering China's censorship and the people who do not show symptoms, it is better to assume the numbers are grossly underreported and the virus has spread farther and has infected more (at least double)."

My sincere hope is that this national Chinese health tragedy, which we all know is far, far more severe than the Xi regime is letting, tips the scales of the popular conscience and leads to the onset of permanent public protest that ultimately drives the communists out of power.

Judy on tv asked the Chinese Prime Minister about the virus. At first he stated they did not know. Then a doctor wrote about it. He was criticized. The Prime Minister stated  that the doctor did well. But he did not know the information. When the information was revealed about the deaths The Prime Minister stated they build hospitals. Judy claimed they are investigating every family to see that they are sick. It sounded harsh to believe. Even for me. But he stated we have to determine what the virus is. He stated the Chinese people need to be inspected to see if they are sick! And then I clearly understood what he meant. I would find it hard to believe that people here in the United States would have doctors or nurses visit them to see if they are sick! I wonder what our TV and newspapers would say?

How completely depressing and dispiriting to read that Trump and his flunkies are stepping up their retaliation against our own whistleblower and those who also courageously testified honestly.

I guess Trump doesn't care/doesn't see how Xi dealt with a courageous doctor who could have stopped/slowed this epidemic. Why? Cause Li Wenliang was branded a ""whistleblower"" and we know what Trump thinks of a whistleblowers.

And don't think that this wouldn't happen in the US!  By example, see what has happened to anyone in Trump's administration who disagrees with him, whether it be about how to humanely deal with refugees to whether a hurricane will avoid Alabama.  And look how he's now punishing NY State Residents who want to use Global Entry because he disagrees with a State law?  (As an aside, what every happened to the GOP mantra of state's rights?).

3. Our democracy, with all its current flaws, stresses, and strains, will survive. I know this because Americans will never give it back.
4. Nor will the free people living elsewhere in the world ever give theirs back. They will fight to the death to keep their freedom.
5. So all this talk about Chinese people caring only about prosperity or whatever and how their system of government is superior to ours, hence where humanity is headed is total you-know-what.

This doctor is the personification of all those martyrs to free speech, from every age, who, usually through no ambition of their own, while pursing the obvious common good, are misjudged by the censors and oppressed. It is just such a hero/martyr like Dr. Lee that topples seemingly all-powerful autocrats, and their illusions of total control, with such acts of selfless courage.

The attempts to contain this virus could have started a month earlier, but old habits die hard and 'four legs good, two legs bad"" was ingrained in their system with the result that there will probably be thousands more deaths before this disease is contained.  The US should reduce its dependence on this country, and like advice for investing, diversify it's manufacturing base."

Some of these doctors are truly brave.  Many of them charged into Wuhan during the initial days without knowing at all how deadly the virus was."
2020-02-07 12:57:03,China is not going to relax its control of public speech but they can still do far better than they did and hopefully they will now set up some sort of secure hotline for doctors and medical workers to report worrisome findings. And encourage people to report even if unsure.  That a doctor had to resort to contacting peers by twitter in order to be heard is the real failure here. His warnings should have been taken seriously and properly investigated.  It is worrisome that he appears to have been young and was presumably healthy yet still died.  I hope he got the care he needed despite the government’s censure.
2020-02-07 13:08:33,"I do not approve of the extreme control the Chinese state exorcises over it people and this was a tragedy not only for the doctor but for all those who have died and will die from this epidemic.  That said, I can also understand governments cracking down on social media.  Look at the amount of dangerous misinformation online in the “free world” as well as all the coordinated and dangerous hate groups.  Rumors of a pandemic circulating without check could cause panic and real problems.  China did not apparently have a legitimate way for this doctor to sound his warning in a way that would have alerted the medical community to swing into coordinated action to investigate his report.  And I suspect a history of shooting the messengers made everyone from doctors to the government health officials scared to say the fears were real. China should celebrate this young man and also anyone in officialdom who finally sounded the alarm and acted on it. They have to encourage people to report (maybe privately but quickly) and act on bad news."

According to the John Hopkins Coronavirus CSSE page the number of deaths has not increased and has been stuck at 638 for almost a day now,  The number of recovered people has increased by 200+ over the same period of time, which is a very good thing, I just find it hard to believe that suddenly no further deaths are being reported, when prior to today, deaths were reported every single day."
2020-02-07 13:20:05,"The universal outpouring of human emotion, mourning the death of Dr. Li, is deeply moving.   Amazing is that the Chinese people choose to openly criticize authoritarianism of their government.   In America, a  more polarized response would be likely with percentages broken down in all too familiar ways."

2020-02-07 13:33:19,"These criticisms of the effectiveness of the Chinese Governments efforts to stem the epidemic are rooted in ignorance about epidemiology and infectious disease and viruses. Instead, the critics are making judgements apparently based on their political preferences. I am no fan of communism but there is zero evidence that any other densely populated country  would do any better than the government of China has done or is doing."

2020-02-07 13:47:59,"@ Alexandra Hamilton
According to the article dr. Li corresponded in a private message with fellow medical professionals. Somehow this message ended up in the hands of social police and he was made to recount it after he received threatening messages from this authority. Democracy, freedom and freedom of speech may sometimes look messy, but that is the price we pay for 
freedom of speech. That very freedom puts the onus on you to sort out truth from fiction, and it can be hard work. The idea that you would have social media policed by a government entity of some sort is abhorrent to everything America stands for. Trump would love it for sure. People fought and died so you could spout your nonsence! Don't stand so ready to hand it back in."
2020-02-07 13:55:44,"Freedom of speech is an essential when we say all men are equal.  Hypocrites and cheaters do not practice such values.  When a society has its politics above everything else, there looms disaster.
The House hearing on Feb 5 did not tell or reflect utmost measures or info from our government to fight this dangerous strange virus.  An eyewitness at the hearing stressed several times that there was not enough data to assess the situation.  If so, should n’t we pay even more alert and caution when we don’t know enough?  Why is that I hear many voices making me feel that the danger of this virus is being played down?"
2020-02-07 13:57:08,"Another super hero who sacrificed his life to save the lives of others. Just a doctor’s or nurse’s daily job. Doctor Li, thank you for your service. My condolences to your loved ones. You are a hero."

I hope some of trump's faithful will realize that things like truth and influenza and shared suffering are universal."
2020-02-07 13:57:50,"Dr Li is a hero  for speaking out to warn fellow doctors and the public of a new and highly contagious disease and to do this under the oppressive Chinese regime. Whistleblowers deserve legal protection under every regime and political system when they are acting in the public interest.
If Dr Li had been listened to by the Chinese state, instead of being forced to retract his truthful account of this terrible virus, then steps could have been taken to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus in December.
Whilst the Chinese government is taking steps to build facilities for infected people, it is extremely unclear what sort of medical treatment is being afforded to the many thousands of people infected particularly in Wuhan, where forced quarantine in basic holding facilities with beds has now been instituted."

2020-02-07 14:21:49,"The people's voice will be heard, but not necessarily in the way the article suggests. The Times needs to do a piece on the modern history of internet movements in China which prompt official response and action. 'Raw emotion' against societal injustice is actually not so uncommon and, if large enough in number, will result in investigations and policy shifts. There is censorship, but also agency, and I expect the death of Dr. Li to result in real change, especially in the means of communication between medical professionals and public media outlets. 

The Wuhan government is getting blasted, rightfully, but their hands were perhaps also tied from above. Nevertheless, I do not believe it to be desireable for news of an impending national epidemic or potential global pandemic to be made by individual experts, no matter how earnest and well-meaning, on platforms like Wechat or Weibo (Chinese Twitter) where the grievances are also being aired now. Announcements of this gravity need to be verified by the medical community beyond all doubt and come with a plan for ordinary people to best protect themselves and loved ones.

Lastly, it is ultimately saddening to see the double standard of 'universal human emotion' in this instance, but when Chinese 'netizens' have anything positive to say about their country, they are 'wumaos' or 'brainwashed.' Though not always the case, these are often the very same people, whose humanity is split into two halves to satisfy an ideology."
2020-02-07 14:23:41,"First, Dr. Wenliang is a real hero who bravely tried to save the lives of his fellow citizens.  

So sorry to see so many people making bad parallels to the US political situation.  The US is one of the most open societies in the world.  Even compared to the UK, the US goes further in protecting the freedom of the press. The fact that Trump and other groups are able to use this freedom to spread disinformation is the downside of freedom of the press because we leave the responsibility for truth with the reader.  There are numerous groups online that provide ""fact checking"" if people want to check almost any news report.  Moreover, citizens are able to search on news from all over the world.  So no we are not on the path to being China  unless we decide to support government control of thought and its expression.  This means tolerating opinions and statements that in our personal opinion are wrong or even immoral is part of what makes our system open."
2020-02-07 14:27:17,"The initial silencing of Dr. Wenliang puts me in mind, not only of Chernobyl, where there was a similar silencing and coverup, but also of the Titan missile crisis of 1980, and the non-response of NORAD on 911. 

Those in any brand of power will want to hide problems. Bring in the anthropologists to search for the path of genuine action and avoidance of damaging false alarms."
2020-02-07 14:28:30,"Dr. Li is a hero who took tremendous risk and sacrificed his life to save others.

A large muzzled humanity is suffocating under an authoritarian and surveillance society. Freedom of speech does not mean anything in China, no matter what is written in their constitution.

We might have engaged them on trade, but have we raised the question of freedom and human rights with them lately? Not that I can recall."

When they were there, they found a better living condition for their families, everyone had food and nobody starving. Yes, China after being invaded and occupied by foreigners for decades, was in OK shape. Many felt good about the Communist regime.

For us foreigners it is difficult to grasp that the Chinese people don’t fight for their freedom, but they don’t know that Chinese people never had freedom. From white people to Japanese control time, people were drugged and starved, but since the communist party people lived."
2020-02-07 14:39:25,"The GOP and all conservatives who support Trump's push for authoritarianism should heed the warning of the Chinese people.  The equality of a virus strips the pretenses of superiority. 

Trump and much of our Country's family wealth envy China's control; they don't appreciate China's civilization has evolved both structurally and genetically under a centralized agrarian culture for millenniums. America is a vastly different story, and while a substantial minority of America is experiencing a period akin to domestication under Trump, even these poor souls will eventually rebel against the misguided leadership of a clenched fist."

It's Communist China - remember that. The government is insidious and has no regard for humanity. It's an autocratic, murderous regime that will tolerate no opposition. 

The spread of the virus is directly related to the Chinese government's suppression of data. The censorship is shameful and disgraceful, and was most likely a catalyst resulting in the doctor's and other deaths.

US leadership's main care is the price of assets and the stock market. That is from the White House to Wall Street.

If they can cover up and hide what is going on as much and as long as possible, that helps hold up all the spinning plates as long as possible.

Another issue is that the US has no national health care system, which moreover is made more disorganised across the country given states, cities, and private hospitals and doctors all do their own uncoordinated thing.

Although many have health cover and access to hospitals among the best in the world, many others have no, little or restricted access to healthcare. Large sections of the population probably have access to healthcare as low as one might find in Africa or India, if poor, their medical plans have limits, if co-pay too high, or if just try put a sniffle off so as not to invite insurance companies to increase future costs of cover.

American are also less likely to acquiesce to officialdom that may try restrict their movements and actions - imagine if the government tried to quarantine NYC? One thing China, Japan, etc have going for them is that the population is likely to co-operate with officialdom.

Ironically, the US might be one of the least prepared and most vulnerable societies to a real serious virus breakout, if not this one.

2. As more cases were discovered, the Chinese people were told by several high-ranked ""medical experts"" on major media outlets, that the virus is not contagious.

While I liked the article, and am encouraged by social media doing a once in a lifetime right thing, I do think it lacked introspection.

There are comments on this very column alluding to conspiracy theories, notably that the virus was created in a secret lab.  The USAToday headlined an article saying it was much less fatal or contagious than the flu.  You yourselves virtually began your coverage with a social justice laced diatribe against quarantine.

It's wonderful that WHO is working with the companies from whom half of the world gets their information to make sure the information is correct.  It would be nice if the other companies that sit in judgment of those companies, like the NYTimes, would do their part.  You are quite ruthless to police opinions and comments when your values are being criticized or when you perceive them as impolitic.

So many reports of the virus affecting those with weak immune system tends to be elder or terminally ill. Also there have been over 8 people in Thailand and 1 in US that were cured from the Coronavirus using modified AIDS and Cancer treatment medications.

I am very concerned that Dr. Li did not die of coronavirus.  This picture itself looks very odd.  He does not look to be struggling to breathe-his mouth is closed-despite having an oxygen mask on.  He looks distinctly afraid in my mind.  His course of illness is not typical for C-virus as we know it nor is he 60 years and above as most patients have been that died.  Healthcare is a human right and honesty and freedom of speech are imperative.  Dr. Li died trying to save people-there is no greater hero.

There is currently lots and lots of infected who are visiting their herbalists just to try anything until validated cures come to market.  Red China could be hundred more portable hospitals and it wouldn't be enough for the infected.

It is like an advertising company that praises their product, when that product harms people.   I feel for the Chinese people themselves, who have lost a courageous leader and doctor; by attempting to covering up the epidemic, the government is responsible for this awful outbreak.  It could have been confined to a smaller number of people, once the hero doctor discovered how the virus was infecting others.  Truth is the ally of a good working government."

At first, the authorities had no idea of the coronavirus's death rate.  And even now, it remains a question mark.  Before the doctor disclosed the virus, routine precautions were in effect, though the appropriate precautons were unknown.  After the doctor's disclosure, precautions approached the opposite extreme, causing widespread panic among the public based on the unfounded fear that the death rate was extremely high.

From a public health standpoint, the doctor shifted the paradigm from one extreme to the other-- existing negligence gave way to panic.   

It is unknown whether the doctor improved the health situation or made it worse because the severity of the virus remains unknown.  But the notion that disclosure was surely in the interest of the public is speculative at best."

Here's the question, however. Are our elected representatives, many from gerrymandered districts and red states, only beholden to the far right or far left voters? It seems so. Politicians, unlike mathematicians and scientists, often rely too much on intuition, sacrificing principles and personal values to stay in the game. Mid-term to long-range, this kind of equivocation and cowardice will eventually be defeated. We see, as an example, how millions of Chinese have blasted their government on-line upon learning of the death of Dr. Li Wenliang who first identified the Corona Virus in a patient and was jailed for announcing his finding. The Communist Party only knows how to use a hammer on the population. No subtlety there. But people aren’t stupid, especially in an oppressive, authoritarian society. The truth will out. And it will out in our own society despite all of the GOP congressional representatives and senators up for reelection. People are fed up but often in different ways.

The metaphor that comes to my mind is two clammy fingers again pinching out a flame that the rest of the world used to take for granted. It used to be that the United States would be the automatic, unspoken counterpoint to a story like this one about what happened to Dr. Li. Today, in contrast, people around the world have learned that our Executive Branch plans to respond to those in the House who challenged the leader in much the same way as the Chinese authorities would be expected to do.

For a number of years Rick Scott banned topic of climate change by those working in the Florida government and banned using the words “climate change.” It was painful to watch these poor state employees try to use other words in a speech. Worse though was the lack of attention to climate change in a state where we are on the frontline.

In most news today, demonstrations or protests are featured daily, but the underlying causes for the demonstrations --and the context for them -- often get under-reported, so news readers don't really have enough context or hard, factual reporting to understand how the protests relates to the actual news events that are the cause."

What a strange quarrel the Chinese Communist Party would have with a citizen. The good Doctor Li alerts colleagues about a weird and mysterious virus, as anyone would be naturally inclined to do...it would have been irrational and illogical to keep silent. Yet, just two days after posting his alert, the state forced him, under threat of dissapearing into one of the ""black"" jail sites set up around the country, to recant his warning and declare himself a law breaker for issuing a warning.

2020-02-07 17:29:33,"I saw an initial Chinese propaganda ""fact sheet"" show up on a FB page dedicated to Ex Pats in Portugal (a country where China is trying to make inroads). It was unattributed of course, but it compared the Corona virus favorably (if you can believe that) to the flu virus and to SARS. Most importantly it said that the US was spreading disinformation about the disease.  A couple of days later it was replaced by a poster that looked identical, but had removed the SARS comparison. Still it stated a favorable comparison to the total deaths of the Corona virus and the flu without saying that Corona had a much higher (around 14 times) fatality rate. Early days.

Now our own President has stuck his big foot into the debate and pulled the spotlight over to himself. Like a true despot in the making, he validated Xi's excellent work and his ability to deal with this crisis. Right.

My earliest comment here when the Corona virus broke out  was that Westerners have no idea how totalitarian states move in the background to control information and to save face. The fearful fog of false narratives. Whatever it takes. Save face, lose lives.

Great reporting in the Western news despite many attempts to suppress by Xi and associates."
2020-02-07 17:40:35,"The tragedy of Dr. Li Wenliang is a poignant but merely the latest example of the suppression of truth in China. Frank DiKotter's brilliant books on the Chinese Revolution, The Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution document the horrors of the Chinese Government as they implemented their ideological programs that led to the death and misery of hundreds of millions. 

But China is just one example of the general principle: that totalitarian governments create reward systems that are driven by power and loyalty, with inconvenient facts being pushed aside and those that voice those facts being punished. 

And it's not just ""totalitarian"" governments. Any government whose governance and policies are based on power and loyalty rather than facts is vulnerable; and its people will end up suffering. Current examples abound..."

I think the message was sent to future whistle blowers and holders of information that would compromise the State - and there is implicit support from the Trump administration for taking these types of barely covert actions."
2020-02-07 15:04:59,"Why do some news like to write like this: “The doctor, Li Wenliang, had been silenced by the police after warning about the new coronavirus that has killed hundreds in China and sickened thousands.”

This gives the impression the police silenced a whistleblower who talked about a disease that had killed hundreds when in fact no one died nor was the disease known when he started talking about it.

He was suspected of just spreading rumors which is a very common thing in and outside China. The proper way is of course to contact China’s CDC and not an online forum"

This is what we are facing in this country, a president and a minority party that place their own survival above the welfare and the will of the people. We have a president and a Republican Party who are willing to destroy the environment and ignore science thereby placing the public health at great risk in order to pander to the fossil fuel and chemical industries."

But the United States also has history of sorts.  Ronald Reagan hid the AIDS epidemic, and his undercover cost lives of thousands - no treatment and death resulted.  (Again, Bellevue, we honor you for your beloved honor through our country’s crisis back then) 

Trump has cut back on the CDC staffing.  What do you think that means? 

Leave it to the US Republicans.  We can’t help but compare to China’s huge mistake."
2020-02-07 11:56:43,"China's repugnant reprimand of the doctor and nurses who attempted to alert the public and the world about an epidemic about to unfold should not be forgotten. Just as elements of our own government sought to hide illegal activity, limit access to evidence and them reveal the identity of a key whistleblower, China sought to hide details of a viral epidemic at a point when it could have been isolated and contained. They then punished and ostrasized those seeking to alert the public. The resultant damage will be unfathomable, both in loss of human life and in economic decline. It is hoped future generations will learn from these disastrous mistakes."

He is a real hero along with the other healthcare workers that are on the frontlines with little support from the CCP. Chinese people, our prayers are with you."
2020-02-07 13:33:34,"""“Heroes don’t fall from the sky. They’re just ordinary people who stepped forward.”""

We could heed those lessons here.  The president is praising what amounts to an antihumarian sacrificial lamb of an entire city, quarantined beyond belief, and left to die with few resources.  

That isn't ""appropriate governmental response.""  It's locking the barn door after the horse has escaped and letting the people trapped inside pay the price for the lockers.

My analogy may be twisted, but to see a US president praise a totalitarian society's response which has been late in coming and cruel to the nth degree is something I never thought I'd see in my lifetime.

The Chinese people are trying to speak up, for how long we don't know. But the cited lines above about heroes being ordinary folk that refuse to accept an alternate reality seem prophetic inthese scary times.

Second, by treating those stricken by it, even at the cost of risking and then catching the illness himself. Finally, as evinced by so many comments here, by providing a stark example for Americans about the danger of surrendering to the authoritarianism threatening our own nation. It will be small solace to his family, but I hope the international public health community establishes some kind of memorial in this great man's name."

That's not correct. Police in this case are at end of a chain of command that goes all the way to the top. While the top did not give an explicit command to deal with this ""rumor"", a system exists where delivering bad news can lead to trouble. And that system can now be very dangerous if new medicines don't work and quarantines don't help and the actual intensity of the virus is softened to keep the country's (read CCC's) image in tact."

Freedom of speech means one is free to repeat the official speech of the party line. Rule of law means I will make the laws to rule you by. Pushing to the ""logical extreme"" it means saying anything that is negative will be banned. In this case lies are truths and truths are lies. The Chinese should read 1984 if it is not banned there.

Will this protest amount to much of anything this time? My bet is no. Even here in America we find people persuaded by fake news when truths are available everywhere. Just ask the ""base"" of Putin's Hump.

He was like you, and he was like me. He did what everyone would have done under given circumstances, to a minimal degree. Yet he was silenced and punished for merely telling the truth.

We live in a society where fear of punishment for telling the truth is the NORM.

Once those in power stifle open discussion and inculcate fear of reprisals, the chances of bad outcomes multiply.  What will our botched government response to a disaster be because Trumpists have punished honorable public servants who put the public interest above their own?"

There are a lot of comments comparing what has happened in China to what is happening in the US with the immediate backlash that we are *nothing* like China. 

I am reminded of a famous Chinese proverb: ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."" 

We are well beyond the first step. We have a President who chastises the press for not printing good news about him like FOX News does. We have a president who threatens the press and the reporters. We have a party that insists that its members literally toe the line. The Senate leader even brags of that the members are in line and loyal to the party and won't defect. With FOX News they have any entire population toeing the line. Look at the backlash when one of their members doesn't. RINO does not mean - ""good on you independent thinker.""

We have an administration that silences science. That writes it out of regulation.  It's here: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/climate/epa-science-trump.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/climate/epa-science-trump.html</a>

Meanwhile, a beacon of hope for democracy and civil society that is the island of Taiwan has been stripped of recognition on the international stage, the U.S. and the WHO included, all the while under constant threat from China.

Moreover, officials reprimanded Dr. Li Wenling rather than helped him sound the alarm. Dr. Li is a martyr. The normal status in China is that the welfare of the people is a below the party and the economy. The Chinese rights lawyers have tried to make the legal system reflect the larger body of human rights law. They were jailed. This epidemic and Dr. Li’s death are piercing the nationalistic emotion of the people that the Communist Party of China relies on.  China needs elected leaders that carry mandates from the people.

Especially among the younger, more tech-savvy generations, people are starting to see that their government is not what it's supposed to be, and that it's not even a communist economic model, but a fascist one,benefitting a privileged few. As a theory, that's not of much consequence, but when party officials are hoarding protective gear from hospitals, and hospitals are relying on public donations, things get real fast. This time, people are genuinely angry, and in large enough numbers that the censors can't keep up. The people of China deserve better than the CCP government.

And even though we can point to China as authoritarian and as forcing Dr. Li to recant his concerns and his desire for the government to use his information and his capacity to see where this epidemic was headed, we have our own worries about truth tellers.
Too often these days, we silence truth tellers if they disagree even with our assumptions and and with our prejudices. We call their truth fake news. And we risk becoming a society where what pleases our ears is considered valid.
The latter is just as bad because we in essence create our own dictatorship by only allowing what we have decided is true to be heard. And then we only listen to those people who bolster that.
We are on a slippery slope and while my first thought was how lucky we are in the US that we can get the truth, my second thought is wait a sec. Yes, we most likely have access to different sides of a given story and can go to reliable sources of which there are some good ones.
Once, however we become hooked on the people who give us what we decide is true no matter what, and even in the face of colliding evidence, we give up on even caring to know the truth. And then all we want to do is win at any cost and save ourselves from humiliation.

2020-02-06 22:09:12,"Dr. Li's death has shocked so many in China that some compare it with the death of Hu Yaobang, which sparked the 1989 protest. The state propaganda machine panicked, announced his death only to retract an hour later. He was finally ""allowed"" to die 3am in the morning, when they are better prepared to censor the Internet. A brave doctor, a true hero whose widowed wife is 2 months pregnant. If this does not wake up the Chinese people, I don't know what can."
2020-02-06 22:30:44,"This is a tragedy, and is heart-breaking, as it reveals the tragedy of China's increasingly authoritative government. But don't worry.... the US is headed down exactly the same road, as Trump's outburst at noon today revealed...."
2020-02-06 22:30:10,"Can any journalist get an update on the current condition of Dr. Li's family?  I heard unconfirmed rumors that his pregnant wife was also in critical condition / (some even said she was) dead from coronavirus.  This is extremely disturbing.  At this moment, I hope there's a way I can contribute (like donation) to taking good care of his family."
2020-02-06 22:30:56,Punishing a physician for doing his job ???  Epidemics can be better dealt with if they are acknowledged early. Apparently the Chinese government thought otherwise and actually punished this doctor for doing what was right.
2020-02-06 22:01:08,"Sad beyond words.
If they would of listened to him instead of making him apologized and retract his worrisome, accurate statement the situation might be much different. 
He was poorly treated by the Chinese government that's for sure!
Condolences to his family and friends."
2020-02-06 22:13:15,"The leadership in China and the system in the country is responsible for this doctor's death.  The world must hold China accountable.  In order to save face, China has suppressed the truth. China's priority is all about making money.  It is time for the world to give China a 'Check List' to follow and abide by,  if the country wants to be a part on the world stage."
2020-02-06 22:14:36,"When this is all over, Chinese government owe him a lot of gratitude. Dr. Lee is a hero"
2020-02-06 22:31:54,Condolences to Dr. Li's family and community.  I wonder if he unknowingly spread the virus to those officials who pulled him out of bed to force him to sign a political statement about the virus being an unfounded rumour and punished him?  Facts matter.  Science matters.  Political fear causes needless and profound pain and suffering.
2020-02-06 23:00:14,"Dr. Li exemplifies the best of medicine. My condolences to his family and loved ones: I hope the Chinese government honors him and supports them. 

One question I do have is how he was treated after being taken in by the government. From reading reports, it sounds like most people dying in this pandemic are mostly men over the age of 60 with underlying health conditions. Younger people seem to be asymptomatic or have a milder form of the illness. Did they not take good care of him under custody? Surprisingly, he's an opthalmologist -- not a field I traditionally associated with exposure to a lot of sick people or involved in procedures that are particularly invasive and would put him at risk.

I hope I'm wrong about his treatment but having lived under Communist governments, I know they are rarely kind to truth-tellers."
2020-02-06 23:03:26,"I was stunned, saddened, angered and rendered nauseous by this news. Such an accomplished young man, with so much to offer. I have only my deepest sympathy and condolences to offer to his entire family and colleagues. So sad for your loss."
2020-02-06 23:13:04,It would be fitting if this strain of coronavirus could be named in honor of Dr. Li.
2020-02-06 23:12:55,"Doctors have an exalted status in Western societies and in ancient times, in China too. What happened?

Also, i thought this virus primarily affected older men with pre existing significant medical conditions, which is not the case here with this young doctor?"
2020-02-06 23:18:41,"It would seem to me that survival might be largely dependent on supportive, nursing care.    I hear about patients bicycling to the hospital for medicine.   Please clarify how this Coronavirus is treated."
2020-02-06 23:20:40,"Dr Li Wenliang was a brave doctor who tried to help his patients and to protect the health of the public. Wuhan was lucky to have him.

Sympathies and condolences to his family."
2020-02-06 23:29:42,"He spoke truth to power--and was punished for it.

He tried to warn his colleagues--and ended up dying from the same disease.

His heroism is an example for all of us--let us honor his memory by also speaking truth to power."
2020-02-06 23:33:36,"Very sad indeed.  Perhaps Dr. Wenliang was a gift to the people of China, not as a man, but as a voice. Not to speak up about the virus, but to go viral about people not having a voice. 
Albeit I am not physician, but this guys was relatively young and in presumably good health prior to the affliction.  Given the important role he played, he assumably was given the best of care.... or NOT. My curiosity leads me to why did he die (IMO) so quickly.   Was he not treated? or Was he punished?
These questions we will never know. Not sure who to attribute this saying to (may be it's me): Answers live long and questions live forever - especially in China."
2020-02-06 23:45:31,"He tried to protect his community, his country and the world.  May the next voice not be silenced despite having a message that we may not want to hear."
2020-02-06 23:50:44,"My condolences to the family of Dr. Li. Wenliang. China was warned during the SARS outbreak about the danger of food markets for the bats and civit cats that appear to be the source of these viruses. China failed to act on the warning. Until this changes, these epidemics will continue, and China cannot be accepted as an equal partner on the world stage."
2020-02-06 23:16:28,This is tragic. The Chinese government needs to be called out by the WHO and other nations where the virus has spread. No one ever holds the Chinese accountable.  The U. S. has been guilty of this for years. It is ironic that the only President who has stood up to them is Trump!  ( I am not a Trump supporter)
2020-02-06 23:00:15,"Don’t know his overall health, but for someone neither very young or old—not at particular risk—his death sounds suspicious."
2020-02-06 23:07:43,"Dr. Li Wenliang's heroic effort to alert people to the emerging coronavirius threat cost him his life, but also made him a hero to millions around the world who value truth, whatever the cost, over being deceived and their interests being considered beside the point by people who think they know better."
2020-02-06 22:32:22,Wake up ! Breaking news! The doctor who broke the silence die after 3 weeks in the hospital. RIP. He was 34 years old and in good health before that. He was true hero for braving the local authority. I believe his government could not hide this one from Public eyes. So far they said the people with health conditions die...and elderly. This is not like the flu or pneumonia. This sounds more like the Spanish flu and SARS...That’s why they locked down part of the country and they are building hospitals in record time. The numbers provided to the media are underestimated. Probably they make up the number of cases to lower the ratio for death rate. It is probably higher than 2% as they pretend. Everyday they add thousands of cases. But can they run so many tests in one day ? It seems to take forever to run a test in US. Something doesn’t add up...I am scared for the first time in my life..
2020-02-06 22:40:52,This unfortunate and sad news again raises a big question I have: where are the demographics on the people who have died? Were they mostly the frail elderly? Babies? People who have autoimmune disorders? Or relatively healthy adults (as Dr. Li appeared to be)
2020-02-06 23:13:57,How tragic - sounds ripe for an HBO miniseries
2020-02-06 23:18:53,A government's resistance to acknowledging a problem or weakness is a dangerous combination of vanity and cowardice.
2020-02-06 22:47:18,"This situation is a lot like the Soviet gov’t after Chernobyl. They didn’t admit anything was wrong until other countries began suffering from radioactive fallout. And I don’t think the problem is so much communism as authoritarianism. If something horrible and spreading happens in the U.S., I can just see Trump labeling it  as “fake news.” The pity is, close to half the population in the U.S. will believe him."
2020-02-06 23:26:55,"According to his name tag on the photo, his given name Wenliang consists of 2 characters. Wen, can be roughly translated as polite or literacy, and Liang means shine or bright.

He tried to shine a bright light to an emerging epidemic.

RIP, good doctor."
2020-02-06 23:48:55,"This flies in the face of the claim that only elderly people or those with previous medical conditions die from coronavirus. What is the truth? Why did a young, apparently healthy opthamologist die? Rest In Peace Dr. Li: you spoke truth to power. My very deepest sympathies to your family, friends, and community."
2020-02-06 22:58:33,"So now we learn that not only the sick, elderly or those with weakened immune systems are also dying from this virus.  In addition, while initially I thought China had reacted proactively to fight the spread of this disease, I now learn that at first they engaged in trying to cover it up.  

Is there any place on earth that doesn’t use subterfuge to control it’s citizens?  Don’t run to mention Scandinavia, because my Danish friends have told me repeatedly that they feel they’re not always learning the truth about various daily issues.  Human nature, I guess.  Sad and demoralizing."
2020-02-06 22:34:20,"A tragedy. We remember you and your efforts, Dr. Li. New people will rise and pick up the torch. Sleep well."
2020-02-06 23:54:02,"This is tragic and the man will be remembered as a hero who loved his country - enough to stand up to the bureaucrats who protect themselves over the people they serve. Unfortunately, this is behaviour that we see all over the world and continues to result in tragedy after tragedy (eg Boeing, Iran, and also much closer to home)."
2020-02-06 23:13:26,"This information is as heartbreaking as it is terrifying.

Condolences to Dr. Li's family, loved ones and co-workers.

The fact that China deliberately silenced a physician, thinking that somehow that insane decision would either stop, control or prevent further cases of the corona virus is beyond comprehension.

The question of how this virus could have possibly been contained and prevented the deaths of so many will always linger out there.

An unbelievably tragic and horrific story."
2020-02-06 23:49:57,"So sorry to read about this tragic death. RIP.
I do believe that the Chinese government is misleading the world about the extent of disease. According to the media reports most people who are trying to get tested are turned away by the overworked staff at hospitals. Only very sick patients are admitted. Many are dying in their homes. There is tremendous shortage of medical personnel and equipment in Wuhan leading to the 5X death rate. 
While there is no specific treatment for the virus patients need to be supported on oxygen and ventilator to give their lungs chance to heal. To operate this type of equipment you need highly trained medical personnel.
If the Chinese want to save the sick people in Wuhan they need to mobilize whole country, ship the ventilators and medical resources on war footing. But it is possible that they have written off the people in Hubei, I sincerely hope not.
It has been 14 day’s since the lockdown. If it is working the number of new cases outside Hubei. We will see."
2020-02-06 22:46:20,"Totalitarianism should be recognized by the citizenry of any 
 country whose leader demands obeisance  to their word in every chain of command. The condition laid out by George Orwell  in his last work , 1984. was claimed  by U.S.  Republicans to represent the left wing extreme in the late 40's, Orwell, himself a social democrat, complained to a friend not long before his death. The correspondence is available in the last of his writings, published postumously as a trilogy that tends to still fly from library shelves.

2020-02-06 23:10:11,"So for all of you who have been blaming the US administration, it is clear, the Chinese power icons will stop at nothing to feed your blaming of the US, as they did do just this morning. The Chinese government is never to be trusted!"

Lisarco virus, short for Li Wenliang SARS-like Coronavirus."
2020-02-06 22:41:33,"""The police forced him [Dr. Li] to sign a statement denouncing his warning as an unfounded and illegal rumor.""

He tried to warm his classmates about a new coronavirus, but the police turned him into a criminal. When the Chinese Communist government is going to learn? Is there a way to arrest the police? 

I'm sorry for his wife and unborn child."
2020-02-07 00:19:13,"Even while ill and after all they put him through, he still said he would recover and return to the front lines - as an ophthalmologist - a revered specialty that wouldn’t usually be on the front lines to address an infectious epidemic like this?  

As an internist myself, at a large academic center in Boston, I am in awe of Dr Li’s service, courage, and selflessness. It is beyond tragic that a hero like this man, in his prime, has been lost to those he served so faithfully.  He ‘didn’t want to be a deserter’ - he ended up a hero.  God bless him and his family"
2020-02-07 00:21:37,"It is a sad and disturbing reality that efforts to combat the spread of the virus in the West will be hampered by those shouting ‘fake news’ as trust in public health announcements is eroded, and trust in government organisation (CDC, WHO, etc) actions is repeatedly questioned and/or dismissed outright.

A unified response is needed.  Never has the Western world been more divided."
2020-02-07 00:08:45,"In this photo, his eyes looking directly at us, now knowing he's dead, makes for a haunting experience.  He did what any good doctor would do and got slammed for it by Chinese authorities.  As we relish the bargain Chinese merchandise that fills our homes, let's keep in mind that there are also other good people in China whose conscience leads them to noble effort and then are crushed by the State."
2020-02-07 00:23:42,"So the physician treating the patient become infected and dies.  We are in the path of a virus as horrifying as Ebola and pre-antiretroviral AIDS.  Its course could change everything.  Certainly, I hope, a wake up call to those who enjoy capturing, torturing and eating wild animals.  Or at the very least to those who police them."
2020-02-06 23:10:46,I've been crying for 20 minutes.
2020-02-06 22:35:41,"RIP, Dr Li. You will be remembered and honored.

Dr Li tried to warn the public about the virus on December 30th. Wuhan police sent Dr Li an official warning notice on January 3rd about his ""fabricated speech on the internet"" and ""if he does not stop the illegal activity, he will be punished by law"".

Did Dr Li receive adequate treatment and medication before his death?"
2020-02-07 00:06:34,"This is sad and devastating.  Dr. Li is a doctor, a man of integrity who immediately sounded the health alarm.  He has been sacruficed by the Chinese government with a penchant to keep secrets, tell lies just to ""save face"".  China has lost a good doctor, a caring doctor vowing to go back to work as soon as he recovers from the infection with corona virus.  China has a culture of ""save face"".  Unfortunately, when the government practices it, terrible consequences will be the result, such as this epidemic that has gone out of control.  Chinese government officers must stop practicing ""save face"", instead open up society for freedom of speech and criticism.  This is the only cure of the social ills and future of ""sick"" China.
Doctor Li should be given a humanitarian peace prize posthumously for his sacrifice.  My deepest condolences to his loved ones and colleagues."
2020-02-07 00:39:40,"Dr. Li gave his life in the care of his patients. Realizing the scale of this epidemic, he did the right thing by going public, only to be silenced by apparatchiks. 
My feeble words must be of little comfort to his grieving wife and family.Yet I can only hope that despite this overwhelming loss, Dr. Li's family can  feel the solemn pride that must be theirs to have known such a man.
As a surgeon myself, I am profoundly impressed with Dr. Li's professionalism, dedication, duty and humanity. Our species needs more people like this.
The US, Russia, China have impressive militaries and technologies. Yet this virus, like any infectious agent, cares nothing about this-and can humble and subdue the greatest nations.
If our species wants to avoid extinction, we will need to realize that epidemics, climate change, denuclearization, affects us all, and knows no boundaries."
2020-02-06 22:43:18,He was thirty-four. How many deaths have been of healthy young people?
2020-02-07 00:11:32,"Seems to me that the smart thing to do for doctors and nurses during an epidemic would be to take a year or two off. You put yourself at risk every time you go to work. You put your children, spouse and maybe even parents at risk every time you go back home from work."
2020-02-07 00:04:02,"Another example of what happens when science and truth are attacked.
Nightmare scenario: Dr. Li was smart enough to recognize a new public health threat based on experience with a past pattern. He was excoriated, shamed, and punished for it. 
Who knows if his death was engineered by the Chinese government. It’s not beyond the realm of possibility."
2020-02-07 00:36:33,"What a brave, brave man. And what an unfathomable, lamentable and morally devastating loss."

2020-02-07 00:30:20,I'm heartbroken to read he has died. This is true courage. These people who are speaking out when it would be easier to stay quiet. I'm hoping he will not be forgotten.
2020-02-07 00:40:05,"May his life be honored by changes of practices of government officials.  Yes, an epidemic is a horrible thing to admit to, but covering it only worsened the problem.  That must be prevented.  Officials must have a chain of command alerted immediately, to act against the problem not the message carrier.  My sadness for those millions of Chinese already suffering.  Peace and quick healing of the virus and local societies."
2020-02-07 00:42:41,"It is so heartbreaking to learn this: I had been hoping that he would make it - being young and apparently in better health than others, often elderly, who died.

So you have to wonder whether his experience with the government contributed to his decline, or he didn’t get proper treatment."

A terrible tragedy."
2020-02-07 00:24:11,"Here are the stats from official Chinese media:

Jan-30 170 deaths, 7821 infections, fatality 2.1%
Jan-31 213 deaths, 9800 infections, fatality 2.1%
Feb-01 259 deaths, 11880 infections, fatality 2.1%

Feb-05 493 deaths, 24441 infections, fatality 2.1%
Feb-06 564 deaths, 28605 infections, fatality 2.1%

The morbid joke around is that, even the coronavirus is heeding to Xi’s edict to LOWER THE NUMBERS. (What a smart virus.)

As to the dummy who prepares the stats for public consumption, apparently he didn’t even dare to round up or round down the percentage.

And so, if you ask me, do I believe in those numbers from China or the low fatality of this virus? Fat chance."

2020-02-06 23:01:42,A tragedy -- Dr. Li sounds like he was a fine man.  This is another example of what can happen when science is politicized.

Definitely Dr Li was worth 5 Mr Xi’s. Actually many more than that.

2020-02-06 22:10:57,"Dr. Li’s death is chilling on multiple fronts. In what has been a largely anonymous epidemic, Dr. Li offered a personal face - of a dedicated & observant medic; of a young - heretofore healthy - patient who nonetheless became desperately ill; and ultimately of the tragic death of a husband/ father/ son/ colleague in the prime of his life. There is a real cost when *any* society discourages openness about emerging disease. Public health always aims to stave off panic during crises; but sometimes it does so at the cost of well-rounded truth. The world owes Dr. Li debt of gratitude for raising well-justified alarm about novel Corona virus."
2020-02-06 22:01:30,What a sad tragedy. As a fellow physician we all understand that infection is a potential risk in caring for our ill patients. Dr. Li could have been any one of us. I offer my deepest condolences to his family for their tragic loss.
2020-02-06 21:54:01,"A devastating loss that could have been avoided. By sounding the alarm, Dr. Li had saved countless lives. By ignoring science and a medical professional, the ""Party"" has undoubtedly delayed actions and caused more harm to the public.

This is a lesson that we should learn over here. Listen to scientists and trained medical professionals, not politicians. Rely on facts, data and evidence in our making of decisions, not one-liner, rhetoric and baseless ""emotions"".

My condolences to his family. He died a hero trying to save lives."

2020-02-07 01:28:39,"Dr. Li is being mourned in China by all Chinese. We call his death a first national mourning on internet.

For those who wonder why he caught the virus as a doctor, he was an ophthalmology (eye) doctor. It is likely that he was infected by patients carrying the virus who didn't show any symptoms."
2020-02-06 23:59:07,"What sad news! He was the doctor that was seen as a hero for speaking out, ironically wearing the little hammer and sickle pin on his garment. Condolences to his family."
2020-02-07 00:30:14,"Proper public health saves lives.
Including your own.
Get vaccinated and always aim for transparency, in yourself and, if possible, in your government.
What an awful unnecessary tragedy.
Our hearts go out to Wuhan and the family of the good doctor."
2020-02-07 01:20:10,What a Sad outcome. His children should be very proud of him.
2020-02-07 00:56:40,I propose commemorating his bravery and his memory by renaming the virus after him.
2020-02-07 01:30:20,"People are saying that being on a ventilator could have saved his life. Obviously he is on a ventilator; look at the picture. There is no real medication for a virus; it mostly kills the very young and the old or the medically challenged. But obviously it also kills young, healthy people as well. This doctor suspected that there was a new virus, similar to SARS and he chatted about it online. The government, unaware that he was correct, sought to shut him down for spreading dangerous rumors, perhaps causing panic. They were wrong, of course, and he was correct. There was a new, very disturbing virus and we humans are very limited in what we can do about new viruses. This one lept from pigs to humans and it takes a while to identify it and make an inoculation which can innoculate against it. All this talk about ""getting the proper medications"" is a bunch of hooey. We could try some of the antivirals we have (as the Chinese are doing with their worst pneumonia cases) but these antivirals were designed for HIV and may have limited and/or no effect on this virus. The government in China is obviously trying to contain and deal with this enormous problem. Honestly, would you all declare a national emergency before you knew you had one? Unlike you all, I'm amazed at how cooperative and diligent the Chinese are being about trying to contain the damage. This is a developing country or had you forgotten?"
2020-02-07 00:18:32,"After reading the initial report in the NYT about the brave efforts of Dr. Li Wenliang to sound the alarm on the Coronavirus, I was hoping that he and his family would make it through. This is devastating news and a warning to all working in the medical community treating the patients. I hope his wife and their unborn child survive the virus and that they receive some financial compensation for the ill treatment of Dr. Li by the Chinese government. He should be treated as a national hero who probably saved lives by trying to tell the truth. We all owe him a debt."
2020-02-07 00:53:51,"Get ready because now that trump and his vile cronies have the bit between their teeth, and there are no checks and balances left in the top echelons of government, whistleblowers here will be silenced, too.  

Rest in peace, poor brave Dr. Li.  Thank you for your efforts."
2020-02-07 01:19:35,"I salute him!

And the government should honour him with the official title 'Hero'. He has done the same thing to any warrior who fought until the last breath."
2020-02-07 01:29:12,The virus is probably a lot worse than the Chinese officials are disclosing- but that shouldn’t be a surprise - to anyone.
2020-02-07 01:27:55,This is tragic news and my heart goes out to his family.  This doctor’s death is a wake up call to all who have been arguing that the flu is a greater threat than this virus is.  The threats are different.  The flu doesn’t typically kill otherwise healthy people in their 30s.
2020-02-07 01:30:12,"I fear the Chinese government is seriously under-reporting their death and infected statistics. Can the WHO or another authority get real numbers? It's the key to ending this scourge. RIP Dr. Li. 
 I hope the government tried to make your last days tolerable, but I doubt it."
2020-02-07 00:49:45,"NYT article about Dr. Li was news - and beautifully written.  I kept wanting to know - what happened to him next.  How tragic.  A man who cared about humanity, integrity, and science took a courageous step putting himself and family at risk......... and in 2020 America - it is not lost on us that we have a president is the antithesis of caring about humanity, integrity, and science....... He would chide Dr. Li for being a whistle-blower.  He would call the whole thing a hoax.  He'd check with his anti-vaccine base.  And, knowing that the Chinese government controls the media and can silence doctors - he would quietly envy Chinese leadership and say ""there's good on both sides."""
2020-02-07 02:00:20,"The virus should be named in his honor.  Viruses and virus-induced diseases are typically named after the place from which they were first described, e.g., West Nile virus, as well as Lyme disease (Lyme, Connecticut). But there are examples of viruses being named after individuals, e.g., Epstein-Barr virus."

2020-02-07 01:56:01,Dr Li Wenliang is  and was a shining light in a country ruled by cruel leaders.
2020-02-07 01:54:47,"Just like China's Dr. Li, we too had someone who tried to warn us of impending disaster; someone doing their job, speaking the truth, someone working for the people.  And here in this new America, ourwhistleblower, like China's, has become a victim; threatened, harrassed, disparaged.  Trump and his deplorables (special call out to Rand Paul!) have Made America China."
2020-02-07 01:51:32,"When the doctor just revealed about the coronavirus, he was subjected to questioning from the authority. His act of mentioning the virus was labeled an ""illegal activity"" that ""spread rumors and disrupt society"". On the document, the doctor was forced to stop this ""lie"". 
Before censorship took complete control last night, the news went viral on social media. Many Chinese people, especially the young, were outraged. In this tragedy, it was somewhat amazing to see how the silenced mass suddenly had their eyes open and mouths no longer shut."
2020-02-07 01:43:11,"I wonder whether this brave doctor was denied the antiviral meds now in use to cure this illness because he angered Xi and local politicians by exposing this epidemic?

If so this would mean the Chinese government murdered him.

Not uncharacteristic for the Chinese government that imprisons and kills people for what is in reality just political resistance."
2020-02-07 01:52:09,"They couldn't save Dr. Li with the best medical care in China, and he was only 34 years old? The  virus must be pretty contagious and deadly. Surely they didn't pull the plug on Dr. Li for bucking the system..."
2020-02-07 01:00:17,"This is so tragic. I'm so sorry for his family. The  media has stated that only 'older' people, over the age of 50, are dying from coronavirus. This doctor was 34. What are the authorities, whoever they are, keeping from us?"
2020-02-07 02:14:51,Condolences to Dr Li and his family. May his efforts always be remembered.
2020-02-07 02:23:55,"Those government officials who lift the ban on wild meat sold on the wet market in Wuhan and elsewhere bore the direct responsibility for this outbreak. It was a lesson hard learned and quickly forgotten during the SAR epidemic;  that bat transmission via wild animal sold in the market was responsible for the outbreak. But the ban was quickly ditched in favor of exquisite taste of few Chinese who are proud of their ability to cook the exotic dish with things moves on the ground.  Those who do not learn from the history, doom to relive it and it is the innocent millions are paying for the delightful taste of a few."
2020-02-07 01:45:24,Sorry to read this.  He was quite young was he not?  I thought this virus was mainly a danger to old people or people with diabetes and heart disease type illnesses.  This makes me nervous.
2020-02-07 02:12:57,"Stating truth but accused of spreading ""rumors"" by those in power in the government.  

Sounds like life under the Trump Administration.

Rest in Peace, Dr. Wenliang.  Your passion for reporting the truth will not be in vain."
2020-02-07 01:06:09,"This is a tragic, but it bears a few comments:
1. He was not a virologist, epidemiologist, internist, or even a GP.  He was an opthalmologist, not involved directly in treatment of the disease. 
2. He claimed to his colleagues that there was a new outbreak of SARS.  This was not a general alert but to his colleagues.  He later released a document. 
3. He was not arrested or detained.  He was reprimanded and went straight back to work.
4. The government had given out an alert of a ""unknown virus"" the day he sent out messages (claims that this was forced because of leaked the information are without foundation). Public notification was done the following day.
5. At the time of his message (12/30), there had been no deaths, and no evidence of human-to-human transmission (the first death occurred 10 days later, in an elderly man with extreme co-morbidity, and human-to-human transmission two weeks later).  It was still unclear what was happening. 

A few questions for comparison: if a public health hazard of unknown dimensions was developing, the government was already seriously investigating, quarantining, and calibrating a measured response, and a non-specialist took it on himself to take things into his own hands, (and release HIPAA-protected information), what would happen here?  Would there have been no effort to control this messaging?  Would there have been no reprimand or repercussions?"
2020-02-07 01:09:27,"My niece is both an MD and a PhD in infectious diseases.  This is possibly as bad as SARS and our president has done nothing to help contain it and work at a worldwide level, as all other administrations have done, to help contain it as we did with the Ebola outbreak under Obama.

Instead, he is probable using the fact that thousands are dying and he can leverage it for an edge in the “Trump Tariff War.”  I do not say this lightly.

And China thought suppressing the danger, in the age of social media would work and it did not.  Are people dying of dehydration and lack of a medical response or the virus?  

Suppressing those who told the truth is totalitarian rule and our empathy goes out to that hero’s family.
But if we do not all contain the suppression of truth, Totalitarianism will rule, in America as well.  

“The truth will set us free.”"
2020-02-07 01:06:56,"Firefighters run into burning buildings. Police run towards gunfire. Doctors, nurses and health care workers expose themselves to deadly disease, with little regard for their own well being. Dr Li was a young hero. We mourn his loss"
2020-02-07 01:30:25,"I note many believe the Coronavirus should be named or renamed after Dr. Wenliang. I disagree.  IMO, to lend his name to a scourge is slap in the face of this courageous man. I would rather we lend his name to the cure... Perhaps for the people of China sake - associate his name with the curing of all epidemics .  Here's my take.   His name Wenliang can be phonetically pronounced as ""Waylay"" (work with Chinese), which means to abruptly or harshly stop or interrupt.  In China, let's associate all abrupt cures or vaccines as a Wenliang (i.e. ""waylaying"") of the virus. Verb, adjective, adverb - i'm indifferent.  If ""Waylay-ing"" sounds prefect in English, I don't see why Wenliang wouldn't be just as fantastic in Mandarin/ Cantonese... Nonetheless that's how we celebrate a Hero. We associate them with the good, and not the bad.  Right?"
2020-02-07 01:08:28,How unfortunate that the authorities didn't pay attention to this good doctor.  Think of how many lives might have been saved had they heeded his warning.
2020-02-07 01:48:26,This is heartbreaking!  Such a young man who worked to heal and help. Wow. My heart goes out to his family. Prayers for anyone currently living afflicted with the virus. And blessings to the healthy ones among us.
2020-02-07 02:16:00,"If there'd be a very day that Mr. Xi got infected by this virus, he'd really regret what he had done to Dr. Li. I somehow doubt it. 

RIP Dr. Li, you are a hero and will live on in memories of many others. My deepest condolences to his family and loved ones."
2020-02-07 01:05:31,"Whistleblowers will always be needed and should be recognized for the self-sacrificing heroes they are. 

I am very sad to read of Dr. Li's death. It is a tragedy not just for his family, but for us all."
2020-02-07 02:49:03,"His actions clearly demonstrate what a wonderful and brave person he was. He gave his life helping others and standing up to authority in order to stand for what was right. His courage, moral compass and selfless-ness is a reminder of what we need from our leaders in this country."
2020-02-07 02:54:36,"This is a warning about our current political trend of denying science that doesn’t conform to a predetermined politically desirable narrative.  Unless Americans wake up, and start to care about truth, this is a glimpse of our future."
2020-02-07 03:09:58,"There are no words. I was just reading about him a week ago. I felt like knew him, I guess I related to his teaching to friends and colleagues to describe what he saw, just like any good doctor or scientist. And now he’s gone? No way. A healthy young man. How is that others survive? Unbelievable and my heart goes out to him in his last hours and to his friends and family"
2020-02-07 03:11:48,"“I think a healthy society should not have just one voice.” 

Wise words, Dr. Li. I hope your children will grow up in a society that’s open to multiple voices and perspectives. 

My deepest condolences to the Li family."
2020-02-07 03:19:05,"As tragic as these circumstances are and of Dr. Li Wenliang's untimely death due to the coronavirus, I doubt the Chinese government would change a thing should another deadly and contagious virus emerge down the road and another brave soul in the medical profession came forward to warn of its troubling signs and potential.

May we or any other country not make the same mistake or error in judgement.  Is it not far better to error on the side of caution than not?

Profound condolences to Dr. Li's family, friends, and co-workers."
2020-02-07 03:59:24,The same thing can happen here if those in power continues to see a free press as the enemy and labels can’t unfavorable news as fake news.

2020-02-07 03:19:07,"Last weekend, Tencent appeared to finally let the cat out of the bag. On Saturday evening, it published an image entitled, ""Epidemic Situation Tracker."" It said there were actually 154,023 confirmed cases of coronavirus in China and a further 79,808 suspected cases.  It also recorded the current death toll as being 24,589 – a figure so substantially higher than the official CCP claims that it is almost shocking. Yet these numbers appear much more credible than the official statistics.

They fit the medical models and estimates published by The Lancet and other experts.  Crucially these figures would also reveal that the CCP is continuing to cover up the true extent of the coronavirus crisis. It is also putting the lives of people in China and around the world in serious jeopardy in order to save its own face."
2020-02-07 05:44:29,"I want to say that he served his oath and died a honorable death. However his spirit should not be forgotten, the freedom of speech should never be suppressed.

If the comment is read, I hope the press can go on with this story to help his family in China. As far as I heard, his whole family are also infected and still under quarantine. This man helped so many others, so his family should be helped as well.

In order to keep the memory of him and commemorate the value of free speech at all times, maybe the media can sort out some foundations to set up an award in his name so that we remember this brave professional every year? He should be recommended to some award himself as well.

He rests in peace, yet his flag should be carried on."
2020-02-07 02:56:54,"“After I recover, I still want to return to the front line,” he told The Southern Metropolis Daily, a Chinese newspaper. “The epidemic is still spreading, and I don’t want to be a deserter.”

So moved."
2020-02-07 03:24:17,"Ummm... this is terribly sad and unjust.

However, I was under the impression from news reports that Coronavirus only killed the immune compromised, weak, very elderly, and babies.

This doctor was a healthy 34 year old."
2020-02-07 03:07:27,At the ultimate price Dr Li Wenliang became the public face of dissent to Chinese authoritarian rule. We will never know how many lives he saved or whether his subsequent treatment hastened his end. A terrible tragedy that serves to give point to a larger ongoing cataclysm.
2020-02-07 02:26:12,A true hero.
2020-02-07 04:30:35,This is nothing short of an outrage. This is what happens to whistleblowers in China. They die. Rand Paul would like the same in the US.
2020-02-07 02:08:50,"Is there any wonder why Hong Kong residents don’t want to be part of China, or at least want to maintain as much independence as possible? The government in China is horrible."

2020-02-07 05:33:53,"This is disturbing on so many fronts.
First, deepest condolences to Mrs Li, and their family! 
Here was a brave and VERY observant ophthalmologist bringing attention to a viral illness spreading fast— but— where were all the ED and pulmonary physicians?? 
They would have been the first medical folks encountering the flu like illness, cough, dyspnea,etc. I’m very sure the word would have spread to keep your mouth shut after what happened to Dr Li.
Let me remind you, if there is going to be another bacteria, virus or fungus wrecking havoc, it would begin in China.
Any Infectious disease epidemiologist would tell you the two deadly factors:
- high population density!
- Chinese eat anything and everything, and I mean from rats, to bats, civet, snakes! They bring in live wild-animals to these markets to sell.
Mix them with local food chain— and that’s your recipe for infectious disaster.

But what do you expect from Chinese authorities— what they’ve have done to Uighur, the clashes in Hong Kong, the attitude and response to a viral epidemic in Wuhan— I see even worse coming.
Economy and tourism are being effected on a major scale and that is the only language the high ups in any government understand, the language of currency. 

We humans are just too many now.
We have disrupted every thing.
In a way, it is nature innate mechanism to put a check on a parasitic population.

That said, China needs to wake up to its realities."
2020-02-07 03:52:38,This is a tragic loss but also very scary. The virus can kill healthy people in their prime?  Either it is much more deadly than we've been told or the Chinese government has contributed in some way to this intelligent and upstanding man's death.
2020-02-07 06:36:25,"Dr. Li was a healthy, passionate, 34-year-old physician. He died from the coronavirus, which many liken to influenza. Yet healthy 34-year-olds rarely succumb to -- or die from -- influenza. Perhaps Dr. Li is also informing us by his death: Coronavirus is more contagious and deadly than influenza or SARS, and it's time for the world to pay attention to this potentially deadly viral infection, which could have been thwarted if we'd only listened to this dedicated doctor when the outbreak initially began."
2020-02-07 08:20:11,"This man is an example of the best of a professional, a physician, and a human being. God Bless him, his name and his family and God bless all of us all over the globe for his siren."
2020-02-07 09:46:13,This is just....very....sad.
2020-02-07 09:58:32,A man with real courage speaks truth to power something that is in very short supply in the US currently. Let this be a lesson in courage for the whole world. I send my condolences to his wife and children. May his children grow up to realise the courage of their late father.
2020-02-07 03:24:26,"This seems a little off: Dr. Li was 34 years old and seemed to be in good health, and if I understand, the death rates for young people in good health, like Dr. Li, are fairly low. The overall death rate appears to be 2-3%, and 80% of the death cases are in those over 60 years old, but only about 17% of people in china are over 60. So your chances of dying from the virus are probably around 0.5% to 0.7% if you are under 60. Probably less for a 34 year old in good health. That's roughly a 1 in 200 chance. 
So what happened here? Was it just pure chance that the one person we know who has been reprimanded by government over this virus died like this? Maybe, but that's about a 1 in 200 chance. It seems more likely to me that there was some kind of foul play involved."
2020-02-07 06:14:23,"I’m glad that ignoring science, evidence, and reprimanding whistleblowers would never happen in this country."
2020-02-07 03:41:17,"Li Wenliang, treated his patients while risking his own health. He alerted his fellow doctors of the new illness despite repercussions from Chinese medical officials and police. He raised the alert, and brought unwanted attention to the raging epidemic – thus saving lives, if not his own.

Li Wenliang,was a hero. He should be honored posthumously, and his family should be honored as well."
2020-02-07 09:12:49,This is just so sad for his family.  He was doing the right thing...such a young talented man to be lost. My thoughts are with his family....he died trying.
2020-02-07 05:01:11,"I hope the Chinese government acknowledge that Dr. Wenliang’s actions to draw early attention to the epidemic was nothing short of heroic, and accordingly give him a state funeral or some sort of lasting formal acknowledgement. It would be an absolute tragedy to bury or cremate the doctor as some sort of criminal, or without clearing his name. Rest In Peace dear sir, and thank you for your dedication to helping and healing your fellow human being."
2020-02-07 03:55:11,"It is sad to see a young doctor died of coronavirus and even more so after learning the Beijing administration had tried to silence him for his early warning of the virus. 

His death cannot be in vain. The Chinese Communist Party has to change. What it has done has made the coronavirus crisis much worse than it should be. 

The CCP history has littered with killing of tens of millions innocent Chinese. The Great Leap forward alone killed at least forty million lives. It was a man-made famine. Yet nobody in the CCP has taken the responsibilities. 

The world is flat.

An authoritarian China is not only to harm the Chinese, but also harm the neighboring countries and the whole world as the coronavirus has demonstrated."
2020-02-07 04:42:47,"After hearing the news of his death, there's an unspeakable sadness that came to me. Dr. Li  is not a hero, nor did he ever wish to become one. He's an average man, simply trying to fulfill his duty as a doctor. It saddens me that China has regressed to a day and age where magical realism seems rampant - the ordinary is now extraordinary and the absurdity is considered perfectly normal. I mourn for the death of another ""ordinary"" man. May you rest in peace Wenliang. Thank you for your services."
2020-02-07 07:32:46,"This is tragic and at the risk of making this about politics, I can't help but think this type of censorship that occured in China could happen in America today.  I didn't used to think this, but in today's world where the president can just lie and repeat a lie ad nauseum until it becomes ""fact"" really worries me if we have to count on him and the Republicans in power to deal with a real crisis and tell us the truth about what's happening.

When we have an administration and an entire political party that denies science and facts and cuts funding into departments and resources that are designed to keep us healthier and safe, can we count on them to prevent the spread of diseases such as this?  Can we believe anything they tell us?"
2020-02-07 03:39:45,I think Dr. Li Wenliang was a hero and a model physician. I hope China honored his contribution according to his devoted life.
2020-02-07 02:43:42,"He's a genuine hero. May Dr Li's name and courage never be forgotten.

When soldiers, police, and firefighters die in the line of duty, there's usually a lot of attention — honor and ceremony — in the wake of their deaths. It's way past time healthcare workers get the same level of respect from society. (Frankly, educators and social workers should, too!)"
2020-02-07 03:40:04,The party people should all report to a team or a committee of medical experts - preferably international.
2020-02-07 05:58:22,"This doctor was a brave soul and it is so tragic he was actually punished by the Chinese government; trying to ""save face"" has caused many problems for them and has allowed the virus to expand.  I can only imagine that the stress of both finding this virus as well as the pressure from his government, contributed to his early death.  RIP.  You were a brave man."
2020-02-07 05:48:58,"I’m sorry to say that I wouldn’t doubt that the government had something to do with his demise for his daring to be honest and caring. It’s like Tank Man again. Bless their families and let their deaths have some purpose, some spurring of change so their souls can rest. He may have died too for standing up to the government.   
Images of Chinese military arriving to affected areas and forced removal look pretty scary to me.  I hope they are treated like humans and not livestock to cull. Prayers for those in China: may they awaken to their power.  I wish I were reading more of international cooperation but relationships are hard with little governmental honesty which leaves us needing to prepare for the unknown."
2020-02-07 02:48:37,"In a world filled with conflict and despair, it is inspiring to see someone who acted to disperse factual information to serve the Greater Good. Dr. Li is a hero in the truest sense of the word."
2020-02-07 03:49:32,"In the face of their enormous loss, I sincerely hope Dr. Li Wenliang's family is safe and healthy. I am sure many countries in the world would provide sanctuary for them if the Chinese government would permit it. I hope Canada would. Perhaps the negative international publicity surrounding his treatment by the Chinese authorities will be enough to keep his loved ones safe. The world must keep an eye on them on his behalf. It is the least we can do to repay his heroic efforts to try to keep the coronavirus from spreading."
2020-02-07 05:42:39,"Dr Li was an eye doctor, not a corona virus expert.  After he was caught issuing the warning of the new virus, he was ""reassigned"" as a front line doctor to deal with patients infected with the new corona virus.

You can certainly say that desperate times need desperate measures and that every bit helps, but we all know that the CCP doesn't forget and never forgives."
2020-02-07 07:43:46,"This gentleman whom none of us will ever be able to met had the perfect name for what he will forever be remembered in confronting the all-knowing authoritarian regime which pretends to govern China. 

The first character of his given name is “Wen” 文which can be translated as “mark, pattern, design” or “culture” or “literate / literal”. His second character is “Liang” 亮 which means “loud and clear”.

So loud and clear he made his mark, he warned his culture but the all-knowing authorities rushed to shut him up.

Poignant to the extreme!

Thank you Dr. Li, thank you for your service to humanity.

It is not you who should be “summoned for a middle-of-the-night reprimand over his candor” but the Father-knows-best crowd that currently governs China in a way really no different than any previous Imperial Dynasty of yore yet within the complexities of the 21st Century.

This coming May 4th will mark the 101st anniversary of Chinese students in Beijing protesting at Tiananmen Square for democracy, for people to rule themselves. When will this fundamental human right finally appear in China so that people will be able to speak without fear and share with the rest of society what it is that they see, think, and feel which may just happen to be of importance for everyone else?

Meanwhile here in Hong Kong we continue to confront authoritarian impulse with the cry of democratic aspiration. Wish us all luck."
2020-02-07 05:09:18,"This is truly a sad loss. My condolences to the family. Today I heard an interview with the Chinese ambassador to the US. He was asked a couple of pointed questions about this man. Did the party admit that silencing him was a mistake? Did they regret it? Would things be different next time? He's a diplomat, so no direct answer, but as he deflected and not quite explained, I had this horrible thought that dead this young man could be held up as a martyr, a shining example of the courage of the people. While alive he could be an inconvenient outspoken voice to do better. And then I wondered just how hard they tried to save his life. A horrible thought and I pray it's not true."
2020-02-07 09:31:05,"Is there a saying in Chinese for ""No good turn goes unpunished.""?

This is a terrible and unnecessary tragedy and the result of the so-called government that is China's 'method'. of government.  I would like to think that in apologising, the ""authorities"" will offer "" to take care of the family.   Properly, that is. ..."
2020-02-07 07:40:31,I wonder though if he didn't get the treatment he needed because he had blown the whistle back in December.
2020-02-07 05:50:53,"Highly unusual that a young, otherwise healthy man dies from the Coronavirus. 
He dies a hero. The villains are safe. Pretty convenient."
2020-02-07 10:04:59,"My Wechat Moments, mainly Shanghai elites and expats, are completely full today of posts memorializing this doctor and his heroism.  It is good to see these sentiments are reflected around the world.

What I have running in my head, from the Civil War song John Brown's Body:

""He's gone to be a soldier in the army of the Lord,

His soul is marching on"""
2020-02-07 10:21:23,It seems that it is taken for granted that China’s single party dictatorial regime will always be in place. This outbreak and it’s aggravation by mishandling of information and ineffective actions obviate that this regime is not just a threat to the Chinese people but to the rest of the world. The world should take renewed urgency in helping make China a viable democracy.
2020-02-07 10:03:21,Dr. Li was an honest doctor and for me a hero even before he died. My deepest sympathy to his family. I hope the NYT can give our messages to his wife.
2020-02-07 10:13:18,To my fellow Americans who are thinking it can’t happen here I would like to remind you of a certain national hurricane map modified with a sharpie to save Donald Trump embarrassment for misspeaking. And the ensuing fallout out inside the weather service office who dared speak truth to power. Any person who cannot admit to themselves and others that they are capable of a mistake are extremely dangerous in positions of power.
2020-02-07 09:08:12,"A martyr or the primitive markets where people buy bats to eat.  And then blamed by the government for his concern which now has killed him.  How do the Chinese put up with this form of tyranny?  I guess it is like us and Trump, or probably more correct, the Republican Party, the one taking away medical benefits.  Let's hope coronavirus does not strike with fury in the US."
2020-02-07 04:37:31,"Not to worry; the Trump Administration cuts the CDC budget every year while raising the military budget almost 10% this year. You'll all be fine. 

None of this was caused by cutting down forests and bringing new viruses into contact with humans. That is fake news. Here in the U.S. we rely on and believe scientists. Oh wait, that ended in January, 2017."
2020-02-07 06:35:32,Not one mention in this article about how exactly this ophthalmologist came to know about the virus back in late December and able to “warn” of its potential impact.
2020-02-07 04:43:01,"If people wonder what happens when an authoritarian government vindictively lashes out at those who seek the truth because they may be embarrassed . . .

This is what happens."

2020-02-07 10:04:07,"Let this be a lesson to Americans what happens when you stifle the voices of the true professionals who have spent a lifetime in the study of complex problems, and instead listen to the ravings of a carnival barking screaming from a podium at some campaign rally."
2020-02-07 03:39:42,"Telling tale of what authoritarian rule brings, and something we are sliding toward here in the US."
2020-02-07 03:51:56,"I hope that America never descends into the pit of authoritarian government as happened inm China, where criticism of the government or of its leaders is punished and silenced by the authorities.  I fear that we are moving down that path, where the Bully Pulpit and its Fox ally are used to smear all on the ""list of enemies""  as traitors and unpatriotic--smearing with falsehoods. Our leader who has no civility or respect for others can be very dangerous as his power grows."
2020-02-07 08:37:56,Yet another whistleblower pays for speaking truth to self-interested power.  I hope that this disease will be called the Li coronavirus in his memory - and that his family are given a lifelong pension by the Chinese government.
2020-02-07 08:13:25,"This news is very alarming to me, because Dr. Li was only 34 and was probably healthy.  When they say the flu killed tens of thousands in America, many of those people have compromised immune systems.  This virus is much more dangerous than flu."
2020-02-07 07:17:20,"“I think a healthy society should not have just one voice,” a statement that can apply to both Li and Xi."
2020-02-07 08:02:06,"It would be very useful to have statistics regarding the propensity or not of healthcare workers to contract this and other viruses and/or the pneumonia afterwards that so often results in death.  Are young people now routinely vaccinated against pneumonia (the old man's friend! sic.)? Are oriental people more likely to contract this virus than blacks or Caucasians?   
Does barrier/mask protection work?  

Keep your hands away from your face!!! even if apparently well-washed.  Wipe down or avoid touching objects that many other touch -- door knobs, computer keyboards and mice.   Cough into your elbow.

Always sad when a young person dies. And so interesting that an ophthalmologist discovered this disease."
2020-02-07 06:44:49,Nobody else is finding this incredibly fishy in a authoritarian way?
2020-02-07 09:22:59,"What about the patient that Dr. Li first identified on Dec. 30? Is this person alive, any updates?"
2020-02-07 07:16:53,"My heart tears for Dr. Li.  For Dr. Li’s father and mother, for Dr. Li’s wife, for Dr. Li’s son and daughter.  Nope.  I don’t buy the death.  A 33 yo man in the prime of his life dying of a viral illness?  My heart aches for the 1,430,000,000 Chinese living under the regime.  God deliver us."
2020-02-07 08:33:37,This seems as suspicious as the downed jet in Iran which turned out to be not an accident.
2020-02-07 09:19:18,Wow! The Chinese government is just like the US government. We have a lot in common.
2020-02-07 04:35:34,"Given the history of the brutality inflicted on Chinese citizens by their own government, and its secretive and controlling behavior, can we be absolutely certain the doctor died of the virus?"
2020-02-07 02:31:43,Who knows what lies ahead with this virus. I think it’s much more out of control than China admits.
2020-02-07 07:34:53,"Dr. Li was clearly a great humble humane empathetic human being who exemplified the best of our humanity and his profession.

In the new growing world order where scientific ignorance, lying and stupidity are exalted by our governing political leaders the danger to human survival will only metastasize."
2020-02-07 04:30:56,It might be fitting that the new hospital just built in Wuhan be named in his honor.  Ironic and sad.
2020-02-07 09:39:12,"I wonder what the Chinese secret police put him through before his death.

Whatever they did, it resulted in his death, more than what the coronavirus could have done to him.

There is the Chinese system for you!"
2020-02-07 10:29:16,Party over Science...sounds familiar.
2020-02-07 12:43:30,"The Chinese CCP has people all over media forums even on here. You can usually tell by the way they express themselves in superlatives kind of like Trump with his ""perfect phone call."" I read a comment the other day that the Chinese government got the outbreak under control, and that it has not been spreading. And that it's blown out of proportion. When a young doctor only 34 years old dies then what hope is there for someone twice his age? If anything one would expect a doctor to know to practice universal precautions as we use the term here. Hopefully they practice it in China too."
2020-02-07 12:13:24,"I read about Dr. Ali’s death late last night. I was so shocked. He really put a face on this pandemic. When he was hospitalized, I remember thinking “He’s young, he’ll get over it.” 

It really makes you wonder whether the Chinese are suppressing the true extent and mortality of this virus. As the only “face” to this epidemic, I am sure that they did everything they could to save him. I get the feeling that the medical establishment in Wuhan is totally overwhelmed by this epidemic and that they are unable to deal with it. The idea that sick people with plastic bags on their heads are walking the vacant streets of Wuhan trying to get help, and spreading the virus, is chilling. So is the thought of being warehoused in a convention center receiving no real help from overwhelmed staff."
2020-02-07 12:29:56,I find it baffling that the Chinese reports have been minimised. Dr Li was the real hero here.
2020-02-07 12:57:54,"What frightens me most is that similar horrors could happen in America, and I don't mean hundreds dying from a disease.  I would never have believed that the American government would be able to deny scientific facts, even to the point of compelling scientists to deny the existence of such facts.  Similarly, I would not have thought that the government could issue statements denying the occurrence of events that clearly happened.  My opinion has changed.  We are China."
2020-02-07 13:11:46,"Chinese government has already dispatched an investigating team to Wuhan to find out the truth of Dr. Li Wenliang's story.  No stone will be unturned, and truth will be coming out.

The other reason that the Chinese government wants to know is where and how the reporting system could mishandle such an important information.  Of course, local officials will bear the majority of the responsibility.  The city mayor of Wuhan, the epicenter of the Coronavirus, already offered his resignation.  

But the people in charge of the province has yet to announce his resignation.  And the investigating team coming from the central government will handle this high level managers without any hesitation.  They will report to central government back about the causes of this incidence.  We'll see. 

Any dissatisfaction of this report will cause social unrest. Even as powerful as Xi Jinping, he will treat it carefully."
2020-02-07 13:08:22,This example of what Governments can do to stifle truth is exactly what is happening in the United States at this time though the truth always comes out in time it is never soon enough.
2020-02-07 13:38:35,God bless Dr. Li. I am so very sorry for this hero and his family.
2020-02-07 13:49:44,Is it certain that Dr. Li died from the coronavirus? Is there evidence that the Chinese government retaliated against him?
2020-02-07 14:34:07,"We ignore science, and the professionals who study it and use it, at our own peril.  This man literally gave his life speaking truth to power. Let's not forget him."
2020-02-07 15:06:18,"A tragically sad story, my condolences. The most striking part was the quote "" A healthy society has more than one voice"". I feel this is critically important right now in a time where many voices are being silenced."
2020-02-07 15:15:27,"Think this stifling of a medical professional does not happen here? It does in many ways, a few in which I will list: 
Climate change scientists have been sounding alarms for at least 40 years,
The EPA scientists are being stifled under the trump administration,
The Education scientists are being stifled under the trump administration via betsy devos,
and sooooo much more science being stifled under the trump administration."
2020-02-07 18:34:56,"This is what happens when an authoritarian government regards any public revelation of a dangerous situation as a threat to itself and then suppresses the truth as “fake news.”  Hundreds of lives, perhaps ultimately thousands or even more — we don’t yet know how bad this will be —, might have been saved if the government had not tried to silence the courageous Dr. Li, but instead had welcomed the opportunity to take effective preventative action, including a clear warnIng to the population.
  The Chinese Communist government should be aware that historically, deadly pandemics have played a key role in overthrowing past dynasties like the Ming in the 17th century.  The current pandemic may well force change in Beijing, vindicating Dr. Li, albeit bringing small consolation to his devastated family, colleagues, and friends.
    What does this mean to us?  Although it appears that our public health system is responding appropriately, we need to be prepared for the worst.  But that will require a very different style of presidential leadership.  Can there be any doubt that the inclination of our current administration is to behave in exactly the same irresponsible way as the Chinese, by lying about real threats to our health?  Already we have all too many cases of conscientious scientists being driven out of agencies like the EPA for trying to present realistic assessments of the implications of the Trump policies on climate change and environmental pollution. This MUST end."
2020-02-07 15:22:48,The disease should be named for him to honor his efforts and remind people  of the importance of whistleblowers.
2020-02-07 15:46:56,"“The epidemic is still spreading, and I don’t want to be a deserter.”

It is good to know that even in Communist dictatorships, there are still courageous and good people.

The whole world should honor such a man as Doctor, Li Wenliang."
2020-02-07 17:20:31,"Dr. Li was a fine man who did the right thing, so sad to see how it turned out for him. When he saw the danger he stood up and said so. Shame on the Chinese government for how it treated him, he is a hero of and for the good people of China.

FWIW: His case reminds me of my 30 years working for DoD; where when something goes wrong you search for the guilty, punish the innocent, promote the uninvolved, rinse and repeat."
2020-02-07 18:20:58,"In war they say the best and the bravest are the ones who are the first to fall. They are the ones who lead the way into battle and face the bullets first. So it is with Dr. Li, a man who was on the front lines of this new war. The battle between man and the microbe. May the bravery of Dr. Li inspire millions to become doctors, to become scientists. China as a communist society doesn't believe in creating heroes, doesn't believe in putting any one person in the spotlight. The are going to have a hard time in stopping the memory of Dr. Li. A true hero in a world of phony ones."
2020-02-08 01:00:10,How did he die when he was a healthy person? I thought only those with compromised health would be at risk of dying?
2020-02-08 00:58:19,"It’s time for us to rethink our relationship to China. We have lost virtually all our manufacturing in the US to China. We all know that the Chinese people making our goods are basically slave labor and often live at the factories in terrible conditions. Our cheap goods only provide big bucks for the corporations, not for the workers or for us the consumer buying made to break stuff.China arrested the doctor who warned about the virus, then censored news about it. Do we choose to conduct business with an immoral country? Not that ours is so great either with Trump the liar in charge."
2020-02-07 22:39:42,"A tragic, and unnecessary, loss.  Condolences to his wife and child and to his unborn child.

China: Listen to the comments.  Please.  For the good of the country and the world."
2020-02-08 00:52:10,It is sad that Dr.Li Wenliang succumbed to the disease he warned about in the face of harassment from the Chinese government. Had they heeded his warning instead of silenced him the situation would not be the pandemic it has become. My sincere condolences to his family.
2020-02-07 23:52:33,"Trying to hide the obvious seems to be the way the Chinese national and local governments like to deal with problems that they find embarrassing.  In July 2011, two high-speed trains crashed in China.  Forty people were killed outright and nearly 200 people were injured.  The government's response was to clear the wreckage of the dead and injured, and then use backhoes to dig pits and bury the train cars.

Seems like the Chinese government isn't a very fast learner."
2020-02-07 16:00:06,"“I think a healthy society should not have just one voice.""

Hey 'Murika think about that."
2020-02-08 00:44:12,"RIP Doctor. Even with a President who lies daily and should be impeached, I wouldn’t want to live in China where truth is erased. It’s very sad that this young and honorable doctor lost his life. If the government had listened to him when he first reported it, the spread of the virus might have been contained."
2020-02-06 14:41:45,"Retired doc, here. 

I can think of no better place than a cruise ship to breed an epidemic. They’re notorious for viral diarrheal diseases. Nothing like close quarters, a/c ventilation systems, common food prep and boredom. 

I’d strongly consider taking it on a cruise to nowhere so the passengers and staff can get some truly fresh air."
2020-02-06 15:00:31,Ugh... yet another reason to never go on a cruise.
2020-02-06 15:32:16,"I feel bad for those affected but Japan is very lucky the passengers did not make port and head into town. 

Yokohama China Town/downtown areas are a popular escape from central Tokyo, and several major (very crowded) train lines feed into Yokohama central areas from various parts of Tokyo. No doubt the virus would have easily spread into central Tokyo and surrounding areas.

Passengers will be well looked after by medical staff, and will have to put up with some boredom...there are worse things in life."
2020-02-06 15:33:21,"The horror of being in a small closed room with no fresh air; 
but, -- if authorities want to gauge exactly how contagious the virus is, how easily it spreads from human to human, what better petri dish?  A set number of passengers and staff; tightly controlled conditions..."
2020-02-06 15:27:26,Wouldn’t it be a great thing for the health of the seas and the environment if this virus could put a nail in the coffin of the cruise industry.
2020-02-06 15:35:45,Will they get a refund?
2020-02-06 15:53:14,"I hope someone can interview crew members at some point: they are the true heroes. Hopefully Japan has the resources to get these international laborers safely through a bout of the virus.

In the meantime I look back on my recent fall cruise out of this same port with pleasure. These stories only help me to plan for any and all contingencies on my next cruise. To all those very original commenters who say they will never set forth on one of these large, densely populated vessels, I say it’s just another interesting way to see the world. Either you have the travel bug or you don’t. After I’m too old to stride up the local mountains, explore cities on public transportation, and embark on long road trips, I look forward to seeing even more places from these comfortable, floating hotels."
2020-02-06 16:49:00,"As a non-medical professional I think it sounds dangerous for small groups of passengers to be allowed to congregate for some fresh air, since this would seem to raise the chances of transmission from person to person if any are carrying the virus.

Further, if all the cruise ship passengers are quarantined for two weeks, but one of them presents with coronavirus on, say, day 11, are the rest of the passengers allowed to leave after day 14 or are they quarantined for an additional two weeks?

I am hoping qualified medical professionals will respond to this question."
2020-02-06 18:03:36,"Some people, when ill, do not do well with confinement.  I quarantined (at different times) my wife and my daughter when they had the flu, and took care of them.  My elderly father lives with us - so it was essential.  My teenage daughter did fine.  My wife, although she had a 25 by 25 room with a bathroom, after a few days (compounded by the fever) went a little mad.  She began to believe she was never going to get better, she had flashbacks to childhood trauma, she was super lonely.  We arranged it so she could come down to a room on the second floor which was a little more in the daily “traffic”.  Then at night we would go for a walk outside when my dad was asleep and wasn’t near.  But it was bad.  She told my kids “I might not make it!”  Even when she simply had relatively mild influenza."
2020-02-06 18:15:27,"Great article. It took all the disparate details accrued over he past weeks and summarized them correctly. Especially the part about twenty passengers testing positive. One can get out of synch with all the details, and last reported it was 10, so bravo explaining where the 20 came from. The scary part is that 2,600 people alighted the one ship and scattered into Japan and beyond! We really needed to know that."
2020-02-06 17:00:02,"How do the windowless cabins get their air?  Is it circulated
throughout all the duct work on the ship?  Is all the air then
combined and recirculated?  Is this air contaminated?"
2020-02-06 18:06:16,Windowless cabins? Really? People pay for that?
2020-02-06 18:22:22,"These mega cruise ships are a notorious insult to the environment even if the management (obviously), uses all kind of rhetorics to improve the image of the industry. Despite their loud denials, these ships are regularly caught dumping toxic substances into the ocean, which must mean we are actually only hearing about the tip of the iceberg (no pun intended). Furthermore, the (paid!) promiscuity regularly favors on board epidemics, the most notorious one being the norovirus. All in all, a pretty perverse form of tourism."
2020-02-06 17:46:45,"Unless the ventilation system for each room is self-contained, this seems like a perfect way to infect all of the now healthy passengers."
2020-02-06 16:40:38,"An enormous amount of surface area on the ship must be infected with this virus. It will take a monumental effort to clean after the passengers are allowed to disembark. The AC filters are notoriously dirty on cruise ships, especially the ones that service interior cabins. With  growing population, and oceanic flights, this will only get worse with future contagions. The WHO must be given the authority to take global  action, along with the UN, whenever the first sign of the next disease becomes known."
2020-02-06 17:11:45,"This met get interesting for us.  We're booked out of Yokohama on Holland America on April 8.   Can we even fly into Tokyo then?  More information, please."
2020-02-06 19:54:18,"So the assumption, when the 3500 people on the cruise ship were quarantined, that if no other people on ship , showed any sysmtoms , after 14 days, all could be let off the ship.  But the reality is unfolding dramatically different.  Every time they check, they find more people infected, who are then removed of the ship, while the people not showing infected, stay in ship. So the only way now to get off the ship is to have the coronavirus.  Are they going to wait till the last passenger gets the virus or let people off the ship and hold them in isolation from each other in a proper facility, so that they do not continue to infect each other ?"
2020-02-06 19:58:53,"So the 14-day with no infections clock gets reset, everytime a new passenger is found to have the infection ?   How long would that cycle last ? Until the last passenger is infected ? I don't want to be alarmist or make light of the situation, but consider the hazards of the policy.  Letting passengers of and holding each of them in total isolation from each other , would have been the only way to prevent spread. Its still not too late to do it.  Japanese government and Princess Cruises, need to do the right thing."
2020-02-06 20:52:27,Hence the phrase that long preceded the Coronavirus relating to the yuck-factor inherent to cruise ships:  Germ Barge.
2020-02-06 21:54:15,"This Virus situation has many factors involved.  International travellers all interacting in closer quarters on a Cruise.  But many of them travelled by plane in much tighter conditions.
Many would have used crowded transit systems also.  These interactions would be possible in many ports of call. So with over 50 million people under quarantine just in China lets hope things can level out and go back to normal. Pray or Hope."

2020-02-06 20:54:50,"In the old days before medicine and vaccines, when a ship sailed into port in Europe with a crew stricken with small pox or the plague, they would let all of them die and then burn the ship.   So happy that we no longer live in those times, but sad for everyone who must experience the fear of encountering a new disease on a cruise ship or a locked down city in China.  

I've seen some disgusting comments about China and their society, easy to take a shot at them, but like us they too have friends and loved ones they worry about and actually must plan funerals for, so a little empathy would be nice.  Diseases come from every corner of the world (anyone remember the Zika outbreak in Brazil?), it's just China's bad luck this time around."
2020-02-06 20:16:55,"I understand that those identified as infected are being taken to hospital, as they should be.  But if anyone knows and can contact people who think they are sick but no medical care is available--in some parts of China, or?--then this might be useful.

This is a link to a hospital in Georgia that practices the old, pre-anti-biotic methods of clearing of the lungs, for people with pneumonia or cystic fibrosis.  It's a method of loosening lung congestion with systematic thumping on the back, or by vibration, while in a posture to aid drainage.

I understand these methods were used by--if I recall correctly--Seventh Day Adventist hospitals during the Spanish Flu epidemic.  The mortality rate was much lower in the hospitals where this was practiced as part of the patients' care, compared with hospitals that didn't do it.  
May you all be well!"
2020-02-06 23:39:32,"And the real plan is...

Everyone is being quarantined on the ship for 14 days because 10 people were diagnosed with the virus and we want to make sure no one else is sick before letting them disembark and possibly spreading the virus

Now, days later, 10 new people were diagnosed as sick

Each time there is a new person diagnosed as sick, the 14 day quarantine clock needs to be reset and restarted

Just wow. Guess, the American way of bombing people into submission is much more civilzed. Well heck, I mean those few hundred thousand dead in Iraq were all terrorists right? Or most were and what were the others doing consorting with them anyhow?Well fine, not terrorists but they had WMDs. No WMDs, yeah well they would've had them if they had the science to make them."

2020-02-06 23:30:52,"Hopefully this is the end of this giant ship and their failure to deep clean these ship after each cruise, really show the lack of concern with cleaning and more on a rush to get another ship full of people out to sea.
When we will start seeing the effect of throw all those people on a plane from China and only scanning them with some gauge without real testing to confirm a disease or not, because we all know the airlines DO NOT CLEAN THEIR PLANES after each trip just get the trash out and off they go"
2020-02-07 12:34:45,"Nothing but empathy for the victims, their families and the brave people fighting this terrible disease. I hope our country and others will find numerous ways to help out China. 

It's been disturbing to read so many anti-Chinese posts over the past weeks. Now is not the time to berate those doing all they can to survive. 

While there are clearly elements that were not handled well there is also plenty of evidence of a robust and targeted attack. I think a few western nations might want to pause and consider if they could build a hospital from the ground up in ten days. I'm betting my house that the US could not. 

As a world, let's learn from this. SARS, Ebola and now the Coronavirus are urgent wake-up calls about the necessity of practicing  and being fully prepared for a major pandemic. What we're learning is that you cannot wait to respond. You have to have a game plan--planned down to the last detail--the moment an outbreak begins. 

Often that means overriding those who counsel caution. Better to assume the worst, plan for it, and overact than to wait fateful and fatal days. Curtailment and containment = life.

Something we can all do is support our CDC and the WHO. They are the front-line between us and chaos and death. Full credit to all fighting this disease. May they stay safe and help as many as possible to survive."
2020-02-07 12:38:12,"Dr. Li is a hero; I am so glad that there was mention of his children, since we knew so little other than his willingness to risk his position to send out a warning to the world, defying the all powerful government.

It is true, as Wang Run stated, that people in many nations want security and stability, but that stability is an illusion when those in control suppress the sharing of facts and knowledge. 

""Will you be more stable if you cover the others’ mouths while walking on a tightrope?""

2020-02-07 12:33:32,Clean clear drinkable free water to wash with is what China really needs and until China does something about its eighty percent polluted water ways this SARS epidemic will continue and continue and continue until it’s here
2020-02-07 12:57:30,"We are definitely in a crisis here, and it is more than just a Chinese or Asian problem. It is systemic and global. 
I am far from a conspiracy theorist, but my common sense alarm has been ringing like crazy. The virus lab in Wuhan, the severe concentration of new cases and deaths near the epicenter, the clear knowledge that many of the infected are not confirmed due to a lack of tests and constrained medical facilities, and a young doctor who has died from the very virus for which he raised a red flag. The same doctor that was essentially silenced by the authorities about what he discovered. 

My common sense cannot allow me to take things at face value. Even if I did, Trumps assurance that everything will be ok makes it clear: it will not.

As tests become available to local jurisdictions, I think we may see exponential increases in infection rates globally. Hope for things to get better soon, but prepare for conditions to deteriorate."
2020-02-07 13:39:01,"The Indonesian health minister seems to take a risky approach waiting only for symptoms to arise before testing, when it is already suspected that asymptomatic infected people can transmit the disease.  Let’s hope he is right - Indonesia can’t afford this epidemic"
2020-02-07 14:03:11,"There is very little doubt that the new coronavirus is major threat to the world and all of us who are alive. It is also clear that if local officials had had the courage to take appropriate measures the problem would not have been nearly as big as it is.

As mentioned by others both here and elsewhere China bashing is easy to do and perhaps with the credibility of the US president being what it is, it can not be a surprise that other presidents are not considered very reliable either. Nevertheless it is entirely counterproductive.

As I am a male over 60 I feel that I would be at considerable risk where it to come to Europe before a vaccin becomes available. In part for this reason I have followed the numbers on a daily basis. Some question the reliability of these numbers, but to me they seem consistent, although I think it is highly likely that the initial numbers for Hubei and Wuhan did not reflect the actual numbers. Even though every day numbers of confirmed and sever cases as well as deaths increase, it is noticeable that the rate of increase is slowly coming down and I expect them to decelerate further. This suggests that measures taken are effective, even though I think the total number of deaths may well rise to above 2000 and perhaps reach 3000. That is a large price to pay for neglecting to take appropriate measures.

I just hope that the coronavirus does not reach a poor country that doesn't have the resources to contain it."
2020-02-07 13:54:59,"So of the 3700 passengers and crew, in over one week, only 273 passengers screened and 61 of them found infected.

What is Japan waiting for  to test all. That should have been done in first 2-3 days.  This is beyond incompetance."
2020-02-07 13:48:25,"Maybe, just maybe, the death rate outside Wuhan is so low because it takes three weeks to kill somebody, and the areas with the low death rates haven’t been infected that long. Wuhan’s much higher mortality rate shouldn’t be viewed as an inexplicable anomaly, but as a harbinger for all affected areas with substandard medical care."
2020-02-07 13:14:09,Oh he praised him? Even after we found out that they tried to initially cover it up when one of the first doctors told them about it? That doctor is dead now from it. Pretty smart president we got here. Think he asked for any political favors as well?

2020-02-07 14:30:48,"No doubt the number of deaths can reasonably be confirmed; but, the number of infections is very difficult, in part, because how does one really know the person has or has not the virus.

That said, the number of dead and infection are perhaps much higher than reported.

For American travelers: What if a person came thru JFK (or more than one) who was infected and subsequently died.  Do we close down the airport?  Or, what does the CDC say about areas of possible infection.  This situation could lead to panic and confusion."
2020-02-07 14:47:53,"My heart goes out to all those suffering from this virus, those sick and family members and friends, with sick and deceased loved ones.

I am 75, safe so far, despite knowing there is one patient confined to hospital in my city.  

But I think about the future.  Would I survive if I caught the virus?  What if my son (age 50) and his fiancé (51) also catch the virus?  Everything is already arranged for transfer of assets of I die.  But what if they do too?  I’m considering - in that case - making sure it goes to the least fortunate among us - the poor in certain countries, a particular charity I give to.

We must all look to the future.  The future of all of us.  Whether family, friends or humanity at large."

Ones heart goes out to all the health workers, scientists, and their families as they face risk and suffer loss themselves working to stem the effects of this virus."
2020-02-07 14:45:05,"Quarantining both ill and non-symptomatic people together in close quarters seems dangerous to those who are not symptomatic and indeed may not have the virus.  
It actually may be a death sentence, since a cruise ship doesn’t have appropriate facilities to properly isolate & treat the ill while protecting the heathy.  Scary."

2020-02-07 15:18:04,How nice that Trump congratulated Chinese President Xi Xinping while in true Trump fashion not offering any humanitarian aid that China desperately needs to test and control the spread of the coronavirus.

We pay taxes to keep this government running. We expect you to keep us safe. If you can't do that, what the heck does the state even matter do for us anymore. You're in charge and you are in control, Mr. President. You own this if it gets out of hand in the U.S due to negligence. Please, you need to be honest and do your duty!"

2020-02-07 16:05:32,"Maybe this won't quell the rising hysteria, but it might help if we read about the Black Plague during the Medieval Ages.  Rather striking similarities are appearing.  It seems that despite the enormous technological progress we have made, our limbic system has not evolved very much.  If we want to look for culprits, it is the human population and its expansion.  It is moving into areas populated by animals that can spread disease to humans.  The animals are losing their habitat and the humans are losing their lives."
2020-02-07 16:07:58,"WORRIED ABOUT CORONAVIRUS? I'm seeing an increase in mask use in public areas. A caution from me, a former RN used to wearing a mask when caring for patients in isolation: if it's not a N95 mask, it won't protect you from the coronavirus or other viruses. It will only protect others from droplets if you cough. 

Also, a N95 mask only protects if it is properly fitted. As a nurse I had to attend an annual ""Fit Testing"" where a N95 mask was chosen and tightly applied. Then my head was inserted in a plastic cylinder and a saccharine solution sprayed inside the tube. If I could taste or smell any sweetness, I needed a smaller/ tighter mask, and the process began again.

But I do carry liquid sanitizer in my purse and use it often. Another caution: check your sanitizer. Not all formulations are effective against viruses."
2020-02-07 17:10:27,"Given the ability for the virus to spread very readily while the carrier continues to be non-symptomatic, doesn't logic tell us the cruise ship quarantine gets reset back to zero every time someone new comes down with CoronaVirus?  Is everyone on that Japanese ship destined to eventually get the Corona Virus?  Scary thought for those currently on a cruise ship (or an investor in one)."

2020-02-07 17:57:57,"There's something I don't understand about the ship quarantine. It is only for 14 days. But an individual could have contracted the virus from a person not exhibiting symptoms 3 days before the 14 days has elapsed. Then they would not show any symptoms either and in 3 days would be released into the population. This could be happening over and over again aboard the ship, people being infected from ""invisible"" carriers all along the course of the 14 days, right up until the last day of their quarantine. Day 14 of the quarantine people not showing symptoms yet infecting others not showing symptoms yet and joining the general populace. They should probably take all the cruise ship passengers off the ship and isolate them from one another for 14 days. That seems to be the most Insidious thing about this virus. That it is so contagious from people without any symptoms."
2020-02-07 18:25:48,"90% of the raw materials used in our generic medications are from China, which promoted herself as ""the world's pharmaceutical supplier"".  There are already severe doubts, and a few scandals (see Xantac) about the quality control of these essential materials.  And now could someone tell us if the supply is threatened?"
2020-02-07 17:54:58,"I viewed the interview on PBS last night with China's ambassador to the U.S. Apparently,  medical personnel are going house-to-house in Wuchan to check body temperatures of all residents and presumably be on the look-out for other symptoms.  This is to forestall folks descending on the hospitals be be checked, which would overwhelm the hospitals.  So while this seems like a reasonable approach, why not have everyone self- report via a web-connected digital thermometer that would instantaneously upload body temperature to a central server which would allow a medical personnel to map infections by location and identity in real time and eliminate the house-to-house search?  In general, wouldn't this be a good precautionary measure for any nation including ours?  Wouldn't such a self-reporting system make sense for all viral outbreaks?"
2020-02-07 15:26:44,"My heart goes out to the Chinese people suffering now. 
Please show a graph of the number of people with the virus per day so we can understand the growth rate. Thanks."
2020-02-07 15:33:33,"It must be admitted that outside of the inner circle of the Chinese communist party, nobody has the slightest idea of the virus's current toll. This is what you get when the political class controls the media (to combat ""fake news,"" of course.) 

The arrest of citizens who report what they see and the lock down of over 400 million people highly suggest that this outbreak is far worse than the Chinese politicians are letting on. 

Say a prayer for the Chinese people -- and for the rest of humanity."
2020-02-07 16:36:34,"If I'm on that cruise ship and I have tested clean for the virus, I want off. How can they hold everyone legally?

2020-02-07 16:50:42,"It is sad to see Dr Li apparently died due to the virus. 

But people... if someone at the CDC has done exactly what he did in shouting out alarm in the absence of any CDC verification... said CDC staffer would have been equally castigated by US officials.  

For a medical professional, proper protocol is to stay within chain of command and report upward to local and regional health organizations with facts and substantiation so that they can mobilize quicker and more effectively. 

With any new virus that infects humans, and can be mortal in nature.... you need organized and verified communication to the public.  Otherwise.. panic ensues very easily.. and may actually cause more fatalities in the process.   It is a difficult situation to manage.. both operationally, and in terms of communications and guidance to the public. 

Note: in China.. at the first signs of anything even remotely like SARS.... people panic and start fleeing the area rather than confine in place.  [Different society, responding differently].  And.. some of that probably happened in this case.. given how widespread the infection is now across China.  So.. I think it is a mistake for armchair Americans to be condemning and second guessing how China handled this. 

The challenge here is, even the Dr here thought it was simply seasonal cold or flu in his patient.  He was wrong, and until he fell severely ill.. he had no reason to raise alarm."
2020-02-07 17:27:07,Rather than waste our breath criticizing the Chinese government; we might urge our own president and congress to increase the funding for the CDC to deal with the flu we have.
2020-02-07 18:06:42,"Obviously climbing aboard a cruise ship is the last thing people should do, at this point. I can't understand why people even ride on those obscenely massive ships, to be herded around like cattle. And trapped onboard, if the unforeseen happens. Like a single passenger carrying this new virus."
2020-02-07 18:24:41,"It should be noted that announcing a contagion before public health measures are in place can cause people at the epicenter to scatter... inadvertently spreading the virus across a wide area, and creating hundreds of new epicenters."
2020-02-07 18:22:16,"China deserves credit for stepping up to the challenges of the Corona virus by adopting strict quarantine and is being more open about the number of infections 31,000+ and number of deaths 600+ which seems to be steady at around 2% of the number of infections. While all sensible precautions need to be taken, the mortality rate is not that worrisome presumably because the WUHAN CORONAVIRUS IS NATURALLY CURABLE  by an infected person's own immune response along with treatment of the severity of the symptoms. 

What is needed now is to continue the wearing of appropriate gloves, hand washing with a detergent and giving an infected person a fighting chance to mount an immune response by blocking the rapid multiplication of the virus as well as its speedy spread  in the lung. This can be achieved by administering effective antivirals. In the absence of a vaccine and the lack of a vaccine candidate on the horizon the currently available natural antivirals and other chemically synthesized candidates need to be evaluated with the urgency of now. I have an interest in sending envelope virus neutralizing compounds for testing to the Chinese agency that is supposedly testing antiviral candidates and I also have received other request for testing their candidate. I understand that there are agencies that are coordinating such efforts and I hope to get in touch with them."
2020-02-07 15:37:19,Reading online that a cruise ship docked in Bayonne. Some passengers had Ncov2019 symptoms are were removed by medical workers w/out protective gear. Remaining passengers were allowed to disembark.  Is this true?
2020-02-07 15:44:42,"This is a new strain of c-virus and health officials aren't certain what they're dealing with yet. I've taken a few cruises and can really empathize with those passengers confined to their staterooms 23 hours a day. It would make me want to jump ship!

This must also be effecting the airlines, or will. If you happen to be on a long flight and someone on board shows symptoms of coronavirus, would you be confined for 2 weeks when you land?"
2020-02-07 15:58:19,"I am surprised Japan has not removed all of its citizens (in possession of a Japanese passport and a current home address in Japan)  from the cruise ship to be quarantined on land for 14 days and evicted  the ship from the Yokohama port.  The ship cannot stay in Yokohama forever and the current situation poses a threat to the entire nation. The Japanese government has no obligation to care for noncitizens.   If that sounds cruel, brave yourselves to see  this type of treatment and more as the virus progresses."
2020-02-07 16:30:30,"""Many doctors believe that deaths and infections in China are undercounted because hospitals and laboratories are under severe strain to test for the virus.""

And also because China lies about virtually everything."
2020-02-07 15:33:03,"How is it possible we are not prepared for something like this? What is coming across loud and clear is that there was no plan, not anywhere for a situation like this. A highly contagious disease. Our leaders spend trillions on a military that is preparing to fight the wars of the past, with the weapons of the past. What we are seeing now is the war of the future. Bio-warfare is showing itself to be very effective at both spreading disease and spreading panic. Our government should have had a plan in place to deal with this, which would include quarantine hospitals on military bases, quarantine transport vehicles, like quarantine helicopters, and quarantine planes. Quarantine is the only way to stop the spread of a super contagious virus. Let us hope that our government learns the lesson and prepares for the bio-warfare to come. I am not saying the Chinese did this deliberately but their globe hopping citizens did a pretty good job of spreading it quickly throughout the world. In many ways this is a dress rehearsal for a much more lethal and equally contagious virus, let us hope we learn. There are many things to learn here, including cruise ships are an almost perfect way to spread virus. Also hoarding must not be allowed. This is a warning. lets pray our leaders can stop fighting each other long enough to concentrate on protecting US."
2020-02-07 18:55:52,"As cold as this sounds, it may take hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths in order to save millions.  Quarantines have to be 100%, regardless of the passport."
2020-02-07 16:30:42,"All of this news tells me that this epidemic (soon to be pandemic) is far more serious than we are led to believe, regardless of what the authorities are saying, including Wi and Trump.  We can be sure that the infections are far above 31,000 and that the deaths exceed the 600 that the Chinese have publicly announced.  Who should we trust?  With all of the shade that Trump has cast on the role of government, the American public is going to find it harder and harder to believe anything that Trump says about the severity and scope of this virus.  Since Trump has already told tens of thousands of lies in the past three years, how do we know that he is telling the truth this time?  As a matter of fact, we cannot but help feel nervous when Trump tries to reassure the public.  Our instinct will be to discount the reassurance regardless of whether it is well-founded."
2020-02-07 18:19:46,Of course Trump would repeat and herald Xi's communist propaganda. Trump very much wishes he could control his own messaging in the same way that China permits only the party line to be uttered and no statements contradicting or criticizing it to be made.
2020-02-07 17:28:17,"Dr. Li Wenliang is owed a debt of gratitude by humanity.   The fact that he fought and made the world aware of the emergence of this deadly new virus probably resulted in his death, but could also have possibly saved many others from infection.  His case illustrates why it is important for conscious people everywhere to expose wrong doing or danger when it is observed."
2020-02-07 17:36:59,"I find the news of the cruise ship in Japan to be more of a concern than what is happening in China. The cruise ship seems to show how contagious the virus is in close quarters. Airplanes have similar conditions, particularly for long flights. Hundreds of thousands of people fly every day; the cruise ship seems to show how easily a single person could infect an entire plane. Containment of this virus seems almost impossible."
2020-02-07 16:11:52,"It seems our hospitals in California are now overflowing with flu patients, and urgent care patients are lined up around the buildings in some hospitals.  I wonder how our healthcare system might handle thousands of Corona patients if this epidemic grows."
2020-02-07 18:02:33,"It is interesting that past epidemics may have created the pathway to fight this new virus. MERS, SARS, Ebola, even HIV led to research into new anti-viral drugs which have already been used to save some Corona Virus patients, and are going into trial studies as we speak. It is also important to know that the Trump administration wants to cut funding to the very institutions designed to combat such viruses. Long range thinking is important for the survival of the human race. When you vote in November please take this into consideration. And also remember that totalitarian regimes, which are top down rather than bottom up style of governing, care more about image than lives. As of now we are still a functioning democracy where every life is important, because every life is a vote. Trump is leading us towards an authoritarian regime where the only life that matters is the man on top. Always remember that elections have consequences. Let us be thankful for the scientists and doctors who work in anonymity, their vigilance will save millions of life. It is odd, in this life, the ones who talk the loudest do the least and care only about today's pleasures, and the ones who truly matter are working right now, without fanfare solving the emergencies of tomorrow."
2020-02-07 19:34:41,"NYT may want to check up on Chinese statistics of the daily change illness rates. Posts on other social media sites have accurately forecasted illness rates for the past several days suggesting that what is being published are not actual numbers but - at best- estimates preconceived to fit expectations of a non-exponential outbreak. In other words, a disease outbreak model possibly would not follow that pattern.  We should be deeply concerned if the official numbers are being manipulated.  Disclaimer: I am not an epidemiologist or a statistician."
2020-02-07 19:54:54,"The quarantined cruise ships might be an efficient public health test. Not only do we need to know the numerator (number of people sickened by the disease), but we also need to know the denominator (who has the virus, but are without symptoms)."
2020-02-07 20:07:02,"A way to stop an epidemic is to minimize contact by keeping people apart from each other as much as possible. Concentrating them in small spaces does the opposite. Minimize movement between countries, cities and provinces but let people self-quarantine by keeping away from others."
2020-02-07 21:23:32,"My sympathies to all residents of China and anyone on any of these cruise ships. I think it's time for everyone (e.g., government, health care professionals, NY Times readers) to move on from who's to blame to thinking about how to deal with an inevitable pandemic.  It's really too late for quarantining to do much more than slow the spread of disease. There are undoubtedly tens of thousands more cases than those ""confirmed.""  Some of this undercount is undoubtedly the fault of the Chinese government.  But by far the majority of undercount is due to two factors: This is a novel disease, so other than fever, there is nothing short of testing to indicate specifically coronavirus as opposed to influenza or the common cold.  It is highly probably that the disease is mild enough in many people that they are passing along the coronavirus without even realizing they ever have it (as opposed to early, asymptomatic transmission where someone eventually gets sick).  For example, actual numbers of influenza cases far exceed documented cases every year, and influenza has been prevalent in humans for thousands of years - or maybe in Neanderthals and Denisovans for all I know.  But, so far as I know, no one has blamed Trump for not stopping influenza."
2020-02-07 22:28:15,"Are they going to bar people with Chinese passports regardless of whether or not they have been to China recently, and allow everyone else to board, regardless of whether they have been to China recently?

2020-02-07 22:30:17,"These unfortunate souls stuck on cruise ships have essentially become participants against their will in a massive clinical trial which will do plenty to reveal the virulence  and deadliness of this novel virus.

The economic disruptions are just beginning to be felt, the societal disruption will be unlike anything American has experienced since the Spanish Flu pandemic of 19018-20 which wiped out entire families and created orphans in widows in days or less than week form the first clinical signs of illness.  Our preparations and plans will prove grossly inadequate to the challenge and since we only recently started blocking and screening air travelers, the virus is likely already incubating in many people with mild infections or asymptomatic infections.   The political instability which a global pandemic may cause is quite alarming and as the death toll mounts in the PRC, we should all be gravely concerned - because peace and prosperity are merely delusional veneers which can be stripped away in days as food distribution collapses in recently urbanized nations with inadequate healthcare infrastructure.  Unlike 1918, when the only WMD was chemical weapons, today there are many already unstable nations in possession of NBC - and a culling of leadership could lead to civil strife and violence and refugee crises unlike anything we have witnessed since WW II.  Thing are about to get very ugly and our CIC and POTUS is grossly incompetent and woefully ignorant of what is coming down the pike."
2020-02-07 22:28:56,Locking them on a ship insured they will all get sick
2020-02-07 16:27:10,"From the article:  After speaking by telephone with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, President Trump said on Twitter that “he will be successful.”

Problem here.. the guy with more than 15,000 verifiable lies to the public.... simply cannot say anything and be trusted that it is true. 

See.. this is where public confidence in the President of the United States being trustworthy in telling the truth becomes critical.  If Americans could trust that anything he says is truthful... it would go a long way in settling worried Americans.  

Instead.. it will likely have the opposite effect here.. because he is a known pathological liar, even to his base.  His base just does not care.... but they know he lies.. so he is not soothing their feelings of confidence either."

2020-02-07 20:09:41,"CNN writes this:

""The vessel has been quarantined since Tuesday, and passengers are expected to remain under quarantine for at least 14 days — so roughly 11 more days. ""

Correct me if I'm wrong (got my infos from movies etc.), but that's not how it works:

1) The quarantine lasts at least twice as long as the incubation period
2) The ""timer"" is reset every time there is a new case

So, we are talking about 28 days starting today, not 11, right? And it seems the virus is still spreading on that ship, despite the quarantine.

Still, a ship is the place to be, weirdly:

1) Everybody knows your status, so nobody is suspicious, as with air-travel right now
2) Lots of cabins, maybe even dividable, to isolate people from each other
3) Enough power and fresh water (as long as the fuel doesn't run out, unlikely if anchored, water is generated on board)
4) 3:1 ratio in terms of potential patients vs. dedicated supporters (stewards, waiters, everybody in the crew - assuming they take precautions and don't fall ill themselves)
5) Medical help for serious cases is only a few minutes by boat/chopper away

As long as someone drops food and medical supplies on the ship this should be the least of the worlds worries regarding the virus. Still, best of luck to everybody on board, you all will have quite a story to tell upon your save return home!"
2020-02-07 22:26:59,"It is scary that a quarantine results in more illness. Wow, what can we do?"
2020-02-07 19:30:07,"I would hope the United States would have stopped all flights, except for citizens to be quarantined, between Hong Kong as well as China.   Chinese people, as reported by a Chinese citizen, are leaving the country through Hong Kong, and this has not been stopped to my knowledge.  I certainly understand the feelings of Chinese citizens, but please do not leave and risk infecting the rest of the world.  Our country is more in the position to help if we are not overwhelmed by our own epidemic.  I notice the cruise ships have stopped taking people from Hong Kong."
2020-02-07 19:37:01,"I'm no epidemiologist, but this is beginning to look like a Whac-A-Mole game that can't be won."
2020-02-07 21:06:56,"Japan should have no problem to handle a ship with coronavirus victims.  Japan should send medical personnel to the boat to handle guarantee issues.   Giving time, the virus  problem should be resolved.

Japanese government provided medications, medical clothes and masks to China in the very early stage to help the supply issues. They should have enough supply if the coronavirus did spread in Japan."
2020-02-07 19:58:15,"On large cruise ships, as in Japan, passengers are being quarantined on the ship and numbers of Corona cases are increasing, because people are sharing the same air, especially in cabins that have no windows.  The people who are not ill should be quarantined in a space that does not share air and heat.   Now other people are getting infected who would likely not, simply because they are breathing the infected air.  It makes no sense, unless there is a decision to sentence to illness the remainder of the passengers."
2020-02-07 21:34:54,"I cannot even imagine what it must be like to be on that ship right now. Or in one of the places in China under quarantine. Terrifying. 

Every time I catch a cold, I remind myself that every day that I am in good health, I should be brimming with gratitude. Never more so than now."
2020-02-07 17:40:29,"This just happened for a cruise in NJ. Why did they allow everyone to disembark? I hope the medics will be fine and that those individuals w/o symptoms will take the proactive action to self-quarantine. It's one thing to set a policy. It's another to execute. What is CDC doing? NJ and NY are so crowded that this was not the responsible thing to do for the public, if this news is true.

We need to hope that Trump, DHHS, and republican states don’t handle the coronavirus outbreak as badly as China has.  One can only hope , as well, that Trump won’t tell as many lies as he usually does—could lead to more deaths in the US.  Even deaths among his base??!!"
2020-02-07 17:53:01,"Let's put things in perspective, when H1N1 (swine flu) first came out in the US in 2009, the ""CDC estimates that 151,700 and 575,400 people died worldwide"" in the first year alone.

Try to remember your own response and how the US government/world reacted then, before going all holier than thou.

This can happen anywhere in the world as long as viruses mutate, so drop the America First and collaborate as an international community."

2020-02-07 18:29:12,"Trump has effectively banned science from federal policy. He and his science-hating supporters need to sit down and shut up now, because dealing with this virus is a job for the science-trained elite the Trumpers all despise with such vigor.

These Trump types have put our country at risk with the resentment and suspicion they hold towards science and scientists.

China supports science. China has put a lot of money into science education and into scientific research. They believe scientists on climate change. They trust that science seeks the truth and this truth protects us from many things.

It makes my blood run cold to hear Trump and his ilk praise the Chinese, while they're actively seeking to cripple and destroy science in ths country."
2020-02-07 21:48:17,"Wonder if totals of infection are completely accurate, deaths included. How about those that were mild, as well as probably could not be seen? reports are some dying before being seen.

2020-02-07 19:44:25,"It may not be a good idea to keep those passengers on the ship, including elderly and children, rather than relocating to another site for quarantine as has been done with airline passengers.  Food servers, utensils, etc are going from one cabin to another and food service may become a means of transmission.  Handrails, doorknobs etc. become potential ways of transmission.   What is the medical care on-site ?"
2020-02-07 17:57:01,"So what to do?

We are supposed to be leaving on a cruise out of Miami next week and we are quite close to canceling it. I am not necessarily afraid of contracting that virus; instead, I am petrified at the idea of a potential quarantine. With 5000 people in one boat (more if you count the cruise), chances are of someone presenting like the coronavirus is not small. 

Truly at a loss on what the right thing to do but increasingly, we are leaning towards cancelling."
2020-02-07 23:08:38,"It seems like common sense at this point for cruise lines to cancel cruises in Asia for the near future.  If even a few passengers test positive, thousands are forced into quarantine.  Some ships are being refused permission to dock altogether.  It simply makes no sense to continue with these trips."
2020-02-07 23:59:11,"If this becomes a pandemic will ill people and their family members be quarantined? Will travel to and from work be restricted in cities with high levels of the virus? How would that affect the economy? Those photos from China are worrisome, with affected cities looking like ghost towns."

2020-02-08 01:09:39,The number is cases/deaths reported is based on tests that show a match with the pathogen nCoV2019. Shortages of test kits have been widely reported. I think it's reasonable to think the actual numbers are much higher than what is being reported.
2020-02-08 01:13:47,"The daily growth rate seems to have dipped from 20% earlier in the week to about 11% now.  And the total number of new cases seems to be around mid 3000.  While still too high, I'm glad to see the growth rate slowing.

Best wishes to everyone impacted."
2020-02-08 01:40:11,"Great journalism and the best account of this story I have seen i n any form.  As a career health care worker and one who has a cruise planned from Vancouver BC, I am also very interested in seeing how this story evolves."
2020-02-08 02:02:35,"More like the 'officially reported' death toll is 700.

Only deaths confirmed by a test seem to be officially counted.   The actual toll is fat higher with bodies collected from the street and elsewhere going straight to the crematorium and others listed as mere 'pneumonia'.

Realistic counts would be far more useful in analyzing the outbreak but China seems far more concerned with controlling the public perception.  

Whatever the official numbers, the pictures of empty streets says far more."
2020-02-08 00:53:32,"There soon would be boycott of the cruise lines and the rallying cry will be their values not aligned with Chinese value, which resonates with how people feel if being unfairly treated."
2020-02-08 01:14:16,The Chinese government is lying about the numbers.  A data person on Reddit has effectively predicted what numbers they will release based on some quadratic model with scary accuracy.  They are propagandizing like they always do to the detriment of global health

2020-02-08 01:12:28,"So, the US and WHO have offered help and China declined. They are winging this on their own without the necessary expertise to avoid looking weak. They truly don’t care about their people."
2020-02-07 23:37:32,"The cruise ship setting may be a better place than a hospital if there are medical personnel in board. How each cruise ship cleans, disinfects and works with local health care to guarantee all passengers are being isolated, being fed, and being monitored for signs of fever, then it may be a better setting. I would not want to be stuck there, but it is probably safer than most of the people in Wuhan have been dealing with."
2020-02-08 03:36:18,"The prospect of Wuhan coronavirus showing up in Africa, since there is still travel between China and the African continent, is terrifying. The virus is highly transmissible, and infected people remain asymptomatic for days. It's hard to feel optimistic, but we have to hope the pandemic can be forestalled."
2020-02-07 23:48:42,Considering to how many people live in China and their government lying to stay in power this may not have even started.
2020-02-08 00:49:19,Does the virus come in through your skin?  Otherwise why do you need these protective suits.
2020-02-08 02:01:38,Hilarious to read all the bashing of President Trump. If he had criticized China’s response rather than praised it you would have called him racist. Just admit that the liberal inability to see any good in anything accomplished by the administration is surely what will re-elect him in 2020. Approval ratings went up during his impeachment. Americans - even those that don’t like Trump much - are tired of listening to the incessant whining and accusing. Liberals are the boy who cried wolf: no one is listening anymore.
2020-02-08 03:15:35,"Does anyone else think it's strange that the doctor who tried to blow the whistle on this virus is now dead? I don't trust that the Chinese government didn't have him killed to ensure he wouldn't be around to reveal the true story when he recovered AND to save face for themselves AND to send a very clear message - don't humiliate your country by making us look bad on the public stage. 

Also, when Donald Trump says not to worry, I definitely start worrying."
2020-02-08 03:35:55,"What happens if a cruise ship passenger or just person off the street becomes ""feeling sick""...and he/she has no health care insurance.

Is the Trump administration going to allow people into hospitals who feel sick or have fevers..which of course, could be anything but the coronavirus.

At an average rate of $2000. per day for a bed..this decision maybe something to think about.  Lastly, most have seen the horrific conditions of homeless people in San Francisco or Los Angeles.  I would suspect most of those people are not in the best condition, in fact, no doubt most could do with a warm bath and a meal.  So, here comes somebody..who says..""I was close to a Chinese person..and now I feel sick..""  Does the hospital then measure temperature..and if the temp is higher than normal, then is admitted?  Think about this scenario for a moment."
2020-02-07 15:42:01,We need to evacuate the almost 500 Americans stuck on a cruise ship in Japan.  They are in bigger danger than the people we evacuated from Wuhan.

2020-02-07 01:25:49,"We need to urgently provide aid since if China fails to control the epidemic we will soon be part of the pandemic. This news is proof that reports over the past days of hospitals turning people away untreated due to lack of space were true. Hospitals have reportedly been unable to handle the huge and expanding caseload. Epidemiologists now estimate the true case count is over 200,000 in Wuhan alone. For days now infectious patients have been turned away and sent home, allowing uncontrolled epidemic spread of the disease. Now Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, the official in charge of control efforts, is ordering police to sweep of every home in Wuhan to force people into mandatory quarantine camps. Videos leaking through the renewed strict censorship show struggling people frog-marched into vans by police in protective suits. Can this work? People will surely hide from being arrested and transported involuntarily to what will be a death camp for many. This is guaranteed to cause panic. Clearly the CCP is desperate. It looks like they are losing the fight to control the epidemic.  My life, my daughter’s life and your life, all of us are personally at risk; if China fails the rest of the world is next."

Hopefully a medical breakthrough is on the horizon."
2020-02-07 01:50:16,"Most of the comments seem to be of the opinion that the Chinese government is losing control of the situation.  The Article writes of a progression from concern to anxiety to panic within the Chinese people.  Forced quarantine in camps will most likely create even greater panic (and  accompanying dissent).  Under these conditions, it is hard to assume economic creation and productivity are occurring.  If so, very soon, ""supply chains"" will break.  The USA, and other nations, will then experience shortages of product.  And how will we react?"

There is zero reason to believe the US government is any more truthful than the Chinese government. Zero. Especially this government. Our government poisoned the people of Flint and I never heard one peep about how America’s system was flawed. And imagine if we quarantined Chicago, LA or NYC. America’s culture of extreme individualism and lack of altruism would immediately spiral the entire situation completely out of control. In many ways, I think China’s government and culture are the best on planet earth for handling such a dreadful situation. Wishing the people of Wuhan the very best."

Unpleasant yes but the principle simple: The virus is exceedingly infectious less human contact less exposure and passing time hopefully seeing a dropping rate of infection.
Why plane loads of medical supplies are not arriving, interesting; Trump did offer aid.  And has Taiwan lifted its ban on export of mask?

If the W.H.O. has better options the Times can criticize and publish them otherwise perhaps praise due for China’s efforts to contain this affliction."

While the rest of the world is checking in with reassuring case studies showing the illness may be less risky than flu, the Chinese government is mounting a full-scale, military exercise of the surveillance and control state. 

It seems to me this is a convenient dry run for suppressing dissent in the future, or for locking down Hong Kong and rounding up dissidents. There appears to be no other explanation but something of that nature for the vastly excessive reaction of the government to an epidemic."
2020-02-07 01:48:26,"Does China’s government mean to sacrifice the entire population on the altar of their incompetence? If so, then there must be consequences in places like the United Nations, the World Bank, the WHO, and other international organizations as well as with other nation states.

There seems to be an opportunity of racism hiding behind anti China sentiments to surfaced in some of the social media comments. 
It's a pandemic which knows no races or nationalities. China is doing what other countries including America might not be do so like locking down a population of 60 million to prevent spreading. Is that wrong?"
2020-02-07 02:04:58,"It's very reminiscent of Chernobyl, save that the Soviets weren't embedded in everyone else's economy."
2020-02-07 02:29:41,The Chinese government is throwing Wuhan to the wolves in order to protect the rest of China. It's hard to interpret their actions in any other way.
2020-02-07 01:29:56,"Let us not forget this is a great human tragedy. The situation is incredibly serious, incredibly dangerous and is highly destabilizing for China. The official numbers of cases do not come close to reflecting the actual scale of this disaster, for this is what it is. Despite the draconian measures now being taken by the Chinese government this could well become a pandemic with the gravest consequences for all of us."
2020-02-07 02:19:06,"Amid all this, it should give the people of the world and in particular the population of China a reality check that when your (whether it's a virus or your opinion is different) situation no longer suits that of Mr. Xi, he will very readily throw you under the bus.

The saddest thing is that Xi and his party ultimately seems more concerned about controlling the perception of his image than to address the issues. 

It goes to show a lot that when the Chinese public were openly critical of the Hong Kong protesters, the ""disposables"" can just as easily be them."
2020-02-07 02:46:43,"The Chinese government is undoubtedly hiding the true magnitude of the disaster. Interesting that Tencent is mentioned as being kept on a leash as last night,  and for a short time, Tencent published what many people believe are the true infection figures on their page tracking the spread of the virus. These figures showed over 134,000 infected and over 25,000 deaths! The statistic was taken down very quickly but it was recorded by many and is now widely known.
Just think about it. The Doctor who first reported on the infection, is a man now known worldwide and who undoubtedly received the best treatment available is now dead from the disease. Is it really reasonable that less than 300 have died across all of China particularly knowing what we know about the poor treatment many are receiving? 
China's leaders are doing the only thing they know to do and that is clamp down to try to make sure the truth is not known.
The situation is much worse than we know."
2020-02-07 02:49:48,"The Chinese government is doing a much better job than the US government would be able to under similar circumstances. They are delivering food to 1.2 billion people in a systematic and coordinated way. Patients get the food free. Everyone else pays normal prices, but the food is fresh and healthy. Hospitals are being built in under 2 weeks. During Katrina, we saw that the US can’t even feed people in one city during a disaster.  It would take months or a year even under emergency circumstances to build a hospital."
2020-02-07 02:58:55,House-to-house searches sound like a really effective way to make sure everyone is exposed to coronavirus.
2020-02-07 03:08:44,"“Do you hear the people sing” is all over my wechat moments. I can only guess what it means, but my heart is breaking for everyone caught in this evolving tragedy. When voices are silenced from speaking, I guess singing is the only option."
2020-02-07 01:23:28,"Let's stand in solidarity with the Wuhan people. Their government may be different from ours, but their humanity is equal and absolute. 

The world is watching. China, be truthful -- no matter what... Trust your people. The world prays for you, Wuhan. Let #GodBlessYou"
2020-02-07 02:51:55,"There are two big areas of fallout in addition to those in China who are already infected:
1. Those who can't get medical care for other conditions, can't get adequate food or help, and become ill and die. We don't know how many have, but that certainly must be occurring, from what I am reading here.
2. The effect this will have on the world's economy.  Here, we already saw that Boeing's woes affect its suppliers. Chinese labor and products are everywhere worldwide. This will effect every global company here. Chinese tourism is a big deal. Or it used to be.  That is a phenomenal amount of money lost. If one key part comes from China, this is going to be a nightmare.

If the outbreak in China goes on like this for several months, and China closes down, we are headed for a recession.

If the infections that are being brought abroad start to spread, too, all bets are off.  That might not happen, but it would be unwise to think it can't.

Who saw this one coming?  It's predictable, and the next one may spread like measles or kill like Ebola. Or both."
2020-02-07 01:15:05,Horrifying.  Wishing those affected well.  Hoping the virus is contained soon.
2020-02-07 01:15:28,"I remember the panic SARS had on Asia as a child. I was only 7 and in Singapore at the time and even though SARS wasn’t a big threat yet, our schools were closed and face masks handed out. Hygiene schools were set up and people had a palpable sense of fear - especially as Singapore had a large ethnic Chinese population and was a transport hub. If that was the panic back in 2002/3, it’s very interesting to see the dichotomy of panic in a super plugged in world ranging from sheer desensitisation to anything not “on your doorstep” and blatant fear - usually in the same moment. The good thing about being plugged in is that you can keep an eye on loved ones and friends and colleagues very easily! Handy in times of crisis!"
2020-02-07 01:17:30,Will sick elderly people be separated from their care-giving adult children? Will sick children be separated from their parents?
2020-02-07 01:25:01,"“It said some of the country’s giants, including Sina Weibo, Tencent and ByteDance, would be placed under special supervision to ensure “a favorable online environment for winning the war for prevention and control of the coronavirus outbreak.”

How is this different than what Zuckerberg is doing in te US?"
2020-02-07 01:25:16,"Get ready for a pandemic. Remember learning about exponential growth in school? If this continues, by the month's end, we will have a quarter of a million cases. By the end of March, four million. 

This is not a drill. This is coming, and we need to be prepared."
2020-02-07 02:17:38,600 deaths seems implausible based off the scope of their reaction and all the other reports they have failed to suppress. We may be looking at something closer to the Spanish Flu in terms of mortality rates.
2020-02-07 03:10:29,"To regain its moral world community standing, at least a bit, China should close its own borders to all but emergency aid."
2020-02-07 01:33:41,"When the experts start comparing this pandemic to the Spanish Flu, it's time to freak out.  That one killed some 50 million people worldwide.  And many of them were young people cut down in the prime of life."
2020-02-07 03:01:52,Is that smog?
2020-02-07 02:05:53,"This is awful.  I feel so badly for these people and wish our government would offer support.  

As bad as it is today, every next day is worse.

I hope it begins to taper off soon."
2020-02-07 02:23:27,And the lack of sympathy and assistance for the Chinese people from the global community speaks volume of the effectiveness of Western propaganda in demonizing anything Chinese.
2020-02-07 01:52:31,I want to thank the Times for such great reporting on this situation.  While other media outlets seem to be deferring to whataboustism comparing this to the flu (an apples to oranges comparison) the Times is sticking to the facts the best they can despite obvious information limitations.
2020-02-07 03:28:57,If the death rate in Wuhan is >4% does anyone really believe the rate elsewhere is only 0.17%?  Seems impossible...
2020-02-07 02:50:40,"I think Trump admin. has been unusually quiet.  WH has held no special briefings and are trying to pretend no big deal to protect the stock market , so that Trump can brag about it.  We would like to know what is CIA analysis saying about the extent, severity, mortality and spread of the disease.  My guess, they sure have lot of information and people on the ground in China and Wuhan.  Please break the silence."
2020-02-07 03:06:35,"My heart goes out to all who are affected....let us remember our common humanity and not treat those who are infected as lepers.

No matter which country is facing this illness."
2020-02-07 03:04:56,"Thanks for the report, and it really came in time, Doctor Li passed away this morning, all we need is truth."
2020-02-07 03:14:29,"This is a war I hope China wins. Sadly, the whistleblower Dr. Li died from the virus, at least that's what we've been told."
2020-02-07 01:35:14,"This could be catastrophic. Meanwhile our stock market is booming. What's wrong with this picture? Kind of sad don't you think?  

""Greed is good, let them eat cake, let's create another loophole, the President didn't do anything wrong, climate change is a hoax, Russian interference is fake news""

Once again Rome is burning, what will you do about it?"
2020-02-07 03:05:29,"China manages its economy on the cheap for the benefit of the wealthy at the expense of its population with the most significant disparity of income and wealth in the world.

On the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus, as will as the previous pandemics of SARS, etc., all of which originated in China, China’s unregulated livestock industry is a cesspool of dangerous viruses and bacteria. There are many reports of the outbreak of dangerous virus among animals, most recently pigs, in China which forces the culling of large herds of animals. This is why the West has a prohibition for the import of any animals, fowl, etc. from China. The science of the transfer of virus from animals to humans has been proved. There will be more pandemics originating from China as long as China’s livestock industry is unregulated."
2020-02-07 03:21:31,"The problem here is the government is so scared of public anger that they are fighting two wars at once - the virus itself and silencing critics. I am a Bernie supporter but this is where he and Trump overlap - far too long we've put too many eggs in the China basket and were going to get burned. Their economy is so vital to global economy yet the government is extremely secretive and authoritative. You couldn't trust the government at any time - not with their debt, their economic numbers, their laws, etc. China was slowly on the way to more openness until Xi took power and considered himself Mao 2.0."
2020-02-07 03:45:03,"What can the international community do to help the people of Wuhan? Are there reliable charities involved that we can donate to, or any other form of aid that we may contribute to? 

My heart goes out to all the families impacted by this. None of us is immune, as the coronavirus  appears to be going global pretty rapidly. I hope we can all remember our humanity and interconnectedness during this time."
2020-02-07 03:24:56,"Can the international community, such as UN Peacekeeping or some other international organization step in to ensure against human rights violations?
Very scary situation if people are being forcibly rounded up as this article says. I hope there is some sort of oversight by the international community."
2020-02-07 03:10:12,"Now is the time to act. You can stay away from Syria and Yemen, but it is hard to escape a virus. For purely selfish reasons the free world should act. Where is the International Red Crescent? The medical experts are warning everyone that warehousing patients is not the best idea. All of China is going to become a quarantined zone. The Chinese have lived through mass starvation and cultural war. Over 400,000 Syrians have died over the course of civil war. However, the Chinese are the manufacturing floor of the world."
2020-02-07 03:13:06,"While I find that criticizing the Chinese government for failing to contain the virus is patronizing at best, putting together sick people in such facilities verges on the criminal in my opinion. I spent two nights in wards in an English hospital about twenty years ago and it was not a pleasant experience: you can’t sleep, you can’t read, people moan in pain, cough, etc. The bathroom was also shared. In giant wards such as the one in the photo, the situation would be nightmarish : maintaining basic hygiene would be impossible, the ones who don’t die from the coronavirus will die from dysentery or a variety of infections. Not only would it be cruel, but, if it is true the virus takes milder forms, it will be absolutely pointless and won’t stop the transmission of the disease."
2020-02-07 02:47:21,I can't see the virus continuing the current rate of new infections reported of doubling every 4 days. That would be 3.5 million in a month.
2020-02-07 03:11:46,"The doctor that died appears to be in his 30’s. I have read anecdotally of others in their 30’s dying of this virus. The WHO is still not releasing any official data of the ages of those who have died. Why?? Is China not letting them in?

It is beginning to seem, based on  the measures taken by China and the curious lack of accurate data, that this virus is potentially more lethal for younger, healthy people than we are being led to believe."
2020-02-07 01:47:04,My thoughts and prayers/good wishes are with the people of Wuhan and all of China. I studied abroad there in 2008 and can only think of all the kind people I met there. I hope they are well. I wish them strength. China has a huge population but every single one of them is a human being who deserves to be treated with dignity. I hope the Chinese government will remember that.
2020-02-07 01:08:59,If the Chinese government controls the flow of information how can anyone in China or the world know how dangerous this is?
2020-02-07 04:04:54,"It is very sad that patients are warehoused with minimal medical assistance.  I am wondering if most of the citizens in this area of Wuhan live in apartment buildings and share ventilation systems; if they do, this could be a medium to spread the virus.  Isolating people has not stopped the virus, so my guess is that the density of citizens is so great that it is difficult for them to not pass the virus around.  Isolating patients is a good idea, but hopefully they will receive more medical care so their prospects of improving are increased.  My heart goes out to those with this disease, and those in the epidemic's way.  Isolation with compassion is the way to go."
2020-02-07 05:14:52,"The CCP’s influence over the WHO is already abundantly clear. The WHO’s decision not to class the coronavirus outbreak as an international crisis was strongly influenced by how the Chinese regime wanted the issue handled even though they knew of this more than two months ago.  

Given the growing evidence of Chinese mismanagement of the coronavirus outbreak and WHO complicity in this, it is not too strong a statement to say that every person who dies from coronavirus is dying as a result of both the CCP and WHO’s failings."
2020-02-07 05:21:53,China has taken a massive economic hit. It has paid and more for the sins of perhaps neglecting good scientific warnings. There is a staggering shutdown of all factories and shops. The worlds manufacturing furnace is basically in shutdown. I would be more merciful in judgment of the leadership of a country of 1.4 billion people living densley together facing a horrific possibility. They are doing amazing things to ensure the rest of us are protected as well as themselves. My heart goes out to Wuhan's people with a staggering 4.57% death rate from the virus on my last reading.  The efforts of it  peoples some dying form overwork to fight this thing is beyond words of admiration.
2020-02-07 04:46:34,Can we say that China is sacrificing a entire city to save the world?
2020-02-07 04:25:42,"Our government has intermittently preached that government itself is the problem and that we shouldn't trust it.  It has met with intermittent success until now, when to prove the point, the government has made itself intentionally untrustworthy.

For example: how confident can we be in a government that in 2018 fired its entire pandemic chain of command:

<a href=""https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/31/coronavirus-china-trump-united-states-public-health-emergency-response"" target=""_blank"">https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/31/coronavirus-china-trump-united-states-public-health-emergency-response</a>/

And anyhow, picture Americans voluntarily subjecting themselves to the loss of ""freedom"" that quarantines would entail.  The situation could be helped by trustworthy public information from the media.  For this, we are at the mercy of partisan oligarchs who own major media outlets and whose editorial policies might not coincide with government pronouncements.

This is all rather speculative.  So, if you want concrete evidence that the U.S. may not be well positioned to handle a major disease outbreak, kindly review the recent history of FEMA in handling major, but localized, disasters.  Think Katrina."
2020-02-07 05:27:43,"I'm re-posting my comment below from elsewhere but I feel that more people should know about this:

I live in Hong Kong.  Like this article says, a virus like this ""must be cut off from the source,"" yet Hong Kong's borders with China are still open, meaning people from China can enter Hong Kong, then have access to the rest of the world.

Most countries have banned flights out of China, but only a few have banned flights out of Hong Kong.  And as long as the world allows flights from Hong Kong, the virus will keep spreading.

Starting Saturday Feb 8, all those crossing the Chinese border into Hong Kong will require a 14-day quarantine.  Too little too late.  Over 10,000 mainland Chinese people EVERY DAY for the past month have already come through, and god knows how many of those have left for a city near you.

The Hong Kong government's refusal to completely close all borders with China is vigorously protested by the people of Hong Kong and its front line medical staff; the rest of the world should, too."
2020-02-07 04:08:05,Suppression and absolute control has propelled Xi Jinping to the apex of power unseen since Mao. Yet the very same tactics that inspire fear and denial now undermine him just as powerfully.
2020-02-07 04:17:42,"In a country of 1.4 billion, 600 deaths is .00000428% of the population. More people die from car accidents every day than Coronavirus.

So why would China be so concerned?

Because the actual number is much, much higher.

Just this week, we've seen the Chinese media clamp down hard on all negative reporting, now we have ruthless Mao -Era Red Guards going door to door root out any and all possible infected people. The story is getting worse, not better.

It's an epidemic of epic proportions, and we better get ready."
2020-02-07 05:40:59,"The Chinese government is sacrificing any of their people who have a remote chance of having been exposed to the novel corona virus. They realize that until a vaccine is developed, the only way to stop the spread is to isolate and terminate everyone who could possibly harbor it. My heart breaks for these helpless and sickly people piled in warehouses."
2020-02-07 04:15:40,"My goodness, this seems barbaric. How many people who don't have the Coronavirus are receiving death sentences by being warehoused in close proximity to those who do?
.
Granted, this is a disaster, but this is the government that wants to replace democracies around the world as the best way to govern humanity.
.
I don't think so."
2020-02-07 04:52:02,So many expert criticisms of China's response to the epidemic yet so few expert suggestions.
2020-02-07 04:03:04,"Those that have recovered in the hospitals, are now immune and should have to do mandatory service at the hospitals and quarantines. In a place like China you can mandate such things and it appears to me they have no choice because they are poorly understaffed.  They can be trained to do certain low levels tasks."
2020-02-07 05:58:14,I hope this turns out to be a good lesson that supply chains need to stop relying so much on China.
2020-02-07 05:29:46,"My heart goes out to the voiceless many in Wuhan.
The faceless people in China and elsewhere who toil all over the world  will be the ones to be crushed first in disasters.Those at the top will protect themselves and their interests in good and bad times alike."
2020-02-07 04:47:05,"My heart goes out to these poor people enduring this horrific experience, having their lives upheaved overnight to this extent.

It's a humbling reminder that, regardless of the denial and hubris of some, we are part and parcel of the natural world. Ignore it at our own peril."
2020-02-07 07:54:15,"I am deeply concerned about this virus.  I don't see how it will be contained.  I think China is buying us some valuable time to hopefully develop a vaccine and create contingency plans, but I don't see how they're going to stop this.  We should be preparing for the worst, because if this gets out of control, it could upend our economy."
2020-02-07 06:31:04,I am impressed that the NYTimes actually has two reporters in Wuhan and hasn't withdrawn them like other news organizations such as CNN.  Hope they stay safe.
2020-02-07 06:55:26,Let’s pray for the departed. Amen
2020-02-07 04:39:14,"@ Eric, your post lacks perspective in ways that others here point out.  I simply want to comment on Flint.  That was no systematic cover-up of an active epidemic.  There was unacceptable denial and avoidance by some authorities but children were not dying left and right.  That is not to minimize lead exposure but to suggest you are comparing apples and oranges.
Most importantly, the pediatrician who identified the issue and advocated about until it was acknowledged was treated far differently than she would have been in China.  She was not hauled down to the police station within a couple of days of speaking up about it, jailed without chargEs forced to recant and say everything was hunky-dory, nor jailed for a couple of years as a social deviant when she continued to speak out.
China’s extreme authoritarianism, one-Party tule, social monitoring and complete suppression of an independent press cannot be compared to our own form of government — with or without the current administration."
2020-02-07 02:49:02,"The response to the epidemic seems to mirror the film Contagion more and more every day.  Going apartment to apartment in a city of 11 million, pulling away every person with a fever from home to a warehouse to be observed until they are well will likely result in many people with other febrile illnesses becoming 2019-nCoV coronavirus victims."
2020-02-07 03:16:11,"A student whose mother is a nurse in Wuhan said to someone I know that the morgues are full and bodies are stacked. A lot of people have died in their homes and have been left there. The situation is far worse than the government is admitting. And the fact that they delayed admitting that there was a problem at all begs the question of how many exposed people traveled before Wuhan was cordoned off, and where they went."
2020-02-07 05:45:42,why are they short medical supplies?  The world has tons of medical supplies and they fit neatly into airplanes.  they also have people on the ground who are doing everything they can.
2020-02-07 09:57:36,"Scary developments. It can not be fun to be trapped in a city with an outbreak of a rapidly growing epidemic. 

The story shows both the limited and opportunities of dictatorship. The dictatorship is the reason this was allowed to grow without effective response for months.

On the other hand dictatorship allows some pretty draconian measures which may prove effective, although rather inhumane sounding."
2020-02-07 05:00:20,"Everyone likes to criticize the Chinese authorities for the way they're handling the virus crisis--warehousing people and giving minimal care knowing that this will cause more deaths; suppressing news reports so we can't know how serious it actually is (ignoring the fact that no one probably knows accurate figures), but if they were not doing these things, which would not pass muster in a western society, I imagine the virus would have spread much more widely by now.  Perhaps we should lighten up on the Chinese and the way they're dealing with this thing--their methods are probably working for us."
2020-02-07 02:58:11,"One of the curious things about the coverage of the coronavirus in China is that I have not seen any mention of the army. Perhaps it is there and I have missed it. In all large nations the army has the capability to rapidly deploy fairly capable field hospitals. Perhaps the coronavirus in Wuhan would overwhelm what the army could do. Still, you would expect that they would be deployed and would provide some additional capacity. With all the written coverage and all the photos - where is the army medical corps? This is not a rhetorical question. If another reader knows the answer, I would appreciate if he or she would post it."
2020-02-07 03:01:46,"It won't be as bad here.  But if this becomes an epidemic here, I suspect it will be very bad.  Do you really think our medical care system can treat millions of corona patients with hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, while also treating the flu that is rampant and all the regular medical care that is needed?

I suspect that a great many people would end up receiving no medical care, just staying home and suffering with only nearly worthless over-the-counter medications.

Hopefully, Trump will really enforce the travel ban and quarantine to prevent a lot more of the disease from coming here.  And hopefully, we will be able to contain the disease that has already arrived here."
2020-02-07 06:26:01,""" With the sick being herded into makeshift quarantine camps, with minimal medical care, a growing sense of abandonment and fear has taken hold in Wuhan, fueling the sense that the city and surrounding province of Hubei are being sacrificed for the greater good of China. ""

When I read this article, I burst into a sadden laughter about the western bias media using these subversive word. ""herded"", ""camp"", ""minimal medical care"" and ""abandonment "".

Imagine a lockdown of California plus 10 millions people, this is what the government of Hubei province try to quarantine 50 millions around the epicenter Wuhan. The sheer number will overwhelm any healthcare system facing such a highly infectious zoonotic virus.

The most current infection data are 31,452 with 638 deaths. Ninety nine percents of the infection and 97% of the death are within China. As more diagnostic kit are available, the number of infections for sure is going to rise. I just hope the current strategy will eventually contain the outbreak. 

One of the epidemiologist from England predicted that the infection cases may be as high as 126,000. With the mortality rate of 2-4%, the number of death are ranged between 3,000-5,000. These are tragic number and human suffering on a grand scale. To the western media and the critic of "" Whataboutism "", the top public health issues facing this country such as opioid death 50-70,000 and gun-related death of 30-40,000 predictable annually seem to be in the back burner."
2020-02-07 08:34:46,"Australia is also 'warehousing' people as a quarantine measure.
243 Australians have been evacuated from China to a remote island and previous detention centre (Christmas Island). Most of its facilities are similarly sparse to the Chinese facilities mentioned in this article. Some people there have also reported they are sharing their rooms with cockroaches too and old linen left over from detention residents. The facility is surrounded by razor wire that was used previously to prevent detainees escaping.
Another plane load of evacuees from China will be sent to a former gas plant workers village outside remote Darwin in the Northern Territory.
The Australian government is also looking at opening up other detention centres that once warehoused asylum seekers and repurposing them for quarantine if the virus spreads."
2020-02-07 04:47:28,"An tragic and striking misalignment of politics and culture seems to have caused this debacle: Mass Chinese forced urbanization pushed millions into cities in tight proximity with no medical primary care--just hospitals. But simultaneously, peasant agrarian culture persists, and one feature of that  is massive live animal markets which animals--many wild ones including all manner of species--are often slaughtered on the spot for meat and traditional medicine and potions. That yielded  a dangerous hybrid virus. Put it all together, and China has apparently unwittingly created this monstrous collision of social engineering and its own  cultural traditions. The Chinese government has now pretty much imprisoned all Wuhan citizens in their city with food running out and medical care--always marginal--now non-existent. It is a failure of a monolithic communist system on a frightening scale."
2020-02-07 08:47:25,I taught at a university in Wuhan from 1990 - 1992 and it was a wonderful experience.  The people there and throughout the country were so friendly and helpful.  What’s happening in Wuhan now is horrible and I hope the people there (and all over the country) conquer the coronavirus real soon.
2020-02-07 07:33:55,"Tonight, there are reports that the city of Shenzhen and Guandong Province have been shut down.  Shenzhen is a major port and together with Guandong Province manufactures a huge percentage of the electronic components used in the world.  It appears that despite the desperate measures employed in Wuhan, the corona virus marches on in China.  My sympathies to those who are ill in China tonight and to the friends and relatives of those who have died.  Let us hope that there are lessons from Wuhan that can be used by the rest of the world to stop this terrible disease from spreading further."
2020-02-07 05:15:41,"The speed of new infections is still unrestrained exponential.  That indicates that the virus is neither exhausting its pool of sustenance, nor is any effort by the Chinese government doing anything to slow it down.  It is confining it, but it is not making ""great strides"" to conquer the virus, which is reproducing unchallenged."
2020-02-07 08:08:38,"Looking at the death rate which is in percentage means not depending from the total number if infections: if in wuhan it is 4 percent and in the rest of China 0,2 percent. It means that the higher death toll is because of the lock down. I actually wonder how many non-disease related additional deaths are caused by the lock down."
2020-02-07 07:38:17,There is probably no country in the world more capable of  controlling this epidemic. Centralized power has its advantages.
2020-02-07 05:16:42,"The liberal USA thinks its in a terrible spot given its problems with Trump, but when we look at this situation we see that we are breathing the free air - for now.  What a recipe for disaster.  Putting thousands of virus victims in cold stadiums with no medical treatment, is clearly going to artificially inflate the death rate.  All the signals point to a reality that these are no better than concentration camps, with the central government of China deciding to allow these ""sources"" to die in droves, as martyrs to mother China.  The crippling of the media and social platforms will only further compound the deaths as citizens and institutions are unable to collaborate and work together.  Meanwhile the Chinese with all its efficiency and lack of red tape in building hospitals, have little innovation capacity and are relying on the rest of us to provide a vaccine.

It almost makes me want to withhold the vaccine until they liberate the Chinese media and social platforms.  Except I am not a cruel autocrat and care about the welfare of ordinary citizens.

China for all its progress and recent wealth is decades if not more from gaining first world status."
2020-02-07 07:23:06,"It is strange indeed that the novel coronavirus fatality rate in Wuhan is above 4% yet just 0.17% elsewhere in China and virtually negligible worldwide. There may be two factors behind this discrepancy. One is Wuhan's poor air quality, as noted in a NYT letter by Prof. Peter Muennig of Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health. Such pollution, however, is common in many cities in China. The second, and perhaps more significant reason, may be the very close quarters -- the lack of person-to-person isolation -- among infected people in Wuhan's emergency rooms, hospitals and quarantine facilities (also depicted). It turns out that with feline coronavirus, solitary wild cats experience a relatively benign infection but in domestic multicat settings the virus mutates to reach a lethality rate of nearly 100%. Feline and human coronaviruses share similar biology so one can reasonably conclude that these crowded, multiple infected environments generate a very high risk for viral mutation in humans too. It is important, therefore, to understand that quarantine and isolation are not the same. Quarantine (to prevent new infections) is indeed important but, in order to minimize this mutation danger, isolation (keeping those already infected separate) is even more critical."
2020-02-07 05:06:42,I've started re-reading The Plague by Camus.  Seems to the point.
2020-02-07 09:36:53,"I too wish for the speedy recovery of all affected by this terrible virus and am hopeful that the spread can be contained as well as possible. 

However, we can’t forget that the cause is from exploitation of animals and keeping them in horrible conditions because some humans have a need to eat them.  This lesson hasn’t  been learned in spite of similar outbreaks in the past.

May all beings be happy!"
2020-02-07 08:33:01,This is getting out of hand. The world should come together to help combat this deadly virus. China as number two economy is struggling to contain this virus. There might be more deaths and infections than is being reported. Of course China will not want to portray any weakness which is why they might not call for outside assistance. You can imagine what will happen if these spreads to a countries with weak medical systems like in Africa. Something needs to be done and fast!
2020-02-07 10:00:47,The virus may mutate if the quarantine is not enforced. If human to animal transmission is established then the virus will spread extensively.
2020-02-07 04:12:12,"The scope of these lockdowns have progressed well beyond Wuhan. Two cities in Zhejiang province, Wenzhou and Hangzhou (home of Alibaba), both legitimate 2nd if not 1st tier cities with populations close to 10 million have been in effective lockdown for a while now.  I have relatives in Hangzhou and they are surviving off of groceries bought online. One person per household is allowed to go outside every other day. They can't venture in and outside their housing block without getting temperatures taken.  The Chinese government has realized how serious this epidemic is. I really hope the U.S. and the rest of the international community take this as a lesson and not let their guard down. It is much easier to be over cautious and nip this in the bud."
2020-02-07 08:36:54,"It is time for China to permanently ban wet markets, or we will all be suffering from this repeatedly every few years. I think China is modern enough to have refrigeration enough to sell processed animal meat like the rest of the developed world."
2020-02-07 05:42:30,"As an aside, can anyone explain to me why on earth anyone finds cruise ship stuff appealing? It just seems like the most appalling notion ever, in the most optimal circumstances. Why anyone in their right mind would ever subject themselves to being trapped on a massive vessel with a bunch of other unappealing people as a captive audience to a corporate overlord spinning crazed disney-fied versions of ""culture"" and ""entertainment"" and ""leisure"" out in the middle of the ocean is just profoundly puzzling to me.

What ARE these people thinking?"
2020-02-07 10:19:35,"I join others below in expressing great sympathy for Chinese in Wuhan.

But, it just goes to show that the communist system will eventually fail in China - for reasons it went into dustbin in Soviet Union.

A government that is supposed to be for the people, but definitely is not of the people and by the people.

Of the people because Beijing still thinks this is a political struggle.  It is not by the people as none in Beijing will ever stand in a free election where they can be held accountable.

As long as centralized control is declared paramount - all they can do is put lipstick on a pig.

But it is still a rotten system.

Having said that - the Chinese government can do it's people and the world good - if they supervise this - as it now appears - dangerous trade of wild animals - for food.

If Chinese government goes back to saying - it's their culture and proud of it.

That, this is just another epidemic after SARS, now Wuhan - who knows the next one?"
2020-02-07 04:31:13,There is no horror film or play that can compare with this illness as a story or a fear.
2020-02-07 05:23:33,"I spent over a decade living and doing business in China, and studied abroad at Peking University. My advanced degree is also-centered on China and trade, and I am fluent in Mandarin.
I have travelled throughout the land mass in China, and have been to most provinces except Xinjiang . My cultural studies in China are centered on martial arts and (TCM )traditional Chinese medicine .
I state these things to bring out that this crisis us undoubtedly worse then what is even being reported by the Times.
600 confirmed dead and the number of cases reported as contracted the virus is not believable for a second.
The Chinese government will play down the truth until it can’t hold it back anymore .
Death factor alone is probably 10X what is officially reported."
2020-02-07 07:11:33,"This is not really the time to vilify China over this pandemic.
To say the Chinese government has been guilty of under-estimating this virus plague seems pretty obvious. However can you imagine of any government being ready to confront this unique event of biblical proportions. 

There is a case in Britain where the government has decided an individual (journalist) placed under arrest for his news site. Julian Assange of WIKILEAKS a legal case like Daniel Ellsberg of the PENTAGON PAPERS of spilling the beans. So much for ""freedom of information"" or rather the lack of it; at times?"

I don’t want to diminish that this was excellent reporting, but I don’t recall the NYT’s devoting anything close to this much space to influenza last year.  I mean, almost 400 a day, and we didn’t close a single airport."

Hmm, how are things going Puerto Rico? I can't even imagine how horrific it would if this happened in the US. The government would likely build a wall and let everyone die inside. All these nasty comments about China coming from a country that can barely tie it's shoes, and a ruling elite every bit as cruel and inept, if not more."
2020-02-07 06:16:36,"In face of an epidemic that is already happening, it's no use to criticize anyone or any country. The right thing to do is to fingure out ways to stop the conoravirus from spreading. China right now is working hard at all levels to battle against the illness."

2020-02-07 11:03:31,"They missed the time frame to act. If they imprisoned everyone who came in contact with the infected individuals, the epidemic would have been contained."
2020-02-07 11:05:02,"The lethal outcome rate has been recorded below 0.02% so far; the outbreak is less severe than SARS of 2003; the Chinese Govt is making it worse than it could have been: they simply round up people suspected of being infected into huge warehouses with minimal (if any) care and let them do or die. Frankly, this is one
more case for upholding the Second Amendment for me."
2020-02-07 10:54:28,"I just can't get over the pictures of China...and I remember the pollution from my days there.  Yes, Coronavirus is terrible, but think of living in that smog everyday.  China has done a tremendous job of raising it's people up, but the environmental degradation to their country and our planet is just horrific.  And why is no one talking about the fact that endangered animals (tigers, elephants, rhinos) are regularly smuggled into this country    for 'traditional' medicine.  This is not the first time the Chinese have started an epidemic, because they will eat everything. The government there should be looking at other solutions in the future. They are raking the bottom of oceans and are responsible for one quarter of pork (in the world) being killed.  China, take a look at the pictures and think about what you are unleashing on the planet...not just another virus, but pollution so awful it affects us all."

2020-02-07 12:28:23,China's government doesn't seem to be up to the job.
2020-02-07 13:01:10,"The primary purpose of the Chinese government is to stop spreading of the Coronavirus disease and save the life of infected people.   On both accounts, China is doing that.  So far, the rest of the world seems in good hand that each country can control and monitor the situation. All but one death in the Philippine is in the process of recovery.

The secondary consideration will be much more and many. One of those things is to keep people's life in order.  Based on latest Hong Kong news, every province in China will be responsible to provide food, medication, personnel, and logistic support to every locked down cities including Wuhan, the original source of spreading.  Other objectives include building field hospitals in 10 days to handle severely infected people, and also converting public facilities into large temporary clinics to handle mildly or less sick patients.

In the meantime, public and private companies are rushing to test the anti-virus remedies.  There are already several been announced, which are in the field test stages.

China will be in a transforming stage that its population will be better informed and trained after this crisis. Already Chinese government is planning the return trips from homeland to office or factory locations after the Lunar New year.  Once the crisis is over,  and as usual, China will add vitality back to the global economy."

While passengers have their own cabins, they mingle with crew and other passengers (and potentially transmit diseases) in numerous locations like dining areas, bars, recreation venues, theaters, elevators, hot tubs, etc.

Crew are sardined in much smaller and densely populated quarters where transmission is even more likely; what could go wrong?

The idea of being confined to a cruise ship cabin for two weeks of quarantine is definitely causing me to consider canceling an upcoming cruise that docks at 7 ports, any of which could decide to quarantine the ship if coronavirus is discovered among passengers and crew."

For all these folks sympathy is in order.

True, for the next few weeks or months, anyone who books a cruise in, to or around Asia is certifiable or a big gambler. 

Given that the Wuhan coronavirus has spread in a short time to much of the world, booking a cruise anywhere is a bit of a toss-up now.

The debate about cruise ship vacations vs other ways to vacation can be argued indefinitely. My more pressing thoughts are with the crew. These workers need these jobs! I can only imagine the fear in every cruise ship worker as well as other travel industry workers as they worry how the impact of this horrible disease may play out. These jobs offer them a way to provide for their families not found in many of their home countries.  We also made sure to spend money in every port to help island residents earn a living.

Then there's the chance that the captain will sail too close to shore, the ship will capsize, killing a few dozen in lightless coffins that slowly fill with water.

Or maybe the power will fail, when the non-redundant electrical system malfunctions, and you'll spend a few days trapped in hot summer weather in windowless cabins without air conditioning.

If the Lancet Nowcasting paper was right, and there were already 75,000 infections in Wuhan by Jan 25, then we would expect it to have doubled twice by now (doubling rate of 6.4 days), and for there now to be about 300,000 infections. With that denominator, Wuhan’s case fatality rate would be much closer to what we’ve observed internationally (about 0.2).

Given the extreme measures in place, and high number of severe cases, this is probably overly optimistic — but it shows how important it is to understand and count mild cases (which, again, is what is being mainly being reported internationally)."

This is why the West has a prohibition for the import of any animals, fowl, etc. from China. The science of the transfer of virus from animals to humans has been proved. There will be more pandemics originating from China as long as China’s livestock industry is unregulated."
2020-02-06 15:28:17,"There have been reports early on that people in Wuhan would try to escape in the night, since it’s virtually impossible to control the entire perimeter of a large city.  They felt that being quarantined without being sick was tantamount to a death sentence.

If health care could reach all its residents, and the people could trust its government, this kind of thinking might not arise."
2020-02-06 15:10:02,While the Communist authorities were arguing about what color the coronavirus horse was they failed to close the barn doors because they were the ones wearing the blinders. Now instead of riding the horse the horse rides them.
2020-02-06 15:42:59,"There is certainly much to criticize about how the Chinese government has handled the outbreak, but I wonder how Americans would handle the crisis if it was as bad here. Different approaches, different types of incompetence and panic, and entirely different issues of civil liberties. The goal is to stop the spread as fast as possible and wait for all infected to recover, however that is accomplished. I pray that they are successful with a minimum of unrest and lots of compassion for the fear and suffering.

Later, when this is behind them, I hope China's government institutes stronger education and regulation of their farming and agriculture to lessen the likelihood of new viruses developing in the future."
2020-02-06 16:11:07,I hope that one of the greatest takeaways from this latest crisis is the backlash that occurs when the leadership of a highly sophisticated country like China tries to cover up the facts when something as serious as a rapidly spreading global epidemic is unfolding. I fear the same thing or worse would happen in the U.S. with Trump as president.
2020-02-06 16:43:02,"I ain't a doc, but it defies common sense to bring people with unconfirmed coronavirus testing to be housed together among individuals whom may have or not the virus. At the end of the experiment a positive carrier will infect the rest.
One infected person can spread it to dozens of individuals, one thousand healthy individuals will not cure one carrier of the virus.
Good luck to all those poor individuals."
2020-02-06 16:59:58,"I read elsewhere - and am devastated- that Dr Li, the ophthalmologist in China that sounded one of the earliest alarms has succumbed to the illness. 34 years old. The man is a hero."

What about the packages from China bought on Alibaba or Amazon..should we be advised to disinfect packages and products that came from China within the last few weeks..?"
2020-02-06 17:16:55,"Many of those who are marked for warehousing in these new quarantine centers will go in suffering from bad colds or the seasonal flu. They will go out either in body bags or as survivors of nCov.  We can only hope that public health officials here understand the consequences of failure to mount an early, aggressive containment effort."
2020-02-06 17:29:53,"The plan seems to be working, but we gotta do more.

""The fatality rate in Wuhan is 4.1 percent and 2.8 percent in Hubei, compared to 0.17 percent elsewhere in mainland China. This is exactly what one would expect. Fatality is higher at the epicenter because: 1)only the sickest are getting tested and actual numbers of infected are much much higher, meaning actual fatality rate is somewhat lower 2) medical resources/care available per sick individual is more limited in the hot zone and some people who could've been saved are succumbing. Without the mass quarantine measures, we would likely be looking at multiple hot zones with equally overwhelmed medical services. What we need now, and this is critical, is a major, ideally international, effort to support the epicenter with supplies(food, medicine, etc), services(sanitation, utilities, etc.) and medical care(personnel, medicine, equipment, etc). Despite China and Chinese culture being what it is, significant unrest and the breakdown of order cannot be far off. We have to ease the pressure before it blows. Otherwise, we are all in for it."
2020-02-06 18:10:25,"I live in Zhengzhou, China, which hasn't been hit hard by the virus as of yet but is problematically located: it's in the middle of China. So many people coming back from Spring Festival will come through here. A key problem was the outbreak was a month or so before the Spring Festival.

We are now on near complete lock down. I live in a huge apartment complex, and you can't leave unless it's between 9 am and 12 pm. Police guard the entrance. Your temperature must be checked when you come back. So I haven't gone out. I don't know when I shall.

There's no life here: there's no going to the gym, no going to restaurants, movies. You stay home. But, as I like to say, the zombie apocalypse is no picnic."

Whats the plan then?  For food deliveries.  For survival of the richest?"
2020-02-06 16:09:36,"Let me see if I got this right- The Corona virus is ripping it's way through the world and we (the US) are currently working to  remove even basic health care support to massive blocks of the American population? Does anyone really think this will work? We don't die quietly- especially if we die from contagions. There are too many of us, in close quarters, to not have a good national health care system. We keep saying we are the best country in the world, yet we cannot resolve even the most basic of human needs?

Age demographics
those pre existing medical conditions 
Elderly with weak immune systems?

Is the coronavirus not an RNA virus as opposed to a DNA virus?  In general this quote seems pretty pointless to include other than as a way to drop in WHO names. It doesn't state anything new and is only making the WHO sound less knowledgable."
2020-02-06 18:35:06,"This doesn't seem wise....for one, it potentially gives people a strong incentive to breach the Wuhan perimeter. It is a harrowing prospect to submit to being warehoused in close proximity to others, who DO have the Coronavirus."
2020-02-06 16:26:17,"The situation in Wuhan is eerily similar to the description of the medieval bubonic plague graphically described in Alessandro Manzoni’s classic ‘The Betrothed.” It’s as astonishing as it is troubling that five centuries later China is unable to do much better. This is now a global emergency that requires the West to provide the essential humanitarian aid to China not just to contain the spread of the coronavirus, but to test and help treat it. It’s in their interest and ours. Where is President Trump on this? We desperately need real healing and not vicious hating as we’re confronting a potential deadly pandemic."
2020-02-06 16:28:41,"The 34 year old doctor who treated the first patients and sounded the alarm in December just died I doubt he had underlying medical conditions. I don’t trust any of the statistics coming out of China, they’re under reporting. This cannot be contained too late. It’s a virus not a shipping container to inspect at port. It cannot be seen. The proverbial cats are out of the bags all over the globe and WHO is trying to tamp down panic. They are panicked alright, just doing it behind their curtains."
2020-02-06 16:51:33,"If a massive outbreak started here how would we contain it. Americans would not put up with a quarantined area of any size as is occurring n China. It will spread more rapidly here. Would we cover people with minimum health insurance or make them pay the high cost of their treatment resulting in bankruptcy. 
Would states put up barriers to protect their citizens? Would those gun toting militia groups be guarding their areas or patrolling the streets and overwhelm our police force and military. Would they take over hospitals and raid medical facilities. After seeing those masked heavily armed militia group walking through the Kentucky state capital building without even the mandatory security check I think anything goes and not doubt be acceptable to Trump and the Republicans."
2020-02-06 18:37:58,"This is a diplomatic humanitarian opportunity for high level diplomacy through immediate help from CDC experts and logistical advice and support if needed. Trump will miss this opportunity and instead, relish the loss of life and chaos as some sort of perverse vindication. I guarantee it."
2020-02-06 17:29:25,"The numbers coming out of China are probably very unreliable.  On CBS This Morning they interviewed a young man caring for his grandparents.  He had been trying to get them into a hospital - without success.  Grandpa has died and Grandma is very ill - likely to die.  I suspect these types of cases are common and are not being counted by any authorities.  The Centralization of authority around Xi played a large part in this.  The saddest news I saw is the Doctor who tried to alert the authorities and was initially arrested has died.   Cramming people together during a pandemic is probably the exact wrong thing to do when many of those quarantined do not have the illness to begin with - but might develop it due to being warehoused with others who become ill.  Unfortunately Xi will likely pay no penalty, but those lower on the ""food chain"" could pay with their lives."
2020-02-06 19:19:27,"The situation certainly is much, much worse than being disclosed. The Chinese government actions and independent news and witness reports suggest that strongly.  Why is US government not usingf its abilities to access the real extent of the infection ?"

Yeah, right!

There's going to be a lot more dying ""...from the virus..."" among critical journalists, known dissidents, inefficient bureaucrats and surplus politicians in the weeks and month to come. 

You see, the virus is INTELLIGENT, it can DETECT whether you're a ""good person"" or not. No more need for government cameras, behavior databases and internet-snooping, the virus KNOWS everything already, right? Right...

Biological warfare against your own people? Not unheard of. But the experiment got out of the lab it seems :-("

Please put your reporting on this new corona virus in perspective.  Yes, it is serious, yes, it causes deaths probably at a greater rate than influenza, and, yes, we need to be taking serious steps to keep it under control it.

2020-02-06 19:04:22,"I am going to make a prediction that the timing of interferon treatment will be the key in reducing deaths of this virus.

Bat viruses evolved to inhibit type 1 interferons. Bats overproduce type-1 interferon. The interferon bats produce do not trigger an inflammatory response from their immune system and they do not get pneumonia.

<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5604070"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5604070</a>/

Ebola, SARS, MERs and likely this virus replicate by suppressing interferon. This helps the virus to spread easier in bats with their high levels of interferon. In humans it spreads too quickly and initially suppresses too much interferon. The disease spreads to the lungs and when the interferon catches up with the virus it causes lung damage, pneumonia and death. 

<a href=""https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(16)30006-3"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(16)30006-3</a>

Giving people who are exposed proactive interferon can stop the virus from getting a foothold. Reducing the interferon response or inflammation for it in those with pneumonia may stop lethal pneumonia. Another study shows similar outcomes in mice with MERs.

<a href=""https://www.jci.org/articles/view/126363"" target=""_blank"">https://www.jci.org/articles/view/126363</a>

Early interferon treatment like with people exposed or recently infected is absolutely critical for clearing the virus and getting good outcomes. However, the late stage release of interferon activates many killer cells that attack the lungs and creates pneumonia. Studies also recommend combining interferon with anti-inflammatories control the virus and pneumonia."
2020-02-06 19:13:39,Would Chinese please take a close look at the tradition of the live animal markets and exotic wild species which are sold therein as these seem to be the starting point for these diseases time after time.
2020-02-06 19:33:29,"I don't understand how Dr. Li can be ""near death"" if this disease is, as has been reported, mostly killing elderly men with underlying health conditions. He is 34 and was presumably in good health."
2020-02-06 15:09:34,"I was out of the country on a 3 month trip from mid-August to mid-November last year.  Traveling back and forth to Europe by ship.  And by train while there.

So I can imagine so easily the plight of these people stuck on a ship.

Given the number of passengers and crew and the slowness of testing for the virus, by the time they get everyone tested, many of the first ones “cleared of the virus” may not only have become ill, they might have died.

Then one considers the plight of the cruise industry.  Who’’s gonna risk going on a cruise now?  Since it might result in weeks of quarantine with little ability to truly take care of the ill or even test the supposedly well.  Think of the cancellations!  Think of the effect on their stock.

The longer this goes on, the more we can see how difficult this virus may be to contain.  Looks to me like that cat’s gotten out of the bag in may places.  Will it happen that borders close even to ships and their passengers?  

What happens if crews on tankers get sick?  Is there a way to ensure that if everyone is sick on a ship that ship can still navigate?  

It boggles the mind to consider all the unintended consequences that could happen during this fraught time - across the globe."
2020-02-06 16:24:55,"I think it is the height of arrogance from comment posters here to be condemning China as it faces it's worst pandemic style infection in modern China. 

There is a fundamental problem with the breakout of a new novel virus in human society... it is completely unknown, not yet characterized, and must be addressed from the ground up.  The difficulty being such a virus does not simply wait until healthcare and government can get their arms around it and contain it with objective measures and treatments.. it simply continues doing what it does.. spreading silently, often appearing initially to be something more benign.  

You can sit in your armchair and pontificate about the inferiority of China and superiority of America all day.. but it does not mean you are correct. 

In situations like what is taking place in Wuhan China.. there are NO government or healthcare management precedents to rely on.  You have to take it head on and make as many right decisions as possible, as quickly as possible.  Mistakes will be made in situations like this.. and to condemn a nation from afar for this is mindless, arrogant, and simply feeds your own ignorance. 

Part of the problem here, even for a centralized form of government like Chinas.. is modern society is simply not used to or prepared for pandemic scale health problems.  The US would do no better, and probably would do worse facing the same scale and severity of health problem."
2020-02-06 14:46:47,"What is very clear is that, as pointed out by health and policy experts and clinicians around the world, China’s leaders are failing their people. 

Firstly, they tried to hide the virus sending those who first reported it to “re-education.”

Then as opposed to a systematic and humane approach to a virus that amounts to a serious flu, China’s leaders engaged in a harebrained “quarantine” that made anybody ill wanting to escape, and that made treatment to those without transportation or poor almost impossible.  

Now, China is again further engaging in tactics that prove nothing but ignorant amateurs at work, furthering the breakage of the social bonds that keep a society together under stress.

A government is good only as it can serve the people, and Chinese leaders have failed to the extreme."
2020-02-06 21:08:05,"The elephant in the room here is whether or not the virus will peak in the Wuhan area before those providing medical care (doctors, nurses, lab workers, cleaning staff), basic urban services (power, water, sanitation), and security (police, fire) begin to succumb to the combined effects of the virus and exhaustion. 

While the WHO seems rightly concerned about how easily this virus could take hold in nations without strong medical infrastructure, a collapse of an over-taxed region at the epicenter doesn't seem to have been considered.  Hopefully this represents WHO's independent and realistic assessment of China's capabilities and not a fear of offending Xi."

    Anyway, this doctor was extraordinarily brave. He was the first to expose this mysterious illness to the outside world.
Dr. Li and seven other doctors were summoned by Chinese authorities for propagating “rumors” about SARS-like cases in the area — but their warnings were prescient. Soon, health officials worldwide would be scrambling to combat a novel virus with a striking genetic resemblance to SARS. The outbreak in Wuhan has exploded to more than 20,000 confirmed cases just in China.

What I am vastly more worried about is the attitude so many American (and Canadian) adapted. If something similar happened in the US again a la H1N1, I can see the infection spread uncontested because few would heed government orders and society tear itself apart with conspiracy theory and bigotry.

I can see it, theories about Trump using pandemic to expend presidential power, quarantine limits civil liberty, Chinese/Russian/Jew behind the outbreak, government lying as actual death is x10, drug companies have cure but holding it for later/only for the rich, FEMA secretly killing the infected, actually a released bioweapon, Earth/Gaia cleaning itself, Mexican/Asian/Black are carriers, shoot anyone that step into your yard, quarantine is actually rounding up the undesirable.

Just read this comment section and those on YouTube: 90% conspiracy and rumors. With media playing up the fear factor and uncontrolled social media, it’s going to be huge disaster.

Don’t think you can go to hospital. Go to your local ER and see how crowded it is. You’d be in a quarantined stadium/gym/community center like some of these people."

2020-02-06 21:28:31,"The Chinese government is more unhealthy for its citizens than any of their myriad of food handling diseases, Sars, Mers, and now the corona virus. A closed society that ignores and denies crucial information that is considered a loss of face for the Communist party. Regardless of governmental denial of these outbreaks, the Chinese authorities always get found out about their callous disregard for the safety of their people and the rest of the World. Pennywise and pound foolish is an apt description of Chinese response to these outbreaks of deadly viruses."
2020-02-06 19:57:59,"How are infected but functioning people supposed to get better in warehouse conditions with inadequate numbers of nurses? Warehoused patients’ sheer misery and its psychological toll will contribute to their unnecessary deaths. Most mildly sick people and maybe their household members SHOULD be quarantined at home where they can recover in peace. The government should mobilize neighborhoods to deliver food, medicine, and supplies to the outside doors of each quarantined unit. Only the very sick should be moved to quarantine hospital rooms for medical intervention. China’s current response is a frightening display of totalitarianism, sacrificing individuals for an imagined greater good. No sane individual would volunteer to go to these infection centers, unless they were too ill to be cared for at home."
2020-02-06 21:30:21,"It is sad that so many have been infected and many had died from this 2019-nCoV.  Many blame on wild games.  Banning the sales of wild games helps, but I think the outbreak cannot be completely prevented.  Diseases can also be passed from wild life to domesticated animals like chickens and pigs (H1N1, SIV).

The situation is worsened or complicated by the two factors.  The first of course is the covering up by the ignorant local authority of Wuhan.  The second is the food (eating) culture of the Chinese people.  They like group dining (especially during holiday season), and use their chopsticks on shared dishes.  This is why the virus is spreading so quickly.  They just temporarily banned group dining in Beijing."

Out of the goodness of their hearts? 

In China currently, if you are confirmed to be sick with the new coronavirus, your hospital bill is footed by the government in its entirety. This is so the poor can receive treatment and not avoid a bill perceived to be unaffordable, which would only lead to furthering the outbreak."
2020-02-07 00:00:53,"The Coronavirus is particularly tough on the respiratory system. People in urban China are likely to be made more vulnerable by the horrendous level of air pollution that they experience day in and day out.

Wuhan had protests about a year ago due to the extreme level of air pollution. On top of that, the smoking rate in China is about double that of the United States and is especially high among men. That might explain why so many men are having serious complications.

In addition to improving sanitation, we all need to take better care of our lungs and our planet!"

So this is very concerning for populations (like ours in the US) that have yet to experience an outbreak of this coronavirus. But consider being ""rounded up"" and concentrated in what are, well, literally, concentration camps (how else to put it?) for the sick and dying. 

What would the US government's response be if somehow this virus suddenly manifests itself in outbreak numbers in our country? Would you trust any administration--let alone the current one--to take appropriate and effective action? Would you consent to be isolated with thousands or tens of thousands of deathly ill fellow citizens? Would you resist being forced to do so?

2020-02-06 23:39:44,"I'm getting very fed up with all the claims I see of a ""2%"" death rate. People are doing the math wrong!!! You cannot simply divide today's number of confirmed cases by today's number of deaths!!! That doesn't work because there is a lag time between somebody being reported as a confirmed case and somebody being reported dead. That lag time could easily be a couple of weeks. That leads to a huge underestimate when the number of cases is growing rapidly, as it is right now. 

The Chinese explain in one of the Lancet papers how they define a suspected case. The short story is that the patient has to be very ill with pneumonia and in need of hospitalization. From reports on the first 41 patients the Chinese disclose that 15% of them died, with 17% still being in hospital at the time of the report. 

To compare this with flu, 7.6% of people hospitalized for flu in the US died. (CDC numbers for 2016 season). There are currently 28,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus. If 28,000 people are hospitalized for flu, then in the US we would expect 2128 dead. Coronavirus appears to be more lethal so it is easy to project 4200 dead even if new infections suddenly stopped appearing.

For flu only 1.7% of cases lead to hospitalization. (CDC numbers for 2016 season) We don't have this data for the coronavirus. We know that one of the eleven patients in the US developed pneumonia requiring hospital care. No data has been released by the US authorities on the fate of the other 10."

Even a lot of movies was even made. And Bill gates raised alarm years ago. So no big surprise in fact.

And now it comes. And we see that even very autocratic country like China has big problem. China, where they are familiar with punishing people if they don't obey, couldn't stop the spreading. Ok, they fail to inform people well. But would it really help a lot, or would only boost panic. Even now, what would help in world preparation if they would inform the world that they have fifty times higher number of deaths and numbers of infected? Big panic would happen, ability to prepare would shrink, ...

How will in such situation perform liberal western countries is now question for me? Countries that would try to contain without locking people down in first phase. And if this wouldn't work, for alternative solution's maybe will to late, because this appears to be very, very highly contagious.

I don't see real chance to block this disease if it will spread in current way. Ok China is blocked, and we found a lot of Chinese that brought disease in developed countries, where we have prevention. But what about thousands Chinese that work in 3rd world, in Africa for example. There is no report about anybody from there. How is this possible?

2020-02-07 00:30:26,The scenes from Wuhan are chilling given that our own safety net of healthcare is so fragmented. Even under the autocratic regime in China the blatant order to quarantine millions of people lacks the necessary structure to contain the virus. The independent reporting of individuals testing positive on preliminary tests but sent home and not counted on official counts because of a lack of confirmational testing could be in the thousands. The Chinese government has a conflicting interest to contain the perception of spread by downplaying the numbers. In the SARS epidemic of 2003 it was reported they took patients from hospitals and drove them around the city to conceal the numbers of patients while the WHO inspected. One has to wonder what kind of reponse to a fast spreading epidemic in the United States would the current regime in this White House employ?

I am seeing strong words written by those who do not have a full set of facts. Jesus warned us about judging for a reason. We are so quick to tell others not to judge us, but quick to assign evil motives to others.

“Set up a 24-hour duty system. During these wartime conditions, there must be no deserters, or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever"" said a vice-premier.

... concerns are growing about whether the centers, which will house thousands of people in large spaces, will be able to provide even basic care to patients and protect against the risk of further infection.

The lockdown — encircling roughly 50 million people — is unprecedented in scale and experts have _questioned its ethics_.

“This is almost a humanitarian disaster” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Center for China Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong,  “The Wuhan people seem to be left high and dry by themselves.”

One wonders if Professor Lam will be accosted by the police for commenting publicly about the efficacy of locking up over 50 million people with an insufficient amount of medical supplies and food, not to mention a severe staff shortage.

It is also putting the lives of people in China and around the world in serious jeopardy in order to save its own face.  This has to stop and it has to stop now. It is no longer sufficient for the international community to hide behind a discredited WHO and continue to take the Chinese Communist regime at its word on this.

2020-02-07 03:14:00,"The international response to the coronavirus epidemic is being coordinated by WHO. As the crisis has intensified, it looks more and more discredited and increasingly like a Beijing puppet.  Such is the international anger at the handling of coronavirus by WHO that there has been an urgent global petition for the removal of its highly unimpressive Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus. Both the U.S. and the U.K. have gone against WHO advice and have advised against all but essential travel to the whole of China. Other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and Italy have banned all flights from China and any foreign traveler who has visited China in the past 14 days is not permitted to enter these or many other countries, including Taiwan.

Why do these governments feel they need to take these steps when WHO has actively discouraged them from doing so? The only possible reason is they have an idea of the true extent of the coronavirus outbreak and little or no faith in the work of WHO to prevent its spread."
2020-02-07 04:18:51,"After witnessing the destructive power of Hurricane Sandy, I felt that Mother Nature is extremely powerful.  Most people don’t realize this until we get badly hit.  The spread of this Corona Virus is due to the extreme negligence and arrogance on the part of Chinese government which failed to ban the commerce of exotic wild animals.  In addition, the Chinese government was not transparent about the spread of the virus.  In my opinion, if the Chinese government had taken some measures after the SAR epidemic, the current epidemic which will most likely turn into global pandemic could have been avoided.  

Mother Nature sets some rules in terms of what every inhabitant of this planet can and cannot do.  Exploration is good and it made us successful, but we need to explore with caution respecting the boundaries. I hope we all learn some valuable lessons out of this accident."

2020-02-06 19:31:13,"It’s seems China and America is more concerned about the stock markets and economy then the people of China. It makes Americans richer and the top Chinese even richer as well. 

If they only spent 1/4 of the stock bail out money and stimulus cleaning up their food chain and shutting down their open wild life markets they probably could have save thousands of lives and not have to shut down their entire country. Also, save the world from dealing with this pandemic.

If anything this whole thing shows how the US stock market and Chinese Stock markets are manipulated heavily by their governments. It simply does not make sense that our stocks and and theirs are rising during an entire shutdown and possibly thousands dying in China where all out Apple, Tesla’s, Car parts and thousands of other products are coming from. 

Is there going to be a big pop in the stock market in a week or is everyone so confident that they will find a cure next week. 

So far at first is was not as bad as a flu and only older people died But now 34 year old healthy doctors are dying and a 4 percent mortality rate is much worse than any flu. The data from China is obviously not 100 % accurate and we can only suspect the deaths and infected are much much higher than being reported."
2020-02-06 20:13:14,"It is laughable to be treating numbers coming from the Chinese government as Gospel truth.   

Deaths are being deliberately miscategorized as simple pneuonia according to many reports from Chinese health personnel.   Bodies collected outside the hospital go straight to crematoriums with little if any records kept.  

The increase in infected cannot be readily determined under the circumstances with people 'self-quarantining' and others being locked in by government.

Clearly the Chinese government is doing all it can to publicly minimize the official statistics while taking ever more drastic measures to try and get control of the outbreak.

Again, this virus is looking much more like an engineered virus that escaped from the Wuhan level 4 containment lab."

There have been several medical papers supporting this idea recently and reports of characteristic spikes similar to HIV1 and characteristics of other Coronavirus in these reports. Not to mention a recent article about anti viral drugs used against HIV that are showing promise. 
I suspect it was an research experiment not a naturally jumping virus from bats in the wet market over the recent past. China cannot put the genie back in the bottle and is panicking. 
The global reaction is so severe with travel bans and quarantines yet the authorities are talking it down. The two positions are incongruous. 
They are talking out of two sides of their mouth. 
The health authorities are not telling us something but doctors on the ground suspect it and are reacting. Our own government is taking this very seriously compared to SARS. 
I fear we are all being lied to for fear of a global panic and mass social disruption. 
Regardless let’s not fall into complacency and tell ourselves the flu is worse. It’s not. The couple in Cali has also taken a turn for the worse after some improvement just like the Chinese doctor Li.

I grew up drinking a lot of these broths when I coughed a lot—for some reason cough suppressants turned my cough into a dry one and it would linger much longer than if I hadn’t. The soups helped a lot to alleviate my cough and it would help shorten the duration and the severity quickly. There was once I didn’t drink the soups and well, I coughed for so long (~3m) I ended up with bronchitis. The other time, I was at college and my parents couldn’t deliver soup to me and I coughed for a solid month. There’s not a lot of research to back up any of the claims people make, but for centuries, people figured out certain herbs help alleviate coughs and other things.

I can see it now.  What we need to combat corona virus is pangolin gall bladder mixed with Amur Leopard tongue!"
2020-02-05 14:47:12,One of the main problems with traditional Chinese medicine is that much of it relies on the slaughter and consumption of threatened wildlife species.  There is absolutely no scientific evidence that consuming these animals has any medicinal value.
2020-02-05 15:40:37,"This from a professor of pharmacology at Yale, “I think it {traditional medicine] is the correct approach....The evidence is going to come and we have to give it the benefit of the doubt.”!   This from Yale's description of their Pharmacology Program for the BBS degree, Bachelor of Biomedical Sciences, ""The program of study will emphasize an integrated view of pharmacology and disease built upon a rigorous foundation of basic sciences. Each student's curriculum will be designed according to their interests and background""; so where does this professor fit in, a stipend program sponsored by Belt and Road for pharmacists in Inner Mongolia?   

There is no problem with traditional Chinese medicine or cuisine, so long as it does not denude the earth of thousands of species.  Refer to the article yesterday announcing seizure of thousands of shark fins on their way from South America to China for soup.  Estimate was that ""millions"" of sharks are killed annually for medicine and cuisine."

It also sounds like Chinese medicinal beliefs played a part in causing the outbreak in the first place due to the consumption of exotic animal meat. The Chinese government may need to take a serious look at these traditional practices and ask tough questions about their efficacy and consider what regulations could be put in place to make them more scientific and less about guesswork and unfounded beliefs. As for the exotic animal meat, that should be banned immediately before there's another outbreak. People's lives are at stake here; it's not just a matter of some harmless religious practice. China needs to decide if they want to join the 21st century or remain in the 1st century when it comes to medical practices."

2020-02-05 17:44:29,"The good news is that by all accounts they are started to get the handle on a disease that has been more hype than horror. With more and more people being released from the hospital totally cured. They are finding more ways to fight the virus, and the mortality rate is low, and sure to go down as time goes on. Quarantine seems to be working, with less and less cases being reported. Even the first American patient has been released from the hospital. These numbers are mirrored by the stock market, as the sharps have figured out this is hardly the black swan event it was made out to be. Fear itself, is always the big thing to be avoided, and let us hope we learn from this event and make the kind of changes needed to make sure that when the ""Big One"" does arrive we are positioned to properly weather and survive it.

It infuriates me when I think of all the people I knew who died following that path into the wilderness. People then were desperate to find anything that worked, and we tried everything, crazy things, much of it to our detriment. 

But in our time there were no answers. The difference here is that we do. Thanks to the AIDs epidemic we have vast scientific understanding of virology, immunology, and epidemiology; so much that it only took weeks instead of a decade and a half to find a reliable test and drugs capable of blocking 2019nCoV.

The mystical 'pracitioners' of traditional Chinese medicine sidestep their lack of scientific knowledge by talking about logical sounding things like immune support but none of it has factual support. Go look for yourself, you will find no proof, just stories. You're better off just taking a hot bath. Thank God they aren't grinding up something on the endangered species list this time."

2020-02-05 19:15:40,"Reading the accounts leaking through the censorship in China it is obvious that the epidemic there is still expanding and is not under control. The confirmed case count is a small fraction of cases since most people with the disease are not tested for the simple reason that the test requires scarce tools and total testing capacity is a small fraction of the true case count. The repeated estimates of the fatality rate are currently incorrect. That number is based on confirmed cases and confirmed deaths, confirmed by the reverse transcriptase RT-PCR test. However that must be an under-estimate since it is calculated as current count of fatalities divided by current cases. That calculation is wrong when the number of cases is rapidly increasing and there is a multi-day lag time between case confirmation and death. If the average lag time is 10 days, the estimate for the fatality rate among hospitalized patients should be calculated as: current fatality count divided by the case count 10 days prior - a much greater fatality rate for serious cases, more like 30% not 3%."

PETA, start your China crusade. Plant-based diets are healthier, and people don't need to eat bat head soup, civet cats, household pets, and all sorts of exotic animals because of mythology about their magical properties. Those irrational beliefs have also led to the killing of many endangered species whose body parts are assumed to improve male virility. Sorry, but sometimes traditional customs should give way to science and ethics. Preservation of weird eating habits is no excuse for what China is doing to humans and animals."

A combination of steroids to reduce inflammation and interferon would be more like its host’s environment. 

If there are immune people producing antibodies for this virus then maybe it is time for an unorthodox approach. A Russian doctor contracted diseases from a patient but cured that patient of malaria and tuberculosis. In this odd case of doctor suicide he died and cured his patient.

People who have the disease and beat are producing the exact antibodies needed. A transfusion can lower the viral load in someone else if it contains antibodies from an immune donor. Reducing the viral load buys patients more time for their own immune system to develop their own antibodies.

The Cochrane group comprehensive meta-analysis on neuraminidase inhibitors has convinced me of that. In regards to baloxavir marboxil, good luck trying to find a study by someone that is not on the Roche payroll.  Conversely, non-GMP Chinese ""patent"" medicines are of unreliable quality, sub-optimal formulation and too low of a dose -- think Dollar Store quality.

Interferon treatment administered early in the infection combined with the anti-inflammatory cyclosporine should be tested to see if it is effective at stopping an early infection from turning into pneumonia.

Combining the interferon alpha with an anti-inflammatory is likely effective at clearing the virus. Especially if given early or to those who may have been exposed but asymptomatic.

So in Wuhan, a month ago there were 1,000 confirmed cases. Now there are 15,000 there alone.

Not be an alarmist but doesn't it logically follow that with confirmed cases in about ten large Chinese cities hovering between 500 and 1,000 today in a month from now all those cities will resemble Wuhan? 

Logically it follows then that all of China's large productive cities will have to go on lockdown and that, phased in and out, that will equal at least a month's worth of total GDP loss plus knock on effects to productivity and unforeseen expenses fighting the disease through massive government health expenditures —so — really big recession in China equals at least a small one in the world economy no?

Obviously the deaths and suffering are the worst part, but governments tend to only calculate costs and their own popularity. This was just a horrible thing to have happen and worse still because the wild animal markets had been shut down after SARS but were allowed to reopen. 

Who is the bureaucrat who signed the bill letting that happen? There's the real culprit, not the Chinese people.

Or at least those coming from or originating in eastern Asia?

And why are military bases in CA being used as quarantine sites (which essentially become incubators for the virus if even one quarantined person carries the virus)?  Why not instead have all America-bound flights stop over in HI or Samoa or Guam or the much more sparsely populated AK or even the Catalina Islands off the coast of southern CA and a part of CA?

2. He immediately returned to his home and has been in self-quarantine mode. His wife and child have been staying with another family. 
3. Food was delivered to his doorstep. He works from home and dials in for required meetings both at work and in the community.

I went out and reentered the hospital thru the foreigner side. No animals in the hallway (thank God for small favors). I went into a doctor’s office and first thing I noticed was no books or the smells of a doctor’s office(such as my dad’s). I told the doctor I had an ingrown toenail. He verbally danced and dodged about what needed to be done and he said he’d be cutting into my toe soon. No anaesthetic was in sight. I had to know. I asked a question that infuriated him, “Have you ever done this before?”. He jumped out of his chair as if his rump was on fire, pacing the floor and muttering indignations at a ‘white savage’ (me) having the gall to question him.

Consider this as you head back home to meet with constituents.   

The greatest political threat to the President is the not Impeachment, but the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which will in 2 to 6 months cause a global recession and result in a raging pandemic in the USA with possibly 30 to 90 million infections.   Up to 20 % of those will require ICU/CCU inpatient confinements (and there are not enough hospital beds in all America to treat these cases). If the mortality rate runs between 2% to 3% for those infected, then we are speaking about possibly 2 to 3 million dead if 30$ of the 323 million Americans get infected.

The linear plot that the NYT keeps showing hides the information on whether the exponentiation is slowing. Expanding the published plot, and reading off the data for days 20 through 32, and adding the number being reported today (24,500), which corresponds to about day 36.5 since the first reported case, yields a log plot that shows pure exponential growth between days 20 and 28 (increasing about a factor of 10 every 6 days), and then a clear reduction in growth rate. Of course this assumes that the reported number of cases is at least linearly proportional to the true number of current cases."

I worked with lots of Medical professionals in China. They all do a yearly physical, and foreigners working there are required to do a medical check, but I never once heard mention of anyone being immunized. At all.

So in the same way, should you ever contract coronavirus, already being protected from the opportunistic bacteria that may want to pile on, might improve your chances of surviving the ordeal.

Much more interesting to ignore risks like this and then let the media figure out who to make the sacrificial lamb for the tragedy when it arises.

The flu shot has notoriously low success rates, even lower for seniors like myself.

I had my last shot seven yrs ago and either because of people coughing on me in the doctors office or because it gave me a low grade flu I was sick for two days. After reading the low success rates every year, never got another one but did follow your other advice and knock on wood have not had a cold or flu since.

Results with my family and friends bear out the written facts ie I know an equal number of people who got the shot and did not it with equal results. Some got the flu, some didn't.

One big reason is that most Americans only remain with their health insurance company for a few years.  So since it doesn't pay for health insurers to spend a lot of money on vaccinations when their patients will likely soon be some other insurer's problem, they don't bother.  

But in Britain, where the National Health Service is responsible for your health from conception to death, they do everything possible to keep you as healthy as possible.  And that includes launching major campaigns to get people to get their flu shots (""the jab"").

And that is yet another reason why socialized medicine keeps people healthier longer and at lower cost than does America's for-profit healthcare system.

So I personally refuse to get that shot, even now that I am in my sixties. The flu I had 20 years ago was an absolute nightmare.

Rugs and curtains also were exposed to sun, which does kill germs.  I had the flu in 1956/57 and spent a week flat in bed, feeling as though dying would be an improvement, and I was a healthy teenager.  These days the filthiest thing we touch is probably our cell phones; I wipe mine with a disinfecting wipe every day and try to avoid using it if I haven't washed my hands.

Having just arrived from outside and used the toilet, I was eager to give my hands a good wash. Although they had soap this time, the water came out in thin short bursts of cold water.  Recently had similar problem at Museum of Modern Art. To add insult to injury, these places often have those electric blow dryers (including the very expensive Dyson ones @Moma & @lincolncenter).

2020-02-11 10:21:02,"Re: flu shots. If you want the general population to get them you'll have to do a better job of getting people to understand that it's not just the elderly and babies that are at risk. I guarantee you that most young or middle aged adults as well as teens don't get a flu shot as they think this is only something that seniors need. True, the worst outcomes of the flu tend to be found in the elderly or very young children but that doesn't mean others don't get very sick, lose significant amounts of time away from school or work, have the potential to pass it on to many others and even sometimes die from the flu.

 I haven't been able to convince my own young adult son that he should get a flu shot each year. After getting the flu twice I have gotten a flu shot yearly and so far so good. I have no desire to be so sick again. Yes, sometimes the flu shot isn't perfectly matched but it's better than nothing. And so far, fingers crossed, it's always done the trick.  It needs to lose the stigma of just being for old people though. I'd suggest maybe having flu immunization clinics in the fall at college campuses etc."

Why can't we just seriously restrict international travel until this disease is eradicated in humans?

For those who *must* travel to countries experiencing an outbreak (like China), we can have a mandatory, 2-week quarantine at a government facility."
2020-02-11 16:07:04,"Not in any way to diminish the suffering from and impact of the Wuhan coronavirus but, for perspective, I would note the C.D.C. estimates that up to 42.9 million people got sick during the 2018-2019 flu season, 647,000 people were hospitalized and 61,200 died. In the current season, half over, it is estimated there have been at least 22 million flu illnesses, 210,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 deaths from flu. 

While we appropriately pay serious attention to the evolution of Wuhan coronavirus, let us not let it cloud out the ongoing risks from flu and the need to act accordingly. If quarantining cities in China, cruise ships, and others is sensible and legitimate, maybe we should consider the same for anti-vaxxers here in America. 

As with the 40,000 annual deaths in vehicle crashes, the flu is not a ""sexy"" news story, so does not get nearly the coverage deserved. On the other hand, the Wuhan coronavirus, makes for excellent clickbait. That is not to deny the legitimate stories, many hooked to the unknown elements. Novelty and the unknown get attention, until what was once novel becomes the new normal. That's human nature. Think of suicide bombers. In the mid 2000s when they started happening as more than a rare ""curiosity"", each had huge news coverage, complete with psychological ""analyses"", biographies, detailed descriptions, etc. Now when there is a suicide bombing, it is simply covered as is any other bombing, ""suicide"" simply being consigned to being an adjective."

Every year, nonetheless, it only takes a glance from a sick person (usually at work), and I'm down for the count...a very long count of usually 4-6 weeks with bronchitis if I'm lucky, walking pneumonia if I'm not. I'm a consummate hand-washer, too.
For this reason, I am particularly unnerved by the coronavirus.

I hope that clearer information about at-risk populations and relevant guidelines is soon forthcoming."

Hello heating contractors; a marketing opportunity here!"
2020-02-11 17:21:24,"Handwashing is great, and everyone who can should definitely get a flu shot. But the data strongly suggest that 1) this coronavirus is likely to become pandemic, and 2) its initial case fatality rate (CFR) is likely to be greater than that of an average flu season. In fact, the CFR for this virus may be 5 to 10 times higher than that of ordinary flu, or even higher. Moreover, the US healthcare system is seriously underprepared for an influx of patients, and a pandemic here would be likely to cause extra deaths because not all people would be able to get the care they need.

Thus, it would seem wise for people to prepare for the serious possibility of a pandemic that will affect their communities starting at some point within the coming year. People need to be told what might happen, for instance, that schools or workplaces might be closed for periods of time. We all need to plan financially and logistically for such possibilities. People should be advised to try to lay away non-perishable supplies so that if and when the virus comes to their city, they don't have to go out for a few weeks if they don't want to.

Current public health messaging is disappointing. People need to be told so much more than ""don't panic,"" ""the current risk is low,"" and ""wash your hands."" If I'm standing on the beach watching the water get sucked out far to sea, my current risk is low. But I know the tsunami is coming. I just don't know how big it is.

There is no evidence to support the idea that the flu vaccine will shorten or weaken flu, either. For people who are scientists, I don't understand why ""may"" is good enough. Additionally, has flu changed or something? When I was a kid 30 years ago, we everyone got something we called ""flu"" once a year or so. I never heard of anyone dying. Now we act as if it's Ebola. Why? In terms of the coronavirus- no one has explained why it's such a big deal, either. What makes it different/better/worse than flu? Does it depend on the strain? I wash my hands, I get enough sleep and exercise, I'm generally healthy. Haven't had the flu in four years. I had something in 2016 that a flu test said wasn't flu but the doctor said it was, so I was prescribed Tamiflu. The Tamiflu made me incredibly sick. I was only able to take 3 doses because it made me so nauseated. As soon as I stopped the Tamiflu, I was able to recover with 3 or 4 days of bed rest and lots of liquids.

One other clue to a bad mask type is one that loops over your ears. Again, useless for most people but common.
Just wash your hands often with soap (don't forget the lower part of the palm) and if you can't wash, use alcohol hand cleaners is a good substitute.

I am vexed by the way experts tip-toe around private sector responsibility and the manner of milquetoast appeal made to private enterprises to ""do the right thing"" by ""allowing"" people to stay home when they are sick. Dr. Carroll appeals to these entities as if they have ever prioritized employees over profits. These are policy issues and require the will to delineate and codify them as such. Is that likely in a culture that erodes employee agency continually? No. But people can just wash their hands a little more I guess? Much like climate issues where people work to reduce carbon foot print with the tiny measures they can effect while corporate and systemic purveyors of environmental degradation move forward with their enormous damaging effect. 

I understand that Carroll, a PCP, shares what measures the individual can implement, but physicians as a whole must more vigorously protest the many ways healthcare and health policy is negatively impacted by the privileging of business interests over peoples needs. Health IS political. Doctors can't minister to patients without understanding this point and acting in the public arena to encourage, through policy not toothless appeal, that businesses act responsibly, as their effect on health and safety outstrip the nominal effort individual can enact here."

It is a highly irresponsible statement to make at reducing the urgency and effectiveness of a face mask when you can’t even be sure what the virus is. 

If ONE DAY someone was to tell you that this is an engineered virus, would you say something otherwise? But it will be all too late for those who believe in the fallacy of your line of reasoning in this article. This article is meant to play down the panic and pretending that normalcy is still around, where there is none."

When it first started they showed video of a city in china and 80%+ of the people were wearing masks and shortly after that they were showing a ghost town. They made business and shops and factories close. There economy has been going down the last couple of years and this would make it even harder for low income people to get by. There have been reports that low income people are eating rats, wild cats and dogs and snakes. And it's strange the trouble in Hong Kong has gone away? And they won't let the CDC help them? If during flu season in the USA 80% of the people were to wear masks the flu season would last about week or less. The ONLY way this got as bad as it has is they are ingesting the virus. Good way to stop the Hong Kong problem."

Could it have changed in one of them who then made their way to Wuhan? I am now asking could it have all been started by a human being, the ultimate super spreader. I wonder if the only reason it was discovered was a shift in the infected population from maybe a more rural exposed one to a cityscape where perhaps people were more susceptible to it’s effects.

Then, pangolin fetuses are used in China as the main ingredient in a soup, and chopsticks are used to pick up and bite into them. Looking at a photo of this ""dish"" is to be totally disgusted.

It explains how over the past decade, the booming Chinese middle and upper classes' taste for jewelry, artwork, and traditional though scientifically uncredible remedies and exotic foods have increasingly fueled a global wildlife black market that has decimated species in Africa, Southeast Asia and elsewhere. Ivory and rhino horn from Africa increasingly arrive through Hong Kong’s international airport where much of the illegal merchandise is headed for mainland China. The more rare and endangered something becomes, the more desirable and luxurious it is considered to be by the Chinese middle and upper classes. As a possible intermediate host, now the critically endangered pangolins will be disposed of just as thousands of civets were slaughtered when the SARS virus emerged and they were considered to be an intermediate host."

Let that settle in folks... HONG KONG... you know the little city state you all celebrate for their resistance to China.  

As to why the Pangolin was ever considered medicinal in Traditional Chinese Medicine in past centuries... it really is immaterial as today medicine and healthcare in China centers around the same medical practices and applications of modern healthcare technology and medications as the rest of the modern world. Example: CT scans are a routine and low cost (in China) method of diagnostics in modern Chinese medicine.   

It is true that folklore based medicine of an earlier time.. dies hard in any society (evidence: the still persistent feeling among Americans that Chicken Soup is a therapeutic enhancer to recovery from a cold or flu).  So I really think that all the chest beating and outcry from armchair critics needs to be toned down.. because the fact is.. most Chinese would never touch Pangolin as a medicinal.. simply because they have access to better and more proven medical care in China.. which is also much less expensive.  

The wealthy in China, including in Hong Kong! ... that still believe in the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine of folklore.. are the issue here.. because only they have the finanical means to follow it."

Further, TCM is far from having withered away in a country of well more than a billion people, a large proportion of whom are still poor, rural and “traditional” (aka superstitious), whether you like it or not.

China’s increasing contact with the outside world seems to have created many unforeseen costs, in addition to the normalization of fear-and-conformity-based single-party dictatorship by corporations like Apple looking for cheap labor, ubiquitous citizen surveillance, ethnic concentration camps, an international trade in human organs “harvested” from prisoners (many of whom have committed offenses only considered to be “crimes“ by China’s tyrannical leaders), and many other hideous violations of basic human rights. The lie-driven mania for “traditional cures” and the insatiable demand for the flesh of endangered species are phenomena we clearly understand. But we are often reluctant to level the necessarily potent criticisms openly, with the exception of a limited number of conservationists and investigative journalists, lest we be labeled “arrogant Westerners” who are “insensitive to traditional cultures” or, per the lazy pro forma accusation which smothers any debate in the US & UK, “racist.”

So it appears that your risk is lower compared to others. That being said, you are brave and you should do what feels right. I know that as a parent, I would want you home yesterday. Good luck and let's hope this is contained soon. I am so sorry for you all others who are going through this."
2020-02-07 22:03:29,"I am an American, retired teacher. I am married to a Chinese national so I spend half the year or more here in Nanning Guangxi Province. 

The streets are deserted, all schools and many businesses are closed. I wonder how long some of these establishments can hold out with no income. The restaurant industry has been annihalated. Who in their right mind will eat food prepared by strangers? For the vast number of retail establishments the business model is foot traffic. Will people pay tuition to closed schools? Is a collapse of the Chinese economy a possibility?

 Apparently, face masks are now mandatory but none can be had so I have been making my own. 1.3 billion masks per day are required in all of China.

I intend to wait it out. The alternative that awaits is, like the author said, being cooped up in a closed space with strangers for half a day and not knowing what awaits me on the other end. Can I even get out if wanted to? First I would have to fly from Nanning to Shanghai or Beijing. The Chinese airline industry is not dependable right now. Besides, I will not run out on my wife."

2020-02-07 22:16:29,"""The virus is very good at math."" Indeed, I have thought the same thing. The numbers they are reporting do not add up; I think they know that if they report a worsening fatality rate, their ability to control the situation will spiral rapidly out of control. A virus that kills 2 out of 100 feels very different than one that kills, say, 20 or 30. Who knows what the truth is; we won't know until free countries begin to truly learn about the virus."
2020-02-07 22:21:32,"Incredible column.  The inevitable argument in dire conditions-i.e. keep moving or huddle down.  (Sounds eerily like an argument from WWZ.)  But in any calamity (war, pestilence, natural disaster), people are moving.  China was experiencing capital flight before Wuhan.  Undoubtedly it is continuing.  So the obvious questions.  Who is moving (if anyone), where are they going and why?  Follow the wealth and power, and those that have it, in their private decisions.  It usually provides a significant amount of answers to questions."
2020-02-07 22:50:39,"You are young and healthy, however, consider what will happen to the medical system if cases in Shanghai increase to hundreds or thousands, fear takes over, hospitals are flooded and there is no oxygen or medically supportive care. Then, as the epidemic increases, food becomes scarce. 

I would leave ASAP. You are the lucky ones. My heart breaks for anyone who cannot get out."
2020-02-07 23:09:43,"One way to analyze stay-versus-leave is to ask how risky it is for someone outside China to go to China, or for someone in China outside Hubei to go to Hubei.

Going to Hubei sounds like a terrible idea; going to China sounds like a very bad idea.

Then one might identify and analyze the risks associated with leaving Hubei and China. Might one be stranded on the way out of Hubei/China? Might one catch the disease on the way out and be quarantined or hospitalized? If traveling with family, what happens if one member comes down with coronavirus? What if various forms of international transportation will no longer accept passengers with passports from China, as has just happened with Princess Cruise Lines, and may happen with some airlines? What if certain destinations are no longer open to Chinese?

Perhaps some NYT readers are already working on a risk-assessment algorithm to deal with such decisions and can share their wisdom by commenting here, or by cooperating with NYT writers in preparing an article.

Deciding whether to leave or stay is an intensely personal process, informed by often sketchy information. Based on living and traveling in third-world countries, my experience has been that it is better to leave before conditions deteriorate and threats to life and limb increase to levels that local and national governments are unable to manage.

For me the fact that the US Embassy and most US nationals have been evacuated is a pretty good sign that it’s time to go."
2020-02-07 23:53:42,"I am in Beijing and reluctantly leaving for the UK this morning. (8th Feb). Leaving behind friends and colleuagues is not easy and to see the effects of the virus on the economy and people' lives is stunning.
My choice to leave comes from an awareness that, should I become ill and, therefore confined / isolated, I could rely on getting the resources I would need (Food and meds getting delivered) compared to how locals would have family to support them. 
As for the virus itself, I honestly do not fear that any more than I would flu or pneumonia; both of which I have had, and recovered from.
My heart goes out to all those living in fear and isolation in China and I hope to be back in China at the next available opportunity."
2020-02-08 02:48:59,"My spouse and I and our two children live in Shanghai. There is no lockdown here. You are free to venture out as far and often as you see appropriate. There are relatively very few cases of infection, considering how massive the city is. Many people, including us, prudently minimize time at crowded indoor spaces, but a walk around the neighborhood or to a nearby park is perfectly safe. Sunshine, (relatively) fresh air and exercise are key inputs to staying healthy, and do wonders for one's mood and outlook."
2020-02-08 02:36:49,"I honestly feel for you and pray this ends soon.

 But my real question is: why weren’t you writing op/ed columns about open air live animal markets before this outbreak? The hideous animal cruelty and health risks to the rest of the world posed by these inhuman practices surely outweigh the cultural practiceof eating snakes (linked by scientists to this outbreak)and domesticated dogs. Enough is enough."

2020-02-07 23:00:33,"Chinese people have gotten used to managed existence; a bargain where they follow the rules and the leaders provide safety, financial and food security.  The system has been working so far due to good growth rates and the communist party's muscle flexing and hard bargaining to accumulate from the global marketplace.  The virus has brought the place to a stand still and is testing the system as people expect the virus to be booted out.  This expectation may be a monster that may eat up the master if the virus goes on for a long time."

2020-02-08 04:36:55,"There are good reasons to stay or go, but if you base your decision on health risks, it is essential that the reported figures be reliable. Authoritarian regimes default to obfuscation on minor matters because secrecy is essential to controlling the levers of society. Investors, scientists, diplomats and others may choose to believe data the Chinese government offers in their respective fields of interest, but the risk of relying on epidemiological data in the midst of a an epidemic is too high."

I'm a Japanese mom whose 37-year-old son had come back from Shanghai last week but will go back again next Monday. He works for a Jap firm with over 100 Chinese employees. Business will probably not resume but he is going back with suitcases and bags filled with face masks. There is also a demand for smaller ones to fit ladies and small children. Sending them by mail or delivery is hopeless. A few boxes of masks would not make much difference, but he needs to tell his coworkers he cares for them. I just pray for his safety."

You can only go out and come back between 9am and 12pm.

Zhengzhou is huge, and I live downtown on the biggest street. Everyone is closed except for one supermarket in my neighborhood, so this morning it was really crowded. Last week I would go at 5am, when no one was there.

Really, all there is to do is stay home, wash your hands a lot, and hope for the storm to pass. I should say people at the store were really polite and calm."

I have also been in wechat groups with many others staying - and there are a huge variety of reasons that people have - all of them good reasons and all very personal. For us, we have a visa thing that needs to be sorted first, but in addition to that, we've lived here for 6 years. The thought of just leaving our home, our belongings, our community, our jobs, indefinitely seems like a kind of crazy thing to do, especially when you're in a city where the cases of the virus are so low - for now. The thought of carting my two kids (4 and 5 years old) on a 14 hour flight to the US and stay with our elderly family - and risk bringing the virus with us - or staying in a hotel indefinitely somewhere racking up a bill (especially with a 14 day quarantine on top of it), does not sound appealing. But of course, I worry too, and we may change our minds once we get the logistics of the visas sorted out. Hang in there!"

2020-02-08 06:13:56,"I have a job in China but I left. Easy decision because as an ESL teacher I had two months holiday and was out before the virus was even discussed. I have no idea when I will go back.
Staying or leaving is a hard decision. For all, there is the costs of a flight, abandonment of possessions or continuing rent payments. Many could lose a business they have built up over years or lose a job. Coming back home could mean paying for a hotel for months while trying to find a new job. It is not just a quick trip to the airport.
Staying in China though without a useful purpose feels like being a burden. I struggle in the Chinese health system in normal times and can't imagine how I would fare without fluency in the overcrowding of an epidemic."

We have decided to stay put as our dog needs us and we would not want to put the burden of taking care of our dog on anyone else right now. Also, we would not want to risk exposing anyone in the states as there seems to be quite a few people who are afraid of the unknown. We are looking forward to the day when we can have some normalcy again but we have to continue to remind ourselves that there are worse situations out there and to count our blessings. Please keep all of us in your thoughts and prayers."
2020-02-08 06:50:55,This version of the coronavirus is highly contagious with some epidemiologists believing it has a R naught value close to 4 - meaning highly contagious. I think the Chinese government made the unprecedented decision to quarantine over 60 million people because they knew how highly contagious the virus is￼- much more virulent than the flu but less than the measles. I’m thinking it’s probably more likely than not the virus will get to Shanghai and into your neighborhood. The question I would be asking is how safe do you feel in your high-rise building from contracting the virus if your neighbors start to get infected. One thing to look at is if your building uses common air ducts for ventilation that feeds the apartments - sometimes used in some high-rise buildings.  The air then gets recycled through common air ducts which makes the transmission of the virus much easier. Also given the population of Shanghai there would be limited availability of the more novel medications now being considered￼ for use in the most severe patients.   You’re safer option would be to come back to United States if you’re able to travel- and wait it out for two months or so- and even if you have to live with your in-laws￼.
2020-02-08 07:05:40,"Frankie, my simple answer: LEAVE.  The epidemic will likely drag on for months, you just can't survive by cooping up in your little cocoon and ordering delivery for every basic provisions.  The authority is not trustworthy and the spread of the epidemic will get worse before it gets better.   So why wait?  Book the next flight out, change your pajamas, pack up and leave while you can.  Lamenting all those sorrows won't solve your problem.   By the way, don't get too obsessed about the mortality rate, it's only a reference--be it at 2.1% or 4.8%, the real danger is there."
2020-02-08 07:54:01,"Thank you, Ms. Huang, for sharing some of your personal experience. The world is following what's happening and gratefully, experts in America and in other countries are assembling to come to China to help address this crisis."
2020-02-08 09:10:46,"My wife, my 3 children and I live in Dalian, China on a long term work assignment.  We are all US citizens. We were out of the country in Tokyo during Lunar New Year when we found out our children's school was canceled until (at least) March, so we decided to stay in Tokyo for a few more days to see how the situation progressed.   

We were trying to decide whether to go back to China or not, as we have not been formally evacuated by my company, but the deciding factor for returning to Dalian or not was medical/emergency care.  There are no ""tier-one"" hospitals in Dalian, so when we need medical care, we fly to Seoul or Tokyo. However, if there is a ban from entering Japan/Korea from China, we have nowhere to go in an emergency.  So we are heading back to the USA.   I also feel somewhat guilty for being in a privileged position where we can choose to stay or go, so I understand the mixed feelings of the author of this article."
2020-02-08 09:50:16,"The question about risk from travel would be to ask yourself how well you could protect yourself in flight. Those common masks won't cut it. If you could be as strict as a surgeon about hand-washing, not touch your face, bring your own cutlery and/or beverages and food, and get a virus-blocking mask, I'd say leave.

Then, please be a good citizen of the world and quarantine yourself for two weeks once you arrive somewhere else. 

If my family learned anything in WWII, it was to run while you still can. 

Which explains my expat status as well."

Let’s just say theoretically, although not entirely unlikely,￼ that a Chinese scientist alters the genome of an insect. This insect then becomes a deadly poisonous version of its former self. How will the rest of the world be protected from this threat when during the early stages, when control and eradication could be possible, the government of China will jail and silence the scientific community which is sounding the alarm?

In the 1950's in America, it was polio with visions of children in iron lungs and braces.  Our response was literally a march of dimes which funded the race for a vaccine from the sugar bowls of our country.

After the hiatus from many more vaccines for dread diseases, we settled into a self-obsessed complacency cracked open by measles as we learned the cost of the anti-vaxxers campaigns and blown to bits by this 2019-nCoV epidemic.  If a coronavirus vaccine existed, would anyone refuse it now?

Fear pressed into service of xenophobia can drive us apart.  Fear serving to unite us in response can bring us through difficulty to triumphs like Jonas Salk's.

As humans continue to spread into animal domains, our contacts with bats, primates, pigs et al. will stir up a continuing array of new diseases.  We must continue to be prepared, be resolute and be respectful of the natural world."

We fear the economic costs because that is what our corporate overlords fear and by gosh we must fear what our masters fear. They have taught us well, when they are not happy we cannot be happy. Except, they are never happy because it is never enough. There is not enough money in the world for our corporate owners and their greedy and needy and childish share holders.

For doctors who have to go to work, which is also the case of some of my family members, that of course raises a lot of worries for family member. Everybody has their own doubts, uncertainties, worries, struggles, etc. and why does yours -- being so elitist -- deserve to represent the ""life under lockdown""? I see no point.

If it is already happening and if the Chinese government is hiding that this is already happening, it would become a very serious problem, and very quickly.

Flickering lights that eventually fail altogether, inadequate or sporadic heating and/or dirty water might be your first clues - but it might be impossible to safely leave if any of that happens.  Uncontrollable public panic tends to happen at that point.

Everybody has their own doubts, uncertainties, worries, struggles, etc. and why does yours -- being so elitist -- deserve to represent the ""life under lockdown""? I see no point.  Unfortunately the NYT is full of this stuff, also when it comes to understanding everyday struggles of ordinary Americans, some of who probably never read this site for this reason."

Taking shot at China here, which is mostly vitriol over it not obeying a confused West on climate, will only further frustrate the politically prostrate Left. The Lefts ancestral ilk declined to listen to MacArthur, then Westmoreland. Now it listens to Asia on climate. If you don't think so, take a look at the facts. Perhaps a quarantine precedent can be learned. Stay put Huang, take notes. If nothing comes of this, fine, but don't miss this opportunity.

2020-02-06 14:00:09,Thank you. This is tremendously helpful. Every generation and every technology changes how we communicate about scary things. This may help me not over react.
2020-02-06 16:56:14,Thanks for this important post telling parents not to be scared to express their emotions. That's one of the best ways to teach our children not to hide their feelings.
2020-02-06 16:10:55,"I really hope you understand that memes aren't easy to be used as any type of propaganda. Trust me, as a teen myself, most adults don't know how to use memes to whir advantage."
2020-02-07 13:53:27,Memes are the art of the 21st century. I wouldn’t have it any other way.
2020-02-07 15:43:24,"Memes are a digital ""young people only"" conversation. When we read & react to them without fully comprehending this fact, we are really missing the point. 

I am also the mother of 4 boys (ages 15 to 26.) And the difference between how my older children read & share memes vs my younger children is huge.

The 15 and 17 year old boys have a completely different relationship with memes from 25 & 26 yrs olds. For the younger boys, whole conversations happen in the blink of an eye. Nuanced emotions that could not otherwise be shared get not only shared, but responded to. Older generations get put in their place. Subcontexts and subconscious thoughts get mined. Fears get excavated & released. Balance is found in shared laughter. And yes, really, all of this in the time it takes to read & share, then witness a brother's response. That's the power of memes.

Grownups will always knock on doors with ""no grown ups allowed"" signs. Parents and well-meaning teachers will always fear their lack of influence in those exclusive rooms. But it is precisely the absence of ""appropriate behavior"" requirements that makes a meme powerful. That gives it a ""reason to exist."" And trying to regulate, redeem, translate, or mitigate it, or explain how it might ""cross the line"" fundamentally misunderstands the point. The point IS to cross invisible boundaries. To exist in the ""no grown up allowed"" space. In other words, it is PLAY, of a transitional & critical nature at a critical age of transition."
2020-02-07 15:51:59,"I am an English-German university student and a recently ex-teenager. People of my generation and in my surrounding use memes in a very self deprecation, humorous, but ultimately  politically intelligent way. 
I do not believe jokes like those your sons made are something that should be taken seriously at all. My generation is facing a lot of existential crises like climate change, possible nuclear war and eco system collapse. Most of us have luckily never experienced war or a virus personally as you mentioned, but through the internet the accompanying realities are constantly broadcast right to our computers, phones or tablets in vivid detail.
To be able to make a meme, a self spreading joke that most people are in on, a fundamental understanding of a situation is required. The joke is oftentimes the ridiculous or extreme nature of a statement made. Most people I know regularly make jokes of a similar nature and often intelligent conversations about the issue raised follow. 

So yes, the statements your sone made might shock you, but it means they know and understand what is going on. You might want to follow up by asking their take on what they allude to."
2020-02-07 15:52:33,"For those growing up in a climate where last year's absurdity is this year's normal, with an ecosystem that allows incredibly rapid communication of images and ideas, is it any surprise that young people are turning to media that their parents don't understand? Memes pull on shared experiences, shared fears, and important topics."
2020-02-07 16:52:51,"A great note in this piece is the use of the word ""hilarious"".  I hear that from my teenagers when they are actually feeling uncertain or shocked.  I find myself saying it too sometimes when I hear something that Trump says.  Ugh."
2020-02-07 17:18:47,"I am torn. Others here have already described the nature of memes and the use of transgressive humor as a coping mechanism better than I could have. I tend to agree; hyperbolic statements are often used to express the feeling that your world is dangerous and that life feels out of control. It’s a trust fall. To act as though the whole statement is genuine is to out yourself as out of touch.

I recently read Antisocial by Andrew Marantz, though. Transgressive humor and hyperbole are absolutely part of the toolkit altright, supremacist, and men’s rights movements use to propagandize. In short, to say a meme is hyperbolic is not to say a meme is harmless. I think it’s mostly a matter of minding your “us”s and “them”s, but I would love to hear other folks’ thoughts on recognizing the distinction, and how to handle harmful/hateful memes. Social platforms and meme culture are built to signal boost extreme content."
2020-02-07 14:42:56,"I am neither a teen nor a full-fledged adult, but are adults really this deaf to irreverence? Yikes."
2020-02-07 14:47:17,"Unfortunately there's no reason to assume a parent would be more likely to have the knowledge to give context on world events to their teen. It's just as likely that the teen will be fruitlessly trying to debunk propaganda and rumors their parents read on Facebook, via insufferable boomer memes containing Minions and inappropriate use of the ""crying laughing"" emoji."
2020-02-07 15:30:15,"Life is the same today as it's ever been  in terms of how we relate to the world around us, the social mores. Each generation has always  had a problem relating to it's off spring; this, because when we age , we confuse our fears with reality and project our fears onto our kids. We forget how we were when we were young. I used to sit on the Board of a Waldorf School in California. At one session, in 1990, i found the board all terrified about the use of cannabis at the schoool. I pointed out that of the 14 people in the room, every single one of us  had been a Hippy and smoked more pot over the years than their kids. That's the level of stupidity we find when we get lost in our fantasies about life. The problem isn't the kids and the manner in which THEIR CHOSEN LIFE STYLE differs from ours; it's our projections that cause the disaffection."
2020-02-07 16:57:41,"I love a good meme. They've been cracking me up for year. But lately, being bombarded on Facebook by both pro-Trump memes and anti-Trump memes, I'm starting to worry that many people aren't equipped to deal with the subtle emotional manipulation of memes. Most of the memes I see have a way of encouraging readers to make judgements based on fear, anger, or outrage, and once they get too far down this path there is no reasoning with them anymore. 

I have no idea what can be done about this. It would be foolish to try to ban memes, nor would I want to. (Like I said, they crack me up. The more wrong the better! It's sort of my guilty pleasure...) I'd like to think that we can teach people to think more critically, and that just because you find a meme appealing doesn't mean you should automatically agree with it. My wife thinks I'm dreaming!"
2020-02-07 18:15:14,"Parents of teens should also look at the memes with their children and discuss with them the risks of sharing them too widely. I was reminded of a recent ""Hidden Brain"" episode detailing the effects on a young man who shared racist and sexist memes in a Facebook group and then had his (and others in the group's) admission to Harvard rescinded. Memes are not always harmless and children should be taught that."
2020-02-07 13:56:30,"Jennifer, I don’t think you get this at all.  The example in the opening paragraph isn’t about not worrying, it’s about handling things one has absolutely no control over - which feels like just about everything now.  And then you go further sideways from there.  The last thing anyone exercising much-needed gallows humor wants to hear is crying, or a lecture."
2020-02-07 15:30:25,"It sounds to me that younger people can see the hypocrisy in our society, and have great fears and insecurity about that. War as a video game? Assassination and invasion is noble? It will take more than memes to help the insecurity of those who know they aren’t hearing the truth."
2020-02-07 13:34:26,"Parents shouldn't surrender to the dominance of memes and social media in the lives of their children. They should fight against it. Parents should encourage their kids to read reliable sources of news such as this newspaper. Memes are silly, childish fads. When they replace important information (hey, I guess that article about climate change isn't funny enough to matter to today's teenagers) the world becomes stupider."
2020-02-07 14:52:46,"As a teenager, I find it absolutely hysterical when the NYT publishes articles that try to analyze teen culture. These are articles are so far off the mark. Memes do not embody the teenage psyche, nor are they emblematic of deeper problems. Anyhow, for parents reading these articles to better understand their children, please understand that all teens find this hilarious."
2020-02-07 15:18:46,"Memes are an outlet for young people. Turning them into a teaching opportunity, using them in classrooms, etc. will push teens to other mechanisms. This is the equivalent of your high school history teacher using a rap/hip hop song to teach you about the Declaration of Independence. 

Stop looking for ways to manipulate your children and teens into acting and thinking like adults. Talk to them like they are people. Listen. Answer questions. Stop the pretending and manipulating and using their culture under the facade of “teaching”. All you are really accomplishing is to get in the way of their self expression and the outlets they use to communicate with their piers."
2020-02-07 16:39:26,Using memes to communicate with your teen?  Sounds like a South Park episode.  Good luck.
2020-02-07 19:01:47,I think I’m more empathetic now than I was as a teenager. Not because I made light of things I was afraid of. I had a comfortable childhood and didn’t really understand yet that not every story has a happy ending and some tragedies will leave a person permanently broken in places — whether physically or emotionally.
2020-02-07 22:39:58,"Come on, people.  You remember being a teen and wanting to be cool, right?  That's all this is.  They're making fun of things, just like we did.

We made cartoons or used drawings in exactly the same way kids are using memes, and quite frankly, some of the memes are utterly hilarious.

I think we might be reading too much into this.  Sure, some teens need to communicate more and could probably use a bit more socialization, but aren't they supposed to have fun too?

I think we're over-analyzing things.  Yes, we sometimes live in a dangerous world and we all hope for the best for one and other, but let kids be kids."
2020-02-07 23:01:56,"You can try this, unless your kid is like mine, who rolls his eyes and tells me I don't understand memes! So good luck! :)"
2020-02-08 03:38:50,"There is no such thing as 'teen culture'. The sad thing is that there is no such thing as adult culture anymore, either.

My several teen grandchildren don't have smartphones, so they don't get their news on Instagram or whatever...."
2020-02-07 19:53:21,"I can't stand meme culture. I have two children, a 22-year-old and a 14-year-old. The older one grew up before this garbage became ubiquitous. The younger is hopelessly addicted. No matter how much I restrict phone or screen time there are ways. Kids read these and fill in the rest from their own knowledge which they consider to be massive because, you know, like who reads, right? Since they can stare at countless memes -- that being easier than taking in real information -- they're much smarter than prior generations in their own minds. Bring this up and it's ok boomer despite that I'm solidly a gen-x'er. Come up with a more constructive solution, like throwing the iphone in a lake or canceling the phone plan, and her mom intervenes ""without the phone how would we know where she is?"" giving me the choice of memes or marital strife. Memes of coronavirus? Memes are the digital version of coronavirus."
2020-02-08 10:17:36,"In my junior year of high school, my AP English teacher tried to have a unit on memes and their political implications. She wanted us to rhetorically analyze them. It was the most hilariously out of touch and uber cringe-worthy.

None of the articles we were made read had any understanding of how memes are actually enjoyed and interpreted. It never fails to make me chuckle just how confident older generations are that they can “get memes” when they repeatedly demonstrate that they don’t. My teacher was so confident that armed with English her degree, she could sidestep the fact that she was almost 30 years older than all of meme culture. Based off of the few articles she had read, she felt she had a complete understanding of all things “meme.”"
2020-02-09 14:12:58,"I see a similarity to the media of the 1960s and early 1970s which used dark humor to cope with fears about the war in Vietnam, environmental degradation, and the Cold War.  Memes are just the right medium for smartphones and shorter attention spans.  That's not a jab at teens -- most of us have shorter attention spans these days."
2020-02-08 02:02:32,I'd laugh if it wasn't so sad.   I feel bad for kids today.  It's all so clever now but soon they will lose the thread of logic to why the joke works and the architecture of language and thought that made these references possible.  Sorry you had to do some adulting but it aint all Fenty as the kids say.
2020-02-08 07:47:33,"As a teen, I must quote Luke Skywalker, “Amazing, everything you just said was wrong.”

Have you ever had those parents that would take jokes and turn them into “life lectures”? This is basically what this article is proposing you do with memes and it’ll have the same effectiveness as those lectures: none. You’ll know that you’re not out of touch when your response to a meme feels like a natural response to a conversation instead of a teaching opportunity.

When your teens bless you with the privilege of sharing a meme or joke with you, that means that they’re looking for a light hearted response. If you respond to it by pushing your beliefs onto them in a serious tone, you’ll just push them away, and quite bluntly, they might stop caring about your opinions."
2020-02-09 05:26:26,"I ran into a couple of 19-something college students today and we were talking about this and that, about my own university days. They asked if they could keep in touch with me. I thought, what could I give them which would be secure, they would have? 

I said, ""Do you have 'Discord?'"" 

Their eyes got very wide. I'm a 50-something mom of 3 and I have Discord. I am also a gamer, of COURSE, I have Discord. 

I think I ""get"" memes. I make and collect them. 

ALL memes? No. But most of them. 

Kids are ironic. Kids are irreverent. Kids are disrespectful and they want to seem more grown up than they are. Kids want to be cool. The worse something is, the MORE important it is to be cool about it. I have a young friend who is in quarantine for Corona bc he just came back from China. It's a precaution, but he wouldn't want to get anyone sick. He's being *totally,* the soul of coolness about it. Age? 14. 

Seriously, does *anyone* get dark humor anymore?

This puts the liability and responsibility for their online behavior on us, their parents or guardians.

2020-02-08 05:20:50,"My problem with memes? I get almost nothing from them.  I do not understand what they are trying to communicate. I do not get the cultural references (I know ""what"" Sponge Bob is, but not much more...)  So, am I supposed to find it funny, sarcastic, ironic?   I just get: ""dumb.""  Maybe McLuhan (alert: ""cultural reference!"") was right: the medium is the message...Dumb.
Maybe that is my problem, but it really does not bother me.  Maybe they are not communicating to me, so I feel safe to ignore them.  (No kids, BTW)"
2020-02-14 05:10:34,"I remember the first time I ever saw a TV... it was the only one in our small town in Ohio and my Grandparents, who lived across the street from us, had bought it.  We and other people in town would gather in front of the small round black and white and watch a variety show on Sunday evenings. I was 7 years old. Maybe Ed Sullivan or some one similar.
We moved to Southern California soon after but we still had no TV until I was 9.  I think I benefited as a person because of it.  We had a lot of close family time..a quality of time I don’t think kids have today. The breadth of technology available to them has good and bad points, but if my kids were young today, I wouldn’t allow them to spend all their time on social media until they were old and mature enough to handle it. We loved spending time together when they were young. I wouldn’t have wanted to be replaced by a phone."
2020-03-27 20:58:15,"I wouldn't say that I'm addicted to memes, I would just say that I enjoy watching them on YouTube. Many memes are harmless, but others can be harmful. But you have to understand, some people use memes as a coping mechanism. 
 If you've had a bad day, and you just want to relax, you can turn on TV and search for memes. Many of them are very funny, and I recommend the YouTuber Memenade. Most of his memes are very funny, but there are always some memes that you want to stay clear of. 
 History memes. While they can be extremely funny, they can also be quite offensive. I am a teenager, and I must admit that I really do enjoy a good, and well made meme.
 For any parents reading, please do not be too hard on your children for watching memes. If they are, it's likely a way of coping with something that's stressing them out. Now, I don't know too much about Snapchat, or Instagram, or any social media, because I don't have any, but my friends have told me to stay away from the two that I mentioned, as well as TikTok memes. 
  I also don't have a very good idea of all the tragic things happening in the world, but some memes can raise awareness for these things. 
 While this may seem like a terrible thing to joke about, and it is. Memes about the wildfires in Australia raised an incredible amount of awareness towards the problem. It inspired action in many of the people in Australia, and many started going out in search of hurt animals, like Koalas. 
Not all memes are bad. 
Thank you."
2020-04-01 15:45:30,"I think memes are something that you cannot avoid in this day and age. People from all over the world can give their opinion on a topic in a funny, humorous way.  People who have access to any internet device can view or even make their own memes. I think memes do make the world a better place as long as it has its boundaries."
2020-04-03 06:37:06,"Memes are meant to be humorous, they shouldn't to be taken seriously. Anyone who takes memes misses the point and will probably get hurt. However because they are basically visual jokes, there is a point where they become very disrespectful. As a society, we should not make disrespectful jokes a normal thing because we need to maintain a level of mutual respect. Society shouldn't fall that low. I personally think memes are okay in most situations as long as they are respectful, but there are definitely things memes should not be made about. For example, the Corona virus situation has spawned a lot of memes. Most of them are really funny and aren't harmful. I think these memes are fine, because they bring the internet community together through laughter. It also helps to ease up tension. However, I have also seen some memes that make unfounded statements targeting the Chinese, simply because this started in China. These kind of targeted memes are very harmful. Immigrants have a very hard time as it is adjusting to a new region. I can say that because I am one. We try to learn what is the norm and fit in. When we get called out, it feels awkward. It isn't even necessarily a feeling of disrespect. It's especially true when the meme is just straight up wrong. That's why these kind of memes should stop. We need to create an environment that includes everyone. But, this is something we as a society need to collectively agree on because nobody can control each other on the internet."
2020-04-03 21:45:35,"I think that humor can be one of the best ways to process scary or hurtful information. A lot of famous comedians base their careers around using offensive or dark humour, like George Carlin or Bill Burr. Humor is subjective, so no one should be required to “like” this kind of humor, but as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone I don’t see anything wrong with it. For example, there is definitely something wrong with making Nazi jokes in front of a Holocaust survivor. Otherwise making jokes about serious events can be in bad taste and vulgar, but most of the time lacking malicious and venomous intent. I’m alright with most types of offensive humor personally, but if I knew it hurt people around me that’s when it goes to far."
2020-04-19 23:18:49,"Memes, like all media creations, have a purpose, and it’s the creator’s purpose. Memes are humoristic pieces, but who said that humor is naive? They reflect someone’s ideas, and this someone wants to influence other people. After watching, reading, and laughing, people may, consciously or not, start thinking/acting in a certain way, either playing down the real threat of the coronavirus -- to open up the country before certain conditions are met --, or blaming China like in 1918 Spain was the responsible, for example.
Current teenagers are tomorrow adults and decision-makers, so as parents, we need to find a way to teach values through reflection."
2021-02-08 21:25:00,"Memes really are a prominent avenue for misinformation in society, especially for adolescents and younger adults. However, certain things are given more power over our lives than they really deserve. For instance, violent video games and other media take over the subject of many memes, thus young people who have not been exposed to these things become addicted.

Additionally, the inflation of the COVID-19 pandemic is really much more than it needs to be. The memes that make fun of it or play it down can be damaging, but the Coronavirus 2 SARS is not any more dangerous to the average population than is the Influenza Strain 1. As with any viral disease or bacterial disease, those with a weaker immune system will be vulnerable. Therefore, acting irrationally or out of character is absolutely unnecessary, such as the ""toilet paper"" rush at the beginning of the pandemic.

In a nutshell, memes have a substantial amount of leverage in the minds of young people, so the content creators should be cautious and mindful of what they are writing and how they are portraying their message. As a side note (and simply put), do not believe everything you read, and have some common sense, not reader's sarcasm)"
2021-09-14 12:18:15,I think memes are mostly for fun and entertainment but sometimes they can be offensive. Memes arent really used to spread hate but some people like to spread hate and fear.

If you have dozens or more cases presenting simultaneously in any one city, like what happened in Wuhan, public health workers will get overwhelmed. Especially when a large number of cases will have only minor symptoms while being infectious, and may not even seek medical care.

That is why travel restrictions are an essential part of the initial response to this threat."

It also shows the many weak spots where the system breaks down (that that woman chose to fly knowing she was supposed to stay put and monitor herself). 

I'm sorry to say but this is a microcosm for how the proverbial ""big one"" will go down. No matter how tirelessly those trained in the field work, all it takes is a few people (the young man, a few days ago, who chose to go to a crowded fast food restaurant, the woman who chose to fly) to undo all of the exacting efforts and hard work by trained professionals to safeguard us. 

Turns out you can't take the human out of the human. Call me cynical, but when the next great pandemic strikes, one akin to the flu of 1918, it's going to be an unmitigated disaster and will be precisely because terror, ignorance, selfishness, and pandemonium-- the four most potent vectors when it comes to spreading disease, the other horsemen on the hill--will be unleashed."

China does plenty wrong and plenty right, time for the double standard to be dropped or why should we expect any assistance from them? Because this virus required mutual trust to be resolved."

Rationally I know it's not likely we'd be exposed to the coronavirus, but sitting in a tightly packed dumpling place frequented by many, just made me think it was easier to avoid it.

2020-02-04 22:29:48,"The angles to this growing story are innumerable. I really see this as a black swan event.

First of all, China, the country is closed. Let that sink in fora moment. 

Second, a disease has been unleashed that has overwhelmed the health care system of a city in China and now threatened an entire globe. That is equally concerning.

Third, the reverberations from this event are yet to be seen or even imagined. We are planning on going in a cruise in two weeks---what will happen to the cruise industry when the first coronavirus patient is confirmed in the US. I understand what has happened in Japan but imagine when that comes here. The travel industry, the cruise industry will be just a few of the many casualties.

What about all the goods we both import and export? How is that going to work? What happens when things stop shipping from China because manufacturing has stopped? What is the effects going to be on pricing or just general product availability? How is research going to be affected? Product development?

Will there be geopolitical realignments? New prejudices unleashed? Will there be new acrimony when things get dire and countries insist on closed borders?

In my lifetime, I have never seen an entire country even the size of China roll up their shingle and put out the ""Closed"" sign.

On the other hand, the high end hotels where many affluent Chinese stay may want to step back and take a look at all the fees they’ve imposed over the last few years for just about everything; internet service, gym usage, service fees and the ubiquitous “ resort” fees. Often I think they deserve to suffer a return to reality, when upon checkout you’re handed a bill with hotel,city and state fees that are astronomical in total. While the majority can pay them, that’s not the point.

Let’s hope the free flow of tourists in both directions returns soon. And let’s hope they return to a system that is not continually trying to rip the tourist off. The price of a room should be transparent and inclusive of all fees."

My opinion is that 2019-nCov is a good thing and more so on this election year. DJT's administration has decreased funding of the CDC and Republicans don't care about the general public's healthcare. Both of which can contribute to an epidemic in the USoA. The object lesson from 2019-nCov will have longterm benefits on both sides of the Pacific. My hope is that the outbreak in China will add wind to Bernie's sails, as he's the most decisive candidate when it comes to healthcare.

I don't want to see sharks or dolphins slaughtered to suit Japanese palates, any more than I want to see pangolins or totoabas made extinct, but there is a better way to handle food and maintain cleanliness.

China's food and hygiene practices have been laid bare for the world to see and hopefully the West will be wary to re-hitch its cart to their ox. The deaths and suffering are real, and I am sorry, but some humans are only moved to change by object lessons. As a cyclist, I owned every mistake and kissing asphalt is a great motivator to change behavior."
2020-02-05 11:42:47,"I'm sure this is having an impact, not just in NYC but in countries all around the globe where Chinese tourists have been flocking to in recent years. I'd venture to say  though that the unconstrained spread of the virus around the world would have a far greater impact. So hotels, restaurants and tour group companies will take a financial hit by the drop in Chinese tourists but far better for all of us if we don't become an epicenter of a coronavirus outbreak."
2020-02-05 07:33:17,Really? Chinese businesses outside of China are more important than human lives?
2020-02-04 19:58:41,There are still Chinese tourist groups roaming around. I am on vacation and have seen them because non-native Chinese travel in large groups. There is no self quarantining going on. Has the State Department deemed them safe? The incubation period for this Virus is a couple of weeks. We likely now have a reservoir waiting to emerge. Especially on the West Coast.
2020-02-05 01:32:08,"Bats in caves, snakes eat dead fallen bats (I saw a nature show), snakes are eaten by all kind of things that hang in a Chinese market, and people kiss. Calling it three months and cold season, this pandemic is as serious as it gets when I fear enough to wear gloves to handle products at work from China. 
I used to live in Hawaii when Japanese tourism was happily enjoyed but I feared now that, as reports show, all likes of Asians are in suspect.
Now, this is where trump comes in, it's winter and the Chinese need food now. Can the US farmers supply food now or must the Chinese look to the southern hemisphere? 
I can only say, ""let's wait and see"", as the coronavirus starts to affect the US economy."
2020-02-05 13:13:06,Today would be good time to get some fried rice for lunch. Our Chinese friends would appreciate your not treating them like pariahs.
2020-02-04 14:10:20,If we were so prepared for the coronavirus why are there not testing kits here in NYC?
2020-02-04 19:13:43,"Commissioner Barbot is out of her league.  Other coronaviruses are spread by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching ones eyes, nose or mouth.  Why is this one different?
She should go to Pub Med and read the scientific articles relating to how coronaviruses in general are spread.

By the way one article says that at 4 degrees Celsius (about 41 degrees F) coronaviruses remain viable for 30 days.  At 20 degrees ( around room temperature) they remain viable on surfaces for a week."
2020-02-04 17:44:16,"Somehow, some way, the U.S. is going to be roped into bailing China out for a virus that originated in China. We may even be blamed in the end. Watch and wait; it will happen."
2020-02-04 15:02:44,"If you think you've caught this new Coronavirus maybe you should go and take a quick dip in the East River -- if that doesn't kill it, nothing will."
2020-02-04 13:28:51,"'The C.D.C., however, has more cautious advice. It said it’s not clear if someone can get the virus “by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes.”'

The way to keep relatively healthy is to wash hands thoroughly and often and, even so, never raise hands above one's neck. An itchy eye or nose -- just ignore it. For those with long tresses -- do not wipe that blown stray hair from the mouth. Keep those fingers away from the face."
2020-02-04 14:12:43,"With a city as dense as ours, why are we not automatically quarantining visitors from China?"
2020-02-04 14:05:29,We just paid $12 for a head of red cabbage at a store in Seattle known for organic produce. Perhaps some fines are due here too.
2020-02-04 14:09:06,The problem is that when you have an Orwellian society you end up with Orwellian problems -and no vegetables.
2020-02-04 14:12:26,"Like misguided politicians in the US often seek to do, Chinese officials are acting against “gouging” of consumers, heavily fining a supermarket for selling cabbage at $9 a head. As a result, consumers who wished to pay the current market price of $9 and obtain cabbage will be unable to do so. Great result."
2020-02-04 14:43:26,"Honestly this was one of my first thoughts, that food would become scarce. After Hurricane Harvey we suspended the rules of good nutrition, but we had enough to eat. I hope that is the only sacrifice families must make."
2020-02-04 14:45:09,"I'm very ambivalent about the volunteers jumping in to alleviate the shortages. Their sense of civic duty is admirable but remarks like ""we have to listen to the government...what the government wants, that's how it's going to be,"" are frightening.   

It is both heart warming and chilling at the same time."
2020-02-04 14:45:43,"China bashing is in full swing .  We are blaming them for food habit hygiene and now alluding to the bio-engineering gone wrong 

It seems it is like nuclear accidents that have taken place over the years in Georgia ,NY  and outside in Spain 

Escape of virus intentionally or unintentionally  is  likely to happen when people are testing and altering genetic sequences ,thinking of potential change that can affect certain ethnicity, and pharma is considering how to prepare for a hypothetical disaster.  

The unfortunate part is that China is no different from any other country when trying to hide  any role that can raise concerns about  self - image,accepting blame,shunning responsibility,facing possible public outrage and not losing undue benefits which are  all  linked in one big thread of otherwise seemingly  normal activity ."
2020-02-04 14:54:44,"@Ken M. - If they allowed price gouging, very soon no one who couldn't afford to pay $9 a head for cabbage (and equally inflated prices for other foods) would have anything to eat at all. 

Millions of people trapped in a city is bad enough (but a necessary evil at this point). Millions of starving people trapped in a city would result in tragedy beyond most people's ability to even comprehend. The government is absolutely right to control prices. 

In any emergency scenario, allowing business owners to significatly raise prices only compounds the misery and suffering that has already occurred due to the underlying disaster."
2020-02-04 15:18:20,"Swine flu and bird flu outbreaks along with the coronavirus epidemic are certainly plaguing China's ability to feed its populace just as a China was becoming a world leader in tech production. As in the U.S., poor animal husbandry by agribusiness may be helping to spread these infectious diseases among animals meant for human consumption. Just as in the U.S. and the rest of the Western world perhaps greater use of meat substitutes may prevent the chance of animal epidemics spreading to human populations."
2020-02-04 15:20:06,"China should be commended for taking drastic steps to fight and eradicate the coronovirus. One of my concerns is, many people who are restricted from leaving or travelling will find there financial resources curtailed because they cannot work. Soon many families will not be able to purchase the neccessities of life like groceries(food) , shelter & medicine. However if there is one country that can mobilize & defeat the coronovirus, it's China."
2020-02-04 15:46:09,"Looking at the recent achievements of China, lifting almost a billion people out of extreme poverty in 40 years and at the same time moving from the tenth to second largest world economy, it is simply mind numbing that Americans want to offer criticism. The US is a democracy with a downward and failing trajectory. Poverty levels are flat, (at best) and upward economic opportunity being replaced by skyrocketing inequality. And if we want to make comparisons about ability to respond to natural disasters, let’s look at Puerto Rico or Katrina. No hospitals built there in just a few short days. And when treated in the USA overall healthcare outcomes can be expected to be abysmally low yet expensive while China’s access and outcomes are dramatically increasing and improving.  Want to feel safe? Walk around a Chinese city at night. 

China is far from perfect, corruption is rife, the news is skewed and censored (sound familiar?) and they have a long way to go to reach the standards of a “Western Democracy” but their system of government has catapulted their nation into success. 

My bet is they will deal with this health challenge, in the same manner that has driven them forward over the last four decades."
2020-02-04 15:51:47,I think the comment from the chili farmer who remembered how he had been helped out from the help of others and if his half ton of chilis turned out to be unpaid and became a gift he was O.K with that makes me feel that the sentiment is very honorable and gets lost in all this China bashing we see all the time.
2020-02-04 15:52:52,"Sounds more like the masses are helping themselves and each other, while the government is just making demands of producers and providers to send more. Like the comment below made about the US and Puerto Rico, Katrina, and other states, I don't believe the US could mobilize and build a hospital in two weeks. 

Here in the New England area, when there is a snow storm there is a run on the groceries to the point of empty shelves. Imagine if we had an epidemic or natural disaster that meant possibly weeks of an event, versus just a few days for a snow storm. I am not certain what Americans would do. After 9/11, Manhattan and New York/New Jersey residents seemed to have banded together.

Let's hope this epidemic in China and Worldwide has peaked and infected/sick are far fewer than predicted."
2020-02-04 15:54:33,"My understanding is that, generally speaking, Chinese people like to shop for fresh food just about every day. Unlike Americans, they don't shop weekly and don't have as large refrigerators/freezers. They could make do stocking up on less perishable items, but their normal eating habits will be disrupted."
2020-02-04 16:01:53,"Trump has a well known self proclaimed love of winning, I am sort of puzzled that he is passing on his opportunity to one up China in their hour of need. He should sell or donate what can be legally sent to China all the food and medical supplies they need and have the packaging all say Made or Donated from the USA, sort of like we did during the Marshall Plan after WW2. He can even emblazon the packaging with President Donald J Trump (impeached suffix optional), and even if for all the wrong reasons for helping other hurting human beings, his usually hollow gotcha would allow his subsequent preening to benefit somebody besides himself."
2020-02-04 16:02:39,"Sanitation seem to be inconsistent at best, desperate at worst. Trucks crossing a quarantine line are sanitized (what is that going to do?), but a guy in a cloth coat (cloth holds shed cells well) leans into a man’’s car and nearly touches his forehead with the temperature reader. Cars are pretty germ laden places, especially in winter when you have the heat running on air recirculation. So then the checkpoint guy does the same thing with the next car, and the next. and viruses live how long on surfaces?"
2020-02-04 16:44:16,"The description of the chili pepper farmer who  with his wife and 2 daughters picked one ton of peppers and would be fine if he didn't get paid for them sent chills up my spine.  In the US, the agribusiness operator would have hired a half dozen undocumented workers, or turned on the AC in the automated picking machine and hit the ""Pick"" button  after the satellite sent him the right GPS info.  And the invoice would have been paid by the US treasury. The cash needs to flow to pay the pickers and the bank that owns the machinery, or the family corporation that runs the farm cannot continue to operate."
2020-02-04 17:02:47,"Insightful article. To the New York Times: Please help us to find a way to help these people who are suffering in China, we don’t need more fear inducing and critical articles, we want to know what kind of helps they are getting and how we can help! I am puzzled by the lack of support to China from the international community. China has been our biggest trade partner for over 25 years, these people made probably half of the products in our house and on our body. They can made them affordable and provided American importers and mega corporations profit margins hence employment opportunities and tax dollars for the American people. They also buy a lot of our products from us.  They are suffering and yet apart from endless criticisms and racism, no support or even just a shred of sympathy has been offered. China is  doing the best they can. Millions of people are suffering with constant fear, lack of food and supply and a very uncertain future.
We need to figure out a way to help, not to throw more rocks."
2020-02-04 15:03:57,Americans should not be smug about China's problems in distributing food in the face of this coronavirus epidemic. How well would our food distribution work if/when a coronavirus-like epidemic invades North America? Can anyone imagine the Trump Administration handling such a disaster!
2020-02-04 16:11:16,"The Iron Rice Bowl, ""we must feed the people"" Deng Xiaoping.  The drive for nutrition is at the core of Chinese civilization.  Numerous populace is their power but also their achilles heel."
2020-02-04 16:24:00,"As a people we are loosing our own history. We then offer judgments about how China must use normal supply and demand economic policy during this crisis which we all hope and expect to be short term. Try googling ‘Food Rationing in the US’ and ‘Fuel rationing in the US’ and Richard Nixons price controls while your at it. The concept of individual liberty with no concept of obligation to others, or freedom of speech with on concept of acceptance of consequences when that freedom is abused to harm. 
Other counties find it these pronouncements of policy that we ourselves don’t use, to be a demonstration of arrogance and honestly they also seen stupid. Not because the policies are wrong, they are misapplied due to lack of education or memory."

2020-02-04 16:27:29,"Brave people!  I impressed by the regular people who are working without knowing they will get paid. If the U.S. avoids an epidemic this spring, next winter people from Wuhan will be in high demand as caregivers if the infection confers immunity. I think 2019-nCoV will eventually circle the globe. We should not be jerks to China right now. The research they are doing will help us later."
2020-02-04 16:37:16,"Let us not judge the Chinese too harshly.  This country is awash in guns with an aggravated political divide. Survivalists and at least one major American religion known for stockpiling food (Hello, Idaho and Utah) are undoubtedly watching this play out."
2020-02-05 11:55:27,"There is a message here for all of us, especially those in major cities,  who depend on ""Just in time"" delivery of food, medicine, etc. as even a temporary disruption can cause chaos.

2020-02-04 15:42:27,"In the photos I see, I don’t understand why people wear masks but not gloves. Based on sources such as the CDC and this paper, old-fashioned hand washing is a better defense against the virus than masks. I understand the anxiety that leads people to wear masks anyway, but it seems to me that anxiety would suggest gloves as well. Gloves not only protect hands from picking up or transferring germs but also keep one from accidentally putting one’s unwashed hands in one’s mouth or other orifices."
2020-02-03 13:57:21,how can the west ever compete against such power?
2020-02-03 14:01:16,"I read an article like this and reinforces my fear that the Chinese will simply pile over the United States as a world power. I realize this isn't related to the current issue i.e. the outbreak of the Corona virus but the ability of the municipal authorities to build an operational 1000 bed hospital in ten days simply awe inspiring.  
How long would it take to do this in the United States?  Five years? I think so.  The argument that socialism is dead or obsolete is probably mistaken.  The command economy that the Chinese have built is similar to the command economy the U.S. and other countries had during the Second World War.  Dealing with pandemics is one area where this mobilization seems essential."
2020-02-03 14:00:28,Amazing.
2020-02-03 14:06:28,"Nothing short of extraordinary. No matter what your opinion is of the Chinese authorities, you can't help but be impressed. Permits? Who needs 'em! Union work regulations? Fiddlesticks! Adequate drying & curing time for poured concrete? Eh..."
2020-02-03 14:08:10,"I would love to see the project management plan for this hospital.  The coordination is brilliant. Just look at what can be accomplished for the public good. Stunning.

Thank you for covering this fascinating aspect of the health crisis. Please continue with more details as they can be learned. We have a lot to learn."

2020-02-03 14:09:26,"It will be only a matter of days, at most, before Trump begins to reference this feat at his rallies and other public occasions with admiration and as an exemplar while contrasting and complaining about the foot-dragging and obstruction in the construction of his wall - continuing to demonize the democrats.

Authoritarianism will be praised and idealized, while the rule of law, democratic processes, and the Constitution will continue to be disparaged and rejected by Trump and his enablers."
2020-02-03 14:12:14,"On a terminally jammed highway near the European city where I live, there is a 7-year project plan to widen it and expand an existing tunnel with an extra lane... the work goes on at a seemingly glacial pace, you rarely see more than a few crews of workers over the entire 10-mile stretch. 

While fuming in the endless traffic jams I often say that the Chinese would have done the entire job in 6 months, but seeing this amazing feat of project management and engineering, perhaps I was being pessimistic."
2020-02-03 14:15:28,"Think about this accomplishment by the Chinese and then compare it to the years it takes to complete a similar project in the US. Authoritarian governments have drawbacks, but getting major projects done quickly is not one of them. Imagine what the rail lines on the Eastern seaboard would look like if the US government had the ability to push public benefit projects through in a similar fashion. Instead we are left with decrepit railways that run at a fraction of the speed that they could run at. 

Maybe Trump's regulatory rollbacks aren't so bad. It may be a step in the right direction."

We here in Chile figure that Chinese will be the world economic power within 10 years.  Already Mandarin Chinese is offered in all public schools..."
2020-02-03 14:11:47,A functioning hospital - no.

2020-02-03 14:17:50,"Slap construction materials together in a few days and you have a structure.  But, I doubt enough care was not taken as it relates to safety, functionality and long term resilience.  Would not be surprised if it starts crumbling after a few short years, or that there are plumbing, electrical, communications or host of other system failures almost immediately.  But knowing China's allergy to criticism we'll not hear about it for some time."
2020-02-03 14:18:24,"This is an incredible achievement but is it merely an ostentatious display to the world? Local residents in China claim that when they show up at hospitals to report coronavirus symptoms, they are being turned away. Those that have passed away are being documented for death of other reasons other than coronavirus and their bodies are being burned."
2020-02-03 14:18:36,"I can't see how the concrete foundation could properly cure in such a short time... I'd imagine that foundation cracks will appear at some point in the future, which can cause the building to collapse.

2020-02-03 14:20:47,And in the U.S. it can take 20 or more years to replace a simple bridge and cost 20 times more than what it costs in other countries to build.  We should just hire China to come over and replace all of our infrastructure.  I figure they could get it all done in less than five years at a fraction of the cost.  We should also outsource our healthcare and educational complexes to other countries to get better results at a fraction of the costs.
2020-02-03 14:25:16,"Yes, this is amazing. Having visited China and lived in Japan for many years, I have witnessed many construction and repair projects. Not only the speed of construction is remarkable, but the consideration for traffic flow and inconvenience for commuters is taken into consideration. If the commuter rails were ever late--a real rarity--you'd receive a personal apology from company staff and a late notice. The NYC subway, while decently reliable, is a filthy dinosaur compared to the urban subways of China and Japan. We can learn a lot from the speed and care which these countries invest in their infrastructure. May the Chinese government's commitment to stopping this terrible virus pay off as quickly as possible."
2020-02-03 14:26:31,"Shabby construction aside, how does China qualifies doctors, nurses and other hospital personnel necessary to run a 1,000+ hospital bed in 10 days?"
2020-02-03 14:29:13,"This is a stunning accomplishment and a lesson for our country. Try to build a hospital like this in this country. First, the NIMBYs would rally, worried about traffic, and all ""those people"" with the coronavirus near them. There would be lawsuits over zoning issues. Angry hearings. Political backsliding, until the government gives up and takes over a local arena and converts that to a temporary hospital. And that's what we will do if this becomes a problem here. 

I hope our government acts fast, hard and decisively if we need to manage this virus. Just like China but way better. The public needs to get a grip."
2020-02-03 14:30:11,"If a medical emergency of this magnitude ever presented itself in the U.S. , we would meet it with an equal urgency.  A two story structure is an easier construction because it has less safety concerns than a bridge, tunnel or a multi level building ."
2020-02-03 14:31:06,"A hospital is not just a place to warehouse sick people.

A hospital needs lots of highly trained staff.  The usual number in the US is roughly 4 staff per each bed, don't know about China.  Will they have around 4000 doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, x-ray techs, and so on, and on, on the premises immediately?   oh, and experienced in care of pneumonias rather than, say, obstetrics?
A hospital needs laboratories, and oh! the equipment and reagents, which need to be held at correct temperatures in order to retain accuracy.
A pharmacy, again with the temperature problem.

2020-02-03 14:39:50,"I see a common thread in comments in this section that a bridge would take 10 years to be build in the US. That is not true. The I-35 bridge over the Mississippi River that collapsed in downtown Minneapolis several years ago serves as an example.  Between clearing the debris, designing the new bridge, construction and opening to traffic with all safety regulations in place it took 15 months to build the bridge.  And let's not forget that within these 15 months there were 7 months were frigid Minnesota winter weather to deal with.

I only have great job to say to all the people that worked on this major construction work, while still remembering the lives lost during the fall of the old bridge."
2020-02-03 14:36:34,"This is an example of quick decisions and actions, something the western government can only wish of doing. If an outbreak this size were to occur in the US, it would have taken months due to build a new facility due to all the regulations, unions, government approvals involved. Yes quality is not good as Americans repeatedly exaggerates, but its better than to not having any heath care or waiting months for more people to get infected and die."

2020-02-03 14:42:40,"Reading this makes me wonder whether democracies are ""better"", when the capabilities of communist style military rule would seem to give that society an adaptive edge toward meeting disaster demands.  The Times ran an article that the Chinese authorities stifled the reporting of the disease in a claimed affront to freedom, well the other side of the coin is those authorities built a hospital in ten days....so it's a mixed bag.  We can always say freedom is more important [although do we really have that here if we aren't entitled to fair elections anymore?] but survivability and adaptation are perhaps more important toward the future of our species."
2020-02-03 14:43:28,"There is a message here, the way China gets things accomplished and the way our country might respond.

There is of course no way a modern fully functioning hospital can be completely built in 10 days, however building rooms with dormitory type accomodations for quarantine  is a distinct possibility .

Yet look beyond the hospital, consider the single minded determination needed to even consider a project of this kind. What if that determination were applied to a different set of parameters.  Space, weapons, pseudo capitalism which we see now.  Monopolistic practices so overwhelming they could alter the very path of humanity.

Far better and less dramatic to have spent the effort and money with all this autocratic power to have educated the populace about these practices, both culturally and intellectually, answered protein requirements so even the poorest people did not have to resort to eating wild infected animals, and strong inspection and sanitary regulations against them being sold to the public as food. 

Lack of regulation has gotten the world swine flu, bird flu, SARs virus and now this new corona virus. 
Well, I'd say with my grandmother that ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,"" and some well placed regulations would have prevented a hospital or two needing to be build in 10 days. 

Very dramatic action, no doubt, but won't bring back the close to almost 400 dead so far that strong regulations and education would have saved."
2020-02-03 14:43:51,"If they’re laying concrete, they’re not building in the 21st century."
2020-02-03 14:44:58,"Criticize China all you want, but give credit where it’s due.  Constructing that hospital at a lightning pace is remarkable by any standard."
2020-02-03 14:45:45,"A government that works for the people can draw upon its resources to respond quickly to emergencies.  This is no fancy, designer hospital with a lobby that resembles an upscale mall.  Built with prefabricated units with readily available medical  equipment and staffed by public employees it can meet the sort of emergency brought on by an epidemic.  Kudos to China."
2020-02-03 14:52:06,Astonishing accomplishment. I can't fathom how they managed this feat. The just-in-time logistics alone boggle the mind.
2020-02-03 14:55:16,"Think of how our government responded to the disaster in New Orleans.  
Perhaps this hospital is only a containment unit.  And I am certain that it was not designed to be like a traditional  hospital that treats all kinds of issues like traumatic injury, births, rehabilitation, etc.  I'm sure it doesn't do research.  But it probably does exactly what is needed under the circumstances.  Bravo."
2020-02-03 14:56:10,"What is interesting in the photos is the sky.  Is that misty weather or frightening levels of air pollution?  Much can be done very quickly, if we ignore the environment."
2020-02-03 14:58:04,"This is a remarkable achievement. But the biggest limitation to expansion of medical facilities is not buildings or equipment, it is manpower. Every city in China can build additional hospitals if they need to. Where are they going to get the doctors and nurses to staff them? That too in the middle of an ever expanding epidemic, where doctors and nurses will among the first to get infected."
2020-02-03 14:49:59,"We returned from four and a half years living in Wuhan last year. Our first apartment, in a “high end” community, had major plumbing issues. Wallpaper peeled from the walls, black mold spread from a corner in the bathroom, tubs and showers leaked, and a fine debris sifted down from damp ceilings. Tiles came loose and fell from building sides and from stairwell steps. This was a newer building, less than 10 years old. The apartment we moved to later had uneven concrete stairwell steps. I tried to climb them as part of a workout. Impossible to do without tripping. When our undermount sink dropped down into the vanity, they just glued it back on. The leaky ceiling? Just spread some quick dry concrete over it. 

We were lucky. Our coworkers kitchen caught on fire due to faulty wiring. The whole house nearly burnt down.

The development speed is astounding, and it may look impressive from a distance, but the buildings in Wuhan aren’t made well and aren’t built to last. And I don’t believe any are truly safe."
2020-02-03 14:44:44,"Kinda like a lot of the remarkable accomplishment I see there. Shenzen blows me away. 

Our democracy does severely complicate matters. 
Perhaps we should start our version of this now. It is long know global warming would increase disease. The buildings could be designed for multiple social purposes."
2020-02-03 15:00:15,The US Military could combine its deploy-able Hospital infrastructure and do this too.  Provided they were given a site to do it.  Otherwise the environmental impact lawsuits would go on for seven to 10 years.
2020-02-03 15:07:21,"It is interesting how they are building the hospital since it literally looks like shipping containers put together. Instead of building a concrete hospital from scratch, they put many equally shape rectangular boxes together to form the hospital. My gut says this hospital isn't mean to be permanent since it was built so quickly utilizing pre-built units. But it makes sense to build something quickly that will suffice. I think it is a good plan for any future pandemic."
2020-02-03 15:07:34,"This is certainly the upside of what authoritarian governments can do. Probably not the best of work for the long term, but impressive nonetheless."
2020-02-03 15:01:26,Not sure why they have bars on the windows.  Maybe those prefab units were designed for prisons or toy factories.
2020-02-03 15:03:03,I think the ability to slap together a hospital in 10 days is one of the more exciting and positive aspects of a totalitarian government.
2020-02-03 14:44:47,"I wonder if the building is built with safety standards in mind, or if it will simply collapse one day."
2020-02-03 14:54:41,Imagine if we mustered this kind of response to the water system in Flint ...
2020-02-03 14:48:26,"This is an advantage of authoritarian governments. However, when we think back on different moments in U.S. history like the response to Pearl Harbor and the New Deal, Americans are not incapable of harnessing their considerable abilities to a accomplish common goal. Instead of wasting our time downplaying an admirable response by the Chinese, it's time we think about why our government is currently so dysfunctional. It's not just about throwing out regulations so that we have to address the same problems that originated those regulations 5 to 10 years down the line. It would be nice if the brilliant minds that figured out how to deliver media garbage and deception on a global scale to manipulate voters for the highest bidder would set themselves the goal of working for something we could all feel satisfied by, such as consensus building for a better future."
2020-02-03 14:53:19,"It takes months to get an appt with my Dr in my town of 100,000 people, and when I do they can hardly be bothered to do anything more than take my BP.  I don't want to even think of how terrible this would be if Coronavirus hits my city or any other similar community in the USofA.   But not to worry, we have a very stable genius steering the ship....America.  Yippee!!"
2020-02-03 14:54:04,"No way they poured concrete foundations,  tied rebar, installed elect/plumbing in 10 days. The building couldn't be inspected in that period. I declare it will fall down on the patients."
2020-02-03 15:07:11,"Please, don't forget that China has a long history of deciding to do something big and then doing it at the expense of quality, the environment, liberty, individuals, ethnic groups, etc. While it may seem impressive, China has a rich history of covering up the costs and the quality is typically not great. It reminds me a bit of Arrested Development and building a fake house to fool the investors. 

Additionally, only one other comment noticed the bars on the windows. This is not a hospital, it's a place to force people to go to and isolate them while they are sick. Will they receive treatment? Will it be humane? Who knows? 

Ultimately, this is not a model to aspire to."
2020-02-03 14:46:17,Okay so the Chinese can build a new hospital in a week. Meanwhile Trump struggles to build a useless wall across the desert.  Welcome to the  decline of America.
2020-02-03 15:12:16,"Undeniably impressive. But that’s only the beginning. Furniture, supplies, staffing, supervisory and record keeping systems...all this and more has to be in place for a hospital to function."
2020-02-03 15:15:12,"This is an expedient hospital built with prefab buildings: a useful response, but not an engineering marvel. It's been slower to construct than a military field hospital would have been. The model for disasters and outbreaks elsewhere has been to expand quickly using containerized modules and tents."
2020-02-03 15:15:36,"Yes, it’s a feat. But yet the ‘hospital’ looks not much different from a sea of modular construction trailers one sees all over China, albeit on a grander and connected scale. Time will tell whether it can operate as an hospital with the appropriate technology and qualified personnel. If this can be accomplished during a time of crisis, why can China not use such party determination during normal times and improve upon a healthcare system which is derided by most of its citizens?"
2020-02-03 15:14:37,"That's insane.  For many people, it's two weeks in between paychecks.  When I heard they were building a thousand bed hospital in 10 days, I thought it would look like an army installation with temporary structures and such.  That looks like a complete two-story facility with nice walkways all around.  I wonder if it has a food court."
2020-02-03 15:19:35,This is amazing.  Keep at it China - you can beat the problem in no time.
2020-02-03 15:25:12,"As usual and worthwhile, we discuss the pros and cons of building a hospital in 10 days or 7. This deals with the ideas of democracy, efficiency and usefulness versus quality Some say hooray fro throwing it up fast, other concerned that it is a piece of junk and will soon be falling apart and hence a waste. Others note the bars on the windows implying the state will be ""locking"" people up.
A good human discussion about communism versus democracy; the decline of America versus the rise of China; the problem of overpopulation and the spread of disease and the concern about commodities and destruction of the planet; global climate disaster versus can we save the species and the planet; human creativity versus human greed, hate and the other seven sins.

I wonder when we shall get answers to these questions and become able to see  the fate of our species?"
2020-02-03 15:22:09,The environmental impact studies here would delay groundbreaking by 5 years.
2020-02-03 15:13:03,"Q: Why is China panicking now?

A: Because their state system was too busy crushing dissent and covering up how bad the virus was when it first presented.

Much like the Soviet coverup of Chernobyl. This is classic authoritarianism. Deny, deny, deny. Coverup, coverup, coverup, until such a time as it becomes impossible to hide the truth. Then, AFTER there is an  emergency, mobilize orders of magnitude more resources than it would have taken to prevent the emergency, after the fact, just to try to contain it.

If China would have been transparent from the get go and mobilized international response teams, they could have contained this threat to Wuhan, and they wouldn’t NEED to build a hospital in 10 days."
2020-02-03 15:29:57,"Just goes to show that when you throw everything possible into it, the impossible can be achieved.  It is a shame that the Chinese government was not more pro-active when the earliest patients came in over two months ago."
2020-02-03 15:02:56,i remember a country that used to build ships in 30 days
2020-02-03 15:41:16,"To all those saying this is an incredible accomplishment that the US could never achieve need to understand that this is not a permanent structure. 

You can't compare building a bridge that needs to last 50 years to a bunch of shipping containers set up to be temporary housing for hospital beds. This is also not a fully functioning hospital, and 1,400 medical staff is not nearly enough to fully support 1,000 beds unless the purpose is quarantine and basic care (i.e., providing IVs and medication).

This is about quarantine. 

If an epidemic like the 1919 flu breaks out in the US again, we would respond as quickly and effectively. We also have better medical infrastructure already in place in urban centers. We also are more focused on prevention rather than the response in the absence of prevention."
2020-02-03 15:34:18,Great job   An example of what can be done when a government sees the need and takes care of it.  If it were a fire;then we would not be surprised at the quick response.  In America we fight fires better than almost any country. In the area of health care we are not the envy of the world
2020-02-03 15:40:26,Why does the new hospital have bars on all the windows?  This suggests it is built to serve as a quarantine/confinement facility.  A more ominous implication.
2020-02-03 15:35:19,NYC tried to update its subway after 100 years. It's sort of close.

2020-02-03 15:42:21,"This is a Stakhanovite experiment, designed to dazzle all who might have lost faith into China's Communist regime.  A dash of heroics that is supposed to cover the root cause of this crisis - a total governance failure of local government in Wuhan and a botched reaction of the party leaders in Beijing.  

I hope that this tragic episode will prod China to solve the issues of unsanitary markets, food supply standards and safety and a health system that is inadequate in handling the needs of 1.3Bn population and the possible health emergencies like this one."
2020-02-03 15:37:58,"This quote from the article reads:

 “The city government needed to build the makeshift hospital quickly using prefabricated units to ease a persistent shortage of hospital beds and medical supplies.”

So they only build hospitals when people are dying?"
2020-02-03 15:37:42,"This would take a year in the U.S.

And that would just be for permit approvals."
2020-02-03 15:40:56,We can't even agree to repair aging infrastructure. Maybe we should adopt some Chinese methods?
2020-02-03 15:44:58,"Many will criticize this as a building that will fall down soon and be a piece of junk.

They all miss the point that this could not be done with capitalism; it would take years to build a hospital of this size here. I might say JUST ONE OF the horrors of capitalism.

The point is a crisis is at hand and they are solving it IN DAYS! Get the people with the disease isolated and treated. Get to the problem immediately and solved. You can watched the buildings fall apart later when the problem is solved. 
Big problems no longer get solved in America; some call it the decline of America and I agree. Health care insurance problems are killing people and keeping them insecure and up at night and hurting their children; we have money wasted by the trillions on our 800 military bases and military industrial complex; the atomic scientists pointed out this week the fact twe are getting closer and closer to nuclear war (100 minutes to midnight on their ""clock); corruption is rampant in our government where the wealthy and corporations keep themselves rich and powerful while the poor get poorer; life span decreases and the suicide rate increases in; we have gun murders of huge proportions and ignore our children. Countries like Finland are glorious, happy countries, far happier than people in America. On and on I could go.

So you should be complaining about your own country, not that China is ""showing ""authoritarianism."" You get lied to by our president several times a day, etc."
2020-02-03 15:28:55,May be China can train a medical doctor in ten days too.

Could we do something similar if need be and with the same speed?  I hope someone is planning for such an eventuality, but I have my doubts in a country that thinks cutting the CDC’s budget is a good way to save money."
2020-02-03 15:56:22,"My question is, what materials did the Chinese construction companies, or the government itself use as the foundations for the hospital?  

That area of the world is not immune to earthquakes.  

Does it take many days for cement once poured into a rebar matrix to dry and set?  The other components, electrical, HVAC, and plumbing can be installed but the time necessary to dry the cement?"
2020-02-03 16:08:25,And this is an ideal example of why China will dominate the world. If they want to do something they do it. Here is the US it would take 10 months for local politicians to decide on whose name would be on the building or which Senators son would sit on the construction company's board.
2020-02-03 16:09:06,"That the Chinese government and its workers can put together a building so quickly to treat those who are suffering from this disease is an amazing feat. 

If it is going to help people NOW when it is needed, then so be it. Hopefully, post outbreak, the government will make sure it is a sturdy building. Until then, the old saying, “any port in a storm” comes to mind."

They are doing what we in America could do at one time.

One does not have to agree with the communist dictators in Beijing.

But the system over the years have produced a system that is an envy of the world.

I have been to China many times.

I have also ridden the Tibet train - the highest at some 15,000 ft in the world.

Chinese had hired Swiss engineers to help them with this train.

The Swiss advised them to abandon the project as technically next to impossible.

China thanked them, paid them and saw them off

And they finished the job without any foreign assistance."
2020-02-03 16:13:50,"Two points I'd like to emphasize.
First, these were built using modular construction. This basically means that the units are per-fabricated (think of the big metal containers you see on cargo ships). The pre-fab units then get welded together. This significantly reduces construction time, and we could do it in the US if faced with a crisis. Although probably not quite as fast.

Second, as someone who constructs hospitals in the US, there are a lot of hospital regulations that are important and not just unnecessary ""red-tape."" For example, certain rooms must have ""positive pressure"" or ""negative pressure"" to either keep sick-particles out or in. Without that, you could have infectious air floating around the whole facility, getting everyone sick. If this hospital does not take those precautions, then you might get coronavirus by just going to the hospital."
2020-02-03 16:13:57,"Bravo to the Chinese and their accomplishment here!  Sometimes I yearn for the kind of authorial vision that  can create marvels like this.  Look what they did for the Summer Olympics or the 800-mile high-speed rail system linking Beijing to a faraway province built within three years!  Meanwhile, the U.S. suffers the effects of aging infrastructure throughout the country and a transportation system that’s the envy of no one.  Just imagine the effect on our lives and the economy— on the eastern seaboard — if you could link up cities with trains that cruise at 200 mph, so that it would take about an hour to go from my home in Albany to midtown Manhattan!"
2020-02-03 16:04:50,"Big deal, it’s made from prefab materials, easy to give them a pat on back.

BTW what if the Chinese government had delayed action and not did the lock down, what would the count have been in the other countries, so easy again to talk about what they did wrong!

BTW there are things like quick set concrete and also it ain't a skyscraper so deep foundations and thus aren't needed, duh"
2020-02-03 16:19:00,"It’s one thing to build a pre fab hospital for 1000 patients. It’s a completely different thing to staff the hospital with the trained providers (doctors, nurses, etc) and staff (clerks, X-ray technicians, janitors, patient transporters, etc) needed to take care of those patients round the clock.  Who is going to care for the patients?"
2020-02-03 16:53:54,"I read recently that China has poured more concrete in the last three years than the United States did in the last 100.

Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that people on food stamps are portrayed as parasites, while billion dollar companies like FedEx, and multi-millionaires like Jared Kushner, who not only pay nothing in taxes, but actually use their tax position as a revenue stream, are held up as icons of responsibility.

If capital gains were taxed at the same rate as labor we could probably replace every road, bridge, school, hospital, and firehouse in this country every 20 years."
2020-02-03 16:54:12,"There is no way around saying this is impressive, despite a number of provisos. I doubt seriously that we could do this. Clearly this is not a level one hospital as we know them. Doubt they will do all that much surgery or treat an entire spectrum of problems. Probably designed to deal with many patients with very similar problems. Of course, some of this could have been for show, and sure they may have shortages of medical staffing. 
This hospital appears to have bars on the windows and external HVAC ducting. They had excess construction capacity (or the ability to divert 7,000 workers from active projects) including heavy equipment and materials. Apparently, they had a lot of medical equipment ready to go. Some of all of that could have been redirected from elsewhere in the country including staffing.
Modular construction implies simplicity of course but ask yourself why/how they had these units already ready for deployment. And, they had plans and specs in place. My guess is all that had been preplanned per military planning. 
Pretty impressive at any level."
2020-02-03 16:15:33,"Mr. Xue's mother was probably not counted as a dead victim of the coronavirus. I wonder if the Chinese government's official report was accurate, or did they intentionally keep the number low."
2020-02-03 16:14:50,"My discussion only related to the construction.

I would face the reality when writing down the discussion. The reality is: (1) The population is huge in China (so does for Wuhan city); (2) The government is powerful enough to show the things that people need to know; (3) The government is also powerful enough to gather the resource to achieve quick development under special circumstances;
(4) The virus outbreak is an emergency, or a special circumstance; (5) The hospital with 1000 bed and facilities is ready in 10 days.

Based on those facts, my opinions are:
Due to (1) and (2), the outbreak was not well controlled in early stage. However, we need to face the fact. The fact is that the virus is spreading out rapidly and the infections increase fast. To solve the problem, you need more hospitals in short period. In China, this problem can be solved as listed in (3)-(5). My point is, the 10-day-construction is amazing for sure. I would like to know if there is an comparable case (1000 bed with equivalent facilities) around the world.

If you want to say, ""why you can constrain the virus in early stage?"" ""In US, the outbreak like that is impossible so the US doesn't need 10-day-construction"", etc. That's another story."

2020-02-03 16:36:20,"Was the prefab also made in 10 days or was the parts stashed somewhere in China’s equivalent of FEMA? Seems like slower but more permanent version of FEMA’s white tents field hospital.

I wonder if it is possible to stack it higher inside a stadium and instead of digging down and laying pipes and wires for water, sewage, and electricity, just hook it in to stadium’s existing power and sewage lines.

Something to explore and maybe coordinate by major countries for future emergencies. These prefab can be loaded onto cargo planes and fly to disaster zones."

2020-02-03 14:25:18,"Before we're quick to criticize the chinese for not meeting strict engineering and hospital standards, we should remember that this is a crisis situation with 11,000 patients in hubei alone. How long does it take to build a hospital in the US or Canada? Months? Years? How well can our infrastructure handle existing medical care demands (answer: not well).

Patients need a place to go, and meeting every exactin standard would come at the cost of lives. Patients would be long dead before receiving treatment. Desperate times call for desperate measures."
2020-02-03 17:19:31,"At this critical time and facing a crisis that could potentially affect everyone of the world, as the most powerful and advanced country, what did the US government do to help to manage it? So far, absolutely nothing except for issuing warnings and border control. Even countries like Pakistan offer to donate protection masks, which is among the most needed."
2020-02-03 17:21:14,"It takes more than 10 days  - more like 28 - just for all the (wet) poured concrete to come to full strength and to relieve itself of most of the moisture. Depending on thickness of the concrete structural elements, it can take up to one year for all moisture to leech itself out. There is therefore a risk of mold forming in non-ventilated spaces. As this this is a hospital, not a playground, a rush-job should not compromise structural integrity nor pose a future risk to health."
2020-02-03 15:16:23,"At times such as this we can be impressed by the feats that a government-controlled economy can achieve in a short time. China's government is able to direct tremendous effort and resources into a single project. We can be proud of what humans are capable of when working together.

But at the same time, we can also be wary of a government that maintains this control by squashing dissent and individual liberties. And we can be wary of a government whose mismanagement and disinformation is partially responsible for this emerging epidemic in the first place.

The danger of strong central control is a mirror of its benefit: It can accomplish a great deal - for good or for ill - in a short period of time."

This is not a makeshift mobile hospital, it is a fully equipped respiratory infectious disease treatment center.

All air in and out of the hospital are filtered, and there are specialized UV decontamination units for sterilizing food/equipment in each room.

A 92% ethnic Han majority homogeneous society with a 2200 year history as a unified nation can get an awful lots of things done cheaply, efficiently and quickly.

Particularly in a one political party nation state that governed on a term limited collective leadership model that replaced a cult of personality and imperial style that still allowed for and encouraged independence and originality and creativity. That also rewarded merit."

2020-02-03 17:47:41,"For about a dozen years, I've gotten the feeling that China is an enormous house of cards.  They are capable of building ""a hospital"" in 10 days but their motivation is always either maintaining control, or proving they are bigger/advanced/better.  They drove people to the cities, installed population control, ignored the environment, make short-term decisions (even as they claim they think in long time periods) - when they are unable to pay all the out of work people in cities during the coming (already started) decline, as people in the countryside are struggling, what do you think is going to happen?!
The recession of Japan is an example of what can happen, but they had a much more developed infrastructure, a democratic government, and were well ingrained into the global financial system - and they only have 126 million people."
2020-02-03 17:53:38,"This is somewhat impressive but I will only be impressed with the Chinese Government if they end live animal food markets and related practices that make this sort of pandemic more likely to occur.

That would be real progress."
2020-02-03 17:53:46,"The more consolidated government control is, the faster it can implement it's agenda - for better or worse. The less consolidated it is - which is what the founding fathers, in their wisdom, truly intended - the more compromise is required.

The problem we face in this country is that the consolidation of power into the the hands the modern GOP - which by every metric represents a minority - isn't directed towards benefiting the public at large, rather, it's directed towards benefiting a few extremely rich individuals at the top.

And, if the GOP is going use our taxes on any construction projects, it's going to be for building walls (to keep out mostly harmless immigrants), and for building prisons (for mostly poor and middle class scofflaws, with the rare exception being a rich person who has made the grievous mistake of defrauding other rich people)

China has engaged in a lot of corruption and misuse of power over the years, but we have seen nothing in the last few decades to suggest that the the GOP would be any different if, and when, they could wield the same level of control.

In fact, I think it's safe to say that if the GOP had the same power as China's Central Committee, they would use it much more selfishly and irresponsibly.

After all, when China determines that corporate executives have egregiously betrayed the public trust, they don't give them multi-million dollar golden parachutes, they put them to death."
2020-02-03 18:00:11,"Given some of the problems encountered with construction in recent years (eg subpar concrete) I only hope this hospital will withstand normal wear and tear; experts in construction will know better than me, but it seems certain things take time to do well; concrete needs to settle, etc...

In the US, the bridge built in Florida using an ‘accelerated method’ failed 2 years ago."
2020-02-03 18:01:30,"Funny thing. 
15 years ago the escalator at the DC Woodley Park metro stop was out of order. Passengers were told that the 200  steps would have to be climbed the old fashion way. And, no elevator. And the repairs would take one year. Amazing. In the meantime, the hi way overpass that was damaged by fire last year in Atlanta was supposed to take 2 months to repair. Massive disruption. The repairs were done in one week. Also amazing."
2020-02-03 18:05:06,"What really stood out for me was that photo of men quarantined in Kansas in 1918. The place seemed so CLEAN. I have seen big hospitals in India and a sense of hygiene is clearly lacking. Yes, tremendous number of labor, very poor training. Even if the hospital appears clean, the outside is unbearably filthy. Hospital help live in places where clean water is scarce and the hospitals are not ensuring people bathe or wear clean clothes. In essence, it is pointless building hospitals quickly if you cannot factor hygiene into a populations DNA. So in reality all these pandemics are going to arise due to close proximity to decomposing filth. I don't know what it's like in China in terms of clean surroundings, but looking at the photos of the market, it seems to resemble India minus the exotic entrails. Here in the USA we need to take a closer look at the poverty stricken homeless population, the poorer states in the south, and how we farm animals and poultry. Just because we are a rich country does not mean we cannot be the source of future pandemics."

2020-02-03 18:25:03,It's only possible in China (both the pandemic and the hospital construction). They own the whole supply chain for the project and can divert the manufacturing capabilities to an emergency situation like this. We have outsourced raw materials and manufacturing. We have to find a Chinese company that will actually supply the components or we have to use Army Corp of Engineers to make the battlefield versions.
2020-02-03 18:25:13,"China did something similar before with SARS.  It is likely there are standard designs already drawn up with modules already pre-built.   

The US actually has hundreds of closed hospitals sitting empty.  I can think of 4 locally.   How hard would it be to reopen closed facilities?"
2020-02-03 18:26:04,"This seems like the type of thing FEMA should be able to do, have plans for and be able to roll out immediately if ever needed.  Maybe a type of Modular multi-use building, could be hospital, could be housing/school/etc etc.  However, given their response to Katrina, Puerto Rico, etc, I'm not too confident."
2020-02-03 18:31:05,"In a 10-day construction process, what kind of safety mechanisms exist to protect the welfare of construction workers and, later, hospital workers and patients? I for one would be wary of the structural integrity of that building."
2020-02-03 18:38:25,"Yes, it's a fact that a dictatorship can get things done faster than a democracy, but it remains a dictatorship. Just as it's a fact that it takes longer to get things done in a democracy than in a dictatorship, but it remains a democracy.

Faster doesn't mean better in all things, any more than slower means worse in all things.

The political system that is most likely to ensure the best of both worlds is one which enshrines ""compromise"". A word the founding fathers wisely understood.

It's also a word which has been outlawed within the modern GOP for some time now. Something the founding fathers never intended - because they knew it would inevitably lead to dictatorship. And you would be hard-pressed to find any evidence these days that a dictatorship isn't exactly what the modern GOP has in mind for this country."

Of course, I fully expect to hear in the coming weeks or months that, due to shoddy construction practices, this hospital will have suffered some kind of cataclysmic failure and that many lives have been lost as a result.   

Obviously, I do hope I am wrong in this prediction."

Far more are infected than the official number, that seems abundantly clear....Sadly, 2,500 new beds will not help enough (though, yes, better than nothing). China will try to use these buildings as proof they are on top of the health disaster, strong & capable & in control...but dealing with it at the beginning, not hiding and punishing those who spoke of a new virus, would have been far better than having new buildings and what will be many thousands dying. And the WHO seems to just play along with the Chinese government version of events, which is really awful, and sad. So much of this could have been averted with proper public health measures, which are always wiser than being able to build a quarantine building lickety-split. I would not ooh and ahh over the buildings too much, just what China wants, a Look over here! Not over there at the elderly dying in the streets...."

The writer is using the word “hospital” but this is not what WE think as a hospital.  The point of the article is completely something else.  The Government and the world can not afford to wait longer than 10 days to get help to people because people are dying by a minute at home and at the current medical center.  The Medical Centers are turning people away because they don’t have space.  Those people are going home and infecting others and/or dying.  Those that are sick have to walk for hours and then are turned away and have to walk back!  And I bet their family members don’t want to go with them either.  And those that have people that are dead at home are living with those bodies!  

This is to prevent more people from dying and to get them medicine they need.  

I think Wuhan needs at least 10 more of these and hundreds more Ambulances.  It’s a sad sad sad situation!  

It’s best to be empathetic and encouraging!  This is just a building to SAVE people’s lives!"

China also is a communist dictatorship; meaning that all means of production are owned and shared equally by the people; the government is designed to be ""the people."" China, however, is a dictatorship were President Xi makes all of the decisions. Projects like this are easily erected because the government does not have to ask anyone to complete these tasks, they just do it. 

Some of you are showing your ignorance by saying that the buildings do not meet US code, and etc. That is not 100% true, and you all have no proof of that. The government has over 7,000 construction workers building, in a ""dead city"" around the clock for several days.

But it is important to give a huge applause to these workers despite political views."

Avoid eating animal protein. Viruses are most prevalent in exotic species but US animal farms will kill you, too. Just takes longer. 

How about we get China to build us some fast cheap housing units for the homeless. Of course, some standards have to be relaxed. As much as I hate Trump I’m amazed how business people to a person are happy with his attempt to reduce regulation in the US.

2020-02-03 18:10:19,"How many problems can I spot just from reading this article and looking at the pictures?  One, the hospital appears to be built on low-lying swampland.  Two, doesn't appear enough time even for quick-set concrete to have set.  Three, bars on all the windows.  Is it a hospital or a quarantine facility?  Four, you can't get in unless diagnosed at another facility, and all of those are overwhelmed and out of test kits, turning patients away.  Five, Wuhan probably needs 10,000 additional beds, not 1000.  Building this hospital in 10 days was more a publicity stunt than anything else.  Arresting the 8 physicians who spoke out, early on about an outbreak, thus ensuring it turned into an epidemic, that was what the party needs to be remembered for."
2020-02-03 18:15:41,I think that the most important question for us to be asking right now is how can we help?
2020-02-03 18:03:48,"I see a lot of comments here saying this could never happen in the U.S. because of a) red tape (design, environmental compliance, bidding process, etc.) and/or b) lack of authoritarian regime. Do we really not have the capacity to quickly build makeshift facilities like this in times of emergency? Doesn't the army do this all the time? Isn't FEMA prepared to rapidly build infrastructure like this during emergencies? Maybe part of the story--as is happening now in SoCal--is that the U.S. has excess capacity to use if needed, such as old military facilities, sports stadiums, underused hospitals, etc. I don't think it's a matter of lack of authoritarian regime. For non-emergency projects in China, things happen a bit slower, and with sometimes decades of careful (or not so careful planning). The Three Gorges Dam wasn't built by some ""dictator"" snapping his fingers and making it happen."
2020-02-03 18:00:36,Does any entity in US have this rapid-construction capacity?
2020-02-03 19:17:01,"Well well well. The evil Chinese can build a massive hospital in under two weeks while here in Los Angeles it took 3 years to finally finish one housing unit for our homeless folks. 
And my point is? A once thoughtful ideology 'liberalism' is the root of most of our ills in large cities. 
Apparently LA - that has been run forever by Democrats  - has built an abusive set of regulations that make each unit in the low-cost housing projects cost over $500,000 per unit!!! 
I am a life long Democrat and am currently suffering from a diabolical form of nausea watching the party debate ridiculous policies when the apparatus that actually runs our government is sitting back sipping on mid-twentieh century Burgundies and drinking all the way to the bank.

Do you think the CCP bothered with things like buying the land from the previous owners or asking the workers if they wanted to move here to work?  You can do a lot when the people don't have rights and safety standards and markets don't have to be met.  Just look at all those ghost cities.  Build a cheap city that no one wants?  Why not?  They have really ""efficient"" re-education camps too."

When was the last time a hospital was build or completely refurbished in NYC? New York Presbyterian bought up a number of private hospitals and seems to have spend some money improving the structures of the hospital. The same cannot be said of the city operated hospitals.

I had the misfortune of having to visit the emergency room of 2 city hospital centers within the last 3 years and they were packed. 3 beds stuffed into space for 1 and more beds along the hallway. The drunk and mentally unstable that were brought in by cops argues with the medical staffs. There is at least one prisoner under guard handcuffed to the bed and I guess they forgot the key so were cutting the handcuff with a grinder.

I cannot imagine the city’s health care system is functioning well with so few hospital beds being added."
2020-02-03 19:47:00,US Army can build hospital may not 1000 bed close to war theatres with operating rooms and all other essential required equipments in short period of time. China has command economy and probably in the time of such crisis and large number of regulations and ignored or delayed.

Couldn't they build a large military-type temporary tent (s) instead?  I also wonder why China hasn't deployed mobile testing units to different neighborhoods so everyone isn't converging on the few brick-and-mortar hospitals and possibly spreading infection.  If there is no transportation, the medical units should go to where the people are."
2020-02-03 19:51:11,"We marvel at the Chinese high-speed rail system. Well, guess what? It was built under the same environmental standards (none), traffic studies (none), public hearings and objections (none), diversity quotas (none), and union contracts and work rules (none) as this hospital is being built.

So yes, we could have a high-speed rail system. Just have the government create the right-of-way no matter how much havoc it causes, pay workers minimum wage for 60-hour weeks, and import thousands of Chinese workers who have a ridiculous work ethic, even when paid low wages and given no protections."

No one has ever seen a response like this, it is completely unprecedented. Nothing like sticking it in the face of the West constantly second guessing and constantly slandering China and it's government.   The US cannot even begin to come close to respond effectively like China right now. You, know, I talk every day to all my friends in China including Wuhan. I can tell you people a all shouldering the burden for the fight. Staying home, organizing the duration. Being one.

Because, one day, hopefully not for the Wuhan virus, but for the Big One on its' way, we are going to need to do stuff like this. And right now, we don't really know how. People who are talking about repurposing stadiums and the like, obviously don't work in healthcare. People are going to need much more than simple shelter and even that is questionable (remember Katrina?). Ever been to an ER in NYC?

Contrast that with cultural expectations in the west that what is built, or most of it, should be built to last at least a half century or more.  Many of us have lived in, studied in, attended worship services in , buildings that were over a century old and are still standing, thanks to a basic structure that permits renovations.  That the Chinese can build a sprawling hospital in less than two weeks does not surprise me, but this one has not been built to last.  Since this is an emergency response structure (see Jon's comment, from which I copped this phrase) it's understandable.

Isolation and immediate help regarding the very first cases would have been a lot more impressing and, after all, spared us the crisis that has developped from these first cases. Do I remember wrongly? I get the impression that Africa handled Ebola a lot better without building idiotic hospitals. 

Putting the  7000 workers in safety uniforms in order to evacuate the patients to other hospitals in the country would have helped a lot more, especially regarding the circumstances infected people have found them in the last weeks, queuing at hospitals they have been walking to for hours. 

People are treated with utmost cynicism violating human rights. Well Wuhan only comprises 3 to 5% of the Chinese population and their safety, wellbeing and lives are willfully put in jeopardy as the China as a whole, in other words the remaining 1,35 billions or so, can obviously survive this catastrophe without the inhabitants of Wuhan.

All the trains are clean and new. There is no decaying subway infrastructure like New York.

Building something this fast guarantees only one thing: big problems.  We do it too.  A lot of our contemporary structures are terrible because they were made as fast as possible.

For example, just one, how long does it take for that concrete they're pouring to cure, if its going to hold up to use, that is? Best practice is 28 days, at least two weeks of not letting it dry out (yes, kept wet, under plastic or burlap) because concrete continues to harden long after it feels hard and needs water for that chemistry to function. Maybe they're using a special mix but it still won't be as good. Rushing that will result in floors that fail sooner than later.  And that's the foundation.

If its modular, as it looks like it is at least to an extent, they've still got to run/connect electrical, plumbing, and as we can see ventilation, and they need to take time to make sure everything is well fastened...and safely so.  Will there be no outlets, no sinks?  Maybe so.

Its not a brag-able accomplishment to build a huge structure in 10 days, rather its a sign of our priorities.  Look at structures that are ancient and still standing for evidence of the obvious. This building will be huge, ugly, dysfunctional, and a blight within 10 years (long after the builder has flown the coop).

Yes, of course it is a quarantine ward. Of course you would only want Corona patients there. How would you feel about 200 Corona patients getting admitted to your local pediatric hospital. But, the fact that one of its' primary functions is indeed containment does not preclude the possibility that it might also provide life saving care. With most viral infections, it is a waiting game. You try to stay alive while your immune system mobilizes against the invaders. Part of it is actually surviving your own immune response. Actual antiviral treatments are very limited at this time, so the role of hospital  care is really just to support you while your immune system wages its' scorched earth war against the virus in your body. Things like breathing assistance is hard to provide at home.

With respect to earthquakes, I don't think anyone is too worried about this place functioning 10years done the road. This is  temporary, and meant only to deal with the current crisis. And if an earthquake were to strike? Well, unfortunately lightning can strike twice or thrice....

The particular characteristics of this virus, still largely to be determined, have a lot to do with how this plays out. But this could jeopardize the Chinese economy for the long term. It could also jeopardize the future of the Communist Party if it is widely seen as bungling things."

Whatever you think of the Chinese form of government, making all of the pieces come together in 10 days is simply amazing.

Cries of dictatorship are nonsense. Under English, and American Common Law there is the concept of the police power.  Exercise of the police power allows an authorized government official to do ANYTHING that s/he reasonably believes is necessary to protect life and property.  Thus, a police officer can order you out of your house or take it over in an emergency.

The police power could be used to build a hospital, but I doubt that we could mobilize the resources in 10 days.  Give the Chinese credit for a remarkable accomplishment."
2020-02-04 04:04:47,"This 10-day hospital construction goes far beyond the ""limitations"" of the American (or Western) legal system, safety laws, zoning regulations, government oversight, etc. And it goes far beyond the fact that China is an authoritarian state. 

The Chinese people, today, embody a similar attitude to the early American pioneers who overcame hardship, adversity, and had nothing more that a fierce desire and need to succeed. The average Chinese person works for minimal pay with little recourse to safety standards or legal representation. What drives them arises out of decades, if not centuries, of grinding poverty. That's not something that can be imitated or artificially fabricated. It's a natural reaction to a great want arising out of historical impoverishment."

A truly functioning hospital is so much more than the structure it occupies.  if they could not staff, supply and equip the hospitals that they already have, why should we believe that these show places will be any different?  Remember China is the same country that arrested the scientist that reported the emergence of this new virus.  Action then might have averted the catastrophe now."

It is not surprising that China could pull together so quickly to build a hospital to house 1,000 patients.  China built the Great Wall so many hundreds of years ago with just manual labor so large that astrounauts could see it from space.  On the other hand, Chinese government's tendency for secrecy leads to repeated viral epidemics.  China has a lot to learn from this lesson.  First and foremost is improve the hygene in food handling, as well as ban wild animal slaughter for food consumption.  The accolades and admiration about the speed in building this hospital belong to the planners of the project and the workers."

For those in the US or other first world countries this may be a reasonable approach, keep good virus spread habits and if you get a bad case some hospital will provide the supportive care you need to survive. However, what is happening in Wuhan seems to be truly terrifying. People put into quarantine have no medical care, and if they need respiratory support they will die. The result is that many avoid quarantine, further spreading the disease. Is it possible to enlist the efforts of those quarantined, if provided with oxygen and masks and some basic instruction in how to keep the most sick alive? Dying unnecessarily of dyspnea is not a great prospect for reducing panic."

    The crackdown on the trade in wildlife should have been done long ago after the SARS epidemic, China has been responsible for at least three major epidemics of zoonotic origin the Swine Flu, SARS and now the new Coronavirus epidemic . 
   According to experts, the new coronavirus likely originated in bats. More than 75 percent of emerging diseases originate in animals, these are called zoonotic diseases meaning they can jump from animals to people.
    At least 10 outbreaks in the last century have spilled over to humans from animals such as bats, birds, and pigs.  Ebola jumped from fruit bats in west Africa 40 years ago and has killed more than 13,500 people in multiple outbreaks. The  SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome), and Nipah also originated in bats.
  The H7N9 and H5N9 bird flu, meanwhile, jumped from infected poultry to people in Chinese markets, together killing more than 1,000 people.
  The 2009-2010 swine flu pandemic (also known as H1N1) started, of course, in pigs. It killed nearly 300,000 people in a global pandemic and spread to 214 countries in less than a year.

2020-02-04 12:45:55,"I believe the best way to avoid this is to wash your hands often, avoid crowds and stay off of planes. This is playing out just like a ""B"" horror movie as one sick person fly's around the world while governments and officials make major mistakes. Its really all about money from a sick person deciding if they should lose a days pay and stay home to a government deciding how a response will effect its economy."
2020-02-04 13:27:09,"China manages its economy on the cheap for the benefit of the wealthy at the expense of its population.

On the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus, as will as the previous pandemics of SARS, etc., all of which originated in China, China’s unregulated livestock industry is a cesspool of dangerous viruses and bacteria. There are many reports of the outbreak of dangerous virus among animals, most recently pigs, in China which forces the culling of large herds of animals. This is why the West has a prohibition for the import of any animals, fowl, etc. from China. The science of the transfer of virus from animals to humans has been proved. There will be more pandemics originating from China as long as China’s livestock industry is unregulated."
2020-02-04 14:43:08,"The best way to avoid this chaos in the future is to make the ban on sales of exotic food (like cats, bats, snakes, etc) in China permanent. There is no shortage of ""normal"" food in China, and these antiquated practices should be strongly discouraged in the 21st century, as they are one of the main sources of new strains of viruses that ultimately can endanger the whole human race."
2020-02-04 15:31:12,"I have carefully read and reread all the mask articles. I still can't find a downside beyond creating a shortage where they might be more critical. I get the importance of protecting medical providers and that my risk mitigation by using one is quite minimal. However, if you have some available to use, what is wrong with decreasing risk but even a few percent?

Specifically this is how I think about it: Currently,the odds of having an infected person spew enough virus on you for infection while riding the 7 train is statistically quite low to begin with. So most of the time the mask is wholly useless. And if it does happen, the mask is far from 100% protective because you could get it in the eye, the mask may have slipped off your nose, etc. *But* it could still work and at some point, the odds could go up. Starting with masks when infection is already rampant may be too late. And,  if everyone masked up, including the virus shedders who are not feeling sick, how would that not decrease transmission? This of course assumes hand washing, etc."
2020-02-04 15:18:40,"I would like to know the percentage of people that not only die but get sick enough to require hospitalization.  I saw somewhere it was 25% of those affected. Let's say 10% are intubated (hooked up to a breathing machine).  Is it just me or does anyone think ""they didn't die but spent a week in ICU""   It is not being reported and that makes me wonder.."
2020-02-04 15:48:01,"The reality is extremely worse than what is reported.  On the NPR/BBC news show this morning, the reporter spoke over phone to a lady in Wuhan. The women in thirties lives with her parents, uncle, brother and son.  The uncle died of the virus at a quarantine facility, which she said were hotels with absolute no medical staff and very poor conditions. Her father at home with same symptoms, extremely high fever, coughing, having verydifficulty to breath and dying.  Her brother and Mom are now also showing the initial symptoms of fever and cough.   All their efforts to get medical help for his dying father has been futile as there are no hospital beds available.  None of them can even be tested.  So none of the 4 above, including his dead uncle and dying father, are among government statistics.  She said her family situation is repeated all over Wuhaan."
2020-02-04 14:53:51,"Although todays article is toned down, the headlines remain deceptive, even inaccurate. This is a novel virus, without ANY herd immunity or vaccine, perhaps as much as 30 times more deadly and 2-4 times more contagious than seasonal  flu. “reassuring headlines” comparing NCov favborably to seasonal flu can be dismissed by everyone. While we dont know the danger  at yet, there is certainly NO evidence yet this is “less a risk than the flu”=quite the contrary. A healthy adult, having expsoure to multiple flus and multiple  flu vaccines in the past decade is clearly at more risk from NCov.The only question is HOW much....we can dismiss the data coming out of chiuna at this point. On the one hand , this possibly overetimates the death rate as the number of cases are being under reported and unknown/untested.Xis concern  and response have been unprecedented; much of china is on a quasi martial law footing, millions of reservists and actiev duty  are to imposing  tarvel bans and quarrantines. Obviosuly he views this as an existential  threat to the party, so much so hes willing to suffer a signfiicant decline in GDP while he fights NCov.

2020-02-04 16:50:07,"We are going to need to work together as a community if 2019-nCov becomes a problem here. If a city determines people need to stay home, we’ll need to do that even if we feel fine. I see comments about staying home for a day and losing a day’s pay. With an incubation period of up to two weeks while being asymptomatic and contagious, it’s possible folks would be home for weeks as our cities and country tries to stop this coronavirus. That will be difficult. We’ll need to cheer each other on and work together. This might eventually mean not going to things like concerts, book readings, parties, etc. 

Hand washing is crucial. We’ll also have to accept that we might feel fine while being contagious with a virus that could kill someone else. I’m unsure why people flatly say that wearing a mask is useless. There are studies on mask effectiveness. Go search the NIH database, etc. With the freedom of the internet, fact check things for yourselves. 

IF 2019-nCov becomes a problem here, it’s going  to be hard. We’ll have to help each other and stay strong. We’ll have to make decisions based on what’s best for all of us rather than what we as individuals want. We’re going to need to treat and consider ALL AMERICANS with love and responsibility as we weather this storm."
2020-02-04 17:28:25,"At Harvard Business School I learned about assessing country risk which was critical in determining the net present value of investments.  Professor after professor also bemoaned the fact that few business actually do this risk assessment in real life.  Diversification was another big buzzword.

I don't believe American companies would have put all their eggs in the China basket had they factored in the real risk of doing business in China, a country whose government is wholly untrustworthy and vindictive with an abysmal track record for unleashing major diseases that disrupt global markets and, in this latest case, may very well cause a global depression!"
2020-02-04 17:36:56,"In China each infected person was transferring the virus to an average of 2-3 other people.  This was before much was done to stop infections and in a country where sanitation and health care systems are sub-standard.

In the US we have had 9 ""primary"" cases (people getting infected in China then brought themselves and the virus back to US). They have transferred the virus to 2 other people, both times a spouse living with them.  That is a transfer rate of 2/9 or 0.22 - you must have a rate of more than 1 to get beyond sporadic cases to an actual epidemic.  Yes these people may have spread the disease to others that have not yet been diagnosed - but at this time they have been under quarantine for so long that even the worst case scenario would not produce more than 1 or 2 ""yet to be discovered"" transfers.  Thant would mean a maximum transfer rate of 0.44 - still way below what could produce an epidemic.  If we keep doing what we had been doing this thing is over before it really begins."

2020-02-04 18:05:55,"Can we learn from this? Sars, Ebola, and this outbreak can teach us a great deal about systemic responses in crisis. One thing we've learned (that we already knew) is that the true rogue element is human fear. We have fire drills relentlessly at my school (more than a dozen a year) for a single contained, potential event. 

Nations need to start practicing for the coming crises that will range from climate change catastrophes, to food shortages, to  wars, to outbreaks of illness.* It's difficult to respond in the moment when panic has set in.

For years, I've been calling for an international committee that does nothing but plan for pandemics and global crises, and I  mean down to the last details, where known. Where, exactly, are we putting the millions who will (not might, will) be displaced by rising sea level? Exactly where. Who pays for it? How do we compensate those who may be asked to give land? How do we provide millions with food during a crisis like this? Where are the backup generators? How do we keep medicine cold? How do we quarantine large numbers of people and enforce it without violence?

We aren't, frankly, very good in the day to day management of things. In a crisis, the stakes are higher even as our resources are at a low ebb. Sure, there are myriad organizations all of which dabble in or even focus on different aspects, but we need a global plan. Now.

2020-02-04 18:21:13,"One important lesson here. To not consider China as the one main location as the world's production center. One can see what is happening to the supply chain. This has nothing to do with China. In the first place, why is it that all those corporations, large and small, take all their production plants to China? As much as China had to offer cheap land and labor, there are other locations as well with the same incentives. It is time, for those businesses who have gone into China, to start diversifying the location of their plants, and not concentrate in one place. The pros and cons of that exercise is now right in front of us to see."
2020-02-04 18:25:01,"We know that 500 people have recovered from this infection and there may be thousands more who have also recovered and are now immune. Can a person who now has antibodies be given interferon alpha and other immunotherapy drugs to increase white blood cells produce even more antibodies to fight the virus? 

If a person is immune and a compatible blood donor with someone who is infected then can they share blood an immune system that is resistant to the virus? An immune person with milder symptoms would probably make better donors and they would continue to produce new antibodies as long as blood is supplied with new viruses to destroy.

If this method works then are both individuals then immune to the virus and also able to perform additional transfusions?"
2020-02-04 18:32:40,"The shutdown of the Hyundai factory, is a reminder that there are costs associated with outsourcing products to low cost 3rd world countries.

2020-02-04 19:13:26,"The article about what you need to know about the virus is sketchy, assuming because a lot still remains unknown.  The big question is how is the virus spread, through touch or through the air--or both and to what degree.  Other questions:
1.  How long are virus particles viable once expelled from a carrier?
2.  Which mucous surfaces carry the virus; where does it replicate fastest in the human body?
3.  It's suggested old people are more susceptible because of lessened immune systems.  Is this solely related to disease or to aging in general.  If the latter, are there tests to correlate what type or amount of immunity is compromised in relation to susceptibility of infection--an epidemiological study?

One would imagine that airborne tests to determine infectiousness are dangerous to perform.  Are samples that the CDC works with live samples, and how are they kept viable, or is everything done on site with patients?

The article states that confirming tests of who is infected are done in a CDC lab.  Why is this not done in the field, and what field tests are available to determine the presence of any virus, i.e. what is available to doctors for routine testing; what viruses are detected, and how expensive is it?

One other note:  While we are awaiting a vote by Republicans to approve election criminality, they are also criminals on the infectious disease front, proposing cutting funding for pandemics and research, and opposed to insurance coverage of pre-existing conditions."

For example, in China over 23 million vehicles were sold in 2019 which is more than that of the US, Germany, France and the UK combined.

With that giant marketplace comes a massive supply chain which is a big reason the world buys Chinese components. The larger your manufacturing base the cheaper unit price can be."

But is has now reached the province of my grandparents residence. At secondary school, many people said I had the coronavirus. At first I thought they were joking around and waved it off. But now as it becomes a very serious thing, is started getting angry. I started to ignore them. Whenever I see an article about how people are being xenophobic towards Asians. I got mad. If anyone had done that in my country I would’ve reported them to the authorities. Now my true friends are serious(although we joke about other non-sensitive things) and don’t joke to me about the new 2019-nCov. They feel sorry for me and threatened anyone who was being racist to me. For instance this S1 came up to me in computing and had the nerve to say “Sup, Chinese man, stay away from me.” I told my friends and they were mad. They even threatened the little kid! I was happy and glad I had such friends. I hope the people that are racist could just stop doing these cruel things. Even in other countries there are many people who help in anyway they can. China has a problem in their hands. Hong Kong riots, 2019-nCov and a feeding issue. And that may not even be the start. This is getting serious. I hope people can stop the cruelty and start setting up a fight against the threat to us. I hope that this can end. Every little cruel thing. Please."

China should focus on a multi pronged strategic approach to respond to the crisis and outsmart the Wuhan Corona virus. Tough talk and panic will not enable the dragon to spit out the Corona virus. Right now China also needs to ensure that every Chinese person has access to a balanced diet. A malnourished person cannot mount a robust immune response to clear any virus from the respiratory tract or the body. There is a shortage of vegetables in Wuhan and other key food items that constitute a balanced diet.

To reign and rule until his natural death he can't blame anyone else for his leadership failures during this coronavirus crisis.

Punching down makes him look cowardly and weak. And by governing political definition he has no peers.

Sending his feckless Premier Li Kijianq to the frontlines was like Trump sending Vice President Mike Pence.

As the son of a Chinese Long March legend who rose and fell under Mao Zedong, before rising under Deng Xiaoping, Xi Jinping has something in common with Donald Trump.

As the Communist Party cements control, more officials worry about pleasing their bosses than taking care of the people.""

I'm in the middle of listening to ""A Very Stable Genius"" and I'd say that the above description fits the Trump administration and Senate Republicans PERFECTLY.

The difference between Xi and Trump is that one of them knows that China and India share a border, and I suspect that Xi also knows what happened at Pearl Harbor.

My hope for the people of Wuhan, and everywhere else, is that this outbreak will soon be contained and people can go on with their lives."

In the end, CDC was not totally wrong.
So what else is different? We have a free press. Yes some fake news can get out there but by and large we do very well and if you take this newspaper it has been responsible. 
Finally our healthcare system - we are overwhelmed with Flu activity currently and so a new outbreak will test our limits. 
Even before that, we need to fund CDC and other agencies substantial more. CDC just ran out of money managing the current outbreak with just 11 patients in the US. Congress should authorize funds to be transferred from the Pentagon to Public Health."

I bought vegetables tonight - red peppers, green beans, brocolli, etc. - it's still cheap. Under 20 yuan for a full bag, which is about 3 dollars. The vegetable store was full, even had boxes of strawberries. 

So our zombie apocalypse continues. The streets are mostly empty, in my huge apartment complex you have to pass a cop and get your temperature checked to get in. Checking google all the time, no one in my city has the virus yet. Life is strange and eerie here, but people aren't dying.

Maybe we will never know the true numbers. In China the hospitals are full, people are dying in their homes and the government is struggling to pick up the bodies, the morgues are overflowing.  China isn’t being “more aggressive” and shutting down a whole country for nothing.  It can’t just be a normal flu.  Sympathy for the Chinese people. Prayers that the public health measures in place elsewhere will stop the spread around the world.  The economic impacts simply show how much the world depends on China (and maybe outsourcing whole industries was a bad idea).  People are scared. I live in an area in Melbourne with a large Chinese population.  The shopping centres and restaurants are empty, you can’t buy hand sanitiser for love or money.  I’ve heard people are buying them all and sending them to China.  But, once this crisis is over the economy will quickly bounce back - focus instead on the people."

In comparison, WSJ mentioned today that  US had 10,000 flu-related deaths among all ages this season.  And we also had most unfortunately 68 pediatric flu-related deaths this season. Most important of all, we had 10M cases of flu overall this season.  Just keep calm.  We are fine."
2020-02-04 21:59:37,"What is the first thing that leaders of a pyramid style organization do when things start to go wrong because something new has happened? They assert control. They have no grasp of what is wrong nor what is needed to correct it, but they need to feel in control again. That is why Xi and his colleagues are what makes this virus from a public health problem into an international crisis. They could not grasp that the problem with viruses is that being the powerful head of a big government is irrelevant. What is needed is understanding and that requires open and free communications among all who can fix it an who are affected by it. But that is something which these kinds of leaders reject, collaboration and equal access and freedom of action and of communication which they do not impede by trying to control to serve their preferences."
2020-02-04 22:32:58,"As a point of info, WSJ has an article yesterday that notes that Chinese doctors have been using a combination of 2 antivirals commonly used in treating HIV  to treat patients.  The medication is very expensive in the US, but is widely available in Africa and other developing economies.  The treatment appears to be effective, and more people are recovering.  

If the virus does break out in the US where the medication is expensive, this will create a  whole different type of crisis."
2020-02-04 22:49:41,"The WHO Director General said the following:

In other words the reflective panic reaction is not the way to go."
2020-02-04 23:44:34,"What I can't uderstand is why people do compare it with the flu. The contagion rate seems to be a few times higher than that of the typical flu. The number of people infected is growing every day in both ways - in additions and cumulatively. The fatality rate seems to be significantly higher than that of pneumonia. Actually, it looks more like the severe pneumonia not the flu. Right now we have two deaths outside China, which give us a fatality rate of 50% in the Philippines and about 5% in Hong Kong."

The NYT is first and foremost a source news, not entertainment or even opinion. It’s well-known that music is an effective method of shaping human response to visual cues.  That’s why it’s used in movies to great effect.

But NYT journalism is and should not be merely a form of entertainment and, thus, should not have need to use the subterfuges of the entertainment or influence industries when reporting the news.

If you include any soundtrack at all, let it be the actual, factual sounds existent at the time and in the place where your photo/video journalists shot their images.  Period."

Yet I am seeing millions of people being quarantined world wide.  Which is it?  Why is there such a difference in responses?  Why do I feel like I am not being told the truth for the sake of economics?

2020-02-05 02:12:10,"The statistics given out are way off. There are probably 100,000 to 500,000 infected. China  is over populated, crowded and underserved. The Chinese government is trying hard to catch up to the virus. 
However under reporting infections is incomprehensible."
2020-02-05 01:18:42,This is what happens when you rely on supply chains in an autocratic communist nation. A nation that acts like it’s a first world country but in many ways is still a third world country. I have no sympathy for companies that chose to cut costs by setting up shop in China. It was always a political gamble at best and a deal with the devil at worst. Karma has a way of getting you in the end.
2020-02-05 01:54:33,"When I learned that the Wuhan coronavirus was still maintaining exponential growth trends with no sign of abatement, I became alarmed. But 3% fatality rate is still pretty good odds if pandemic blockbusters are to serve as a point of comparison. 

But what really scared me - and for this I am ashamed - was today's news that Hyundai has stopped production due to supply chain disruptions resulting from the Wuhan coronavirus. This is the first of many manufacturing difficulties that may kick the entire world into a forced economic slowdown as a result of China's growing health emergency.

Arguably, a recession is a more potent killer than a low-intensity pandemic. All-cause mortality rates for unemployed individuals have been reported to be 50% higher in comparison to employed individuals. For the US then, a 5% increase in the unemployment rate will lead to 240,000 recession-connected deaths per year. All this and the US population may not even suffer a single direct death from coronavirus. 

A pandemic that seals up China affects the economy in similar ways to the most extreme kind of trade war one can imagine. As such, strategies like rationing, price freezing and stockpiling are forward-thinking options that may reduce significant initial economic harm. The US needs to use this event as a case study for learning how to weather extreme supply-chain disruptions without inducing total economic shock on our system."
2020-02-05 00:58:28,"It is said that WHO was informed of this new virus either on 12/31/19 or 1/1/20. Why did it cooperate with the Chinese government to hide this viral outbreak from the Chinese people and the world until 1/20/20 when it was finally revealed?

WHO repeatedly praised the Chinese government for doing a fantastic job, part of which involved putting 60 million residents of Hubei in quarantine; yet it chastised other countries from wanting to isolate potentially contagious people from their uninfected citizens.

As it is said, the virus is the enemy, not the Chinese people. So the point is to ban entry for any people who are potential carriers of the virus, Chinese people perse is not the issue."
2020-02-05 01:24:24,"For all the talk about the Coronavirus, there were over 50,000 flu related deaths in the United States last year, with 15 million infected, and we are well on the way to that number this year, that with a flu vaccine. I have never understood why, in all this time we as a nation have done so little to shorten the odds on getting sick. We fight the same fight in the same way year after year, with very little information or a national plan of action.
Some ideas
Change the way sick days are tabulated for Flu and viruses, to make sure infectious people stay home, staying home while sick with flu or other infectious diseases means you stay home with pay, and it doesn’t count to your yearly sick days ,usually  a meager 5 or 10 days, and since flu season comes at the very beginning of the year people invariably come to work sick so as not to burn through every sick day.

Everything in our daily lives should be Hands free, from bathroom faucets, soap dispensers, paper towel dispensers. Doors in and out of every store should be automatic 

Anti- hoarding laws should be implemented to stop incidents just like we have seen with surgeon masks as recent as this week. People panic and hoard because they worry their neighbor will hoard so they act proactively 

All these and more are common sense ideas that will help lessen epidemics. It’s a lot better than what we do now- which is - every man for himself,"
2020-02-05 03:01:07,"Hopefully we as a people are becoming more aware that new and exotic microbes are emerging at a rapid rate.  The Wuham virus is just the most recent example.  However, we can not rest reassured that this will be the last one, nor do know when or where the virus will emerge.  We should always be aware and careful not to demonize.  For the problems faced by another today, will become a problem faced by us tomorrow."

2020-02-04 14:05:53,"It’s too bad that Xi’s government is only now realizing the threat this virus presents to CCP’s mandate to rule China —a lesson you’d thought the Communist Party of China learned during the year that SARS spread. However, recriminations aside, I do think the government of China is now doing all in its power to reverse the tide of this epidemic and cull it before it becomes a global pandemic. Xi’s Party depends on the success of the response, the Chinese people suffering are depending on a successful outcome, and the entire world is watching and preparing for a Chinese failure to contain this virus from spreading globally. Godspeed in their efforts, and hopefully when this recedes, lessons are heeded about the power of nature and man’s arrogant encroachment on domain we do not understand and exploit for our amusement, pleasure, or profit."
2020-02-04 16:48:07,"Looking at the detailed record of the first US case [NEJM, ""First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States""], we see that the patient  began to recover in less than two weeks, in indeed was released from hosptial jin a non-contagious state just two days ago after less than three weeks of being sick.

The flip side is that 6 days of IV drip, antibiotics, 3 days of supplemental oxygen, and an experimental anti-viral drug were given during the critical period and any or all of those may have been critical life saving treatments.

So it may be that difference between a typical flu fatality rate of 0.1% and a higher rate of  3% (0.1% - 3% being the estimated range offered in [NYT, ""How Bad Will the Coronavirus Outbreak Get? Here Are 6 Key Factors"" ], is going to depend mostly on the ability to deliver necessary treatment over the a critical week or so. 

As long as the number of cases are few, this will be possible in the US.  The only problem will be if patients outnumber the  available treatment spots, or if panic and fear causes many to go untreated (as appears to be happening in China).  

We should calculated available supplies and other resources, and  plan ahead to make sure that a increase 30 times the number of cases in a usual flu year can be successfully treated.  While that may seem an excessive margin, even a couple of weeks of being unable to treat all cases could result in extreme spreading, making that number a reality."
2020-02-05 03:22:21,"One thing that leaves me puzzled is why the quoted death rate from multiple sources seems to hover around 2%. If we conservatively estimate about a week between a positive PCR for coronavirus and the outcome of death, then we need to base the death rate on the number of people known to be infected one week prior. 

When dealing with a fast moving logarithmic progression, this makes a tremendous difference.

For example, the most recently quoted figure of 490 deaths should not be divided into the most current published figure of 24,552 confirmed cases (~2% death rate) but rather the number of confirmed cases say a week prior (7,816 on Jan 29th), or a 6.3% rate. 

This significantly shifts the calculus when considering the virulence of 2019-nCoV. Paired with published estimates of R(o) in the 3-4 range, we must assume that the potential for this pandemic is far more extreme than is generally advertised."

2020-02-05 06:07:43,"I live in Hong Kong.  Our borders with China, albeit not all, are still open, meaning people form China can still enter Hong Kong, and then have access to the rest of the world.

Most countries have banned flights out of China, but not Hong Kong.

No one wants to talk about the fact that you can still buy ivory or rhino tusks in Hong Kong.  No one discusses the fact that endangered species are regularly traded in Beijing markets.  A wander through a wet market in Shanghai, will make you cry.  Animals held in cramped cages, people with dirty fingernails dealing with meat, and the fact that many Chinese find it fine to defecate in the street. Why were these things not dealt with after SARS and MERS?  And further, go to any Chinatown outside of China and you see the same stuff, New York, Bangkok, Vancouver, San Francisco...why do they get a pass, when it is clear that these practices are spawning disease?  500 people dead...and yet no one wants to talk about the real infection."

I went out and reentered the hospital thru the foreigner side. No animals in the hallway (thank God for small favors). I went into a doctor’s office and first thing I noticed was no books or the smells of a doctor’s office(such as my dad’s). I told the doctor I had an ingrown toenail. He verbally danced about the subject of what needed to be done and he said he’d be cutting into my toe soon. No aesthetic was in sight. The dancing unnerved me. I then asked a question that infuriated him, “Have you ever done this before?”  He jumped out of his chair as if his rump was on fire, pacing the floor and muttering indignations at a ‘white savage’ (me) having the gall to question him. I didn’t need to know anything more and exited with my Chinese girlfriend. I put some iodine in the nail groove daily for 2 weeks and all was fine.

China is trying to talk down how much of a threat this virus is while acting like it is a HUGE threat.   The extreme response by the government exceeds any effort we've seen in previous outbreaks.

Reports in mainstream media seem focused more on reassuring the public than reporting the severity of things and investigating the all too real possibility that this is an escaped bioweapon under development.

This could have immense repercussions for the future of the Chinese State if the people find out this was an escaped bioweapon, that government failed to respond to initial warnings by doctors and then continued to lie about what was happening."

You get the sense of some fear as would be expected but mostly uncertainty as that is where things stand with this virus.  It will likely burn out without major worldwide infections and deaths ( like SARS, MERS, Ebola) but we cannot be certain of that.  Of course there is lack of clarity about what to do and how far to go to prevent its spread.  What I'm baffled by though is that so many readers' comments are all about bashing the Chinese government or bashing the NYTimes for supposedly basing the Chinese government.  I'd suggest reading the article again."

They may have a slow start, but all can witness the tremendous efforts put up by the Chinese government AND the Chinese society. You'd better hope they succeed in containing the disease; it's already a global crisis. 

p.s. the Chinese public will not reject their political system, as long as there's a perceived external threat. Just google America's military bases around the Pacific. Don't tell me they are there for North Korea."
2020-02-03 13:57:32,"I don't know about the morality of excluding people who need healthcare. I'll let those with a greater sense of how to properly deal with health emergencies answer that one. Maybe contingents of healthcare workers from Hong Kong (and other parts of the world including the US) should go to Wuhan to help contain the spread of the virus through treating people in the center of the outbreak. United we stand. Divided we both fail and fall.

But I noticed the pictures of the high speed railway station. Compare those facilities with the decrepit transportation system in the US. The US is obviously in comparative decline. We spend trillions on endless wars and comparatively nothing on preventing wars by raising living standards through intelligent investment in infrastructure and education worldwide. This country needs new leadership along the lines of Bernie Sanders. Trump and more of Trump has been and will be a catastrophic social disaster.

China helps Hong Kong over the years by providing water, electricity, food, and tourists sustaining the HK economy.

2020-02-03 19:52:08,"Great article with realistic details of Jaden's situation in China.  Why is the mother's age noted in the photograph with her son?  Why does the NYT put this information with her name?  I don't see how this is relevant to the article.  I notice this often in NYT articles.  Jaden's age is relevant, his mother's is not."
2020-02-03 18:46:00,"Wait - he flies into Los Angeles, the burrito capital of America - and eats at Chipotle?"
2020-02-03 20:44:29,"I sincerely hope he's virus-free, but he definitely should have been questioned on arrival and most likely quarantined until certain."
2020-02-03 19:00:04,What a great kid!
2020-02-03 20:46:30,The virus can take two weeks to show symptoms....
2020-02-03 19:56:11,"I would feel a lot better about this story if the man was going to go straight home and self-quarantine for 2 weeks, rather than going straight to a fast food restaurant.  Or at least ask him if he was going to report himself as someone who should be monitored.  From the CDC: “ Travelers who have been in China during the past 14 days, including US citizens or residents and others who are allowed to enter the US, will be required to enter the US through specific airports and participate in monitoring by health officials until 14 days after they left China.” 

“Will be required.”"
2020-02-03 20:54:21,I'm most impressed that he dug into two Chipotle burritos. Those things are huge!
2020-02-03 19:02:15,"Um, is it possible he is contagious even though he’s not showing symptoms? Also, kind of scary that U.S. customs didn’t ask any questions. Elephants in the room."
2020-02-03 19:11:21,"I can appreciate the challenges and the relief at the end for both mother and son. Glad it all worked out. But there were some aspects of this story that troubled me. 

1. This kid, while no doubt important to his mother, is just one of thousands of people stuck in this situation. He seems to not realize how fortunate he was and how much other people wish they were in his shoes (the wife of the person in the preceding story, who is now stuck indefinitely, for one). And he doesn’t seems as grateful to the people who helped him as I would have imagined. Also, where is the concern for his host family or for the driver who helped him?

2. The fact that he was able to skip any and all scrutiny by customs and immigration simply because he’s a white American is troubling. Asian and Chinese people are being detained, questions and subjected to health checks even if they were no where near the epicenter of this outbreak. Yet, here is a kid who knowingly snuck out of his host home to wander around a quarantined city, adjacent to the hot zone, and then traveled to the US where he got a pass because he took his mask off. Hmmm...

3. Here is the perfect illustration of what not to do and how quarantines break down. He broke quarantine while in China, potentially exposing himself to the virus; he was not checked upon his arrival; and then he immediately went to a very public, very crowded restaurant.  I hope for everyone’s sake he’s healthy."
2020-02-03 19:30:24,"I had a similar experience leaving Shanghai China on Saturday. In China they checked my temperature at the hotel and at the airport. Oddly, they didn't check passenger temperatures before boarding the plane. On the flight there was one passenger nearby who was audibly sick with horrible nasal drip. Upon entry to the United States, there was no temperature check, and there was zero health screening. Given that US airlines are canceling flights and immigration does no health screening, it shows how underprepared we are for this epidemic, and we have no capability for a nuanced response. The MO here is 'just panic and shut it all down.' I asked the CDC about having my kids return to school. They said if they have no symptoms they can carry on as usual. Obviously I'm not following that guidance and potentially putting others at risk. So we are self-quarantined for 14 days."
2020-02-03 20:03:08,"I am glad that he arrived home safe and sound. But from the public health perspective, he should be in quarantine. Inconsistent health directives may put others at risk."
2020-02-03 19:14:15,"More than 55 years ago I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in an African country. Even back then, long before cell phones and personal computers and the internet and texting and WhatsApp, there was a comprehensive plan for notifying, assembling and evacuating all the 1,000+ Americans in the country should the need arise.

I was therefore greatly surprised that today’s story seems to show American Field Service as a bit slow and disorganized in dealing with the problem of repatriating Jaden Taylor and possibly a few hundred other A.F.S. participants in China. 

A.F.S. and similar organizations have been around for decades, so I would have thought they would have comprehensive contingency plans and protocols for dealing with individual or group emergencies, at least piggy-backing on the plans that all US embassies have for assisting Americans in emergencies.

I also wonder why A.F.S. was not in constant touch with Jaden and others to offer reassurance, provide updated information and describe pending arrangements for evacuation. That his mother had to call A.F.S. headquarters and relay information and guidance to him via texts is shocking to me.

If A.F.S. does not have such emergency plans I hope it will soon initiate contact with some of the corporations and government agencies that have, and are certainly willing to share, their expertise in such matters.

I am happy that Jaden is back safe, though I don’t understand why he wasn’t quarantined for 2 weeks."
2020-02-03 22:11:44,"Could this young man's irresponsible behavior be any worse? He should self quarantine for 14 days to avoid starting a pandemic in Los Angeles. If his mother was so concerned as to get him out, she should be equally concerned about others her son might infect in case he has the virus. But they won't know that for 14 days. 
 1. He was living next to the epicenter of the outbreak. 2. He flew on China Eastern Airlines presumably with other people from the area. 3. Upon arrival at Los Angeles International Airport, he removes his mask at the passport control. 4. He immediately goes to Chipotle with his mother without a mask.
What if this man comes down with the virus tomorrow? He will have exposed people at the airport, at the restaurant, and wherever else he goes."
2020-02-03 22:54:22,"Thank goodness we are just letting everyone in without any strings attached. The idea that we might inconvenience wealthy international travelers, just for the sake of public health and 330,000,000 people, has kept me up all night."

2020-02-04 01:24:11,The greatest story of how NOT to behave! Why weren’t all passengers quarantined. Great idea to immediately go to a restaurant.
2020-02-04 02:04:59,"Jaden must be so happy to have lunch with his mother at the LA airport.  A touching but real interesting story. I was an exchange student from China more than 70 years ago after WWII  and I am still here.I worked for three jobs to support myself and I didn't accept any helps from the US government.  Because I feel America is the greatest country on earth. No need to look further. Great schools and helpful people. I wouldn't allow my granddaughter to study in China. I have nothing to against China. But I feel safe in America. I was in Wuhan for a short stay with my parent s in 1938 but we didn't like the dirty city so we moved to Hong Kong. Hong Kong was a great, a British colonial island. Now it is ruined by the demonstrators."
2020-02-04 04:38:03,"As an American living in China, this article irks me beyond measure. It's an ignorant editorial lacking factual information that only serves to worry the general American public. I understand fear is a powerful motivator but couple that with ignorance and you're left with fearmongering like this. 

Unlike Jaden, I stayed in China during this epidemic and put myself through self-quarantine at home. I'm still under self-quarantine and here's what I've learned over the past 2 weeks at home. 

Yes it feels apocalyptic when all masks are sold out and grocery stores are left barren. Yes it was impossible to find transportation in the early stages because everyone was worried about becoming infected. Is it so weird that a taxi driver refused to pick up a stranger in the middle of an epidemic? I don't think so. Is it bizarre to have people in hazmat suits check your temperature multiple times? No, not as bizarre as US customs letting Jaden back in without so much as a worry. 

The government, albeit Communist and different in nature from ours, is doing a decent job at maintaining peace and ensuring public safety. The entire country is cooperating in order to nip this in the bud and it's awe-inspiring to witness this first hand. 

I implore the writer to get a first-hand account from a ""grassroots"" level in China before publishing more content that further propagates fear and ignorance. I'm still in China and I'll continue to be here for a while. You're welcome to talk to me."

Yes he has left the epicenter, but did he not understand that he might be carrying the virus? So irresponsible."
2020-02-04 08:54:27,"I agree with others here that the man should have self-quarantined. I hate to think he possibly has been spreading the virus around the airport, Chipotle, and wherever else he is going this week. 

Also it is highly disturbing that he wasn’t checked for illness or advised to self-quarantine by airport personnel. At the very least, he should have gotten a piece of paper from the CDC with advice on how to protect others, including his own family. I’m sure going to Chipotle wouldn’t be on the list of recommendations. This lax response is all under Trump’s watch."

2020-02-04 09:54:25,"I am struck by how cavalier and almost congratulatory the tone of this article is:  this boy should have immediately self-quarantined himself.  Instead, he and his mother went to a Chipotle restaurant, seemingly days after he snuck out of his host’s apartment to say goodby to friends and the deserted streets of Wuhan?  He and his mother showed completely disregard others in their behavior."
2020-02-04 13:15:01,"It was hard not read this without thinking of the vast oeuvre of post apocalyptic novels where one person's ""safe exit"" or ""close call"" becomes the vector for the spread of a plague. 

I just reread ""The Stand"" this past fall (wrong year to reread it!) and was struck by how brilliantly King plays with our investment in the first family's attempts to flee, only to realize that their exit from the military compound where the flu has been weaponized is precisely what ends up dooming everyone else. 

I'm not remotely comparing this to anything apocalyptic. I was just struck at how canny writers in this genre are. They know that you cannot take the human out of the equation. What we're seeing in the mad scramble to leave a nation in crisis is precisely the vector that spreads first panic and then the disease. 

In all pandemics (and this still is not that) the only sure way to break the back of the virus/infection/disease is to quarantine."

This article is somewhat ridiculous. (Read - will not be posted.)"
2020-02-04 13:37:25,"Wow.  Customs didn't ask any questions?  Shocking!  And, he and his mother felt it was wise to not self-quarantine, instead choosing to eat at a very public fast food establishment?  That wouldn't have been my first choice.  I hope the actions of this young man and his mother do not result others falling ill.  I'm glad he is home safely, but this story shocked me (on many levels)."

Also, reading about some universities, it does not seem they are properly vetting where Chinese  students have traveled from over the holidays. Customs, schools, etc., need to step it up and take this seriously. While some people sound exceedingly responsible upon return,  there are others who seem ignorant to the risks they pose to others based on their travel history."
2020-02-03 10:28:55,"Depending on low wage, unfree labor for production just to break unions and increase profits and control over the workforce by big companies dismantled an entire industrial Civilization in the West,  worsening inequality, and made our economies dependent on what happened in a dictatorship that sells its workers to global companies to be exploited.  

The anti-globalization movement in the late 90s pointed all this out but we were demonized by the same press that today demonizes Senator Sanders.  Including by this newspaper and its writer Thomas Friedman,  prophet of a flat world and the Ear in Iraq.

2020-02-03 11:23:20,"A corrupt “semi imperial” (as a Times opinion article labeled it) government in China initially prevented dissemination of information about the coronavirus; this, and the lack of free press, may have accelerated the virus’ spread.
Our government can now be described similarly, with economic, health, and security threats, as well. The now accepted dictator president has already publicly downplayed the coronavirus, war injuries, effects of tax cuts and tariffs, to name a few of his empirical pronouncements. His obedient senate, state officials, and local cult members are fearful of opposing him. With the help of Fox News, they may follow suit, in these and other areas, potentially with disastrous results."

2020-02-03 11:59:59,"We need to put articles like this into perspective.  The article underlines a very serious problem in the critical components area.  Business leaders world wide need to assess the risks of concentrating too much of their needs in a single source or single area.  In other words, every critical component needs to be multi-sourced from independent sources so that there are alternatives should there be any interruption regardless of cause, which might also be a natural disaster, a strike, civil unrest, a disease, etc.  

Also, we need to put the Wuhan virus into perspective.  Not too long ago the US CDC estimated that there were 8200 deaths so far this year in the US from ordinary flu, and that number was expected to grow and is probably bigger now.  SARS resulted, according to the article, in only 800 deaths world-wide.  Of course, there is no way of knowing how many deaths Wuhan will ultimately cause, but we are likely to face a much larger problem with ordinary flu, which occurs every year, than we will with Wuhan."

2020-02-03 12:30:37,"One must credit the Chinese society/government for some achievements vis a vis this type of epidemic, skilled medical and research personnel who can diagnose the problem and work with comparable teams around the world for a solution.  Photographs document a sophisticated medical response for the most seriously ill patients, and that was not present twenty years ago.  A remarkable physician in Wuhan recognized the issue and was able to communicate on social media about it, although he was then hassled by police.  

However, in the last twenty years, they have not done enough to prevent virus spread to humans, nor have they done enough to address virus spread across vulnerable animal populations.  Better standards for animal husbandry are necessary.  I am not certain that one needs to go to the extreme of western standards, where meat is prepackaged in cellophane and styrofoam, because we still have our issues with Salmonella and toxigenic E coli.  It is clearly time for China to rethink the structure of its live animal markets, because the current system all too easily allows for aerosolized animal waste and byproducts to affect humans.  

Regarding the issue of governmental downplaying of these epidemics, it pays to remind all that the US government similarly downplayed the scope of HIV infection in 1982.  I can never forgive Margaret Heckler, Sec'ty HHS and Ronald Reagan for their delay in response to HIV."

I am an optimist and I am prepared as best as I can but that is not the reason for my optimism. The reasons are following.

1) It seems so far only around 2% mortality rate even though there is a high morbidity rate.

2) The public health world is awake and the blunders of politicians are behind us. China is in high gear and building hospitals and infrastructure at lightening speed.

3) Gloves and proper mask production and supply chain is protected.

4) There are treatments in the pipeline that are being tested.

5)The US has formed a task force headed by the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services in the president's cabinet as the head.

6) The temporary restriction on mixing of the people from PRC with people outside.

7) People will keep safe distance from other people to prevent the spread of the virus by avoiding French kisses or close affectionate expression.

8) Proper gloves and masks religiously worn along with thorough hand washing with a detergent containing soap will contain the virus.

However, it will be controlled....just like SARS

What won’t change is the number of people dying worldwide from preventable diseases.

I don’t want to minimize the several hundred people who have died since the outbreak occurred, but globally, approximately 25,000 children die everyday from preventable diseases. Every day. 

When the coronavirus has been reduced to a few daily deaths, the other common cold and viruses will continue plaguing the poorest countries around the world.

I’m not sure why we don’t see more of what’s actually happening to the poor.

When I told her that Chinese businesses in New York were suffering needlessly in my view, she said “stay away for now”.

For instance it is being reported overseas that most people who have contracted the coronavirus recover with systems like severe cold.

It may well have a mortality rate similar to the flu. But as of now, we simply don't know.

2020-02-03 13:28:29,"This might be the black swan event that finally hits China in an situation where trust in the China system has been wavering:

- Originally, countries and companies bent over backwards to do business in China, in recent times, protectionism by the Xi government and protests in Hong Kong have made companies rethink their strategies and establish ""contingency"" plans to wean themselves off the China dependancy
- Censorship continues to be a problem, and it seems that Xi is still more concerned about his image than actually save China's citizens. It demonstrates that he will readily throw anyone under the bus if said person no longer suits his agenda. Eventually domestic sentiments will turn.
- Domestic and international demand from Chinese consumers will take a massive hit given the timing with Chinese New Year, this will make the global community to reconsider dependency on Chinese demand.
- Let's face it, whilst businesses have taken on China consumption, it's never been ""nice"" to deal with China. Xi hasn't made himself any friends in the process and it's likely that Global economies see this as an opportunity to ""reset"" the status quo to something a bit more easy to stomach.

Whilst the occurrence of the virus is not the fruits of China's own doing (like black swan events, these things are random) - negative attitude that China will face as a result of this is something  Xi has created himself given that his strategy depends on continued dominance of Chinese consumption."
2020-02-03 13:30:43,"China is THE world's supplier of electronic parts.  All the pieces that go into just about anything electronic come from China.  This are crucial industries that fuel the word's economies. 

Economists tend to look at macro numbers but those hide the true story of criticality.  For example, let's say a product sells for $300.  The parts in it from China cost $10.  An economist would look at that percentage and calculate that the loss of that $10 is an insignificant percentage of output.  But the $300 product will not function without those $10 in parts.  So the products cannot be made and sold.  This results in huge losses elsewhere as they ripple through the global economy.

We stopped making those parts here 40 years ago.  First they went to Japan and then Taiwan.  Then it all went to China.  Chinese electronic parts drive the world.

If those plants shut down, that's bgd trouble for the global economy.

As Krugman often states.  Your spending is my income and my spending is yours.  As the Chinese economy contracts, it drags the rest of the word down with it.  This is one reason why steel prices have plummeted.

The Trump tariffs are a huge drag on domestic electronics manufacturing.  That's where I make my money.  As inventories have been depleted, the replacement parts are coming in at 30% higher.  This is devastating to profits and viability for us.  Trump is ruining our industry.  Now this virus could be another blow if the parts plants shut down."

Building hospitals/triage centers/isolations wards in a week or so are just achievements that would be unimaginable in the West.

With so much advanced warning, politicians do nothing substantive to reverse climate change and the dire effects we all know about and can see coming.

In the USA that is supposed to be a global leader, Trump and big corporations reverse course on climate change initiatives by working to allow raw sewage to be dumped, again, in rivers and streams....utter stupidy, incompetence and extremely dangerous to our health and the stability we need to plan for a better future."

In comparison, the people cured leaving the hospitals so far out numbered the patient died dur to the disease.  

In comparison, SARS occurred in Beijing and Quanzhou, two largest and vibrant cities in China in 2003.  Quarterly GDP decreased 2% immediately, but recovered back to 11% after one year.  Today, the Coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, a secondary or tertiary city in the middle of China.  Although it has vital industries there, but overall to Chinese economy should be limited.  Mainly the small retail, service, and hospitality sectors will be severely affected. Government loans should help those middle and small companies without saying.

In comparison, China is a much more regulated and advanced economy than that in 2003.  Her ability to handle emergency is much better and more sophisticated.  Otherwise, shut down of several big cities is not that easily accomplished without adequate ability to sustain the people's life there.

We should not limit our mind to doomsday scenario.  In comparison, if we can handle emergency adequately, China should be able to do the same more or less. In comparison, Chinese economy is about 65% in size to our economy."

The expertise gained by doctors in China from the SARS epidemic is making recovery for hospitalized patients possible, an expertise not found in some countries facing newly infected corona virus patients.

Trump’s paranoia about having such government veterans in the White House would likely mean greater personal involvement.

We live with common flue which kills far more than these exotic viruses. So why do we panic? It follows that we humans, due to 'normalcy bias' don't respond to impeding threats such as the Climate Crisis but over-react to fear-mongering which is the product of media gone berserk.

If the coronavirus causes an economic downturn that would be a good thing since unfettered capitalism is destroying democracies and the planet we live on. 

As a member of the unrepresented underclass I have no worries about either the deaths or the economic damage since I will likely survive a case of the coronavirus (being generally healthy) and I am not benefiting from the economy which is geared toward taking from me rather than allowing me to be successful financially.

I can think of only two explanations.  One is that the world economy is so fragile and investors have so little confidence in the future that almost anything will tend to create a financial crisis.  The other is that the mass media likes nothing more than to create anxiety and panic to build its audience.  Actually, I think it's both.

Listening to a Johns Hopkins professor of infectious disease and public health on NPR this morning my take away is that this is a respiratory virus with a very low mortality rate, which has been incubating and present since last November, which most people experience as a mild cold, and which is far less likely to kill you than influenza.
He answered the questions about China's response to isolate the entire province and America's to cancel all flights from China as an hysterical over reaction, predictably in-efficacious, 
So what we have is inadequate information, unreasonable panic and an ill informed public led by ignorant politicians intending to score political points--even Senator Ed Markey is excoriating Trump for failing to appoint a ""coronavirus czar,"" as if that would help.

I would venture a guess that Trump has had no such briefing..no instead he is doing Super Bowl interviews with Hannity--where he discusses the height of opposing candidate instead of a coming pandemic- and hosting an extravagant Super Bowl party--when  he should be overseeing a plan of action when this virus hits our shores.

Even with a vaccine for influenza, ""The CDC estimates that up to 42.9 million people got sick during the 2018-2019 flu season, 647,000 people were hospitalized and 61,200 died. That’s fairly on par with a typical season, and well below the CDC’s 2017-2018 estimates of 48.8 million illnesses, 959,000 hospitalizations and 79,400 deaths."""
2020-02-03 15:32:21,"I was in Hong Kong and mainland China for both SARS and avian flu.  Coronavirus seemed much worse from early on due to the level of contagious spread. I was at an HHS meeting in DC last week when early in the week the public was still nonchalant about it. The CDC folks were clearly scared; not for the Chinese, for themselves. It was obvious this was thought to be the big one, or at least one of the big ones we have been worrying about for decades. That was at least my read on them."
2020-02-03 15:35:21,"Experts seem to agree that the number of carriers is vastly understated and that we are facing a pandemic, but little is known about the characteristics of the virus -  like how it actually spreads or will it die off in milder weather. One thing for sure, it’s moving around fast and will be hard to contain."
2020-02-03 15:35:42,"The best news about the coronavirus pandemic is that it shows how a private, for profit health care system doesn't work. How can a company that needs to see quarterly earnings invest billions in preparing for a pandemic that might not show up for 20 years. Instead of spending millions advertising obscure cancer treatments, the pharmaceutical industry needs to invest in more widespread but less profitable illnesses. This can only be accomplished with government regulations, financing and price controls."
2020-02-03 15:36:34,"With a strange coincidence when China joined the WTO and registered its presence on the global stage it also terrorised the world with the SARS menace. Since then China has rightly or wrongly acquired the capacity to impact the global society, economy, and the politics,more so due to an enigma associated with its intentions and actions shrouded in mystery. So, whetether it is China's contribution to world economy and the scare through pandemics like SARS and the Coronavirus the world has to learn to live with China's mixed baggage of benign and not so benign influence with due preparedness and cooperation."
2020-02-03 15:36:56,"Assessing the risks of nCoV will require data and time. Among the most crucial indicators in any epidemic is the fatality rate: the share of the infected who die from the disease. The statistics on diagnosed nCoV cases available as of today would suggest a fatality rate of around two percent. (For comparison, SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, had a fatality rate of ten percent when it broke out in 2002 and 2003, while seasonal flu has a fatality rate of about 0.01 percent.) But that fatality rate will change. At the start of a new outbreak, the most serious cases of illness and death are the easiest to spot and are thus recorded first. As more cases come to light, including many milder ones, the fatality rate is likely to go down, perhaps substantially. In an optimistic scenario, nCoV will have a lethality closer to seasonal flu than to SARS—but it is too early to know. As of now, older adults appear to be most at risk, with very few recognized cases in children."
2020-02-03 15:50:57,"It's far to early to go into panic mode over any of this, because much depends on morbidity rates, mortality rates, the timing of the effectiveness of control measures and simply the time it will take for this virus to burn itself out before we fully understand the extent of personal risk, and from that the economic risks associated with the control measures. So let's all take a deep breath, wash our hands, keep our hands away from our faces and keep a safe distance from people who may have been exposed. This article speaks of disruption - for sure, but how much and for how long remains to be reliably assessed. Meanwhile, a great many more will die of the flu."

Oh yeah, that costs money, and we need that money for weapons that are never used. Think only China is this way? Even this article takes the point of view of the effect on the economy.  Oh how unfortunate.  We better not plan for the next outbreak huh?  That would cost more money.  And while we're at it, let's not plan for or take preventative measures for climate, renewable energy, education, health care, and all other predictable (through science) needs.  This is an essentially right-wing, money grubbing attitude for everything, and even the left-leaning press has bought into it.  Listen to NPR, for example, and how often they repeat the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq?  Probably three or four times an hour.  What is the message being sent?  Money matters the most. Science doesn't matter unless it's convenient, or when we are staring death in the face.  Most people don't know this, but scientists working in academia struggle for every research dollar.

2020-02-03 11:31:45,"China is so integral to the global economiy that any halt in its production quotas for supply chain parts, or assembly,  is bound to have a major impact.

Last week a Paul Krugman opinion piece explained China's role, in response to a rather flip remark from Wilbur Ross who reasoned that manufacturing would return to the US, in effect seeing a silver lining to a world health crisis.

The Ross statement made about as much sense as the moon is made of green cheese.  While some companies can quickly transfer their purchases of parts, and other supply chain resources to other Asian countries (labor has to be cheap!), it's not so simple to rearrange your business production sources on a dime.

And if what you purchase from China is assembly of your smart phones, that will do great damage to your company.

An potentially volatile economic year just got more so. To follow this crisis, check a variety of sources and discount what you hear from Wilbur Ross."
2020-02-03 11:57:43,"If the Coronavirus outbreak happens in a small and less developed country, this virus will be stopped easily before it spreads to other countries. On the other hand, China is a big country and people travel during the Lunar New Year.    And increasingly Chinese middle class travels beyond their borders to foreign countries during the long holidays. Thus, it is hard to stop unless drastic measures such as closing down cities with iron fists.

Global economy will be affected by this temporary Chinese slow down.  But it will also rebound fast due to the recovery process led by the dynamic Chinese work force and centralized government actions.  In some ways, Chinese economy policy is more capitalistic than US.  Thus, it will push their productivity and innovation to recover better than before."

2020-02-03 16:50:16,"Blaming China for the virus out break is very unfair, however, their first reaction to the problem amplified that disaster.  The simple reason of it was their totalitarian governmental system characterized among others by the lack of free speech.  China’s government controls everything and in spite of improved standard of living the Chinese citizens are scared of voicing their opinions.  During the last decades all world efforts to make China democratic failed. Not long time ago President Xi announced himself a leader for life, which had surprisingly weak response in the democratic world.  In spite of wishful thinking of many and the famous phrase that I have heard from friends “we need to work together” the threat of huge (1.3 trillion) totalitarian regime is real.  China slowly craws into many European countries for example by buying into sixty biggest high-tech companies in Sweden or owning strategically important sea port in Greece,etc.  The human right abuses have been ignored by many west European countries, which are short of cash exhausted by the blown out social system or subsidizing their clean energy.  Being careful not to antagonize the benefactor they choose to be oblivions to the threat that the totalitarian China poses to the world.  I wish that all the civilized world would become more aware and exert pressure to help the world as well as Chinese people."

The parallel to the AIDS epidemic is apt.  The quick consumption of infected fresh monkey meat and the transport of  surpluses to cities by way of paved highways  made  a world wide epidemic possible.
Age old cultures resist change and protect their traditions. Until China modernizes its food production, processing, and transport, this epidemic will not be the last. Recall that it all began with Hong Kong flu , asian Flu, swine flu and avian flu in the mid twentieth century.

In my lifetime, I have never seen a government do what China is doing right now. A self-interested selfish regime has willingly shut its own borders to keep its citizens inside. They are doing this despite catastrophic economic consequences, why exactly? Because they are so concerned about other people? Since when?

China has quietly and passively allowed airlines to suspect flights UNTIL APRIL, borders to close, cruise ships to cancel. To me, I think this signal that they know ""this is no flu"". So for anyone still saying ""but the flu blah blah blah"" stop. No country behaves this way because of the flu.

I would instead point it to the incredible coincidence of the work at the Wuhan Institute of Virology which 1) was cited with safety concerns in 2017 and 2) was reportedly studying the novel bat coronoavirus last year.

If the U.S. ends up in China's position, it won't be able to build hospitals in ten days, as China did. We can't even manage to fill potholes. Here in the U.S., (poorer) people who may be exposed won't be able to stay home, because we lack the social safety to support them. Thus, the virus will spread.

According to that article, nCov 2019 is at least as infectious as the flu or a common cold, i.e., worldwide infection is inevitable. On the other hand, the lowest fatality rate estimate is 0.1%, which the only same as seasonal flu.  The top fatality rate estimate is 30 times that, or 3%.  That percentage is not written in stone, it depends on a rational non-panicked  response, and such details as a supply of anti-viral medication.

Most of the economic effect in China so far has been a result of the quarantine efforts, which appear to have miserably, and have possibly caused more harm then good through lack of basic services and healthy food, as well as hoarding of food and medical supplies.  

I expect China will realize their mistakes, at the same time as the number of immune young people who have passed through the disease safely enable a more rational approach, not so different from that of a bad flu year.

So articles saying that there's ""still"" little room for panic seem ignorant of how things work.

We need schools that teach excellent math and science.  There is no substitute for this   in todays world, if we are talking about exponential growth in the global economy, or in a virus.  What does this mean, what are the implications?

In an accompanying front page story, there's a photo of a Chinese hospital being built in 10 days.  1000 beds.  Image the scope of an economy that can do that after so short a time from being destitute.  That has something to do with this exponential economic growth.

2020-02-03 19:51:44,"If each person infects 2.6 people then how many people need to wear masks in order to stop the outbreak?

If R_0 < 1 then the epidemic burns itself out. I am sure there is a better probability distribution that accounts for super-spreaders or where to ideally distribute masks. But I think a naive analysis also shows a better way to contain it. 

For R_o = 0.999 then 0.999/2.6 = 0.384 = 38.4% can be left susceptible to the virus. That means if 61% of people who are not infected wear masks then that is enough to break this epidemic.

If only the people infected are wearing masks to prevent the spread of disease then to get R_o = 0.999, 61% of the infected group (which is much smaller) should wear masks. To stop asymptomatic spread that would include 61% of the group with a degree of separation from a known carrier. Unless the spread is much more infectious due to asymptomatic carriers. 

A double layer of bandannas that individually captures 85% of particles would be the equivalent of an N95 mask, assuming it also tied snuggly enough to create a seal against the face. 

My point is a full quarantine is unnecessary. If about half the population is under quarantine and the other half is wearing masks is likely more than enough to stop this epidemic. I think China should start relaxing their quarantine. Start small, but still ask those sick or caring for the sick to self-quarantine and let those who are healthy support the supply chains and infrastructure."
